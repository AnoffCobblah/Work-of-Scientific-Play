# Work-of-Scientific-Play

These documents outline the tools and methodologies that have emerged from my current dissertation project, The Work of Scientific Play in Nineteenth-Century Britain: methodologies which I call 'Recreational Reckoning.'

For those who are inclined to use this script as a tool for textual analysis, but who are otherwise uninterested in the methodologies employed or the applications to which it has been put, the R Markdown File (.Rmd) named "0-RR-Preparation" is the only section of this script which ABSOLUTELY must be read, as this is the stage which outlines the general tools utilized. After following the instructions in that part of the script, a reader could theoretically simply "Run" only the relevant chunks of the code (using the Run commands on the top right of the R Studio console), and the script will output the analysis they desire. Treating this script as a black box for transforming texts into certain types of data visualizations is, as I will argue below, quite contrary to the rules of Recreational Reckoning. However, breaking rules is very much within the spirit of Recreational Reckoning. So the reader is free to utilize this script in whatever way they find most helpful for their own work/play.
