                             PREFACE.
    IT   has been observed by            cynical instructors of youth, that
the poet Thomson could   not have been a schoolmaster, or he
would never have described " teaching the young idea how to
     "
shoot as a " delightful task."   But, from the experience of
many years,      I       am disposed to     think that Thomson was not
very far wrong, for           I   have found the task of directing          the
young      mind a most pleasant one.               There have necessarily
been     a few exceptions and some disappointments, but not
more than are met with in any other walk of life, while the
pleasures of success are greater than can be hoped for in other
professions.         I   have always been fond of boys, and therefore
have     not confined my work merely to their school-hours, but
have     always partaken of the sports of my boys, and in many
cases  invented new games for them, endeavouring, as far as pos
sible, to throw off the burden of years and to be a boy again.
    There is as much instruction in the playground as in the
schoolroom;      and therefore the following pages are destined
quite as much for the benefit of the teacher as of the taught.
The book       is,   as far as possible, an epitome        of   a   boy's play-
hours,    giving him instruction in graver as well as in lighter
amusements.          With this view,      I   have included many pursuits
which are rather above than below the general routine of
play-books, but which              are    completely within the grasp of
a   boy's ordinary intellect, and cau be           heartily appreciated.

 iv                             PREFACE.
    A work    which comprises so many different subjects could
not be written by one person, unless a large portion of it
 were   compiled    from   other   books.    Such a compilation      is
always     evident, for it wants     the freshness     and vigour of
 original writing,     and   invariably fails to inspire interest.
 For this   reason  I have enlisted practical men in the service,
and have been fortunate         enough to secure the assistance      of
several gentlemen who are to my own knowledge practically
acquainted with their subjects.        The article on Yachting was
furnished     by C. Baker, Esq., late of the Royal Navy.         R. B.
Wormald, Esq., of the Hermes Chess Club, has written the
account of Chess.       J. F.  Wood, Esq., late Chemical Lecturer
 at the Windmill Theatre,         has contributed      the article on
 Chemistry    ;  and A. McLaren,      Esq.,   Professor   of Fencing,
 has given me the paper on      that art.   Other parts of the work,
such as the Geometry, Arithmetic, Horsemanship, Angling,
<fcc., have been revised by gentlemen thoroughly acquainted
 with these pursuits ; while the department of Natural History
 has been revised and enlarged      by the Rev.   J. G. Wood,  author
of several works on Natural History.          To all these gentlemen
 my best thanks are due.          For the Sports, Gymnastics, Con
juring, and Broadsword exercise I am personally responsible,
as also for portions of several other departments.            The en
graver's illustrations of these four amusements were executed
 from my own designs.         For the  excellence  of their execution,
 the conjoint names of William Harvey and Harrison Weir, as
artists, and G. & E. Dalziel, as engravers, are sufficient proof.

   MAKE a mark on the ground at a place called the "starting point."
At  ten yards' distance from this make another, called the
                                                                 "

Then let the players arrange themselves at the starting point, and in
succession run to the second mark called the spring.             From the
spring  make   first  a hop  on one leg, from this make   a  long ttep, and
from  the step   a  long jump.   Those   who go  over the   greatest space
of ground are of course the victors.

                      HOPPING    ON   THE BOTTLE.
   Various games are in vogue among boys, in which hopping on one
foot is the principal object. Among these is one which not only
assists in strengthening the limbs, but also teaches the performers
the useful art of balancing themselves upon a movable substance.
A wooden bottle, a round wooden log, or something of that descrip
tion, is laid upon the ground, a mark is made at a certain distance,
and the players have to hop from the mark upon the bottle, and
retain their possession while they count a number agreed upon.        In
the olden times of Greece, this was considered an exercise of sufficient
importance to give it a place at the public games. The performers
in this ease had to hop upon inflated leather bags, carefully greased,
and of course, by their inevitable upsettings and floundering, caused
great amusement to the spectators.       The sports took place on the
Dionysia, or festivals of Bacchus, when the vmtage was gathered in,
and the victor was appropriately rewarded with a cask of wine. The
rustics in many parts pi England introduce a modification of this
game in their rural festivals.  Two men place themselves opposite to
each other, the right knee of each bemg supported on a wooden
cylinder, while the remaining foot is totally unsupported. When
they are fairly balanced, they grasp each other by the shoulders, and
endeavour to cast their opponent to the ground, while themselves
retain their position upon their fickle support.
                             HOP-SCOTCH.
   This is a game played by hopping on one foot and kicking an
oyster-shell or piece of tile from one compartment         to the other,
                   without halting the lifted toot, except in one case,
                   to the ground, and without suffering the shell or
                   tile to rest on any of the lines.      A diagram is
                   first drawn similar to the subjoined.     It consists
                   of twelve compartments,      each being numbered,
                   and at its further end the pleasant and inviting
                   picture of a plum pudding with knife and fork
                   therein stuck.      In commencing the game, the
                   players take their stand at the place marked by
                   a star, and "quoit" for innings.       The object      is,
                   that of doing what every boy is supposed to like
                   above all thmgs to do, i.e. ''pitch mto the pud
                   ding," and he who can do this, and go nearest to
                   the plum in the centre, plays first.
                       Method of Playing. — The winner begins   by throw
                   ing -his shell into No.  1;  he then Hops mto the
                   space, and kicks the tile out to the star         *;he
                   next throws the tile into No.     kicks
                                                    2,    it  from No.    2
to No. 1, and thence out. He then throws         itinto No.    3,kicks    it

                          DRAWING       THE OVEN.                       3
from 3 to 2, from 2 to 1, and out. He next throws it into No. 4,
kicks it from 4 to 3, from 3 to 2, from 2 to 1, and out ; and so he pro
ceeds till he has passed the cross and comes to No. 7, when he is
permitted to rest himself, by standing with one foot in No: 6 and
the other in No. 7; but he must resume hopping before he kicks the
tile home.    He then passes through the be3s 8, 9, 10 and 11, as he
did those of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c., and so on, till he gets to plum pud
ding, when he may rest, and placing his tile on the plum, he is re
quired, while standing on one foot, to kick it with such force as to
send it through all the other beds to * at one kick.       If  one player
throws his tile into the wrong compartment, or when he is kicking it
out, he loses his innings, as he does also if the tile or his foot at any
time rests on a line, or if he kicks his tile out of the diagram.
                         FRENCH   AND ENGLISH.
    This is an old Greek game, and, like very many simple boys' games,
 has retained its popularity to the present day.      Its Greek name was
 rather a jaw-cracking one, but may be literally translated by "Pully-
 haully."   It consists of two parties of boys, who are chosen on dif
ferent sides by lots. One party takes hold of one end of a strong
rope, and the other party of the other end.          A mark being made
nudway between the parties, each strives to pull the other over        it,
and those who are so pulled over, lose the game.
    In this game, two leaders should be appointed, who must calculate
the powers of their own side, and concert plans accordingly.         The
leader of either side should have   a  code of signals, in order to com
municate with his own friends, that he may direct them when to
stop, when to slacken, or when to pull hard.         So important is  the
leader's office, thata   side with a   good leader will always vanquish
a  much superior force which has no commander to guide it. For
example, when all the boys are pulling furiously at the rope, the
leader of one side sees that his opponents are leanmg back too much,
depending on their weight more than on their strength.         He imme
diately gives the signal to slacken, when down go half the enemy on
their backs, and are run away with merrily      by  the successful party,
who drag them over the mark with the greatest ease.             Orif  the
enemy begins    to be  wearied with  hard pulling, an  unanimous tug will
often bring them upright, while they are off their guard, and once
moved, the victory  is  easily gained.   We have seen, assisted, and led
this game hundreds of times, and never failed to find     it   productive
of very great amusement.        No knots are to be permitted on the
rope, nor is  the game to be considered as won, unless the entire side
has been dragged over the line.
                         DRAWING    THE OVEN.
 This   is  game not very dissimilar to the preceding, but not so
             a
much to be recommended, as the clothes are very apt to be torn, and

if  the players engage too roughly, the wrists are not unfrequently
injured.     The method of playing the game is as follows : — Several
boys   seat   themselves in a row, clasping each other round the waist,
thus fantastically representing a batch of loaves.        Two other players
then approach, representing the baker's men, who have to detach the
players from each other's hold. To attain this object, they grasp
the wrists of the second boy, and endeavour to pull him away from
the boy in front of him.         If  they succeed, they pass to the" third,
and so on until they have drawn the entire batch.          As sometimes an
obstinate loaf sticks so tight to its companion, that it is not torn
away without bringing with it a handful of jacket or other part of
the clothing, the game ought not to be played by any but little boys.
                                      I  SPY.
    This is a capital game for the summer months.         The players divide
themselves      into two parties, one party remaining at a spot called
 " Bounds," and
                     concealing their faces, while the other party goes out
and hides.       After waiting for a few minutes, the home party shouts,
 "Coming, coming, coming." After a short pause they repeat the
                                                                 "
cry, and after another short interval they again shout,            Coming."
If   any out-player is not concealed, he may cry, "No," and a few
minutes more are allowed.            At the last shout, the home_ players,
leaving one to guard bounds, sally forth in search of their hidden
companions.        Directly one of the seekers sees one of the hiders, he
shouts,
          "  I   Spy," ana runs home as fast as he can, pursued by the
one he has found, who tries to touch him before he can reach bounds.
If   he succeeds, the one so touched is considered taken, and stands
aside.    If  the hiding party can touch three, or more, if especially
agreed upon, they get their hide over again.             The object of the
hiders is to intercept the seekers, and prevent them from reaching
bounds without bemg touched.               The worst player is left at the
bounds, in order to warn his companions, which he does by the word
 " Home," as
                  any hider may touch any seeker.
                                 PITCH-STONE.
    This game is played by two boys, each of whom takes a smooth
round pebble.        One player then tnrows his pebble about twenty feet
before him, and the next tries to strike it with his stone, each time
of striking counting as one.         If the two pebbles are near enough for
the player to place one upon        the other with his hand, he is at perfect
liberty to do so. It is easy enough to play at this game when the
pebbles are at some distance apart; but when they lie near each
other, it is very difficult to take a good aim, and yet send one's own
pebble beyond the reach of the adversary's aim.             Two four-pound
 cannon balls are the best objects to pitch, as thev roll evenly, and
 do not split, as pebbles always do when they get a hard knock.

   This game may be played by any number of players.              A large
stone is selected, and placed on a particular spot, and the players

the mark, and the one who        farthest from
                                        is         becomes

Duck places his stone on the other, while the rest of the players
return to the bounds, and in succession pitch their stones at his with
the endeavour to knock      off.it                 If
                                        this is accomplished, Duck must
immediately replace       it,
                         and  the    throwers   must pick up their stones
and run to the oounds.    As soon as Duck has replaced his stone, he
runs after any of the other plavers, and        he can succeed in catching
                                                         if

                                    them, the player so touched becomes
Duck.
                    PRISONER'S               BASE, OR PRISON BASS.
   This isa  most delightful game, and       very great favourite among
                                                           is
Ijovs of all classes.     It                            by a
                             commenced      choosmg Captains, which
dtner   done   by lot or        by is
                             the "sweet voices" of the youths.           If   by is
lot,a  number of straws of different lengths are put m bunch, and    a
those who draw from one end, the other being hidden, the two longest
straws, are the two "Captains;" each of which has the privilege of
choosing his men: the drawer of the longest of the two straws has
the first choice.    When this has been arranged each Captain selects,
alternately,  a boy till the whole are drawn out.
   This method is, however, often attended with considerable incon
 venience, as it    isnot impossible that the lots may fall on the two
worst players.     It very much better to let the boys choose the two
                         is

6                          EVERY   BOY'S   BOOK.
Captains, as the two best players will then assuredly be elected, and
most of the success of the game depends on the Captains.
   The leaders being thus chosen, the next point is to mark out the
homes and prisons. First, two semicircles are drawn, large enough to
hold the two parties, the distance between the semicircles being about
twenty paces. These are the "homes," or "bounds." TwentJ paces
in front of these, two other semicircles, of a rather larger size, are
marked out. These are the prisons; the prison of each party beiue
in a line with the enemy's home. These preliminaries bemg settled,
the sides draw lots ; the side drawing the longest straw having to
commence the game.      The Captain of side A orders out one of his own
side, usually a poor player, who is bound to run at least beyond the
prisons before he returns. Directly he has started, the Captain of
side B sends out one of his men to pursue, and, if possible, to
touch him before he can regain his own home.          If this is accom
plished, the successful  runner  is permitted to return home   scathless,
while the vanquished party must go to the prison belonging to his
side; from which he cannot stir, until some one from his own side re
leases him, by touching him in spite of the enemy. This is not an easy
task; as, in order to reach the prison, the player must cross the
enemy's home. It is allowable for the prisoner to stretch his hand as
far towards his rescuer as possible, but he must keep some part of his
body within the bounds ; and if several prisoners are taken, it is suffi
cient for one to remain within the prison, while the rest, by joining
hands, make a chain towards the boy who is trying to release them.
When this is accomplished, both the prisoner and his rescuer return
home, no one being able to touch them until they have reached their
home and again started off.      But the game is not only restricted to
the two origmally sent out. Directly Captain A sees his man pressed
by his opponent, he sends out a third, who is in his turn pursued by
another from side B; each being able to touch any who have pre
ceded, but none who have left their home after him.     The game soon
becomes spirited; prisoners are made and released, the two Captains
watching the game, and rarely exposing themselves, except in cases
of emergency, but directing the whole proceedings.         The {jame is
considered won, when one party has succeeded in imprisonmg the
whole of the other side. Much depends upon the Captains, who
sometimes, by a bold dash, rescue the most important of their         pri
soners, and therebv turn the fate of the battle; or, when the attention
of the opposite side  is  occupied  by some hardly-contested struggle,
send some insignificant player to the rescue; who walks quietly up
to the prison, and unsuspectedly lets out the prisoners one by one.
No player  is permitted to touch more than one person until he has
returned to his home; when he can sally out agam armed with fresh
strength, Eke Anteus of old, who could not be conquered at wrestling,
because whenever he touched the ground his strength was renewed
by  his mother Earth.

                            BASTE  THE BEAR.
                                   POX.
   This game was extensively played at the school where our boyhood
was passed; but we never saw it elsewhere. It used to afford us such
amusement in the long summer evenings, that it deserves a place in
this collection of sports. One player is termed Fox, and is furnished
with a den, where none of the players may molest him. The other
players arm themselves with twisted or knotted handkerchiefs, (one
end to be tied in knots of almost incredible hardness,) and range
themselves round the den waiting for the appearance of the Fox. He
being also armed with a knotted handkerchief, hops out of his den.
When he is fairly out, the other players attack him with their hand
kerchiefs, while he endeavours to strike one of them without putting
down his other foot.      If he does so he has to run back as fast as he
can, without the power of striking the other players, who baste him
the whole way.       If, however, he succeeds in striking one without
losing  his balance,   the one so struck becomes Fox ; and, as he has
both feet down, is accordingly basted to his den. The den is useful
as a resting-place for the Fox, who is often sorely wearied by futile
attempts to catch his foes.
                             BASTE THE BEAS.
   This is a funny game. The players generally draw lots for the first
Bear, who selects his own Keeper. The Bear kneels on the ground,
and his Keeper holds him with a rope about four feet long, within a
circle of about five feet in diameter.    The other players tie knots in
their handkerchiefs, and begin to strike or baste the Bear, by running
close to, or into the ring.    Should the Keeper touch any of the boys
while they are at this sport without dragging the Bear out of the

  ring, or shovdd the Bear catch hold of any player's leg, so as to
  hold him fast, the player so touched or caught becomes Bear. The
  second Bear may select his Keeper as before, and the play continues.
                                 LEAP-FROG.
      This is an excellent game of agility, and very simple.   It consists
  of any number of players; but from six to eight is the most con
 venient number.      Havmg by agreement or lots determined who shall
 give the first "back," one player so selected places himself in posi
 tion, with his head inclined and his shoulders elevated, and his hands
 resting on his knees, at ten yards' distance from the other players;
 one of whom immediately runs and leaps over him, — haviug made
 his leap, he sets a back at the same distance forward from the boy
 over whom he has just leaped.        The third boy leaps over the first
 and second boy, and sets a "back" beyond the second; and the fourth
 boy leaps over the first, second, and third, and sets a "back" beyond
 the third, and so on till all the players are out. The game may con
 tinue for any length of time, and generally lasts till the players are
 tired; but the proper rule should be, that all who do not go clean
 over should be out. Those who
                                   " make backs" should stand
                                                                 perfectly
 stiff and firm; and those who "make leaps" should not rest in their
 flight heavily upon the shoulders of their playmates, so as to throw
 them down, which is not fair play.
                                 MOUNT NAG.
     This game is best played by four boys of a side; one party being
the Nags, and the other the Eiders. The party to be Nags are deter
mined by lot, and they arrange themselves in the followmg manner :
No. 1 stands erect with his face to the wall; No. 2 places his head
against the back of No. 1, and bends his back.       No. 3 does the same
at the back of No. 2, and No. 4 the same at the back of No. 3. The
Eiders now make their leaps. The first, making a run, must endea
vour to leap over Nos. 4 and 3, to the back of No. 2, and the second
rider to leap over No. 4, to No. 3; the last, leaping on the back of
No. 4. When thus seated, it is the province of the Nags to wriggle
off the Riders, or to make their feet touch the ground, without falling
themselves.     They must not, in wriggling, toucn the ground with any
part of their bodies but their feet; and if they can succeed in making
the Riders touch or fall of, they become Riders; and those who touch
or fall, the Nags.
                                  TOUCH.
     This is a brisk game, and may be played by any number of boys.
One of the players being chosen as Touch, it is his business to run
about in all directions after the other players, till he can touch one,
who immediately becomes Touch in his turn.          Sometimes when the
game is played it is held as a law that Touch shall have no power

                               WARNING.
over those boys who can touch iron or wood.          The players then,
when out of breath, rush to the nearest iron or wood they can find, to
render themselves secure. Cross-touch is sometimes played, in which,
whenever another player runs between Touch and the pursued, Touch
must immediately leave the one he is after to follow nun.      But this
rather confuses, and spoils the game.
           BUCK, BUCK,   HOW MANY     HORKS DO   I  HOLD TO  ?
   This is a very good game for three boys. The first is called the
Buck, the second the Frog, and the third the Umpire. The boy who
plays the Buck gives a back with his head down, and rests his
hands on some wall or paling in front of him       The Frog now leaps
on his back, and the Umpire stands by his side: the Frog now holds
np one, two, three, five, or any number of fingers, and cries, "Buck!
                             I
Buck! how many horns do hold up?" The Buck then endeavours
to guess the right number; if he succeeds, the Frog then becomes
Buck, and in turn jumps on his back.         The Umpire     determines
whether Buck has guessed the numbers rightly or not.
                               WARSING.
   This is an excellent game for cold weather.    It  may be played by
any number of boys.     In playing it "loose bounds" are made near a
wall or fence, about four feet wide and twelve long. One of the
boys is selected, who is called the Cock, who takes his place within
the bounds ; the other players are called the Chickens, who distribute
themselves in various parts of the play-ground. The Cock now clasps
his hands together, and cries, "Warning once, warning twice, a
bushel of wheat, and a bushel of rye, when the Cock crows out jump
I." He then, keeping his hands still clasped before him, runs after
 he other players; when he touches one, he and the player so touched

   10                          EVERY    BOY'S    BOOK.
   immediately make for the bounds; the other players immediately try
   to capture them before they get there; if they succeed, they are
   privileged to get upon their backs and ride them home. The Cock
   and his Chick now come out of the bounds hand-in-hand, and try to
   touch some other of the players; the moment they do this they
   break hands, and they and the player now touched run to the bounds
   as before, while the other players try to overtake them, so as to secure
  the ride. The three now come from the bounds in the same manner,
   capture or touch a boy, and return. If, while trying to touch the
  other boys, the players when sallying from the grounds break hands
  before they touch any one, they may immediately be ridden, if they
  can be caught before they reach the "bounds.           Sometimes when three
  players    have  been  touched  the  Cock  is  allowed  to join the out party,
  but this is of no advantage in playing the game.
                               FOLLOW MY LEADER.
      This may be played by any number of boys: one being selected as
  the Leader, and the others are the Followers. The Followers arrange
  themselves in a line behind the Leader, who immediately begins to
  progress, and the others are bound to follow him.             The fun of this
  sport   is in the  Leader  carrying   his Followers   into  "uncouth  places,"
  over various "obstacles," such as hedges, stiles, gate-posts,             &c.,
  through "extraordinary difficulties," as ditches and quagmires, —
  every player being expected to perform his feats of agility; and those
  who fail are obliged to go last, and bear the emphatic name of the
  " Ass." The
                    game lasts till the Leader gives up, or the boys are all
  tired out.
                                 THE FUGLEMAN.
     This is a game something like the above.                It consists of the
 Fugleman and his Squad.          The Fugleman places himself in a central
 spot, and arranges his Squad before him m a line.               He then com
 mences with various odd gestures, which all the Squad are bound to
 imitate. He moves his head, arms, legs, hands, feet, in various direc
 tions, sometimes sneezes, coughs, weeps, laughs, and bellows, all of
 which the Squad are to imitate. Sometnnes this is a most amusing
 scene, and provokes great laughter.             Those who are observed to
laugh,     however,   are immediately   ordered   to stand out of the line, and
when half the number          of   players  are   so put out, the others are
allowed to ride them three times round the playground, while the
Fugleman with a knotted handkerchief accelerates their motions.
                              HARE AND HOUNDS.
     This is perhaps the very best game that can be introduced into a
school. The principle of it is very simple, that one boy represents
the Hare and runs away, while the others represent the Hounds and
pursue him. The proper management of the game, however, requires

                         HARE AND     HOUNDS.                        11
some skill.   When we were at school in the north, this game was ex
tensively played ; and in more recent times, when we ourselves were
masters instead of scholars, we reduced the game to a complete
svstem.    The first thing to be done is to choose a Hare, or if the
chase is to be a long one, two Hares are required. The Hare should
not be the best runner, but should be daring, and at the same time
prudent, or he may trespass into forbidden lands, and thereby cause
great mischief.    A Huntsman and Whipper-in are then chosen. The
 Huntsman should be the best player, and the Whipper-in secona
 best. Things having advanced so far, the whole party sally forth.
 The Hare is furnished with a large bag of white paper torn into small
 squares, which he scatters on the ground as he goes.        An arrange
 ment is made that the Hare shall not cross his path, nor return home
 until a certain time; in either of which cases he is considered caught.
 The Hounds also are bound to follow the track or " scent" implicitly,
 and not to make short cuts if they see the Hare.        The Hare then
 starts, and has about seven minutes' grace, at the expiration of which
 time the Huntsman blows a horn with which he is furnished, and
 sets off, the Hounds keeping nearly in Indian file, the Whipper-in
 bringing up the rear.   The Huntsman is also furnished with a white
 flag, the Whipper-in with a red one, the staves being pointed and
 shod with metal.     Off they go merrily enough, until at last the
 Huntsman loses the scent.       He immediately shouts "Lost!" on
 which the Whipper-in sticks his flag in the ground where the scent
 was last seen, and the entire line walks or runs round it in a circle,
 within which they are tolerably sure to find the track. The Hunts
 man in the meanwhile has stuck his flag in the ground, and examines
 the country to see in what direction the Hare is likely to have gone.

  12                         EVERY   BOY'S  BOOK.
 When the track is found, the player who discovers it shouts Tally ho!
 the Huntsman takes up his nag, and ascertains whether it is really
 the track or not. If so, he blows his horn again, the Hounds form in
 line between the two flags, and off they go again.        It is incredible
 how   useful  the two  flags  are.  Many  a Hare   has been  lost because
 the Hounds forgot where the last track was seen, and wasted time in
 searching for it again. Moreover, they seem to encourage the players
 wonderfully.      We used often to make our chases fourteen or fifteen
 miles in length ; but before such an undertaking is commenced, it is
 necessary to prepare by a series of shorter chases, which should how
 ever be given in an opposite direction to the course fixed upon for the
 grand chase, as otherwise the tracks are apt to get mixed, and the
 Hounds are thrown out. The Hare should always carefully survey his
 intended course a day or two previously, and then he will avoid
 getting himself into quagmires, or imprisoned in the bend of a
 river. A pocket compass is a most useful auxiliary, and prevents all
 chance of losing the way, a misfortune which is not at all unlikely to
 happen upon the Wiltshire downs or among the Derbyshire hi'lk
                                STEEPLE  CHASE.
    This is a trial of speed and agility, and may be played by "any
 number of boys.      It consists in the boys agreeing upon some distant
 object  for a  mark, such as a conspicuous tree, or house, or steeple.
The players then start off in whatever direction they please, each one
being at liberty to choose his own course. In a lone run of a mile or
so it very often happens that hedges, ditches, and other obstructions,
have to be got over, which adds great interest to the play, and the
best climbers and jumpers are the most likely to come m victors.
He who comes in first to the appointed object is called the King, the
second the Duke, the third the Marquis, the fourth the Viscount, the
fifth the Earl, the sixth the Knight. The last receives the dignified
appellation of the Snail, and the last but one the Tortoise.
    At Oxford there were in our undergraduate days two clubs for the
purpose of Steeple-chasing, one named the Kangaroo Club, and the
qther the Charitable Grinders, whose performances over hedges and
ditches were really astonishing. There was also a club which kept a
set of beagles, and used to hunt a red herring with intense per
severance.
                              DTTCK AND DBAKB.
    This is a very simple sport, but necessarily restricted to those
spots where there is a river, or a pond of some magnitude.          It con
sists in throwing oyster-shells, flat stones, or broken tiles along the
water, so as to make them hop as often as possible.            One hop is
called Dick, the second Duck, and the third Drake.          The sea-shore
is a capital place for this sport, as, if the player can only succeed
in making the stone touch the top of a wave, it is tolerably certain

to make a succession of hops from wave to wave.           If  a rifle-bullet is
shot along the water, it mil go a great distance, making very long
hops, and splashing up the water at every bound. In war, this method
of firing at an enemy that lies low is extensively made use of, and is
called " ricochet practice." It is also much used in naval warfare.
                               SI Yd -s   s u:-..
   This,  if well managed, is a very comical game.          The players are
arranged as in Fugleman, the player who enacts Simon standing in
front.    He and all the other players clench their fists, keeping the
thumb pointed upwards. No player is to obey his commands unless
prefaced with the words,
                            " Simon says." Simon is himself
                                                                     subjected
to the same rules. The game commences by Simon commandmg, —
" Simon says, turn down: on which he turns his thumbs downwards,
followed by the other players. He then says, " Simon says, turn tip,"
and brings his hands back again. When he has done so several times,
and thinks that the players are off their guard, he merely gives the
word, "Turn up," or "Turn down," without moving his hands.
Some one, if not all, is sure to obey the command, and is subject to a
forfeit. Simon is also subject to a forfeit, if he tells his companions
to turn down while the thumbs are already down, or vice versa. With
a sharp player enacting Simon, the game is very spirited.
                         KINO    OP   THE CASTLE.
    This is a very good game, and to play it properly there must be in
 the centre of the playground a small hill or hillock.            One player,
 selected by choice or lot, ascends this hill,    and  is  called the Kmg ;
 and the object of the other players is to pull or push him from his
 elevation, while he uses his endeavours to Keep his
                                                          "

 Fair pulls and fair pushes are only allowed at this game ; the players
 must not take hold of any part of the clothes of the King, and must
 confine their grasps to tne hand, the leg, or the arm.           If  a player
 violates these rules, he is to sit down upon the ground, and is called

                       BATTLE IOB THE BANNER.
    This game is to be played from a mound, the same as the above,
 and it may consist of any number of players.         Each party selects a
 Captain, and having done this, divide themselves into Attackers and
 Defenders. The defending party provide themselves with a small flag,
 which is fixed on a staff on the top of the mound, and then arrange
 themselves on its side and at its oase, so as to defend it from the
 attacks of their opponents, who advance towards the hillock, and
 endeavour to throw down those that oppose them. Those that are so
 thrown on either side, are called
                                        " dead men," and must lie quiet till

the game is finished, which is concluded either when all the attacking
party are dead, or the banner is carried off by one of them.        The
player who carries off the banner is called the   Knight, and is chosen
Captain for the next game.
                               SNOW-BALLS.
   Every boy has played at snow-balls, from the time that his little
fingers were first able to grasp and mould a handful of snow. Elderly
gentlemen know to their cost how apt the youthful friend is to hurl
very hard snow-balls, which appear to pick out the tenderest parts of
his person, generally contriving to lodge just at the juncture of the
chin and the comforter, or coming with a deafening squash in the
very centre of his ear. Even the dread policeman does not always
escape ; and when he turns round, indignant at the temporary loss of
his shiny hat, he cannot recognise his assailant in the boy who is
calmly whistling the last new nigger-song, as he saunters along,
with both his hands in his pockets. The prudent schoolmaster wfll
also not venture too near the plavground, unless he has provided
himself with an umbrella. It is rather a remarkable fact, that when
ever a Grammar-school and a National-school are within a reasonable
distance of each other, they are always at deadly feud.     So it was at
the school where our youthful days were passed. One winter's morn
ing, just after school Wd opened, the door was flung violently open,
and a party of National-school boys hurled a volley of snow-balls at
 the head-master.    He, after the door had been secured, remarked in
 a particularly mild voice, — " Now, boys, if / had been at school, and

                               SNOW CASTLE.                              15
                  had been assaulted by National-school boys, /should
my schoolmaster
have gone out and given them a thrashing.       Remember,   I do not at
all advise you to do so, but merely mention the course that     Ishould
have adopted   under such circumstances.     We  will resume lessons  at
three." So saying, he took off his gown, put on his hat and gloves,
and walked out to see the fan.      Now, the prospect of a morning's
holiday would have made us attack a force of twenty times our
number, but as they only out-numbered us threefold, we commenced
a pursuit without hesitation.    After a sharp engagement, we drove
them back to their own schoolroom. The cause of their yielding was,
that they threw at random among us, whereas each of our balls was
aimed at the face of an opponent, and we very seldom missed. When
they had reached their school, they closed and barred their door;
at which we made such a battering, that their master, a large negro,
rushed out upon us, vowing vengeance, and flourishing a great cane.
He was allowed to jproceed a few yards from the door, when one
snow-ball took off his hat, and two more lodged in his face. He
immediately went to the right-about, and made for the school, which
he reached under an avalanche of snow.        We pursued, but he had
succeeded in fastening the door, and we could not open it for some
time. When we did, the school was deserted; not a boy was to be
seen.   There was no back entrance to account for their disappear
ance, and we were completely puzzled. At last, when we had quieted
down a little, a murmuring was heard apparently below our feet, and
on examination we found that the entire school had taken shelter in
the coal-cellar. We made a dash at the door (a trap-door), and in
spite of the showers of coal that came from below, fastened and
padlocked the door, carefully throwing the key among a clump of fir-
trees, where it was not likely to be found.      Having achieved this
victory, we had a snow-ball match among ourselves, and then re
turned to school.    About five o'clock, in rushed the black school
master, who had only just been liberated by the blacksmith, and who
came to complain of our conduct.    So far, however, from obtaining any
satisfaction, he was forced to apologise for the conduct of his boys.
                               SNOW       CASTLE.
   The object of this game     is,
                                that castle of snow
                                           a          built, which
                                                      is                 is
attacked  by one party and defended             by
                                          the other. The method of
building the castle is as follows —   :    A
                                       square place   cleared
                                                      is            in
                                                                  the
snow, the size of the projected castle.    As many boys as possible
then go to some distance from the cleared square, and commence
making snow-balls, rolling them towards the castle.     By the time
that they have reached   it,
                           each ball  large enough to form founda
                                           is                   a
tion-stone. By continuing this plan, the walls are built about five
feet six inches high,    raised step running round the interior, on
                         a
which the defenders stand while hurling the balls against their
opponents.   In the centre are deposited innumerable snow-balls,

ready made ; and a small boy is usually pressed into the service, to
make snow-balls as fast as they are wanted.              If
                                                 the weather is very
cold, some wa.ter slashed over the castle hardens and strengthens it
considerably.  The architect of the castle must not forget to leave
space for a door.
                                  SNOW    GIANT.
   This is made in the same way         as the snow castle, that      is,   byrolling
large snow-balls     to  the  place   where   the  giant  is   to  be  erected, and
then piled up and carvea into form. He             isnot considered completed
until two coals are inserted for eyes, and until he           is further decoratea
with  a pipe   and  an  old  hat.    When    he is quite   finished,   the juvenile
sculptors  retire  to a  distance,   and with   snow-balls   endeavour      to knock
down their giant, with as much zest as they exhibited in building
him.    If   asnow giant    is  well made, he will last until the leaves are
out, the sun having but little power on so large          a   mass of hard snow.
There  is a  legend   extant   respecting   the  preservation of snow through
the warmer parts of the year.             A certain Scotch laird had for           a
tenant  a certain farmer.       The laird had been requested         by   influential
personages    to transfer   the   farm to another   man    directly   the  lease was
run out. The farmer's wife, hearing of this from some gossip of hers,
went to her landlord, and besought him to grant                a   renewal of the
lease.   When she called, he was at dinner with            a   numerous party of
friends, and replied in       a    mocking tone, that the lease should be
renewed when she brought him          a  snow-ball in July. She immediately
called upon the guests to bear witness to the offer, and went home.

In  due time the winter came, and witii it the snow.      One day, her
husband, an excellent labourer, but not over bright, asked her why
she was wasting so much meal.       At that time, she had taken a large
vessel of meal to a valley, and was pouring it into the space between
two great stones.     Upon the meal she placed a large quantity of
snow, which she stamped down until it was hard.          Upon this she
poured more meal, and placed upon the meal a layer of straw. The
whole affair was then thickly covered over with straw and reeds. To
her husband, who thought she had fairly lost her senses, she deigned
no reply, except that the meal would repay itself. So affairs went on
until July, when the good dame, hearing that her landlord had invited
a large party to dine with him, many ot whom had been at the party
when the promise was made, proceeded to the store of snow, which
she found about half diminished. The remainder she kneaded hard,
and put it in a wheelbarrow, well covered with straw, which she
rolled up to the laird's own house. When once there, she took out
her snow-ball, and presenting it to her landlord, before all his guests,
demanded the renewal of her lease.      It may be satisfactory to know,
that the laird, struck with her ingenuity and perseverance, at once
granted her request.

                                MARBLES.
    IN ancient times, when we were boys, and indulged in the luxury of
 marbles, they were very different from their present form.        They
 were made of stone, nicely polished, and some of them, called "alleys,
 of the purest marble. Many of the stone marbles were beautifully
 variegated, and now and then a fancy pet was treasured under the

name of taw, which had somewhat the virtues of a talisman, for to
"lose it or to give it" were "such perdition," as Othello says, as
could never be exceeded.     Of late years, marbles, like all other
matters, have undergone    considerable change.   Foreign marbles
have been introduced^ prodigiously cheaper, it is true, than our old
English marbles, but infinitely worse; and various kinds of "patent
marbles" have had their day.         Some of these go by the name of
Dutchmen, others are called Frenchmen, and others again Chinamen,
while it is not quite impossible to procure some right old English
marbles, which, if they can be procured, are still the best. We would
advise all marble players to procure these, if they can, as

are a royal game, and ought to be duly honoured.

                 they shoot         it,

                                             RING TAW.
    Ring Taw is a game requiring skill and judgment, and is a most
excellent game. It is played as follows. Two rings are drawn upon
the ground, a small one, six inches in diameter, enclosed by a larger
one, six feet in diameter.       Into the
small ring each player puts a marble,
called "snot."    The players then pro
ceed to any part of the large ring, and
from thence, as an offing, shoot at the
marbles in the centre.                  If
                                 a player
knocks a marble out of the ring he wins
it, and he    entitled to shoot again be
               is

When all the players have shot their
marbles, they shoot from the places at
which their marbles rested at the last
shot.    Ifthe shooter's taw remain in
the small circle, he      out, and has to drop

its owner must give up to the striker of the taw all the marbles he
may have previously won during the game.        The game      concluded     is

killed.

at the line, and endeavours to shoot into the first hole.
If  he does this he proceeds to the second, then to the
third, and wins the game but this rarely occurs.

                        NINE HOLES, OR BRIDGE-BOARD.
   This game is played by means of a piece of board cut into the form
of a bridge, havmg nine arches, and just large enough to let the mar
bles pass through, as in the subjoined diagram.   One of the players
undertakes to be "bridge-keeper," and the stipulation usually made
 is,
   that he should receive one for every unsuccessful shot, and pay to
those who shoot their marbles through the arches the numbers
standing over them.    The place from which the players shoot their
marbles    generally about four feet from the bridge.
              is
                                       DIE SHOT.
                          This   is
                                 a  very good game, and requires both skill
                       and caution.      It
                                          is played       by
                                                        elevating a  die upon
                       another marble, whose sides are slightly ground
                       down so that will stand firmly, and firing at from

                       The die-keeper undertakes to pay to the shooter
                       who knocks down the die the number which falls
                       uppermost, receiving one from each player as he
                       shoots.
                                  TEETOTUM       SHOT.
     This    is played on the same conditions.    teetotum is set spinning

the side that falls uppermost. This is a very skilful game, and
requires good shots.
                          KNOCK         OUT,   OB,   LAO OUT.
   This game is played by knocking marbles against a wall, or perpen
dicular board set up for the purpose ; and the skill displayed m it
depends upon the player's attention to what is called in mechanics
the resolution of forces ; for instance,
if an object be struck against the wall
at A from the mark at B, it will return
again to B in a straight line; if it be
sent from c to A it will, instead of
returning to c, pass off aslant to B,
and its course will form the angle c
D ; the angle of incidence being equal
to the angle of reflection.
   The game is played by any number
of players ; the first player throws his
marble against the wall, so that it may
rebound and fall about a yard distant
from it ; the other players then, in succession, throw their marbles
against the wall, in such a way as to cause them to strike any
of those already lagged out, and the marble struck is considereil
won by the owner of the taw that strikes        in addition to which,

                               several players, who each put down                         a
marble in  a   small rmg. "One player then stands in perpendicular        a

that each boy's marble approaches the hole. When tnis          settled,           is

 the first thrower takes all the marbles in his hand, and throws them
 in a cluster towards the hole.            If  an even number falls in, such as
 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, he wins all ; but if an odd number falls in, he loses all,
 and the next player throws.               Sometimes it happens that the game
 is so soon finished, that the other players have not the chance of a
 throw. When this happens, those thrown out have first innings in
 the next game, which restores the equilibrium of chances.                     This
 game is sometimes played by giving to the thrower all the marbles
 he can put into the hole, while the other players take the remainder.

respective    shooters.
                                     TUB PYRAMID.
    In   this game a boy generally sits upon the ground with his legs
                               open wide, and making a small circle, places
                              in it three at the three points of a triangle, and
                               the fourth on the top of them, so as to form
                               a small pyramid.         A distance of about four
                              feet is then chosen as the point to shoot from,
                               and the other players shoot at the pyramid.
                              Those that strike it have all the marbles they
                              knock out of the ring, but if they miss, they
                              lose their shots.
                    SPANS AND SNOPS, AND BOUNCE ABOUT.
    This consists of one boy laying down his taw, and, giving a distance,
his antagonist shoots at it; if he misses, the first boy shoots at the
taw of the second, till one is struck, which the striker claims. Bounce
About is the same game played by throwing large marbles instead of
shooting smaller ones. He who strikes the other's bounce being tie
winner.
                                       CONQUEROR.
    There is a game called "Conqueror," which is extensively played
in some places.          A piece of hard ground, and free from stones, is
chosen for the spot.         The first player lays his marble on the ground,
and the second throws his own at it with' all his force, and endeavours

                            THE WHIP-TOP.                            23
to break it.    If he succeeds, his marble counts one, and the van
quished player lays down another marble.            If two players have
marbles   that   have already vanquished      others,  the "Conqueror"
counts all the conquered of the other party in addition to his own.
For example, suppose A, being conqueror of twenty, breaks B, also a
conqueror of twenty, A counts forty-one, i. t. twenty of its own,
twenty for the vanquished belonging to B, and one for B itself.
   Nuts, chestnuts, and other snnilar objects are also employed at
this game, only they are fastened to a strmg, and swung against the
opponent, instead of being thrown.
                                   TOPS.
   Tops are of various kinds. There is first your Whip-Top, a big
and burly creature, great as an alderman; then your Hummmg-Top,
which smgs himself to sleep ; then your Peg-Top, a hardy old
veteran; and lastly your "Boxer," who stands stern and for ever like
the hero of a hundred fights, and makes sad havoc in the ring.
                             THE WHIP-TOP.
   Whip-top is a capital sport when
play ed by two persons ; and is played
by first whirling the top into motion,
by turning it sharply with both
hands, and then, by flogging it till its
motion becomes very rapid. When
two persons play Whip-top, the
object should be for each to whip his
top to a certain goal, he who reaches
it first being the victor. Another        _^_
play is for each whipper to flog his     —5

top, so that it strikes and knocks down that of his adversary; this
                " Encounters," as the other is denominated "
play is called                                                   Racing."
The best kind of thongs are those made of pliable eel-skins, and they
should be used carefully, particularly in "races" and "encounters,"
so that the whippers may not cut each other's eyes out.
                            THE HUMMING -TOP.
   These cannot easily be made, but can very easily be purchased by
those who are so lucky as to have the money. They are made hollow,
having at their crown a peg, round which is wound a string; this,
being pulled through a kind of fork, gives motion to the top, and sets
it spuming ; the fork and the string being left in the spinner's hand.
In spinning the top, care should be taken m winding the string firmly
and evenly on the peg, and when it is pulled out, neither too much
nor too little force should be used, and a firm and steady hand should
be employed, while the top should be held in a j>erpendicular position.
The string should be drawn with a steadily mcreasing force, or the
top will not hum properly.
                                 PEG-TOP.
   There are various kinds of Peg-tops, and they also vary in shape,
                          some bemg much rounder than others. Those
                          are the best which are shaped like a pear.
                          There is also great variety as regards the
                           shape and size of the peg, which in some tops
                          is short and thick, in others, long and taper
                           ing. Again, tops are made of different kinds of
                           wood, some being made of deal, others of elm,
                           some of yew-tree, and others of box-wood.
                           These last are the Boxers so highly prized.

spinning, fall within the ring, they are considered dead, and are placed
in the centre of the circle for the others to peg at. The player who
succeeds in striking any of the tops out of the circle claims those so
struck out.      In some places, each player may ransom his top with                  a
marble.                                                                                    '
   Sleeping tops are exposed to much danger in the play, for they
offer  a fair mark to the "pegger," and often get split, when the
"peg" takenis             by
                        the splitter as his trophy.     Long-pegged tops are
the best for the game, for as they must lay more npon their sides
after their fall, and before the spinning entirely ceases, they are the
more likely to spin out of the rmg.
   There    is    way of making the top spring out of the ring directly

                          drawing the hand sharply towards the body just
as the top leaves the string.         When the manoeuvre       well executed,

     This game       is      two boys, in the following manner — Two
                          played      by                                     :
lines, about six feet apart, are marked upon the ground, which ought
to be smooth and hard.        Some small stones are then procured and
plain midway between the lines they should not be larger than
       I                                        ;                                     a
small bean, and the black and polished ones are the most sought
after. The tops are now set up spinning on the ground, and the
players, being each provided with       small wooden spoon, dexterously
                                                  a

the top still spinning in the spoon, throw the point of the peg against
the stone, so as to chip     out of bounds, he who does this the soonest

 throwing the top from you, the line must be polled in with a peculiar
jerk of the hand, which practice alone can give.     The string button
should be held close in the hand, between the last two fingers of the
hand.    There is what is called an "underhand" way of spuming a
top, i.e. by holding it peg upwards, throwing it in a straight fine
forward, and withdrawing the string ; but as we dislike everything
underhand, we shall not recommend this practice any more than we
shall the Spanish tops, which are spun after this method.
                        There is no sport more exhilarating than Kite
                     flying; and few things afford boys more delight.

                     procure a nice straight smooth lath, about three-

                     six feet long, AB; point the top at A, and cut a
                     notch on each side of the lath at an inch from
                     its top and bottom A B.       Get a piece of thin
                     hoop, or a cane, and bend into the form CAD,
                     with an exact and equal portion on either side
                     of the lath.   Fasten it by fine strong twine at
                     the head of the lath, and then stretch a fine cord
                     from c to D, and tie it as a stretcher to each end
                     of the bow c D, so that the bow may form a
                     handsome curve, and the stretcher be exactly

 one-third of the length of the lath.      Then take one-third from the
 bottom of the lath, which will be at E, fasten the cords r o H I to c
 and ii, A and K, i; i> and B c, and you have what is called the skeleton
 of your kite.
    How to balance the Skeleton. — Take the tip of the point at A,
 and let it rest against the wall, placing the kite slantways, so that the
 bottom tip just touches the floor; observe whether either side pre
ponderates, and if it does shave off a little on that side of your cane
 or hoop; then, after looking over every part to see that all your
joinings are firm and tight, prepare to
    Cover the Kite. — Procure several sheets of double-crown paper,
 and lav them on the skeleton thus: the first sheet at A; cut off the
redundant corners, and nicely paste the other parts of the paper
round the bow, but not to the lath.      Do the same
with the other sheets, cutting them with an arch
rim to turn over the string. When the whole of your
kite is thus covered, make two holes in the lath
at f E, through which pass a cord to hang loosely
in front for the bellyband, knotting the two ends
of the cord at the back of the kite, to prevent the
 string from running through the holes.           Now
make the wings to the kite, by cutting several
 sheets of paper into slips and rolling them into
the form of a tassel, these should be one-fourth
the length of the kite, and should be tied to the
 sides c D.   To make the tail, take some slips of
doubled paper four inches long and slip them
through the noose-knots of a cord about fifteen
times the length of the kite. Tie this to the end of the lath at B,
 and at the end of the tail put a large tassel of paper, the same as those
formed for the wings, and any other matter necessary for steadying
the kite when it is flown. Now tie the string with which the kite is to
be flown to the bellyband, and your kite is ready for flight.

some disadvantages,    and the greatest
that of its being very speedily spoiled
the wet. To remedy this defect, cloth,
calico, or silk kites, have been invented.
These consist of two cross pieces placed
at right angles to each other, and secured
with string from corner to corner, over
                                            b by
which the calico  is sewn, and fastened
quilting along the string. When all
made, the whole may be detached from
the laths, and these being separated, may
be easily carried or packed away       in   a
portable compass.     But great improve

  ment may be made in these by the substitution of the very thin gutta
  percha cloth, which is not thicker than gold-beater's         skin: this,
  strained over the laths in a similar way, being lighter and more durable
  than cloth or even silk.
     The Kite-manufacturer need not restrict himself to any particular
  shape, provided that he only keeps the balance.          An officer is a
  capital shape for the purpose ; his head must be made to unship, and
  his arms must be close to his sides, while his epaulettes make excellent
  "wings." A kite of this form should not be furnished with the
            " tail," but a long
  ordinary                      string should take its place, while to the
  end of the string may be attached a sabretasch, or any other suitable
  object which can preserve the balance of the kite.          The features
 must be marked very strongly indeed, and the decorations should be
 made of tinsel, as that sparkles more than mere gilding. In this way
 a most effective kite may be made.         About seven feet is a good
 height for such a kite; but then the string must be very strong.
 Remember, then, the kite will stand upright in proportion to the
 weight at the end of the tail, so that if you want your officer to
 be very martial indeed, you must give him a heavy sabretasch.        The
 Chinese are wonderfully clever in the art of kite-manufacturing; and
 occasionally fill the air with huge birds, dragons, and other grotesque
 forms.
    The proper and legitimate hoop should be made of a stout ashen
lath, round on the outside and flat on the inside, and should be well
fastened at its point of juncture; it should be in height so as to
reach midway between the youngster's elbow and shoulder, so that he
may not have to stoop while striking it.        The stick should be about
sixteen inches long and made of tough ash ; and in bowling the hoop
the bowler should strike it vigorously in the centre, and in a direction
horizontal with the ground. Such hoop-exercise is exceedingly good,

and a good run with such a hoop will warm the youth in the very
 coldest weather. Nothing can be more objectionable than are modern
iron hoops; they are exceedingly dangerous to by-passers, and many
are the shins that have been broken, and not a few old men have been
thrown down and killed by them. The practice of running them with
a crooked piece of iron is also foolish; for it defeats the end of the
hoop, which is to give exercise to the arm, while running gives it to the
legs. The game called
                         " encounters" can be well
                                                      played with wooden
hoops,   but not  with  iron ones.   It consists  in two  players driving
their hoops against each other from long distances, the victor being
he who beats the other hoop down. Let us again strongly advise our
young friends to use good stout wooden hoops.
                              THE POPGUN.
    The best Popguns are made of a strong straight piece of elder-tree,
which ought to be cut from an inner branch, and should be about six
inches long. The pith of this should be pierced out by an iron ram
rod fitting the hole ; and when the inside is thoroughly smooth by
rubbing the rod up and down,
it is ready for nse. The pellets
are made with moistened tow —
brown paper is a nasty thing to
put into the mouth, and we shall
never advise the use of it.     When the pellet is prepared, it should
be laid over the mouth of the gun in such a quantity as to require
squeezing and plugging in. The first pellet should be driven through
the gun to its other end; the second pellet is to be driven in, m
a similar manner to the first, and then, as it is forced through
the gun, the air between the pellets being incompressible beyond
a certain point, forces out the lower pellet with a loud "pop;"
hence the term
                  " Popgun," which has been                           Pop
                                                 applied to them.
guns are not a very healthy exercise; the pressing of the rammer
against the pit of the stomach frequently leading to derangement
of that organ. To prevent this, the lad who plavs at popgun should
have a small round board slung over his neck by a strmg hanging
as low as the pit of his stomach, like a
                                           " conductors ticket," agamst
which he should press the handle of his ramrod when he fires off his
popgun.
                               THE SLING.
   The art of slinging, or casting of stones with a sling, is of very high
antiquity.   We see it represented on the Nimroud monuments, and
the feat of the divine youth, David, is familiar to every one. In the
earliest times there were bands of stingers, and probably whole regi
ments of them, and there is tittle doubt that the art of slinging was
earlier than that of archery. The former seemed, however, to belong

so                        EVERY BOY     S BOOK.
to the Asiatic, as the latter did to the European nations.  Our Saxon
ancestors, however, seem to have been skilful in their manner of
holding the sling. Its form is preserved in several of their paintings,
and the manner in which it was used by them, as far back as the
eighth century, may be seen in the subjoined cut. We have also suf
ficient testimony to prove, that men armed with slings formed part of
the Anglo-Norman soldiery.
    In country districts, slinging of stones is a common sport ; and the
sling so used consists
                          simply of a piece of leather cut mto the sub
                       joined form, to which are affixed two cords, one
                       having a loop. In using      it, the leather is   suf
                       fered to hang from the string downwards; the
                       slinger places his little finger in the loop, and
                       holds the other end in his hand, and then putting
                       the stone in the hole of the sling at A, which
                       prevents its falling, whirls the whole round for
                       three or four times, to obtain      a  strong centri
                       fugal  force, and, suddenly letting go of that part
                       of the sling held in  his hand, the stone flies for
                       ward with inconceivable        rapidity, making    a
                       twanging sound in the ear as        flies.
                                                          it        Slinging
isa   very good exercise for imparting strength to the arm, but young
slingers should be very careful where they send their stones, or
they may do much damage.
  If  any of my readers may wish to construct           better kind of
                                                          a

The loop and point should be whipped with silk. The accuracy that
can be ootained with such a weapon is astonishing, only the missiles
should always be leaden bullets of the same weight — two or three
ounces being the best average weight.      At the school where my boy
hood was spent,   we  used to send  such bullets  just over the weather
cock of one of the loftiest spires in England, and stripped a chestnut-
tree of its blossoms.    One year there was a solitary blossom on the
top of the tree, which defied our efforts for many days. The blossoms
were soon knocked off, but the green stalk resisted the blows for a
long time.    It was battered to pieces, but bent to the strokes, and
had to be knocked off in fragments.       I  mention this to show the
accuracy of aim that can be attained by practice.
                                QUOITS.
   The game of Quoits is verv excellent.      It seems to have derived
its name from the ancient discus, and with us in the present day
is a circular plate of iron perforated in the middle,
not always of one size, but larger or smaller to
suit the strength or convenience of the several
 candidates.
     To play at Quoits an iron pin called a hob is
 driven into the ground within a few inches of the
 top, and at the distance of eighteen or twenty
 yards, as may be agreed upon; a second pin of
 iron is also fixed. The players are generally divided into parties, and
 the players pitch the Quoits from hob to hob; those who pitch
 the nearest reckoning towards the game. But the determina
 tion is discriminately made; for instance, if a Quoit belonging
 to A lies nearest to the hob, and a Quoit belonging to B the
 second, A can claim but one towards the game, though all his
 other Quoits be nearer to the hob than       aflthe other Quoits of
 B, because one Quoit of B      being the second nearest to the hob,
 cuts out, as  it   is                     If
                       called, all behind it.    no such Quoit had
  interfered, then   A  would have reckoned all his as one each.
  Having all cast their Quoits, the players walk to the oppo
  site side, and determine the state of the play. Then takmg
  their stand there, throw their Quoits back again, and continue
  to do so alternately, till the end of the game.   A     Quoit that
  falls with its flat side upward does not count.

                                     SKITTLES.
    Skittles is played in a manner somewhat similar to the preceding
 game, but the number of pins is only four. These are very large, ana
 are arranged on a square framework, so as to present one of the
 angles to the player.       The bowl used for playing this game is of the
 shape of a cheese, and is usually made of lignum vitse, as being very
 heavy and hard wood.         The game requires more bodily strength than
 nine-pins, as the bowl must be thrown upon the skittles, and not
 rolled up to them.
     The best play is to throw the bowl with a round-handed swing of
 the arm, so as to strike the nearest skittle at the right of its upper
 third.     The ball then springs to the second skittle, and from this
 generally twists to the third, while the fourth skittle is sent down
 bv the roll of the one first struck. It is very difficult to make
 ttiis throw successfully, and many players prefer driving down the
 first and third skittles with a straightforward shoot, and then making
 their second ball spring across from the second to the fourth. This
 latter stroke appears very difficult; but is soon learnt; the great
 point being to throw the bowl high, so that it may drop as perpen

dicularly as possible on the left of the upper third of the second
skittle. In the long run, the constant repetition of this practice will
overbalance occasional brilliancy of play.
                                 DUTCH-PINS.
   This game, is nothing more than a modification of nine-pins; the
pins being higher, and the centre one bearing the name of king, and a
crown upon its head. The great point in this game is to strike
the king out of the board without knocking down any of the subjects.
If this can be done, the game is won. In all other cases, the king
counts for no more than any of his subjects.
                           THROWING    THE HAMMER.
   This is a good athletic sport, but the Hammer can scarcely be called
a toy.    The hammer used by rustics is generally the sledge-hammer
of the blacksmith, with a head weighing some twelve or fourteen
pounds.     The players are all single and do not join in parties, and the
prize  is given to him who makes the greatest number of long throws
m a dozen. It does not merely require strength to throw the sledge
hammer, but a nice calculation of the area which the Hammer has to
pass over in its flight, combined with the strength of the thrower.
                              THE BOOMERAKG.1
   This instrument is a curved piece of wood, flat on one side, and
slightly rounded on the other. It is used by the natives of New South
Wales, who can throw it so dex
terously as to kill a man behind
a tree, where he may have fled for
safety. It should be held horizon

                      and cast        by
bringing the arm backwards, and
after making   avariety of curves
it  will come back again to the
person who sent it. If skilfully thrown,       may be made to go in
                                                     it

                      BATTLEDOBE    AND SHUTTLECOCK.
    This game is so well known as to require but little remark.
 Battledores may be purchased at the toy-shops, as may
 be the Cocks; but if any of our young friends will study
 our article on Carpentry, they may easily make both for
 themselves.     The Battledores are to be cut out with the
 key-hole saw into the subjoined shape. They should be
 about a quarter of an inch thick, the handles about six
 inches long, and the " spades
                                     " of about five inches
 long, and five broad.      The Shuttlecock may be made by
 cutting a piece of cork into the followingform, and placing
 a small brass nail at its lower end.       The top should be
plumed     with  five  feathers standing outwards   from the
rim, being fastened into small holes cut therein by a
little gum. The practice of the game is for two players
to beat the Cock backwards and forwards from one to
the other, and the one that lets it fall by failing to
strike it with his bat is to give to the other a pea, bead, pin, or
some other small article.       Some foreigners, particularly
the Chinese, play at this game with the toes, hands,
elbows, and other parts of the body, and will keep the
Cocks up in a most amusing manner in the midst of
many grotesque gestures.
                          GAMES WITH BALL,     ETC.
    Playing at Ball was very common among the Greeks, and received
various names: Episkyros, Phsenindffi, Aporraxis, and Ourania.        The
first of these games was also known by the names of the Ephebike
and the Epikoinos.          It was played thus: A number of youths
assembled together in a place covered with sand or dust, drew across
it a straight liue, which they called the Skyros, and, at equal distances
on either side, another line. They placed the Ball on the Skyros, and
then dividing iiito two equal parties they retreated each to their
lines, from which they immediately afterwards rushed forward to
seize the Ball.     The person who picked it up, then cast it towards
the extreme line of the opposite party, whose business it was to inter
cept it and throw IPback; and those won who, by force or by cunning,
compelled their opponents to overstep the boundary line.

                             FOOT-BALL.                             35
   Daniel Souter contends that this was the ancient English game of
Foot-ball, into which perhaps it may in course of time have been con
verted, having been introduced to us through the Romans. In cer
tain towns of South Wales the sport of Foot-ball as modified by us
may be witnessed with some interest.         The Balls consist of Ball
Bladders, protected by a thick covering of leather, and blown tight.
Six or eight are made ready for the occasion, every window of the
town is shut by break of day, at which time all the youths of the
neighbourhood assemble in the streets.     The Ball is then thrown up
in front of the Town Hall, and the multitude, dividing into two
parties, strive with incredible eagerness and enthusiasm to overcome
their antagonists, each endeavouring to kick the Foot-ball to the
other extremity of the town. In the struggle severe kicks and
wounds are given, and many fierce battles take place.         The Ball
sometimes mounts thirty or forty feet above the tops     of the highest
houses, and falls far beyond, or goes right over mto the gardens,
whither it is immediately followed oy a crowd of young men. The
sport is kept up all day, the hungry combatants recruiting their
strength with Welsh ale and an abundant supply of pancakes, sold by
women at various corners of the streets.
   Another variety of Ball-playing was by the Greeks called Aporraxis,
which consisted in throwmg the Ball with some force against the
ground, and repelling it constantly as it rebounded, he who did this
most frequently, winning.       In the game called Ourania, the player
bending back his body, flung up the Ball with all his might into the
air, on which there arose a contention among his companions, who
should first catch it in its descent, as Homer appears to indicate in
his description of the Fhaeacian sport.    They likewise played at Ball
in the modern fashion against a wall, in which the person who kept it
                                             "
up the longest won, and who was called         King; the one who lost
obtained the less honourable name of "Ass," and was constrained by the
laws of the game to perform any task set him by the King.
                              FOOT-BALL.
   When a match of' Foot-ball is now made, two parties, each con
taining a number of competitors, take the field, and stand between
two goals, placed at a distance of forty or fifty yards from each other.
The goal is usually made with two sticks, driven into the ground
about two or three feet apart.     The ball, which used formerly to be
made of a blown bladder, but which is now formed of india-rubber
and netted, is delivered in the midst of the ground, and the object of
each party is to drive it through the goal of their antagonists.    The
skill of the players is best displayed m attacking and defending the
goals. The worst part of this sport is the tendency which the players
have to kick each other's shins; and King James was so convinced of
the danger of  it,that he issued    "Decree," thus "From this coast
                                   v a

unless boys can refrain from shin-kicking.
                                         STOOL-BALL.
       This is an old English sport, mentioned by Gower and Chaucer,
and was at one period common to women as well as men.             In the
northern parts of England, particularly in Yorkshire, it is practised in
the following manner : — A stool being set upon the ground, one of
the players takes his place before              it,
                                       while his antagonist, standing at
  distance, tosses   ball, with the intention of striking the stool.
                              a                                        It

   the former player's business to prevent this,       breaking      by
                                                                     away       it
with the hand, reckoning one to the game for every stroke of the
ball    ; on the contrary,
            if,               should be missed
                                   it               the hand, and touch

the stool, the players change places.    The conqueror of the game                   is
he who strikes the ball most tnnes before      touches the stool.

                               NINE HOLES.
   Dig near a wall nine holes, of about six inches in diameter, and
three deep. Let each player have one of these, according to his
number, which must be determined by lot.          At about six yards from
the holes draw a line, and from this, as a fielding place, one player
pitches the ball into one of the holes.      The boy to whom this hole is
assigned immediately runs to      it,while all the other players run off in
different directions. The player snatches the ball from the hole, and
throws it  at one of the
                           " runners    ;"
                                         and    he hits him, the one so hit

he not hit him, the player who throws the ball loses       point, and bowls.

The player who nusses his aim at throwing the ball at his partners
a second time, becomes    a   " Tenner." If he loses the third hit, he    is
a  "Fifteener;"     ifthe fourth, he stands out, and can play no more.
When all the players are thus out, the last player remainmg in wins
the game, and he can compel each of the losers to stand with their
hands open against the wall, for him to throw at, and give what           is
called the " Brandy Ball." If the ball be         soft one, this conclusion

 10 feet from the wall, A; and two others are drawn on each side as
                  boundaries, B c. The instruments used in the play are
                  a ball of india-rubber and a racket-bat, that is, a bat
                 having a mesh-work of cord in its broadest part. It
                 has a long handle, and an oval bowl covered with wire.
                 The ball is hard, rebounding, small, and white. The
                 game may be played by any number of persons, but
                 is usually played by four boys, two on each side, who
                 toss up for innings. The method of play is as follows :
                 — The game may be played either single-handed or
                 with partners. When it is played with partners, the
                 players toss up for innings. The first player takes
                 the ball, and, making it rebound from the ground,
                 strikes it against the wall with his bat above the line on
                 the wall, and so that it may fall without the line
                 on the ground.     The other then strikes           it,
                                                                      and the
                 players continue to hit      against the wall, either before

                                                by           ball called
                                                                    a
" llarpastum," word probably derived from harntgo, to snatch or
                   a
take  byviolence. We cannot do better than describe the game in the
words of an old writer, Carew, who says
                                             " Hurling taketh its name
                                                      :
from hurling of the ball, and       of two sorts, — in the east part of
                                          is
Cornwall, to goals, and in the west, to the contrary. For hurling to
goals, there arc fifteen, twenty, or thirty players, more or less chosen
out on each side, who strip themselves to their slightest apparell, and
then join hands in ranke one against another; out of these rankes
they mateh themselves             by
                               payres, one embracing another, and so
pass away, every   of which  couple are especially to watch one another
during play. After this, they pitch two bushes in the ground, some
eight or ten feet asunder, and directly against (opposite) them, some
ten or twelve score paces off, other twain         like distances, which
                                                               in
they  term  goals,  when   some  indifferent person throweth up     ball,  a

the which whosoever can catch and carry through his adversaries'
gaole hath wonne the game ; but herein consisteth one of Hercules
his labours, for he that is once possessed of the ball hath his contrary
mate waiting at inches, and essaying to lay hold of him; the
other thrnsteth at him with his closed fist, to keep him off, which
they call butting.    According to the laws of the game, they must
h'urle man to man, and not two set upon one man at once.            The
hurler against the ball must not butt or handfast under the girdle ;
he who hath the ball must butt only at the other's breast, and deal no
fine ball, that      is,
                   he may not throw      to any of his mates standing
                                                    it

                                         BAT HURLING.
  In some parts of the country, bats are used to take up the ball,
and strike     it
              away.   The bat    flat on both sides, and curved and
                                           is
broad at the lower end.  Skilful players will catch the ball upon the
bat, poise    thereon, and then hurl
               it                        to    considerable distance.

Sometimes they will toss   up from the bat, and recover
                                    it                      again, till  it
a fit opportunity occurs of sending        the proper direction. In
                                                    it    in
other respects the laws of this game are similar to those of the game
described above.
                                          TRAP BALL.
     This game   so called from the trap used to elevate the ball when
                    is
it   to be stricken
     is                       by

                                                          is
played with the trap and ball, and we can trace          to the commence

played    is
           given  in  the  cut from   an  old  MS.  of  that date.  As now-
played, the trap     no longer
                         is     elevated,  but  set on  the  ground, and           is
generally made in the form of        shoe, the heel part being hollowed

   It  is usual in the present game of Trap Ball to place two bound
aries, at a given distance from the trap, between which it is necessary
for the ball to fall when struck by the batsman, for if it falls outside
of either, he gives up his bat and is out. He is also out if he strikes
the ball into the air, so that it is caught by an opposite player; and,
again, if the ball when returned by an adversary touches the trap, or
rests within one ball's length of it. Every stroke tells for one
towards the striker's game.
   There are some variations in the play of the game in different
counties.     In Essex and Suffolk, for instance, the game is played
with a cudgel instead of a bat, which would seem to be a preferable
weapon, as those who strike with it rarely miss their blow, but fre
quently strike it to an astonishing distance, no boundaries being set.
   The ball being stopped by one of the opposing party, the striker
forms his judgment of the anility of the person who is to throw it
back, and calls in consequence for any number of scores towards the
game that he thinks proper. It is then returned, and if it appears
to his antagonist to rest at a sufficient distance to justify the striker's
call, he obtains his number, but when a contrary opinion is held, a
measurement takes place, and if the scores demanded exceed in num
ber the length of the cudgel from the trap to the ball, he loses the
whole and is out ; while, on the other hand, if the lengths of the bat
are more than the scores called for, the matter terminates in the
striker's favour, and they are set up to his account.
                              CATCH BALL.
   This is very simple play. The ball is thrown into the air by one
player, the others standing round him. He calls out the name of the
player, for whom the ball is thrown.            If
                                           it be caught by the player
so called, before the ball reaches the ground twice, te scores a point ;
if any of the other players catch    it,
                                      they score  point, and the other
                                                         a
loses one.
                               ROUNDERS.
  This   is   a most excellent game, and very popular      some of our
                                                              in
English counties. It  is played with moderate-sized ball and
                                           a                       handa
bat, i. e.
         a  bat that can be held in one hand, and which       about two
                                                                  is
feet in length, smooth, and round.      Two parties play at the game,
and ought not to be less than five of side; and the first innings are
                                           a
decided  by  throwing up the ball, the party catching     being allowed
                                                             it
to go in first.
   In playing the game, five stones, or stakes (called bases), or          if
these be not convenient as many holes, may be made at about 16
yards apart, forming the five points of pentagon, as in the diagram.

At the centre of this figure    is   station called the feeder's place,
                                     a
being the spot at which one of the out party stands to give the ball
to the batsman, or to "feed" him, as       technically termed. The out
                                           it  is

                                 RACKETS.                              41
 party are distributed over the field, except the feeder, who takes his
 station at P to deliver the balls, while one of the in party takes the
 bat and places himself at Fig. 1, which is en
 closed within a circle, and called the Home, and
 where all the rest of the in party stand.     The
 feeder then says "Play," and delivers his ball to
 the batsman, who immediately strikes it as far as
 he can. As soon as he has done so, he drops
 his bat, and runs to as many of the stations as
 he can, but he must touch at all, or he will be
 out.   If while he is running to the second,
 or between any of the bases, the returned ball is sent up and
 strikes him, he is out, and the next of the in party takes up the bat.
 If  he is not struck while he runs, as soon as he reaches one of
 the stations the next of the in party takes up the bat, another ball is
given by the feeder, and he runs to the first, or as many other of the
stations as he can, the first batsman does the same, so as to go the
whole round of the bases to the home at No. 1. The in player is
also out if he tips the ball behind him, or if he misses strikmg it
when delivered.     The in players as they arrive at home take the oat
again till they are got out, according to the rules of the game just
given. When it happens that all are out but two, the best of the
two may, with the consent of the other, call for " three fair hits for
the rounder."     Standing at the home, the feeder then gives him in
succession three balls.     He may decline as many balls as he pleases
if they do not suit him, but if he strikes at the ball he is only allowed
to do so twice without running. On the delivery of the third ball, he
must run the entire course, touching with his bat at every one of the
five points. If, during his progress, he be touched by the ball, or it
be grounded at the home while ne is absent, he is declared out, and
the opposite side go in and take their places. If, on the contrary, he
reaches his home without being struck or the ball grounded, his side
go in again, and continue the game as before.      Should he miss the
ball when striking at it the third time, the rounder is lost. In the
play the feeder is allowed to make feint or pretence of throwing the
ball, in order to tempt a player to run from his base, so as to get a
chance of hitting him.      It is usual also for the out party to place
a player behind the home, so that when a batsman makes a tip on the
side of the home, to seize the ball and strike him out before he
reaches the first base.

    This game is not easily played without what is called a racket
ground, which consists of a large space of ground, a parallelogram, of
not less than fifty yards long, by twenty-five broad. Where such an
advantage presents itself, the game may be easily attempted.        Some
times the high dead wall    of a garden may be  made   into a racket wall,

  direct stroke when near the hole.       Another, formed of iron, instead
  of wood, is used for making a hit at a ball when very unfavourably
  placed, as in a rut, where the common club would be in danger of
  breaking. When a ball falls into a hole or rut, from which it is im
  possible to strike it out, the party is allowed, by a special agreement,
  m some clubs, to take it out with his hand, and throw it up in a line
  with the spot, which is accounted as one, and he then strikes from
  where it chances to rest, but, as already observed, this indulgence
  does not extend to every Golfing Society.
                                     HOCKEY.
                  This game is very simple, and easily played by two or
               more players.    It is best played in a by-road of moderate
               width. The aim of the players is to strike a ball, placed
               on the ground between them, over the bounds, which are
               generally made at about fifty yards' distance from each
               other, or twenty-five from the ball on either side.     The
               party belonging to the bounds over which the ball is
               driven, lose the game, and t)ie party that drive the bull
               over the side bound, such as the hedge or paling of the
               road, also lose the game.
                                   TIP CAT.
    Tip Cat, although not strictly a Ball game, ought to be noticed
 here.    It is a dangerous game, and should be played with great
 caution on the part of the players.      It is a rustic game well known,
 and generally goes by the name of Cat.         It is played with a cudgel
or bludgeon, resemblmg that used for Trap Ball. Its name is derived
from apiece of wood called a "Cat," of about six inches in length, and
an inch and half or two inches in diameter, diminished from the
middle to both the ends, being of the shape of a spindle or double
cone; by this contrivance the places of the trap and ball are at once
supplied, for when the cat is laid upon the ground, the player with
his stick tips it at one end by a smart stroke, which causes it to rise
in the air with a rotary motion, high enough for him to strike it as
it falls, in the same manner as he would a ball.
    There are various methods of playing the game of Cat. The first
is exceedingly simple, and consists in making a large ring upon the

                                 BATON.                              45
ground, in the middle of which the striker takes his station. His
Business is to beat the Cat over the ring; if he fails in so doing he is
out, and another player takes his place; if he is successful, he judges
with his eye the distance the Cat is driven from the centre of the ring,
and calls lor a number at pleasure to be scored for the game; if the
number demanded be found upon measurement to exceed the same
number of lengths of the bludgeon, he is out — on the contrary, if it
does not, he obtains his call.
   The second method of playing Cat is to make four, six, or eight
holes in the ground, in a circular direction, and as nearly as possible
at equal distances from each other, and at every hole is placed a
player with his bludgeon.    One of the opposite party who stands in
the field tosses the cat to the batsman who is nearest him, and,
every time the cat is struck, the players are obliged to change their
situations, and run once from one hole to another in succession.      If
the cat be driven to any very great distance, they continue to run in
the same order, and clann a score of one towards the game every time
they quit one hole and run to another.     But if the cat be stopped by
their opponents, and thrown across between any two of the holes
before the player, who has quitted one of them, can reach the other,
he is out.
                           NOBTHERN     SPELL.
   This game is played with a Trap and Ball, which is struck with a
bat or bludgeon at the pleasure of the players, but the latter is most
commonly used. The performance of this game does not require the
attendance of either 01 the parties in the field to catch or stop the
ball, for the contest between them is simply who shall strike it the
greatest distance in a given number of strokes; the length of each
stroke is measured before the ball is returned, by means }f a cord
made fast at one end near the Trap, the other being stretched into
the field by a person stationed there for that purpose, who adjusts it
to the ball wherever it may be.
   The cord is divided into yards, which are properly numbered upon
it in succession, so that the person at the bottom of the ground can
easily ascertain the distance of each stroke by the number of the
vards, which he calls to the players to place to their account, and the
ball is thrown back.
   Or, "Throwing Sticks."      This was a very popular game among
the Greeks, and was by them called Kyndalismos.           It was played
with short batons, and required considerable strength and quickness
of eye. With us the game is played in much the same manner as
the Greeks played it. A stick is fixed in a kind of cup or hole about
six inches over in a loose moist soil, and the players consist of the
Keeper and the Throwers.        The Keeper places on the top of the

 stick some article, such as an apple or orange, and the Throwers
 endeavour to knock it off, by throwmg at it with short thick sticks, or
batons; whoever succeeds in doing this claims the prize, whenever it
falls without the hole.      The Thrower will soon find in his play that
to hit the .stick is of little importance, as from the perpendicular line
 of gravity which the apple or orange will take in its descent, it is
 almost certain to fall into the hole.    The aim, therefore, should be to
 strike the object from the stick. This game is very common at
 " Fairs," and similar
                         places, and three sticks with articles upon them
 arc usually set up, but which offer no advantage to the throwers.
                             DICK.Y SHOW-LIGHT.
    This game can only be played at night, and in a large ground,
 which will be better suited to the purpose if there are plenty of trees.
 The game is a kind of nocturnal Hare and Hounds. One player pro-
•vides himself with a flint and steel, or with a dark lantern, and con
 ceals himself.    When the other players call out, he shows a light for
 a moment, and they endeavour to discover his hiding place.         A dark
 lantern is rather better than flint and steel, as although a boy cannot
 run so fast when encumbered with a lantern which must be held
 upright, he can often baffle his pursuers by suddenly throwing the
 glare in their faces when they are close upon him, and therebv ren
 dering their eyes unable to pierce the darkness for some seconds.
    MY young readers will in all probability remark that I have laid
but little stress on games with toys, and that comparatively few toys
have been mentioned.       I have done so intentionally, because the book
is written expressly for boys, and those, English boys. Now, an English
boy always likes a toy that will do something.       For example, he cares
not one farthing for all the elegant   imitations of  guns in the world, as
long as he can have his pea-shooter ; and the    walnut  stock, the glitter
ing decorations, and the burnished but useless barrel of the toy gun,
are nothing in his eyes, when compared with the plain tin barrel of his
beloved pea-shooter, which will throw a missile with rifle-like accuracy
of aim.
    The English boy must have something that is substantial and solid,
and will bear plenty of work ; therefore, the boy takes a peg-top that
he can spin, or a whip-top that he can beat, wliilc the humming-top
he disdains as "fudge.           Moreover, his toys must have another
 qualification, viz. that they require skill in the hands of those who
 use them.     He likes a hoop that he can race against a rival, a kite
 that he can match against another, a taw that he can pit against
 another boy's
                 " alley or " agate," and a ball which he can use at
 fives, rounders, egg-hat, or any of the thousand and one games in
 which the versatile sphere takes the principal part. It is a great

                         GAMES   WITH TOYS.                         47
mistake to fancy that young lads require many toys. A boy is indeed
to be pitied who cannot find amusement in a hoop or a top, and is
forced to seek recreation in a wooden drummer or a pasteboard
monkey.
   For these reasons,  I have mentioned but very few toys, looking
with contempt upon those innumerable fabrications that find their
place in the windows of toy-shops, and in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred are only purchased for the immediate gratification of spoilt
children, who unconsciously illustrate the real object of toys, by pull
ing them to pieces, and converting the fragments to unexpected uses.
I  should very much like to see the reception with which a hamper
                                                             I
full of modern toys would meet at a boy's school, although have not
the smallest doubt of the manner in which they would be greeted.
All the pasteboard donkeys with vibrating heads and ears, would be
set up as "cockshys," in company with the wash-leather elephant
and the lambswool rabbit, while the organs would probably be con
verted into mouse cages, and the tin soldiers offered up as victims to
the liquefying properties of flame.
   And, serve them right too !

                              INTRODUCTION.
   THE study of Gymnastics is of the utmost importance           to young
persons,  as its object is to call into exercise, and  to train to  perfec
tion, all the corporeal or bodily powers.      It is the education of the
limbs, joints, and muscles; and includes not only the systematic
training of these, but also the sciences of riding, driving, wrestling,
rowing, sailing, skating, swimming, &c.
   In the following gymnastic exercises, we have determined to intro
duce only those more simple and useful feats, which may be called
the "Alphabet of the Science," and all the individual and progressive
exercises are susceptible of being everywhere introduced.       They may

be performed in very small spaces, and require no particular pre
paration, expense, or place.  By attention to the directions, any
pupil between the age of twelve or sixteen may train and exercise
himself, and a number of other children younger than himself ; and
this excellent study may thus become a source of amusement and
delight.

     The first gymnasium   said to have been established at Sparta, and
                            is
some years afterwards at Athens.      In the former city they partook
of   rude military character
     a                           but among the Athenians, who were
                                     ;
always disposed to mingle the elements of the beautiful in whatever
they undertook, gymnastics were refined, and the Gymnasia became
temples of the Graces.  In each there was place called Palaestra,
                                                          a                               in
which wrestling, boxing, running, leaping, throwing the discus, and
other exercises of the kind, were taught. Gymnastics were after
wards divided into two principal branches — the fala-ttrie, taking its
name from the Palsestra, and the Orchestrie.      The former embraced
the whole class of athletic exercises   the latter dancing, and the art
                                                 ;
 of gesticulation.
    The Gymnasia were spacious edifices, surrounded              gardens and by
a   sacred grove.     Their principal parts were:         The Porticos, fur
                                                                        1.

in running.       10. The Balenca, or baths.       Behind the Xystos lay
the Stadium, which, as its name imports, was the eighth of             mile in        a
length;   and   in this were   performed   all sorts   of  exercises,  in the
presence   of large numbers   of persons, and  the  chiefs  of the state.
    To all these branches of gymnastics the Grecian youth applied
themselves with peculiar eagerness, and on quitting the schools
devoted to them a particular portion of their time, since they regarded
them as    apreparation for victory in the Olympic and other games,
and as the oest possible means for promoting health, and ripenmg the
physical powers; nor could anything be better adapted for those
whose heroism was liberty, and whose first great aim was to be good
citizens, and the defenders of their country.

they constituted a part of the exhibitions at festivals, were practised
only by a particular class trained for brutal entertainments, at which
large bets were laid by the spectators, as is still the custom on our
own racecourse; and when afl the acquisitions of the human intellect
were lost in the utter corruption of the Roman empire, and the
irruptions of wandering nations, the gymnastic art perished.

   The commencement of tournaments during the dark ages in some
degree revived athletic exercises, but the invention of gunpowder,
the use of the small sword, the rifle, and scientific tactics, by which
battles were gained more by skill than force, kept down the training
of the body for athletic feats. But in the last century, when men
broke loose from the yoke of authority, and education began to be
studied, it was found that physical education had been forgotten.

cises, principally confined to running, leaping, swimmmg, climbing,
and balancing ; and at the commencement of the present century a
German, of the name of Volker, established the first gymnasium in
London; while Captain Clias, a Swiss, established one m the Royal
Military Asylum; and since then many of the best schools and colleges
have a gymnasium attached to their establishments.
   It generally happens that the pupils of a gymnasium, after a time,
lose their interest m the exercises.      The reason of this appears to be
that little or no difference is made in the exercises of different ages,
and it is natural that an exercise repeated for years should become
wearisome.     Gymnastics, therefore, when they are taught, should be
divided into two courses.          In the first course we would include
walking and pedestrian excursions, elementary exercises of various
tests, running, leaping in height, in length, in depth, leaping with a
pole, in length and height, vaulting, balancing, exercises on the single
and parallel bars, climbing, throwmg, draggmg, pushing, lifting, car
rying, wrestling, jumping, — 1. with the hoop ; 2. with the rope, —
exercises with the dumb bells, various gymnastic feats or games; and,
lastly, swimming, skating, fencing, riding on horseback, rowing, &c.
   Gymnastic exercises may be begun by a boy of about eight years
of age, or may be commenced at any age ; but in all cases he should
begm gently, and proceed gradually, without any abrupt transitions.
They should be commenced oefore breakfast in the morning, or before
dinner, or supper ; but never immediately after meals ; and the pupil
should be very careful, after becoming heated by exercises, of draughts
or cold, and especially refrain from lying on the damp ground, or from
standing without his coat or other garments; and rigidly guard
against the dangerous practice of drinkmg cold water, which, in many
instances, has been known to produce immediate death.

 54                        EVERY    BOY'S  BOOK.
     In all gymnastic exercises, walking, running, and jumping, deserve
 the preference, because they are the most natural movements of man,
 and those which he has most frequent occasion to use. This exercise,
 within the reach of everybody, ought to be placed among the number
 of those which are direct conservators of health, and which have the
 ir.ost important beneficial effects upon our mental and moral economy.
 Walking provokes appetite, assists digestion, accelerates the circula
 tion, brmgs the fluids to the skin, strengthens the memory, and gives
 cheerfulness to the mind, and in fatigumg the limbs gives repose to
 the senses and the brain.
     It might be supposed that every one knows how to walk — not so,
 however; some persons crawl, some hobble, some shuffle along. Few
 have the graceful noble movement that ought to belong to progression,
 or, however well formed, preserve a really erect position, and an air
 of becoming confidence and dignity. To teach walking, that is to
 say, to teach young persons to walk properly, we should advise a class
 of them to unite, that they may be able to teach themselves, which
they may readily do if they follow the instructions given below.
     A company of boys being formed, the elder, or the one best adapted
to the task, should act as captain, and at the word of command,
 " Fall in," all the boys are to advance on the same line,
                                                              preserving
between each the distance of about an arm's length.        At the word,
 "Dress," each boy places his right hand on the left shoulder of the
next, extending his arm at full length, and turning his head to the
right. At the word,
                        " Attention," the arms fall down by the side,
and the head returns to the first position.     The captain should now
                                                       —
place his little regiment in the following manner :• 1. The head up.
 2. The shoulders back.      3. The body erect.     4. The stomach in.
5. The knees straight, the heels on the same line.          6. The toes
turned very slightly outwards. The captain now stands before his
men, and advancing his left foot, his knee straight, and his toe
inclined towards the ground, he counts one, two, placing his boot on
the ground, the toe before the heel; he then directs his pupils to obey
him, and to follow his motions, and says,
                                              " March," when each foot
is advanced simultaneously, till he gives the word, "Halt."          He
then makes them advance, wheel to the right and left, in slow time,
quick time, always observing the position of the body, and requiring
that they move all together.
                           THE TIP-TOE    MARCH.
    The object of this movement is preparatory to running and jumping.
The boys being in line, the word " On tip-toes," is given, each boy
places his hands on his sides, and waits for the word, "Hose;" when
they all gently raise themselves on their toes, joining their heels
together, and keeping the knees straight, and remain in this position

                                  LEAPING.                              55
 till the word,
                 " Rest," is given, when they fall back slightly on their
 heels, their hands at the same time falling down by their sides. Pro
 ceeding in this manner through a few courses, with such variety as
 may present themselves, the pupils will soon acquire a habit of
 graceful walking, of the highest importance to every one who studies
 a gentlemanly bearing.
                                  BUITNIHG.
    Running is both useful and natural    ; it favours the development of
 the chest, dilates the lungs, and, when moderate, is a highly salutary
 exercise.    To run fast and gracefully one should as it were graze the
 ground    with  the feet, by keeping the legs as straight as possible
 whilst moving them forward. During the course the upper part of
 the body is inclined a little forward, the arms are as it were glued
 to the sides, and turned in at the point of the hips, the hands
 shut, and the nails turned inwards. The faults in runnmg are swing
 ing the arms, raising the legs too high behind, taking too large strides,
bending the knees too much, and in not properly managing their
 wind- In all running exercises the young should begin gradually,
 and never run themselves out of breath at any time.           By careful
practice   a boy may  soon  acquire  the power   of running  a nule in ten
minutes ; this is called moderate running : in what is called prompt
 running, a thousand yards in two minutes is thought very good
work, and in quick running 600 yards in a minute is considered good.
 The first distance that children, from eight to ten years of age, may
be made to run, is about 200 yards; the second, for those more
 advanced, 300 yards ; and the third, for adults, 400 yards.
                                  JUMPING.
    Of all the corporeal exercises, jumping is one of the most useful;
and during our lives very many instances occur of a good jump having
done us essential service,       to jump with grace and assurance one
should always fall on the toes, takmg care especially to bend the
knees on the hips : the upper part of the body should be inclined
forwards, and the arms extended towards the ground. The hands
should serve to break the fall when jumping from a great height. In
       jumping from a height,
They may make progressive exercises in length by varying the distance
from time to time, and in height, by jumping from a flight of stairs
or steps, increasing a step at a time; they will soon be able to jump
in length three yards, and from a height six feet without injury.
                                  LEAPING.
    Leaping is somewhat different to what is called jumping, as the
object is to pass over an obstacle; and, as in jumping, it is of great

 56                        EVERY BOY'S       BOOK.
  importance to draw in the breath, while the hands should be shut, the
  arms pendent, to operate after the manner of a fly-wheel or pendulum.
  It may be practised by a leaping stand, which can be easily made of
  two sticks or stakes sunk in the ground, in which little catches are
  made at various distances, on which an even piece may be laid.
     The principal exercises in leaping are, 1. The high leap without a
  run. 2. The high leap with a run. 3. The long leap without a run.
  4. And the long leap with a run.          In the first of these the legs and
  feet are closed, the knees are bent till the calves nearly touch the
  thighs, and the arms are thrown in the direction of the leap, which
 increases the impulse.       This leap may be practised at the following
 progressive   heights,  —  eighteen   inches, twenty-four inches, thirty-two
 mches, forty-eight inches, which last is perhaps what few lads would
 attain.
     The high leap with a run. — The run should never exceed twelve
 paces, the distance between the point of springing and the obstacle
 to leap over to be about three-fifths the height of the obstacle from
 the ground; and in making it the leaper should go fairly and straightly
 over without veering to the side, and descend on the ball of the foot
 just beyond the toes. The heights that may be cleared by the run
 ning leap vary from three to six feet.             A good leaper of sixteen
 years   old ouglttt to  leap  four  feet  six inches, and an extraordinarily
 good leaper five feet.       Adults well trained will leap six, and some
 have been known to leap seven feet.               Stories are told of some
 famous leapers having cleared as much as sixteen feet.
                                        — The long leap may be marked out
                leaf without a run.
     The long
 from four to eight feet, according to the agility and strength of the
 leaper; and the object to be cleared, a small block of wood, which
 should in this kind of leap be never more than six inches high, placed
 midway.     In leaping, the body is bent forward, the feet are closed,
the arms first sway forward, then backwards, and then forwards at
the moment of takmg the leap.             In this kind of leap ten or twelve
feet is considered good work.
    The long leap with a ma. — The run should be on firm level ground.
The body should be inclined forward, and the run consist of about
twelve paces, a small block of wood as before being placed mid dis
tance in the leap. The spring should be principally on the right foot,
and the arms should be thrown forwards at the time of the leap.              In
descending,    if the  leap  be a very   long  one, the  leaper should descend
principally upon his toes; if the leap be not very long, he may descend
on the balls of the toes.       The leap is considered good if fifteen feet
be cleared, but twenty may be done by a good leaper, and one or two
individuals have fairly reached twenty-three feet.
    Faulting. — Vaulting is performed by springing over some stationary
body, such as a gate or bar, by the aid of the hands which bear upon
it. To perform    it, the vaulter may approach the bar with     a   slight run,
and placing his hands upon      it,   heave himself up and throw his legs

                          CUMDING THE ROPE.                                                37
obliquely over it. The legs should be kept close together: while the
body is in suspension over the bar, the right hand supports and
guides   it,
           while the left       free.
                               is       The vaulter may commence this
exercise with   abar or stile three feet high, and extend
                         a                                          gradually    it
to six feet.
   Leaping with a Pole. —     A great variety of leaps may be practised
with pole, which should
     a                         be  of   sufficient length, and shod at one
                                             a
end with iron, so as to take hold of the ground. The leaper should
grasp with his right hand that part of the pole             little below the
level of his head, and with his left that part of                    it a
                                                             just below the
level of his hips he should then make
                    ;                           slightarun, and,  placing the
pole on the ground, take      aspring forward, and swing himself slightly
round, so that when he alights the fall may be brought towards the
place from which he rose.
   The pole     also employed
               is                   both long and deep leaps. In both of
                                        in
these the mode    of holding the pole      similar; but in leaping from
                                                 is                                         a
height the pole should be grasped at the level of the knee, and then,
the leaper, with    aslight circular swing, should descend on the balls
of his toes.
                         TO CLIMB            UP A BOiRD.
   This should be firmly fixed at an angle of thirty degrees. The
climber should seize both sides with his hands, and place his feet in
the middle on the soles. This will teach him to hold firm          his                by
hands, and to cling with his feet.  As the climber gets used to this
exercise, the angle of the board may be increased.        The young
gymnast can ascend when the plank                     is
                                          perfectly perpendicular.                         A
pole may be mounted      in
                         the same manner.
                              CLIMBING THE POLE.
   The pole should be about nine inches in diameter, and firmly fixed
in the ground in    perpendicular position. In mounting, the pole
                    a                                                                       is
to be grasped firmly with both hands, the right above the left. The
legs are alternately to grasp the pole in the ascent      means of the      by
great toe, which is turned towards the pole. In descending, the
friction isto be thrown on the inner part of the thighs, and the hands
are left comparatively free.
   Climbing the mast     similar to climbing the pole, but
                         is                                   this exer          in

his arms, — the position of the legs    the same as for the pole.
                              CLIMBING THE HOPE.
  In   climbing the rope,      firmly grasped
                              it   is                           by
                                                   the hands, which are
placed   one above the other, and  so moved  alternately.  The heels are
crossed over the rope, which      held fast                by
                                               their pressure, the body
                                    by is
being supported prmcipally       them. In the sailors method the rope
passes from the hands round the inside of the thigh, under the knee-
joint, over the outside of the leg, and across the instep. But the

  58                           EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
  enterprising gymnast        will not be satisfied until he can climb the
  rope by   his hands    only, allowing the rest of bis body to hang freely
  suspended.
                                  CLIMBING TREES.
     In climbing trees both the hands and feet are to be used, but
  the climber should never forget that it is to the hands that he has to
  trust. He should carefully look upwards and select the branches
 for his hands, and the knobs and other excrescences of the trees for
 his feet. He should also mark the best openings for the advance of
 his body.      He should also be particularly cautious in laying hold of
 withered branches, or those that have suffered decay at their junction
 with the body of the tree, in consequence of the growth of moss, or
 through the effects of wet.             In descending, he should be more
 cautious than in ascending, and hold fast by his hands.              He should
 rarely slide down by a branch to the ground, as distances are very
 ill-calculated from the branches of a tree.
                               TEE (II \VT STRIDE.
     Various exercises may be performed with this excellent apparatus.
 It   is made in the following manner.            A very strong pole (a young
 tree is the best) is fixed firmly        into the ground, the hole in which it
 is placed not being less than six feet in depth.           That portion of the
 pole that is below the surface should be well charred, and the hole
 itself carefully paved.        From the ground to the top of the pole
 should be about      fourteen   to fifteen feet. An iron cap is then placed
 on the top, traversing freely on a pivot, and carrying four rings, on
which are fastened four ropes.             In the end of the ropes should be
 fastened cross bars of elm or ash about two feet in length.
     The apparatus being thus completed, the gymnasts are to hold the
 cross bars at arms' length, and run roundthe pole, bearing their
weight on the ropes, so that their hands, heads, and feet, are in the
same line with the rope.            Their feet will then gradually leave the
ground,    and   only  tonch  at  intervals.    After practising this from right
to left, do the same from left to right, until it is as easy to run one
way as the other.         Take care not to lose your balance, or you will
turn round, and grind yourselves on the ground very unpleasantly.
     This is but the beginning. The young gymnast should then run
round, keeping himself constantly rotatmg, which may be done by
the touch of tlie toe against the ground.             Another accomplishment
is to describe four circles in going round the pole, making the hands
the centre, and the feet the circumference.
     A pole should also be erected, about ten yards outside the range of
the feet, and to this should be fixed a number of pegs, which will
support a string passing from the central pole.                  Over this the
gymnasts should leap, performing the movement merely by the cen
trifugal force, and not by the sprmg of the feet. About ten feet is
considered a good height for a boy to attain, but a man can go higher.

                              PARALLEL   BARS.
                               PARALLEL BARS.
     These are two pieces of wood, from six to eight feet in length, and
about four inches square, the edges rounded. For lads, they are fixed
at about eighteen mches apart, and supported by two round stand
ards, firmly fixed in the ground, from three to four feet high, accord
ing to the stature of the boys.
     Balancing. — Being placed between the bars and in the centre, put
your hands right and left on the bars at the same time. After
                                                                  a little
jump upwards,         preserve
your equilibrium on both
wrists, the legs close; this
is called the first position.
Then communicate to your
body a gentle movement of
balancing from behind, forwards, and continue this for several times,
the body moving as it were npon a pivot. This should be practised
until the body swings freely backwards and forwards.
     To bring both Itys over. — From the first posi
 tion, after a little movement of balancing, bring
 both legs, close and at once, over one of the
 bars forwards, without touchmg it or moving
 your hands from the place. The same ought
 to be made backwards, from right to left.
     To jump out. — After having communicated to
 the body a movement of balance, the moment
 at which the legs are raised over the bars,
 jump backwards over the right without touchmg it with the feet or
 waist; then perform the same jump forwards. By the vaulting jump
 yon may easily come between the bars, and also bring your body over
 both without touching them otherwise than with your hands.
      To rise and sink down. — Being in equi
  librium in the middle of the bars, place
  the legs backwards, the heels close to
 the upper part of the thigh. From this
 position, come gently down, till the elbows
  nearly meet behmd the back, then rise up
  gently without any impulse or touching
  the ground with your feet.
      To kitt the bar behind the hands. — In
  the same position as before, bring the body gently down between the
  bars without touching the ground with your knees ; kiss the bar behind
  each hand alternately, and then rise up in the first position.
      Jumping on the Bars. — Keep the knees straight and jump along the
  bars backward and forward. Afterwards, do the same with the
  fingers turned inside.      These wfll be learned easier, if the young
  gymnast tries them first with bent knees.

 60                       EVERY    BOY'S   BOOK.
    Walking  on the  Bars. — :Walk on the hands to the end and back
again. In walking backwards, take care to keep the elbows straight,
or you will come down.      When this is done with ease, do the same,
only keep your fingers inside the bars.
        WALKINO  ON THE IIARU.
   L. — Sit on the ground between the bars; take hold of the bars
with your hands and raise your body still in the sitting position, and
stay there as long as you can. When that is learned, jump along the
bars in the same attitude. Keep your knees straight, and don't mind
if your limbs ache a little.
                                   The Arm Swing. — Rest the fore arms
                                on the bars, and swing.      When tired
                                of swinging, let the body hang straight,
                                and then rise on the hands.      Not easy
                                at first, but soon done with practice.
   The Roll. — Rest on the fore arms, swing backward, and turn com
pletely over, catching the bars under the arms. It looks difficult, but
is easy enough, only wanting a little nerve.
   The Janus.— -Sit astride the bars, having your hands rather behind.
Now raise the feet, swing through the bars, and come up astride on
the other side.    Your arms will then be twisted, and your face will
be looking in the opposite direction.     Swing boldly, or the shins will
be knocked against the bars.
   The Sausage. — Kneel on the bars. Stretch the hands as far forward
                               as possible, and hitch the toes over the
                               bars behind, at the same time stretching
                               them backwards as far as possible. Now
                               let the body sink between the bars,
                               being supported by the hands and in-
steps.   Now rise again. Difficult, but soon learnt.
                                                  To stand on a bar. — Sit
                                               astride one of the bars.
                                               Place the heel of the right
                                               foot on the bar, bitchmg
                                               the left instep under it.

of the left instep.   Take care of your balance.   This is a very use
ful   accomplishment,  and  may  possibly stand  the gymnast in good
stead.
    The Drop. — Stand on the bars with each foot over one of the posts.
Spring slightly into the air, put the feet together, and come down
stiff, catchuIg yourself by your hands. This should be done over the
posts, as the bars might be broken, were the weight of the faller to
come in the middle.
   The Spring. — Swing at one end, and with a sudden impulse leap to
the other on your hands.   Take care of the balance of the body, or
you  will come on your back between the bars.
   The Barber'i Curl. — Hang on one end of the bars as in the L.
Keep the knees straight, and turn over slowly, not letting the feet
come to the ground. Stay there while you count ten, and come back
the same way.
                        THE HORIZONTAL      BAB.
    Let two strong upright posts be firmly fastened into the ground,
about six feet apart, and let a wooden bar be strongly mortised into
their tops.    The bar should be made of white deal, about two inches
                               The bar must have no knot in          will

to reach   it  with the hands. The surface of the bar should be free
from all roughnesses, but not polished.
    The Gray. — The fingers should be hooked over the pole, keeping
the thumb on the same side as the fingers. Hang as long as possible,
first with both hands, then with each Band    by  turns. — Seep. 62.
    The Walk.  —  Hang  by   the hands, and walk   by them from one end
of the pole to the other, backwards and forwards. Do not slip. Do
it  first with both hands on the same side of the pole, afterwards with
a  hand   at each side. — Seep.   62.

   Breasting the Bar. — Hang by the hands, and draw up the body
slowly until the chest touches the bar. Practise this as often as
possible — knees straight.
                               Kicking t/ie Bar. — Hang by the hands

                            instep touches the pole. Do it several
                            times. Difficult at first, but soon learned.
                            Do not kick about, or jerk yourself up
                            ward, or you may strain yourself.

                            swing backwards and forwards. Practise
                            this until your heels are considerably
above your head each way.       After a while, let go of the pole as
you swmg back, and catch it again as you come down.          An mch or
two at first is enough, but do not be satisfied until the hands can
have a space of eight or ten inches between themselves and the bar.
   To nit on the Bar. — Hang by the hands, and pass one of your feet
through them, hitching your knee over the bar.        Then give a good

draw the other leg over, and do not tumble off.
   Circling the Bar. — Hang by the hands, and cnrl the body gently
over the oar.   If it is too difficult, stop for a minnte or two, try some
thing else, and after an interval try it again. It will be soon learned.
   The true Lover's Knot. — Grasp the bar ; pass the left knee through
the right arm, so as to let the knee rest in the elbow; pass the right
knee over the instep of the left foot ; let go with the left hand, and
with it grasp the right foot.        You will now be suspended by the
right hand, and will be packed up in a remarkably small space. Take
care of the right wrist, or you will spin round and twist off.

   CIRCLING THE BAH.
   Passing through the Arms. — Hang by the hands, and bring the feet
between them, permitting them to pass through until they can nearly
touch the ground ; now return in the same way. This cannot be done
properly without practising, as the muscles of the shoulder blades
must be capable of great relaxation, together with great power.

 tive against determination of the blood to the brain. First practise it
 with both legs over the pole ; then take off the left lee and hitch it
 OvBI the right instep; then learn to hang by one leg only, while you
 try to carry a weight in your hands. When you are perfect and con
                        fident, sit on the pole, and drop off backwards,
                        catching yourself oy the legs. This must be
                        done with a fall like a plummet, or the body will
                        swing, and probably unhitch the legs from the
                        pole.
                           The Arm chair. — Hang on the bar by the
                        arms just below the elbows, keeping the elbows
                        firmly pressed to the side. The hands should
                        be lower than the bar, to counteract the swing
                        of the body.

                        tiously, and permit the body to hang at full
                        length. The oest way to reach the bar again is
                        to seize one of your legs, and pull yourself up
                        by it.

briBiant finish, and not so difficult as it appears.
    2. Sit on the bar, place both hands on one side, and vault over.
    3. Sit astride, place both hands on the bar

both feet, at the same time springing upright ; run along the bar
and jump      off the end, or slide down the post       if it is too high to

the bar ; spring off backwards by the force of the arms.

                                                        round once, letting
the impetus hurl you forward.          Take care to cross the feet and come
down on the toes.

                                   THE HOSSE.
    There is not a more graceful or more interesting^ series of exercises
than those performed on the Wooden Horse.              They are very useful

                               THE HORSE.                            65
also, as they give exceeding pliancy to the limbs, and teach the gym
nast how to take advantage of the weight of each member.           They
have also the advantage of requiring some daring, and a spirited
lad will always surpass at these exercises.
   The horse is made of a great cylinder of wood mounted on four
legs, which are firmly fastened into the ground — their ends should be
charred as was directed for the Giant Stride.
   Nearer one end than the other a piece of stout rough leather is
firmly nailed, to represent the saddle, and two curved pieces of wood
bound the saddle and represent the pommels.           The hind pommel
should be nearly half an mch higher than the other.       They may be
covered   with leather also.
   On the off side of the horse a pit about a foot deep and four feet
square should be dug and filled with sawdust, while on the near side
thepaving should be either very fine gravel, or, if possible, sand.
   There should be several horses, adapted to the different sizes of
boys who are to practise on them. When a boy can place his chin on
a level with the saddle, he should change to a higher horse, as the top
of the saddle ought to be on a level with the nose of the gymnast.
   Mounting. — Stand by the horse, place one hand
on each pommel, spring up, so that the body is
supported by the hands, while the legs rest lightly
agamst the horse.      Keep the body upright and
knees    straight.   Down    and up agam several
times. Always come down on the toes.
   Now do the same thing ; but, in springing up,
throw out the right leg until it is nearly at right
angles with the oody, then the left. Afterwards
spread both legs as widely as possible.
   When this can be done with ease, spring up
as before, rest a moment, then throw the right leg easily over the
saddle, removing the right hand, and there you are.
   Dismounting. — Put the left hand on the fore pom
mel, right hand on the saddle, spring off and come to
the ground, keeping your right hand still on the
saddle.    Be sure in all these exercises to come
down on the toes.
   Sustaining the body. — 1. Spring up as in mount
ing, and throw the body away from the horse,
brmging it back again without coming to the
ground.
   2. Mo.unt, and putting both hands on the front
pommel, raise the body as high as you can. Don't
be afraid of going too high.
   3. Do the same, but swing the body backwards and forwards.
Hard work, but capital exercise.
   4. Do the same, and slap the soles of your shoes together.

   Swinging practice. — 1. Sit behmd the saddle, put the left hand on
the front pommel, and the right hand on the other.         Raise the body
and swing round the horse, seating yourself on his neck,               the

                                 their places, and swing back again in
                                 the same manner.

put both hands on the very top of the

has been well learned.
   Throw the somerset as before, only do not let go the hands.  You
will now be standing with your back to the horse,
the spine considerably bent, and your arms thrown
over your head. Wait so for a few seconds, and
then with a powerful effort throw yourself back
n^ain, so as to come on the ground on the same
side of the horse from which you started.          This
is really difficult, as it requires practice, strength,
and confidence, but it looks so well that it is
worth learning.        The writer of these few in
structions has often astonished the natives with
it, and has lately repeated it       after two years'
absence from any gymnasium.

feet swmg for half-an-hour, the sea mny toss its worst, for he will

                            Now, do not mean to say that merely sitting
on a board and getting swung by some one else is any great object :
far from it. But there are some very graceful exercises to be managed
on the swing.        Here are some: —
   1. The way to get into the swing is as follows : — Take one rope in
                          each hand, just above the seat ; walk backwards
                          until the ropes are freely stretched.      Now run
                          sharply forwards, letting the hands glide up the
                          ropes as far as possible, and the mstant that
                          you feel a check, grasp the rope tightly, and
                          spring into the seat standing.        When there,
                          work easily up by alternately bending and
                          straightening the knees.      (See 1.)
                             2. When m good swing, slip the feet off the
                          seat (which should not be more than four inches
                          wide) ; let the hands slide down the ropes, and
                          come down sitting. To recover the standing
          fig. 1.         position, reach upwards with the hands as high
as possible, and      draw  yourself upwards as the swing is going for
wards, when the seat       will  place itself exactly under your feet.
   3. Now for some feats.
                             Let the swing go very gently. Place both
                          hands at the level of the shoulders, and sud
                         denly extend them, keeping the arms straight.
                         Take care, as there will be a violent vibration,
                         and you will be shot out of the swing before
                         you know where you are. Practise it first
                         while the swing is still, but do not be satisfied
                         until you can do it while in strong swing, and
                         without closing the hands, merely letting the
                         palms rest against the ropes.      (See 2.)

             fig- 3-              rope well between the shoulder blades. Put
the inner centre of the left foot against the opposite rope, and fix the
right foot in the same manner agamst the left heel. Now let go both
hands, and lean well backwards, when you will be exactly balanced.
When you are secure with a quiet swing, practise it while the swing

is moving, until you can lie securely against the rope while you are
moving freely.      The balance is entirely kept by the shoulder blades
against the rope, and the arms must be folded in order to throw the
shoulder blades well back.      If the gymnast gets alarmed, and puts
his hands out to save himself, the rope slips off his back, and out he
goes.     (See 4.)
    While the swing is working, suddenly hang out at one side, sup
porting yourself by one hand on the rope, and one foot on the seat.
Practise this on both sides.     (See 5.)

    Seize   the left rope with both hands, press the feet firmly against
the ropes where they join the seat, and fall out forwards. The ropes
will now cross, and when the swing is in full operation, the curves
described are most elegant.        To recover the ordmary position, wait
until the swing is going backwards, and a powerful twist of the body
will uncross the ropes, when the right hand should take hold of the
right rope and steady the swing. (See 6.)
    When the swing is in motion, grasp the ropes as tight as possible,
 and raise the feet until they are high m air between the ropes.   Take
 care of the balance in the back swing, as, if the body is suffered to
bend backwards, the hands will hardly bear the strain.          Now slide
 slowly and carefully down the ropes until the head rests on the foot-
    To make a telling exit from the swing,
two ways may be adopted.         First way : —
 Get the swing into a firm, steady movement,
sit down, and bring both hands inside the
ropes; and just as the swing has passed
its centre, strike the seat away with the
hands and you will shoot forward several
yards. Take care to come down on the
 toes, and to lean well backwards as you
leave the swing, as the impetus will bring              Fif. 1.
 you upright as you touch the ground. (See 7.)

    The second method     is,to seat yourself in the same manner, and as
the swing crosses its centre backwards, lean well forwards and strike
                    away the seat.       You will then be hurled back-
                    wards, and        your balance

                    lean well forward, cross the feet, clasp the hands,
                    and come down on the toes.       (See 8.)
                       Great care must be taken to lean well backwards
                    if you shoot out forwards, and well forwards as you
                    shoot backwards, or in the one case you will come

So practise with gentle swings at first, and then increase.           I have
often done     with the swing at full speed, and

I     know one young man, who owes all his health, and probablv his
life, to gymnastic exercise. From his earliest childhood he was always
ailing, and through the whole of his childhood was never suffered to
sleep unwatched.       When he entered upon manhood, the childish
illness changed into annual fevers, which held their sway until he had
been for some time at one of the Universities.
    His medical attendant advised him to take regular exercise, and
recommended the study of gymnastics.         He rapidly nnproved in health
and strength, his fever has not attacked him for eight or nine years,
and he actually led the gymnasium for          whole year.

gymnasium as part of the regular school discipline, and take care
that the boys were exercised as carefully in their bodily as their
mental powers.
                            THROWING- THE JAVELIN.
    This play is very interesting, and gives strength to the arm, and
exactness to the eye. In playmg           it, a square target must be procured,
 made of thick wood,     about   four   feet  in diameter,
and on which should be marked concentral
 circles, the same as those of       a target in archery.
 This should be well supported behind                     by
                                                        two
 stout   back   pieces, resting   in   the ground,    so  as
 to prevent the target       from    being easily over
 turned. The circles may be several in number;
the centre should be black, and about six inches
in diameter, and count ten; the second circle
should be red, and should count five and the      ;
third should be light blue, and count three.                         ' .
                                                                    '/
The other parts of the target to count as may be
agreed. The javelins should consist of poles of ash or fir, about an incu
and half in diameter, and should be five feet six inches in length.
They should have       a  spike     inone end, which should be surrounded
with rim of iron the spike should be about two inches long, thick,
     a                ;

splitting   it.   The  game may    be   played        by

javelin,   by   holding    in
                           it  the   hollow     of
his hand, between the ball of the thumb *""™ f-)*

arm elevated so that his hand            is
                                         a  little
above his ear, the javelin being at the
same time nicely balanced with the
smaller fingers, touching           itso as to
direct its course;     it   then launched

themselves to avoid, parry, or catch a javelin thrown at them. When
they can do so with certainty, they may storm a fort.    The best fort
is a hedge with gaps. The players divide into two parties, one de
fending and the other attacking. Each player should be furnished
with three javelins at least, weU padded and nicely balanced. The
art of catching and returning a javelin is exceedingly useful in this
game.    We well remember an occasion when, on storming a fort, one
of our opponents, whose frame was larger than his soul, had prudently
retired mto the background until all our spears were exhausted, but,
on seeing us weaponless, he with great courage ran up to the hedge
and hurled his spear, as we were running forward to pick np a fallen
lance.  The moment he had thrown the javelin he ran away as fast as
he could, but was overtaken by his own weapon, which took him in
the rear, and toppled him over in beautiful style.     We have only
known one accident at this game, and that was caused by the impetu
osity of one of the garrison, who on seeing an enemy crawling up
through the gap, and finding himself without a spear, snatched up a
bow that was lying near, and made a thrust at him, which sent the
sharp horn tip of the bow through his under lip.

     The book.   — Fix
                    a book between the toes of the feet, and, by a jerk,
throw it over the head.
    The chalk Hue. — Draw a line with chalk on the floor; against this
place the toes of both feet; then kneel down, and rise up again
without leaving the line, or using the hands.
    Stepping through. — Take a small piece of cane about a foot long,
  '
and holding it between the hands, leap through it.      Afterwards take
a tobacco-pipe, and perform the same feat without breaking ; after
this, join the hands together, and leap through them, whicn is not
very difficult of accomplishment.
    Armless. — Lying upon the back with the arms across the chest, the
attempt must be made to rise on the feet again.
    Hop against the wall. — Stand with one toe close against the wall,
about two feet from the ground, and turn the other over      it,  without
removing the toe from the wall.
    Stoop   ifyou can. — One boy having placed his heels against the
wall, another must place near his toes   a shilling, and tell him he may
have   itif he can pick  itup. This he will find to be impossible for
him to do while his heels touch the wall, as there   is  no room for his
back to balance the other parts of his body.
    The spring from the wall. — Placing yourself at  a   proper distance
from the wall with your face opposite to     it, throw yourself forward
until you support yourself     by
                                one hand.   Then spring back into your
former position.    Begin this feat at  a short distance from the wall,
and increase the distance     by        The

  This feat is sometimes called the palm spring, but the palm has really
  nothing to do with it. The thumb sprmg is similar, but dangerous,
  and many have sprained their thumbs in attempting it.
    The long reach. — This is a somewhat difficult feat, and requires
 great caution iu its performance.     A line is chalked on the floor, at
 which the toes must be placed, and
 from which they are not to remove.
 The left hand is then to be thrown
 forward in a long reach until the body
 descends upon it, without any part
 touching the floor in its descent; the
 right hand is now to be stretched out as                ____
 far forward as possible, and with a piece                 rs>-
 of chalk a mark is made on the floor
 at its fullest extent, the body being sustained by the left hand
 during the operation.    The boy should now recover the upright posi
 tion on his legs, by springing back from the left hand without
 touching the floor in any way.     The length reached, and the perfec
 tion with which the body recovers itself, distinguishes the winner of
 the game.
    The stooping stretch. — In this feat a line is drawn on the floor, at
 which the outer edge of the left foot is
placed, and behind this, at a short distance,
the right heel. Taking a piece of chalk in
the left hand, the voungster passes it be
tween the legs, and under the bend of the
left knee, chalking the floor with it as far
forward as he can. He then recovers his
position without moving his feet from the
line at which they had been fixed.
    The chair feat. — Place three chairs in the situation indicated in
the cut, p. 74:, and lay down upon them, the head resting on one, the
heels upon another, and the lower part of the body on the third or
middle chair, which should be much lighter than the                Then,

by stiffening the body and limbs, and throwing up the chest into a
state of rigidity, it will not be difficult for a boy to remove the
middle chair, and to pass it quite over on the other side of him.
   The poker feat. — Take a common poker and hold it the lower end
                        downwards,     in the manner shown in the cut,
                        i.e. by the fingers, thumb, and ball of the palm.
                        Then, by the mere motion of the fingers and
                        thumb, and the fulcrum of the palm, work the
                        poker upwards till you raise it through the
                        whole length to that part of it which goes into
                        the fire.   This trick depends mainly upon the
                        strength of the muscles of the hand and fingers,
                        combined with a certain knack to be acquired by
                        practice.
                            The slick feat, or from hand to mouth. — Take
                        a piece of stick of the length cf the fore arm,
                        measuring from the elbow to the end of the
middle finger. Hold it in the hand horizontally before you, the knuckles
being down and the nails upwards, and the elbow being on a line with
the hand.    Then raise the left end of the stick from the breast to the
mouth,   without  any other movement of the hand than the arm at the
wrist. This is a difficult feat, but may be easily acquired by practice.

transform themselves into the order of "Waders," emulating
the long-legged storks and herons, and can cross over marshes and
flooded grounds without wetting their feet.      Stilts are easily made,

the hands.    A little practice will soon render a youth " easy on his

                              SKATING.
    SKATING is one of the finest gymnastic exercises, by which man,
as Klopstock says, "like the Homeric gods, strides with winged
feet over the sea transmuted into solid ground."       It is one of the
healthiest exercises, bringing the body into action by a great variety
of motions. The art is mentioned in the Edda, written eight hundred
years ago, in which the god Uller is represented as distinguished by
beauty, arrows, and skates.
    It 'isnot known at what period skating was introduced mto
England, but there are indications of    in the thirteenth century, for
                                        it
Fitz Stephen,   in  his History of London,   says, that  it was in that
time customary, when the ice was sufficiently strong,    for  the young
citizens of London to fasten the leg-bones of annnals under the

soles of the feet by tying them round the ancles, and then taking a
pole shod with iron into their hands, they pushed themselves
                                                                 forward
by  striking it against the ice,  and  moved  with a  celerity equal to a
bird flying through the air or an arrow from a cross-bow.
   Fitz Stephen describes another kind of diversion on the ice in these
words, which may be acceptable to the young reader.            He says :
"Others make a seat of ice as large as a nullstone, and having placed
one of their companions on             it,
                                 they draw him along, when     sometimes         it
happens     that moving in slippery places they all fall down together,
which     israre sport, provided no harm be engendered." Ibral men
tions, that in his time            was customary to use sledges, which being
                                  it
extended from the centre                by means of      a       strong rope, those who are
seated on them are moved round with great rapidity.

                                                 is
from Holland, and for many years skatmg has been exercised with
much elegance in England and in Scotland. Somehow or other, we
do not of late years have those severe frosts which enable the skater
to practise his art with vigour; but there                      is      nowa     skating club in
London who anticipate trips to Holland during the winter months,
where the art may be practised in all its perfection.
     In early days we were "prodigiously," as Dominie Sampson would
say, fond of the sport.             Our first attempts were made during the
great frost in 1813-14, which lasted eleven weeks, and during which
time there was         fair on the Thames, and skating was practised in
                         a                                                                        a
most delightful manner. One of the finest and most beautiful skateis
 of that period was Robert Fergusson,                   a      Scotchman, who had been            a

 works of old London Bridge, on the west side, he pitched his tent
 during the frost, inviting "gentlemen," who could afford                          a   "crown,"
                                                        "

                                          THE SKATE.
    There are various kinds of skates. Some, such as the Dutch skates,
 are very large and somewhat cumbersome, but very safe for those
 who skate with heavy loads on their shoulders, as they do in Holland,
 Denmark, and Russia.      In these the iron often projects above six
 inches from the wood, and 'curls up towards the shin-bone above

suow common to large expanses of ice.
   Some skates are what are called fluted, that      they have    is,

running along the centre of the iron, which are the best for begmners,
as they take    better hold of the ice. The plain skates have no such
                 a
groove,   and are  better adapted for those who have partially acquired
the art, as with them the utmost velocity and elegance of movement
may be performed.1
   The iron of the skate, which lies under the foot,     called its blade;
                                                                        is
this varies in different kinds of skates, and the practised professor of
skating will choose      ahigh or   low bladed skate, according to the
                                        a
nature of the ice; but the beginner should never use         skate whose     a
blade  is more than three quarters of an inch in depth and         quarter            a
of an inch in breadth, for when the blades are deeper than this, the
balance of the body         not so easily preserved, and the ancles are
                             is
liable to be sprained or twisted.

if  he can provide   himself with    " skateaboot,"  in which the skate
 and shoe are all of   piece, he will do better.
                         a                         Such skates were in
 vented in the great frost about seven years ago, but just as they were
 coming      the frost went out; but they can still be procured.

 all events, the skater should bear in mind that the skate must be
 fastened securely and firmly to the foot,               by
                                              being well fastened to the

called the elastic skate, or spring skate, in whick a spring is introduced
at the bottom of the foot, which keeps it fast in every part.        Skates
are also now made of gutta percha, and these are well worthy the
notice of the young skater.
                HOW TO START UPON THE INSIDE EDGE.
   Having risen to the perpendicular, the learner should first ascertain,
by moving his feet about on the ice, whether the skates are firmly
                             and comfortably fixed on his feet. He should
                             then walk a little on them, supporting him
                             self by a light pole about six leet in length,
                             having an iron spike at its end. Having in
                             this manner got a little used to the feel of
                             the skate on his foot, he should then en
                             deavour to throw away all fear and strike
                             out slowly with the right foot, leaning on
                             the inside edge of the skate, and making the
                             pressure greatest nt that part of the skate
                             opposite the ball of the great toe, at the
                             same time bending slightly forward.     When
the skate has moved about a yard forward in this manner, the left
foot should be brought to the ice in precisely similar manner.
The figure represents the skater starting and proceeding on the
inside edge.
                   MOVEMENT       ON  THE OUSIDE EDGE.
   Having practised on the inside edge for some days, to get used to
the skates, the learner may afterwards attempt the
                                                           " outside edge,"
which is nothing more than throwing themselves upon the outer edge
of the skate, and making the balance of the body bend to that side
which will necessarily enable them to form a semicircle.            In this
much assistance will be derived by placing a bag of lead shot in the
pocket next to the foot employed in making the outside stroke, which
will produce an artificial poise of the body at first very useful. At
the commencement of the outside stroke the knee of the employed
leg should be a little bent, and gradually brought to a rectilineal
position when the stroke is completed.         The best method of getting
to the "outside edge" is to form the circle inwards — say with the
right foot and with considerable force ; in the course of this, place the
left foot down in front of the right, and lean powerfully on the outside
of the left heel. A little practice and confidence in his balance will
enable the student to lift his right foot, and hang it behind while he
proceeds to cut outside with his left foot.         Let him then stop, and
 begin  the  inward  circle   with the  left foot, and slip down the outer
edge   of the right heel  in  the same way.
   The young skater has now learned to balance himself, and can
venture to strike out at once to the right, on the heel of the right

foot, keeping the left suspended behind, with its toe closely pointed
to the heel of the right. As he advances, the left 'must be brought
past the inside of the right with a slight jerk ; this slight jerk pro
duces an opposing balancmg motion of the body ; the right foot then
quickly poises, first on the outside of the heel, and then on the inside
of its toe, and by placing the left foot down before    it, and striking
outside to the left, giving at the same time      aslight push with the
inside of the right toe, he passes from right to left. Having learned
this much, the skater will proceed to change from left to right, and
then from right to left agam, without any trouble. To skate " out
side edge" properly, the toe of the suspended foot must be pointed
close to the ice behind the other, and kept there until the foot be
regained, when it   must be brought sharply round to the change. The
skater must keep himself erect,leaning most on the heel.
   This mode of skating having been acquired, an endless variety of
figures, devices, and modes of movement may be practised such as

alternately, with ease, grace, and deliberation. When he wishes to
stop, he should bring both his feet together, and stop gradually or;
he may stop suddenly,    by  pressing on the heels of his skates, taking
care not to throw his toes up too much, or he will cut

sents on the ice are small segments of very large circles; which
enables the skater to diverge but very sh'ghtly from the right line of
his course, and consequently accelerates his progress.

  The above motions combine the elements of skating, and having
acquired these, the learner may perform an infinite variety 'of move

                          LEABNINQ          TO SKATE.
   1. Let your dress fit closely, but at the same time be of sufficient
ease to ensure freedom of motion.        Neither skirts to coats nor full
trowsers should be worn.
   2. Let flannel be worn next the skin by the delicate, and an extra
under-garment by the robust. Let the chest be well defended against
the cold.    A piece of brown paper laid between the waistcoat and
shirt is one of the best chest protectors.
   3. Be careful in venturing upon the ice, unless it be sufficiently
strong to bear the weight of the number that flock to it ; and watch
for the increase of numbers, that you may retire before danger
ensues.
   4. Avoid rough and very smooth ice, and look carefully out for
obstructions thereon ; such as small twigs of trees, stones, or hob
                                                                       "
bles ;" as well as for rotten ice, cracks where the ice has risen higher
on one side than the other, or holes.         Should you suddenly come
upon rotten ice, do not stop, but pass over it as rapidly as possible.
Should you fall down upon        it,roll lengthwise towards the firmer
part, without attempting to stand or walk upon it.
    5. Should the skater fall into    hole, he should extend his pole or
                                       a
stick across  it, and hold on to       till assistance arrives should he

have no stick, he may extend his arms horizontally across the edges
of the ice, till rope can be thrown to him.

should immediately take off his skates, and,             able, run home as
                                                        if
quickly   as he can.  He   should  then  pull off  all his wet clothes, take

                              SWIMMING.
     SWIMMING is the most useful of all athletic accomplishments, as
by it human life is frequently saved which might have been sacri
ficed.   It is also useful in the development of muscular strength, as
well as highly beneficial to the nervous system, ;.nd repairs the vital
functions when falling into decline.    In places near the sea or rivers,
to know how to swim is an indispensable          accomplishment.     The
ancients, particularly Uie Greeks, held the art in such high estimation
as to bestow rewards    upon the most perfect swimmers.
     From the bttle fanuliarity with nnmersion in water which the
inhabitants of our over-grown towns and cities possess, a very great
proportion of the English population are but little acquainted with
the art of swimming, and with the mode in which they should con
duct themselves when risk of drowning presents itself. The English,
above all other persons, should be good swimmers, exposed as they
are by their insular situation, and commercial pursuits, and disposition
to visit other lands, so frequently to perils by sea ; yet, while most
towns on the Continent abound in baths and swimming-schools,           in
British towns thev are still few in number.
     Most animals have a natural aptitude for swimming, not found in
man; for they will at once swim when even first thrown into the

water; but it must be noticed that the motions they then employ
much more resemble their ordinary movements of progression than
those made use of by meu under similar circumstances.
   The children of many uncivilized nations, especially in warm cli
mates, frequent the water from an early age, and seem almost to
swim by instinct. The remarkable powers of endurance, agility, and
strength manifested while in the water by many individuals of savage
tribes are well known, — powers which often enable them to come off
victorious in struggles with some of the fiercest inhabitants of those
rivers and coasts.
    The art of swimming is by no means difficult of attainment, and
several authors have supplied directions to facilitate its acquisition.
Above all things, self-confidence (not rashness leading into danger) is
required; and, when this is possessed, all difficulty soon ceases. Dr.
Franklin, himself an expert swimmer, recommends that at first a
familiarity with the buoyant power of water should be gained; and to
acquire this, he directs the learner, after advancing mto the water
breast high, to turn round, so as to bring his face to the shore : he is
then to let an egg fall in the water, which, being white, will be seen
at the bottom.      His object must now be, by diving down with his
 eyes open, to reach and bring up the egg.         He wlll easily perceive
that there is no danger in this experiment, as the water gets shallower,
 of course, towards the shore, and because whenever he likes, by
 depressing his feet, he can raise his head again above water.
    The thing that will most strike beginners will be the great difficulty
 they experience in forcing themselves through the water to reach the
 egg, in consequence of the great resistance the water itself offers to
 their progress : and this is indeed the practical lesson derivable from
 the experiment; for the learner becomes aware of the very great
 sustainmg or supporting power of water, and hence has confidence.
 This sustaining power of water is shown under many circumstances :
 thus, a stone which on land requires two men to remove         it,
                                                                  might in
 water be easily carried  by  one.   A man might walk without harm on
 broken glass m deep water, because his weight        is supported    bythe
 water. This knowledge of fluid support constitutes the groundwork
 of all efforts in swimmmg, or  in  self-preservation from drowning.
     Should a    person accidentally fall into the water, provided he
 retained his presence of mind,  a   knowledge of the above facts would
 save him probably from
                              " watery           The body being but very

 slightly heavier than the volume of water       it  displaces, will, with
 a very slight motion of the hands under water, float. When the chest
is   thoroughly inflated with air,   it    lighter than water, and floats
                                          is
 naturally, having half the head above water; so that the person
  exposed to danger has only to turn upon his back,         order that that
                                                           in
 half, consisting of his face, with the mouth and nostrils, be above the
  water line.
     But to float thus upon the water, the greatest care must be taken
                                     02

84                        EVERY   BOY'S  BOOK.
not to elevate the arms or other parts above its surface ; and it is in
remembering this caution, that presence of mind in the time of
dangers confers so much benefit; tor, in the moment of terror, a per
son thrown into the water almost instinctively stretches out his
hands aloft to grasp at some object, thereby depriving himself of
a means of proceedmg which would frequently keep him afloat until
succour arrived. By elevating any part of the body in this way, we
remove it from the support afforded by the water, and thus render
sinking inevitable.
   Dr. Arnot, in allusion to this subject, says that many persons
are drowned who might be saved, for the following reasons : —
    1. From their believing that their constant exertions are necessary
to preserve the body from sinking, and their hence assuming the posi
tion of a swimmer, with the face downwards, in which the whole head
must be kept out of the water, in order to enable them to breathe ;
whereas, when lying on the back, only the face need be above
the water.
   2. From the groundless fear that 'vater entering by the ears may
drown as if it entered by the mouth or nose, and their employing
exertions to prevent this.
   3. The keeping of the hands above water, already alluded to.
   4. Neglectmg to take the opportunity of the intervals of the
waves passing over the head, to renew the air in their chest by an
inspiration.
    5. Their not knowing the importance of keeping the chest as full
of .air as possible, which has nearly the same effect as tying a bladder
full of air around the neck would nave.
   But although floating in water is sufficient to preserve from imme
diate danger, this will not alone enable us to swim.      To swim, does
not mean simply to float, but to progress ; and progression by this
means depends, like the flight of birds, upon the law m Mechanics of
 every action being followed by a corresponding reaction, but in an
opposite direction ; and thus, as the reaction of the air compressed by
the downward action of the bird's wing, causes it to mount aloft in
proportion to the force it communicates by that motion ; so the
backward stroke communicated by the simultaneous movement of the
hands and feet of the swimmer, causes his forward progress in the
water.     When once familiarised with the support derived from the
water itself, he soon learns to make the stroke correctly, especially if
aided and supported by some more experienced friend, — a far better
assistant than corks and bladders.
           PLACES AND TIMES FOB BATHING AND SWIMMING.
    It is presumed that most young lads who go to bathe will take the
 opportunity of learning to swim. In crowded cities there are but
 few places in which the youngster can learn the art; but in the

                                SWIMMING.                              85
country there are many rivers, ponds, canals, or lakes, where both
bathing and swimming may be indulged in without annoyance.            The
best kmd of place for bathing is on a shelving gravelly shore, on which
the water gradually deepens, and where no awkward sweep of current
may take the bather oft his legs.      The spot should also be free from
holes, weeds, and hard stones ; and a muddy bottom is to be avoided
by all means.     Should the banks of such a spot be shaded by a few
trees, and should there be close by an open space for a run on the
grass after the bathe, so much the better; and the young learner will
then have the chief inducement to venture the sudden dip or head
long plunge.
    The best time of the day for bathing or swimming is either before
breakfast, between the hours of six and eight in the summer-time, or
between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon.       Delicate persons
should not bathe early in the morning ; and it would be always well
to munch a biscuit before early bathing at all times.     No one should
ever think   of  entering  the water  on a full stomach,  or  immediately
after dinner, and never when over-heated and exhausted by fatigue.
He should also avoid entering it when cold, or with a headache.
Before bathing, it is best to take a moderate walk of about a mile,
and, while the system is in a glow, to undress quickly and plunge in.
It  is bad to walk till you get hot, then to sit down and cool, and
afterwards to enter the water ; many have lost their lives by this. It
ia also very wrong to enter the water during rain, as the clothes are
often wetted or damp, which gives the bather cold.
                          ENTERING THE WATER.
    Having stripped the body, the bather should select the best place
on the bank lor going down to the stream; and then, proceeding
cautiously but quickly, wade up to his breasts, turn his head to the
shore, and dip.     He then technically, as the boys say, gets his pinch
over. Should he not be man enough to proceed in this way, he
should, as soon as he gets his feet wet, splash some water over his
head, and go into the water more gradually, and try the rapid rush
and dip when he gets bolder. He must not attempt to swim or strike
ont till he can master the feat of going into the water up to his arm
pits, and till he feels himself confident and void of timidity.
                            AIDS TO SWIMMING.
    Many aids have been used for the benefit of voung swimmers:
corks and bladders fastened under the arms are the common ones ;
but they offer dangerous temptations for bathers to go out of their
depth, and then should cramp, cold, or any other accident occur, the
event may be fatal.      Besides, these aids often slip about from one
place   to the   other.  We remember, in our                 days, of the
 " corks" slipping to the hips, and of seeing ayounger
                                                    young friend, now an
 old man, suspended in the water with his head downwards; while

86                           EVERY   BOY'S BOOK.
collapsing of bladders and of air-jackets is by no means uncommon.
The best aid to a youn<* swimmer is a judicious friend, himself a good
swimmer, who will hold up his head, when he strikes off, by the
                                                                   " tip
of the finger to the tip of the chin," and who at the same time will
show him now to strike off, and how to manage his hands and feet.
It is not a bad plan to put out a spar from a boat, to which a rope is
attached, which the young learner may make use of by affixing it to
a belt round his body under his arms, which will afford him support
while he learns to strike his legs in the water. The rope may also be
held in the hand of a friend, by the side of the boat, and the learner
may strike off hands and feet as the boat proceeds.       The plank is
a dangerous aid, from its tendency to slip about, and to take the
swimmer out of his depth ; and, although it has many advantages, is
very unsafe.   The safest plan of all    is,
                                          as we have before stated, for
the learner to advance gradually up to his arm-pits in the water, and
then, turning about, to strike slowly out towards the shore, taking
care to keep his legs well up from the bottom. Rigid perseverance in
this course will    in  very short time enable the youngster to feel
                         a
himself afloat, and moving at " all fours," — delight equal to that
                                                   a
experienced    bythe child who first feels that he can walk from chair
to chair.
                     STRIKING OFP AND SWIMMING.
   In striking off, the learner, having turned himself to the shore, as
before recommended, should fall towards the water gently, keeping
his head and neck perfectly upright, his breast advancing forward, his
chest inflated; then, withdrawmg the legs from the bottom, and
stretching them out, strike the arms fonvard     unison with the legs.
                                                   in
The back can scarcely be too much hollowed, or the head too much
thrown back,   as those who do otherwise will swim with their feet too
near the surface, instead of allowing them to be about  a foot-and-half
deep in the water. The hands should be placed just     in  front of the
breast, the fingers pointing forward and kept close together, with the

                                SWIMMING.                             87
thumbs to the edge of the fore-fingers: the hands must be made
rather concave on the inside, though not so much as to diminish the
size.  In the stroke of the hands, they should be carried forward to
the utmost extent, taking care that they do not touch the surface of
the water ; they should next be swept to the side, at a distance from,
but as low as, the hips ; and should then be drawn up again, by bring
ing the arms towards the side, bending the elbows upwards and the
wrists downwards, so as to let the hands hang down while the arms
are raising them to the first attitude.
                      HOW TO MANAGE       THE LEGS.
   The legs, which should be moved alternately with the hands, must
be drawn up with the knees inwards, and the soles of the feet inclined
outwards ; and they should then be thrown backwards, as widely apart
from each other as possible.     These motions of the hands and legs
may   be practised  out  of the  water; and whilst exercising the legs,
which can only be done one at a time, the learner may rest one hand
on the back of a chair to steady himself, while he moves the opposite
leg. When in the water, the learner must take care to draw m his
breath at the instant that his hands, descending to his hips, cause his .
head to rise above the surface of the water ; and he should exhale
his breath at the moment his body is propelled forward through the
action of the legs    If  he does not attend precisely to these rules, he
must invariably have a downward motion, and, as the boys say, swim
furthest where it is deepest.
                         PLUNGING   AND DIVING.
   There are two kinds of plunging ; that belonging to shallow, and
that belonging to deep water. In shallow-water plunging, the learner
should fling himself as far forward as possible into the stream at
a very oblique angle; and when he touches the water, he should raise
his head, keep hia back hollow, and stretch his hands forward. In
the deep-water plunge, his body is to descend at a greater angle ; his

 88                        EVERY   BOY'S  BOOK.
 arms are to be stretched out, his hands closed and pointed, and his
 body bent, so that his nose almost touches his toes.
   Diving is one of the greatest amusements       connected with swim
ming.    There are many kmds; the two most common and easiest and
necessary modes of gomg below the surface, are —
                      1. The feet-foremost jump.
                      2. The head-foremost jump.
   In the first, the legs, arms, and head are to be kept perfectly rigid
and stiff.   The pupil must not allow fear, or the strange sensation
felt in the bowels in leaping from considerable heights, to induce him
to spread the arms or legs, or to bend his body.
   In the second mode, or head-foremost plunge, —which is the
safest mode for persons who are heavily built about the chest and
shoulders, if they have to enter the water from heights, — the head is
drawn down upon the chest, the arms stretched forward, and hands
closed to a point ; and as soon as the swimmer feels that he has left
the bank, his knees, which till then were bent, are to be stiffened.
The diver must avoid striking on the belly — the general consequence
of fear; and turning over so as to come down on his back or side — the
consequence of pushing with the feet. When he has gone as deep as
he wishes, the arms are to be raised and pressed downwards.
               '        SWIMMING UNDER WATER.
   When under the water, the swimmer may either move in the usual
way, or keep his hands stretched before hnn, which will enable him
to cut the water more easily, and greatly relieve his chest.      If he
observes that he approaches too near the surface of the water, he
must press the palms of his hands upwards. If he wishes to dive to
the bottom, he must turn the palms of his hands upwards, striking
with them repeatedly and rapidly whilst the feet are reposing ; and
when he has obtained a perpendicular position, he should stretch out
his hands like feelers, and make the usual movement with his feet,

then he will descend with great rapidity to the bottom.      It is well to
accustom the eyes to open themselves under the water, at least in
those beds of water that admit the light, as it will enable the swimmer
to ascertain the depth of water he is in.
                            SWIMMING   ON      THE SIDE.
   In this, the body is turned either on the left or right side, while
the feet perform their usual motions. The ai-m                      the

shoulder stretches itself out quickly, at the same tune that the feet
are striking.   The other arm strikes at the same time with the impel
ling of the feet. The hand of the latter arm begins its stroke on
a level with the head. While the hand is again brought forward in a
flat position, and the feet are contracted, the stretched-out hand             is,
while working, drawn back towards the breast, but not so much
impelling as sustaining. As swimming on the side presents to the
water    asmaller surface than on the waist, when rapidity    required,

the breast may be distended and the circumference            of the body
augmented.     In order not to sink while in the act of taking breath,
which the greater specific weight of the body would effect, the breath
must be quickly expelled, and as quickly drawn in again, and then
retained as long as possible ; for, as the back is in a flat position, the
sinking, on account of the resistance of the water, does not take
place so rapidly but the quick respiration will restore the equilibrium
before the water reaches the nose.
                           TREADING    WATER.
   This is  a perpendicular position of the swimmer, and is of great
use to enable him to save a person from drowning.        It is in general
thought to be extremely difficult, but it is very easy. There are two
ways of performing the action : in the first the hands are compressed
against the hips, and the feet describe their usual circle ; the other
mode consists in not contracting both legs at the same time, but
one after the other, so that while the one remains contracted the
other describes a circle. In this mode, however, the legs must not
be stretched out, but the thighs are placed in a distended position,
and curved as if in a half -sitting posture.
                               THE FLING.
   The swimmer lays himself flat upon his waist, draws his feet as
close as possible  under the body, stretches his hands forwards, and,
with both feet and hands beating the water violently at the same time,
raises himself out of the water.     In this manner one may succeed in

throwing oneself out of the water as high as the hips. This exer
cise is very useful, for saving oneself hy catching a rope or any
other object that hangs from above the surface of the water, or from
any perpendicular height.
                           SWIMMING     ON   THE BACK.
   In this the swimmer turns upon his back in the water by the com
bined motion of the arm and leg, and extending his body, his head
being in a line with      so that the back and upper part of the head
                           it,
may   be  immersed, while  the face and breast are out of the water.
The hands should be placed on the thighs straight down, and the legs
moved as in forward swimming, taking                 care that the knees do not
rise above the surface in strikmg them              out.   Sometimes the hands
are used after the motion of       awing or          fan,by  which    slight pro
                                                                      a
gression      also
             is    made   at the  same tune         that the surface of the body
is well lifted out of the  water.
                                 THRUSTISG.
  In   the thrust the swimmer lies horizontally upon his waist, and
makes the common motions         inswimming. He then simply stretches
one arm forwards, as in swimming on the side, but remains lying upon
the waist, and, in widely described circle, he carries the other hand,
                      a
which   isworking under the breast, towards the hip.        As soon as the
arm has completed this motion,           it lifted from the water in
                                               is                                   a
stretched position, and thrown forward in the greatest horizontal
level, and is then sunk with the hand flat into the water while the      ;
swimmer thus stretches forth the arm, he, with the other hand
stretched as wide as possible, describes     small circle in order to sus

circle rapidly to the hip, lifts the arm out of tiie water, and thrusts            it

   In the  performance   of this the arm is thrust forwards, backwards,
and again forwards without dipping into the water ; in the meantime
the strctehed-ibrth arm describes two circles before it begins the
larger one.
                          TO SWTJt  LIKE A   DOG.
   In this motion each hand and foot is used alternately as a dog uses
them when swimming, as the term implies. The hands are alternately
drawn towards the chin in a compressed form, and then expanded
and slightly hollowed, with fingers close, and as they strike the water
the feet are likewise drawn towards the belly, and struck backwards
with a kind of kick. This mode of swimming is of use to relieve
the swimmer from time to time when going a distance.
                                THE MILL.
   The swimmer lays himself on his back and contracts himself so
that the knees are brought almost to the chin, and while one of the
hands keeps the equilibrium by describing circles, the other continues
working.     Thus the body is kept turning round more or less rapidly.
               THE WHEEL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.
   In  the  forward wheel the hands are put as far backwards as
possible,  and   so pressed against the water that the head is impelled
under the    surface, and the feet, by a pressure of the hands in a con
trary direction, are rapidly flung above the head, which in this manner
is rapidly brought again to the surface.
   In the backward wheel the swimmer lies upon his back, he con
tracts himself, the hands, stretched forward as far as possible, describe
rapidly small circles, the feet rise, and as the point of equilibrium
has been brought as near as possible to the feet, the head sinks and
the feet are thrown over.

                       TO  SWIM WITH ONE HAND.
    The learner to do this swims on one side, keeps his feet somewhat
deeply sunk, while the arm which in the meantime ought to work is
kept ouiet — and might even be taken out of the water.      It is a good
practice of strength to carry, first under and then over the water, a
weight of four or eight pounds.
                      HAND OVER HAND SWIMMING.
    In this process, the right hand is lifted ont of the water from be
hind, swung forwards through the air with a kind of circular sweep
to the extent of its reach forward, then dropped into the water edge
ways, and immediately turned, with the
paun a little hollowed, downwards, the
body being at the same time thrown a
little on one side, and the right leg
struck out backwards to its full extent.
The hand descends towards the thigh,
and then passes upwards through the
water in a kind of curve towards the
surface.    The left hand and leg perform
a similar movement alternately with the
right, and the measure of progression
attained by these combined similar move
ments is very considerable.
                 BALANCING.
    When the swimmer has obtained ease
and confidence in the water, he will
find many things easy which before he
deemed nnpossible.      Balancing is one of
these. To perform it he has only, when
out of his depth, to fall gently back with
his chin elevated to a line passing exactly

94                         EVERY     BOY S BOOK.
through the centre of his body from the chin to the toes, then,
folding his arms and remaining perfectly motionless, he may suspend
himself perpendicularly: but   he should extend his arms backwards,
                               it'
and pass them gradually beyond his head, his toes, tips of his knees,
abdomen, and part of his chest, with the whole of his face will appear,
and he will be balanced and float horizontally without the slightest
motion.
                               THE CRAMP.
    The cramp generally proceeds from acidity of the bowels, arising
from bad state of the stomach, or from the effects of the cold water
         a
on the muscular system.        Some persons are very subject to    it  on
slight   occasions, and   such persons  will  do well never  to go out  of
their depth.     But should   a  tolerable swimmer be seized with the
cramp, he should not be frightened, but the moment the cramp       is felt
in  the foot or leg, strike out that foot or leg with the heel elongated,
i   idthe toes drawn upwards towards the shin-bone, never minding any
little pain may occasion, as he need not fear breaking bone, muscle,
             it                                          a
or tendon.      Should this not succeed, he should throw himself on his
back, and float quietly, and paddle himself gently to the shore.       He
may also swim with his hands like        a   dog, and practise any of the
motions of the upper part of the body for keepmg his head above
water till assistance arrives.
                           SAVING FROM DANGER.
   Above all things the good swimmer should be anxious to save life,
and to rescue those who are in danger, without himself becoming
the victim, as  often happens. The following rules are highly impor
                  it
tant to be observed.      The swimmer must avoid approaching the
drowning person    in front, in order that he may not Be grasped        by
him;  for whatever    drowning person seizes, he holds with convulsive
                       a
force, and   it  no easy matter to get disentangled from his grasp
                  is                                                    ;
therefore he should seize him from behind, and let go of him nnme

diately if the other turns towards him. His best way is to impel him
before  him to the shore, or to draw him behind ; if the space to be
passed be too great, he should seize him by the foot and drag him,
turning him on his back.     Ifthe drowning person should seize him,
there is no alternative for the swimmer than to drop him at once to
the bottom of the water, and there to wrestle with his antagonist; the
drowning man, by a kmd of instinct to regain the surface, when
drawn down to the bottom, usually quits his prey, particularly if the
diver attacks him there with all his power.
   For two swimmers the labour is easier, because they can mutually
relieve each other.   If the drowning person has still some presence
of mind remaining, they will then seize him one under one arm, and the
other under the other, and without any great effort in treading water,
bring him along with his head above water, while they enjoin him to
keep himself stretched out and as much as possible without motion.
                   SPORTS   AND PEATS   IN SWIMMISG.
   1. The Float. — In this sport one swimmer lays himself horizontally
on the back, with the feet stretched out, the Lands pressed close to
the body, and the head raised forward. The other swimmer takes
hold of him by the extremity of the feet, and, swimming with one
hand, impels him forward.    The first remains motionless.
   2. The   Plank. — One swimmer lays himself horizontally   as before,
another lays hold of him with both his hands, immediately above the
ancle, and pulls him obliquely into the water, while he extends himself
and impels himself forward ; thus both the swimmers drop rapidly
the one over the other.
   3. The Pickaback Spring. — One swimmer treads the water, the
other swims ntar him behind, places his hands upon the shoulders of
the first, and presses him down.    He then leaves his hold, and puts
his feet upon   his shoulders, and, flinging himself out of the water,
pushes the first towards the bottom. Now he treads water, and the
first performs the part of the second, and so on.
   4. The Shove.— -Two swimmers place themselves horizontally on
their backs, the legs are strongly extended, and the soles of the feet
bear against each other; each impels forward with all his power, and
he who succeeds in pushing back the other is the conqueror.
   5. The Wrestle. — Two swimmers place themselves opposite to each
other, tread water and hold their right hands in the air; the question
is, who shall first force his opponent under the water      by pressure.
Only the head of the adversary    is  to be touched, and that only    by
pressure.
              BEBNARDl's SYSTEM   OP    UPRIGHT SWIMMING.
  This system has been introduced into many of the naval and
military colleges on the Continent, and has for its distinguishing
characteristic the swimming in an upright position. The first object

 96                        EVERY    BOY'S BOOK.
is to teach the pupil how to float in an upright posture. He is taught
the use of his legs and arms for balancing the body in water, and
then to imitate as much as possible the movement of the limbs npon
land.   He then pays great attention to the movements of the head,
the smallest inclmation of which on either side instantly operates on
the whole body.     He next learns the method of using his arms and
legs ; and for this purpose is directed to stretch his arms laterally on
each side, and then, by placing one foot forward and the other back
ward, he is enabled to float easily and progress slowly.      The same
circular sweep of the hands and the action of the legs are next prac
tised, and the feet should be struck downwards and a little forwards,
when the movement of the arms is the reverse of the old methods
of swimming.      The young swimmer who has gone through the
various courses laid down by us, will easily comprehend the prmciple
of Bernardi's system, and as easily carry it out if he will take the
trouble. It is much less fatiguing than the old plan, and can be
carried on for a longer period, and is of invaluable service to troops
who may have to cross rivers or dykes, and to all who may be ex
posed to the various accidents of flood and field.
                    THE PSUSSIAN     SYSTEM OF FFUEL.
   The best of all methods for teaching swimming is that originally
introduced by General Pfuel into the Prussian swimming-schools. By
this method a person may be made a very good swimmer in a very
short time.   The apparatus for teaching consists of a hempen girdle
five inches in width, of a rope from five to six fathoms in length, of
a pole eight feet long, and a horizontal rail fixed about three-and-a-
half feet above the platform, on which the teacher stands, to rest the
pole on.
    The depth of the water in the place chosen for swimming should, if
possible,   be not less than eight feet, and the clearest and calmest
 water should be selected.       The pupil wears drawers, fastened by
 a band above the hips and covering about half the thighs. He is now
 placed near the horizontal rail, his hands resting upon        it, while the
teacher shows him the motion which he will have to make with his
legs in the water.      This he does    by   guiding the motion of one leg
while the pupil rest*, nu the other.          This motion we shall explain
presently.
    The swimming girdle, about five inches wide,      is  now placed round
the pupil's breast, so that its upper edge rests on the chest, without
gettmg tight. The teacher takes the rope, which            isfastened to the
ring of the girdle,   in  his hand,  and  directs the pupil to  leap into the
water, keepmg the legs straight and close together, and the arms
close to the body, and, what   is   very important, to breathe out through
the nose as soon as his head rises above the water, instead of breath
ing in first, as every man naturally does after suspension of breath.
                                                  a
The object of this  is  to prevent the water from gettmg into the throat,

                               SWIMMING.                              97
which produces an unpleasant feeling of choking and headache. This
expiration soon becomes perfectly natural to the swimmers.
   The pupil is next invited to leap. He is drawn up immediately by
the rope, pulled to the ladder, and allowed to gain confidence
gradually. The rope is now fastened by a noose to the end of the pole,
the other end of it being kept in the hand of the teacher ; the pole is
rested on the horizontalrail, and the pupil stretches himself horizon
tally on the water, where he remains, supported by the pole. Next
the arms are extended stiffly forward, the hands clasped, the chin
touches the water; the legs are also stiffly stretched out, the heels
being together, the feet turned out, and the toes drawn up.          This
horizontal position is important, and must be executed correctly. No
limb is permitted to be relaxed.
   The movement of the limbs is now taught; that of the legs is
taught first. The teacher first says, loudly and slowly, " One;" when
the legs are slowly drawn under the body; at the same time the kneee
are   separated  to the greatest   possible distance,  the spine is bent
downwards, and the toe kept outwards.            The teacher then says
briskly, "Two;" upon which the legs arc stiffly stretched out with a
moderate degree of quickness, while the heels are separated, and the
legs describe the widest possible angle, the toes being contracted and
kept outwards. The teacher then says quickly, "Three;" upon which
the legs, with the knees held stiffly, are quickly brought together,
and thus the original position is agam obtained.
   The point at which the motions " two" and " three" join are the
 most important, because it is the object to receive as large and com
 pact a wedge of water between the legs as possible; so that when the
legs are brought together their action upon this wedge may urge the
 body forward. In ordinary cases of swimming, the hands are not used
 to propel, but merely to assist in keeping on the surface. By degrees,
 therefore, " two" and " three" are counted in quick succession, and
 the pupil is taught to extend the legs as widely as possible.      After
 some tnne, what was done under the heads
                                                  " two" and " three" is
 done when "two" is called out. When the teacher sees that the
 pupil is able to propel himself with ease, which he frequently acquires
 the power of doing in the first lesson, and that he performs the
 motions already mentioned with regularity, he teaches the motions of
 the hands, which must not be allowed to sink, as they are much disi-
 posed to do while the motion of the legs is practised.
    The motion of the hands consists of two parts. When the teacher
       " One," the hands, which were held with the
 says                                                 palms together, are
 opened, laid horizontally an inch or two under water, and the arms are
 extended till they form an angle of 90° ; then the elbow is bent, and
 the hands are brought up to the chin, having described an arch down
 ward and upward ; the lower part of the thumb touches the ehin, the
                                                    "

 quickly stretched forward, and thus the original horizontal position is

 regained.    The legs remain stiffly extended during the motion of the
 hands.    If the motion of the hands is carefully and correctly per
formed, the legs and arms are moved together ; so that while the
                " One," the pupil
teacher says                       performs the first motion of the hands
and legs ; when he says
                            " Two," the second and third motions of the
feet, and the second of the hands.
   As soon as the teacher perceives that the pupil begins to support
himself, he slackens the rope a little, and instantly straightens it if
the pupil is about to sink. When the pupil can swim about ten
strokes in succession, he is released from the pole, but not from the
rope.    When he can swim about fifty strokes, he is released from the
rope too ; but the teacher remains near him with a long pole until he
can swim 150 strokes in succession, so that, should he smk, the pole
is immediately held out to him.       After this he may swim in the area
of the school, under the superintendence of the teacher, until he
proves that he can swim half-an-hour in succession, so that, should
he sink, the pole is immediately held out to him; he is then con
sidered fit to be left to himself.
   Such are the outlines of the German plan of swimming; and, much
as we dislike the German educational cjuackery, we are still obliged to
confess that schools for swimming nught be, and ought to be, esta
blished in this country in unison with the above system.         No well-
conducted boarding-school      ought  to  be without  a swimming-school;
and the hints above given will be exceedingly useful to the swimmer
who has to teach himself, as well as to the gymnastic tutor who has
to teach others the art; and we conclude by earnestly recommending
the accomplishment of swimming to our young readers.

   THE skill of the English in archery was always very great. Our
ancestors used the bow for a double purpose: in time of war, it was a
far more dreadful instrument of destruction than our present soldier's
musket; while in the "piping times of peace," it became an object of
amusement. The victories the English obtained over their enemies in
times of war were many, and what the world calls glorious; and they

Normans used the bow as a military weapon, and under their govern
ment the practice of archery was not onff much improved, but gene

                                 The use of the English long-bow arrived
                              at  the highest perfection in the reign of
                             Edward ILL; and, notwithstanding the in
                              troduction of fire-arms, continued for a long
                             time after to be successfully cultivated.
                              Cressy, Poictiers, Agincourt, and many other
                             victories, were obtamed by its use ; and Sir
                             John Fortescue writes, "That mighte of
                            .the realme of Engjande standyth upon her
                             archers," — as it will now upon 'our riflemen

                               THE   CROSS-BOW.
   The cross-bow, or arbalist, was a popular weapon with the Etolians,
and was introduced into England m the thirteenth century. The
arrows shot from it were called " guorrels."         It was fastened upon
a stock, and discharged bv means of a catch or trigger, which pro-
pably gave rise to the lock on the modern musket.             One historian
mforms    us, that Ricnard the First was wounded by an arrow from a
bow   of  this kind; and also, that the English cross-bow was used
chiefly at sieges of fortified places, and on ship-board in battles npon
the sea. It was, however, used in recreation, and acquired great
reputation among the citizens of London, who had "butts" in various
places for the practice of this kind of archery; as at Newington Butts,
Brentford Butts, and other spots, which still retain the name of
Butts : and in the reign of Edward IV. an act passed, which directed

                                  ARCnKRY.                                  101
tl;at butts should be in every township, where the inhabitants should
shoot on every feast-day, under a penalty of a halfpenny when they
shall omit the exercise.
                           FEATS OF THE BOW.
    Mr. Grose intorms us that an archer could shoot six arrows in the
 time necessary to charge and discharge a musket; and even in modern
 days, a practised bowman has been known to shoot twelve arrows in
 a minute into a circle not larger than the circumference of a man's
 hat, at a distance of forty yards.     Of the power of the bow, and of
 the distance it will carry, some remarkable anecdotes are told. Xeno-
 phon mentions an Arcadian, whose head was shot through by a
 Carduchian archer.      Stuart mentions a random shot of a Turk, which
 he found to be 584 yards; and Mr. Strutt saw the Turkish ambas
 sador shoot 480 yards in the old archery-ground in London.             An old
 author speaks of a Turkish bow, the arrow of which was known to
 pierce a steel target two inches thick.          In the journal of King
 Edward VI., it is mentioned that 100 archers of the king's guard
 shot at an inch board, and that some of the arrows passed through
 this, and into another board behind       it, although the wood was ex
tremely   solid  and firm.   William  de Brensia   relates that    Welshman
                                                                   a
having directed an arrow at       a horse-soldier of Ms, who was clad in
armour, and had his leathern coat under          it,
                                                 the arrow, beside piercing
the man through the hip, struck also through the saddle, and mortally
wounded the horse on which he sat. Another Welsh soldier having
shot an arrow at one of his horsemen, who was covered with strong
armour, the shaft penetrated through his thigh, and fixed              in  the
saddle;   but what  is   most remarkable    is,that as the horseman drew
his bridle aside, in order to turn round, he received another arrow in
the opposite thigh, which passing through              it,
                                                      he was firmly fixed to
the saddle on both sides.     Mr.                       "

         LENGTH   OF BOWS     AND ARROWS, AND HOW USED IN
                              ANCIENT TIKES.
   The length of the bow varied, but was usually the height of the
bearer, as the Act of Edward IV. commands every man to have
a bow his own height.        The arrows were of different weights and
                             sizes ; the lighter sort, for long ranges,
                             about two feet three inches ; while the
                             heavy were a cloth yard in length.          The
                             heads had various shapes, among which the
                             broad arrow extended in width to nearly
                            four inches to the extremity of the wings.
                            Of these, 24 in a sheaf were put into a
                            quiver, and, in action, about 12 in the girdle.
                            They were trimmed with three goose-quill
                            feathers each, and when the archers shot
                            in volley, the quantity of arrows in the air
                            was compared by Froissart to a fall of snow.
                            The farthest range of arrows was estimated
                            at eleven score yards. The archers, in order
         BOWMAN EnuiprED of battle, generally carried, beside the bow,

ends. They    formed  in open   ranks, in  files eight   deep. When on the
point of engaging, they     advanced    a   few  paces beyond the intended
fine, and fixed their staes, inclined towards the enemy, in the ground.
They then stepped backward, and from behind these chevaux-ae-frise
 dealt forth their destructive arrows; and when the enemy were
thrown into confusion, they salh'ed, and with small battle-axes and
 swords completed the defeat.
                        MARKS    FOR SHOOTING AT.
                                                                     "
   The marks usually shot at by the archers for pastime were butts,"
 "prickes," and "rovers." The "butt" was a level mark, made by
                                          placing a target on a slope of a
                                          hill or bank of earth, and required
                                          a strong arrow. The "pricke"
                                          was a " mark of compass," but
                                          always of one distance, and had
                                          some emblem on a pole for shoot

wands, rose-garlands, and the popinjay, which was an artificial parrot
or peacock, or sometimes the common cock, set upon a post or pole,
as seen in the engraving.
                       EQUIPMENT      FOR ARCHERY.
    Roger Ascham, who was well versed in the subject of archery, says
that it was necessary for the archer to have a bracer, or close sleeve,
to lace upon the left arm; and to this was added a shooting-glove for
the protection of the fingers.      The bow was to be made of elm, ash,
or yew ; the bow-string to be composed of good hemp, flax, or silk ;
the arrows were to be made of oak, hornbeam, or birch. The feathers
from a goose, and especially of a grey goose, he thought preferable to
any for the pluming of an arrow.
                  ANCIENT     BISECTIONS   FOR ARCHERY.
    Ascham says :  " First  take care of a graceful attitude." The archer
should stand fairly and upright with his body, his left foot at a con
venient distance from his right, holding the bow by its middle, with
his left arm stretched out, and with the first three fingers and the
thumb of his right hand on the lower part of the arrow affixed to the
string of the bow.     The notch of the arrow to rest between the fore
finger and the middle finger of the right hand. The arrow, in drawing
the bow, was to be elevated to the right ear. The shaft of the arrow
below the feathers to be rested on the knuckle of the fore-finger of the
left hand.    The arrow was to be drawn to the head, and not held too
long in that situation, but neatly and smartly discharged.         Among
the requisites necessary to constitute a good archer are, a clear sight
steadily directed to the mark, — a proper judgment of distances, to
determine the length of the ground.        He ought also to know how to
take advantage of a side-wind, and to be well acquainted with what
compass his arrows would take in their flight. "Courage," he says also,
 " is an indispensable requisite; as he who shoots with the least
                                                                      trepi
 dation is sure to shoot badly."
                           DECLINE    OP ABCHERY.
    Notwithstanding the great advantages of archery in ancient days,
 somehow or other it began to decline even at the tnne of its zenith ;
 so that, from tune to tune, acts of parliament were made to compel
the citizens of London, and other towns, to practise it. Some of our
 monarchs made sumptuous archery entertainments.            In the reign of
 Queen Elizabeth, a grand shooting-match was held in London of all
 the archers in the surrounding districts ; and these meeting at the
 appointed time, with their different companies, proceeded in a pompous
 march from Merchant Tailors' Hall, numbering 3,000 archers, sump
 tuously apparelled, every man having a long-bow and four arrows ;
 940 of them had gold chains about their necks.        This splendid com
 pany was attended by 4,000 whifflers and bellmen.         The queen met

 104                        EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
them in Sraithficld, and presided at their sports.       But still the art
continued to decline, and, with the increase of other warlike weapons,
become at last almost extinct.       Within these few years, however, it
has again become a somewhat favourite exercise, near London, and in
various parts of the country. In Scotland, the " Royal Company of
Archers — the Queen's body-guard for Scotland — comprises many of
the Scottish nobility, and King George IV. recognised it.          It now
comprises about 500 members, who meet weekly, and at certain
seasons contend for several annual prizes.
   Convinced as we are that the practice of archery possesses, in
point of health, all the advantages of field sports, without their
cruelty to animals, and demoralizmg oppression to pur fellow-crea
tures, we strongly recommend it to our juvenile friends.          It is an
exercise adapted to every age and every degree of strength; and
especially adapted to young ladies, whose sedentary occupations, —
rendered still more injurious by the pestiferous Berlin wool, — disposes
them to disease and consumption.        I do not wish to sing the praises
                                    I
of the art to their full extent, but wish to see it universally cultivated,
and should hail with pleasure the time when it can be again said, as
with Statins, " Pudor est nescere sagittas."
                             MODERN AECHERY.
   Proceeding now to the modern practice of the art, we must first
begin with
                                  THE BOW.
   The Bow may be made of the yew-tree, laburnum, thorn, or acacia,
and is generally formed of two pieces of wood joined together, the
back piece being of a different wood to the front, and the grain re
versed.    It is of great importance to secure a good bow. We would
not, therefore, advise the young archer to make one, but to buy one
at a good archery shop, where they may be had at all prices.          Upon
making    a  purchase,   he  should  examine  the  bow   well, to  observe
whether it be well set in all its parts, of an elegant cut or shape, and
free from flaws, knots, or cracks.     He should look well at the ends,
and to those points on which the bow-string is fixed, which ought to
be tipped with horn.        The proper length of a bow for a youth is
about five feet.     The flat or inward part of a bow is called its back,
and the inward part its belly, and in stringing it the young archer
should be particularly careful to keep the belly inwards, or the bow
will break.
                                 THE STRING.
   The string of the bow should be made of hemp, and whipped with
sewing silk at that part of it which receives the arrow, and at the
noose and eye ABC.          The thickness of the string should depend
upon the length of the bow, and should never be too thin for its

                              ARCHERY.                            105
powers, as the snapping of a string sometimes causes the snapping
of the bow. The young archer should never use a string in the least
out of order, and should avoid cat-gut strings especially.     A bow
five feet long, when bent, should have a string about five mches from
the centre.   This will be a guide in stringing the bow.   The young
archer should take great pride in the care of his bow, especially of
the string, and look carefully, after every day's shooting, at the
" whipping" of the string in its various
                                            points, ABC, repairing the
least defect.  He ought also to place his bow in an oil-skin case,
lined with baize; and when put away for the season it should be well
rubbed with oil, and polished. He should also have always two or
three spare strings in readiness, in case the one in use may 'fly.
                        STRINGINO   THE BOW.
   The young archer must be very careful in performing this feat, or
he  will fail m the attempt ; to do so safely, he must take the bow in
his right hand by the handle, the flat part towards him ; then let his
arm rest against his side, then put the lower end of the bow against
the inside of the right foot, brmg his left foot forward, and place the
centre of the left wrist on the upper level of the bow below the loop
of the string, the fore-finger knuckle on one edge of the bow, and
the top of the thumb upon the other ; then up with the bow and
loop it. This feat, however, can be best learned by seeing another
expert person perform it. In unstringing the bow, the short horn
should be placed on the ground against the right foot, the middle of
the bow grasped in the right hand, and the left wrist placed on the
upper horn, so that the bone finger may unloop the string when the
bow is brought down, as in the manner of stringing it.
                            THE ARBOWS.
   Arrows are generally made of some white wood, such as ash, deal,
or the wood of the orbele poplar, and are sometimes varnished. They
                     are both blunt and sharp.     The sharp ones arc
                     for target shooting, the blunt ones principally
                     for rovmg; they also vary as regards length,
                     some being long, and some short. £1 purchasing
                     them, the principal thing to be attended to     is,
                     that they are perfectly straight, well made, and
                   » that the plumes are securely fitted. There should
                    •
                     be three on each arrow; one, which  is of darker
                                                              a
                     colour than the rest,  is called the cock plume,
and in shooting should be placed uppermost. The length and weight
of the arrows should be in proportion to the size of the bow. The

nicks of arrows should        be cased  with horn, and they should fit the
string exactly.
                                 THE QUIVER.
                       The quiver is used to contain the arrows, and is
                    usually made of wood, or tin, or leather, those made
                    of the latter material being the most serviceable and
                    convenient to wear.      It should be long enough to
                    contain the arrows up to the feather, without bruising
                    or crushing the plumes, which ought always to be
                    kept perfectly straight and unruffled.     The quiver
                    may be worn by a strap over the shoulder, or at the
                    side of the archer.
                   THE TASSEL, BRACE, BELT AND POUCH.
   The Tassel is usually made of green worsted, and is used by the
archer for the purpose of cleansing the arrow from dirt after being
taken from the ground. It is usually suspended on the left side of
the archer.
   /'//'• Brace is of leather, and is buckled on the arm to save it from
being hurt by the string upon the discharge of the arrow.         It ought

    The Beit is made of leather, and is buckled round the waist.             It

in shooting.
                   SHOOTING GLOVE, AUD UKF.ASE           POT.
    The Shooting Glove is made of cow-hide, or horse ball leather.           It
has places   or stalls for three   fingers only, with  a wrist strap to fasten
it on. • Its use is to protect the fingers from the action of the string,
and in selecting it the young archer should be careful that the finger
stalls are neither too long nor too short for the hand.
                                              THE GREA8E POT
                  THE GLOVE.
     The Grease Box hangs usually by the side of the tassel, and con
 tains a small portion of grease composed of suet and bees-wax well
 compounded.      This is used for rubbing on the fingers of the shooting
 glove, and is indispensable to the archer.
                                  THE TARGET.
     Targets are made with plaited straw bands, wound round a centre,
 and sewn together.        Over this body is placed a facing of canvass,
                            the ground of which is painted white ; upon
                            the white are painted four circles, and a gold

                            close   to the eye is red ; the next white, called
                            the inner white ; the third black ; and the
                            fourth white, called the outer white; while
                            the outside verge, called the petticoat of the
                            target, is painted green.
                                A certam value in shooting is given to each
                             circle of the target, which is thus computed :
                             Outer white 1; Black 3; Inner white 5;
  Red 7, and the Gold Eye 9.
     There are usually two targets in an archery field, placed at certain
  distances from each other, which shortens the labour of walking; for

 if one target only be nsed, a great deal of time is lost in going from
 the shootmg mark to the target to fetch the arrows, and in returning
 to the spot again.
    The prizes usually shot for in archery matches are gold and silver
 medals, silver cups, silver arrows, silver gilt bugles, prize bows and
 arrows. There are generally two prizes given; the first for the shots
 nearest the gold centre, the second for the number of shots put into
 the target, according to their value.
    A person is usually appointed to register the shots at the targets,
 who has a card similar to the form given below, by which he takes an
 account of the hits as they are made.

                                  usually about six feet high and four feet
                                  broad at the face, upon which a circular
                                  piece of thin white pasteboard, about six
                                  mches in diameter, is affixed with pegs.
                                  Butts are generally placed in the field in
                                  sets of four, so as not to stand in the way
of each other.     And when shot at, the arrows placed in the paste
board mark are alone reckoned, and those who here place the greatest
number of shots are the winners of the prize.
                           HOW TO DRAW THE BOW.
    The ancient directions for drawing the bow, or rather the arrow,
have been already given.          The archer having placed himself opposite
to the target, with    his  face   a little inclined to the right, should swing
himself slightly round, so that his eye and the target are in an exact
line. He snould stand quite upright, his left foot slightly in advance.
Holding the bow horizontally in his left hand, he should draw an
arrow from his pouch and carry it under the string and over the left
side of the bow.        The fore-finger of the left hand now holds the
arrow secure on the wooden part of the bow at its centre, while the
right hand fixes the nick of the arrow on the string, where it is held
fast between the first and second fingers, the cock feather being up
permost.     The fore-finger of the left hand may now be removed from

 the arrow, and the centre of the bow grasped
 tightly.   The bow is now raised gradually by the
 leu hand, at the same time that the string is
 pulled by the right; and when the arrow is drawn
 about two-thirds of its length, the neck of it
 should be brought close to the right ear and the
 aim should be taken.      The aim should be taken
 quickly, and the string loosened freely from the
 fmgers with a peculiar touch, which no books can
 teach, and which nothing but experience and skill
 can give.     In long shots the right hand must be
 lowered, and the arrow sent so as to form a
 greater curve in its flight. The archer should            SKOOTINO.
 look at his mark, not at his shaft, and when he has shot should re
 treat to the leftward, and take his position behind the person with
 whom he is shooting.
                            FLIGHT SHOOTING.
    This is principally engaged in for the purpose of ascertaining the
 greatest distance to which the arrows can be sent by the respective
 shooters.    It requires no skill in aiming, but much care in drawing
 the arrow, as nothing is more likely to fracture the bow than flight
 shooting. The archer who sends his arrows to the greatest distance
 is the winner.
                             CLOUT SHOOTING.
    In clout shooting the target is only a small piece of white    paste
 board attached to a stick about five feet from the ground, and    placed
 at a distance of from 120 to 150 yards.    In it seven makes the  game,
 and all arrows that fall within two bows' length of the foot      of the
stick are marked in counting.                       •
                                  ROVING.
    So called from the shooters roving from place to place, over field,
heath, moor, common, finding their marks in trees, posts, bushes, &c.
The distances constantly varying, give to young archers a great deal
of practice; besides which, the variety of the scenery, and the various
incidents that occur in a day's roving, are often highly interesting and
exciting. By roving the eye gets a habit of measuring distances,
and the hand and arm strength for the bow.          Blunt-headed arrows
are the best for roving, of which about a dozen ought to be carried
by each archer.     Sharp arrows would imbed themselves too deeply in
trees to be easily extracted.      In a roving party, arrows that reach
within five bows' length of the mark tell, and those which arc nearest
cut the others out. THach archer measures with his own bow.           The
number of the game is often nine, but generally twelve.

                    GENERAL   HINTS   FOR AXCHBRS.
   1. In commencing archery never begin with a stiff bow, but select
one adapted to your strength, and change this for a stronger from
time to time.
  2.  Never shoot with another person's bow.
   3. Never put an arrow in the string when any one stands between
you and the target, or you may shoot out an eye.
   4. Never talk, jibe, or jest at the time of shooting.
   5. Always study to take a graceful attitude in shooting, or in
moving about the field.
   6. Never draw a bow near another person ; as, should it snap, the
danger will be greater to him than yourself.
   7. Never let vour bow-string get untwisted or ravelled by neglect.
   8. Never exhibit impatience at the tardy efforts of your compeers,
or chagrin at your own failures.
   9. Never shoot alone if you can help   it,  as
                                                it  leads to negligence
and indifference.

                                     CHAPTER I.
                    " When I    was a mere schoolboy.
                         Ere yet I learnt my book,
                      I felt an itch for angling
                        In every little brook.

                      And, thus equipp'd, I angled
                         In every little brook ;

   WHAT can be more delightful than angling ? Not indeed so much
on account of the fish we may catch, but for the pleasantness of the
recreation itself, for the cool streams, the shady trees, the little sunnv
nooks, the tiny or gigantic cascades, the meandering rills, the still
pools, "with sedges overhung;" the picturesque mill-wheels, the deep
             " smooth sheeted by the flood;" and above

 hair-breadth escapes, for the duckings, for the hazards, for the
 triumphs. Ah,     I do not wonder at boys being foad of aTi^IJTig, it is
 almost an instmct with them, and has long been a favourite amuse
 ment with boys of all degrees, ages and constitutions.      Therefore we
 shall be somewhat comprehensive in our notices of this interesting
 sport, that every boy who can bait a hook and hold a line may be an
 angler if he wifi.
                           A WOBD ABOUT HSH.
    First, however, let us say a word about fish in general, before we
 come to fish in particular.   Fish or fishes are, to speak scientifically,
a class of vertebrated animals (having a backbone) inhabiting the
 water; which breathe through the medium of that fluid by means of
branchiae or gills, instead of lungs ; which swim by means of fins,
and are mostly covered with scales. They are also generally furnished
with a white membraneous bag close to the backbone, called the air
bladder, by the dilatation or compression of which it is supposed they
can rise or sink in the water at pleasure.     All parts of their bodies
seem to aid them in swimming in the water; their fins, their tails, and
the undulation of their backbones assist progression, and their whole
structure is as much adapted for swimmmg as that of a bird is for
flight.
    The fins of fish consist of thin elastic membrane, supported by
bony rays, and are denominated according to their position — dorsal
on the back, pectoral on the breast, ventral near the vent, anal that
between the vent and the tail, and caudal the tail fins.      The dorsal
and ventral fins appear to balance the fish, and the pectoral to push it
forward; while the tail fins are the grand instruments of motion, and
enable the creature to dart forward almost as rapidly as the bullet
from a gun.
    With regard to the senses of fishes, the eye holds the first place ;
but this is best adapted for seeing under water.         Of the organ of
hearing there is no outward sign. The organ of taste is thought to
be very unsensitive, and the power of touch but slightly developed.
To preserve their own existence, and to transmit it to their posterity,
seems to be their only enjoyment; and they move forward m pursuit
of whatever they can swallow, conquer, or enjoy, and their insatiable
appetite impels them to encounter every danger, and to their rapacity
there seems to be no bound.        A single pike has been known to
devour a hundred roaches in three days. The fecundity of fish is
prodigious. The number of eggs in the codfish often amounts to
more than three millions; those of flounders above a million, of the
mackarel 500,000, of the sole 100,000, and of the lobster 20,000;
but the salmon is far more productive than any of these, as it has
been known to have more than twenty millions of eggs !
    Without saying any more about "Fish in the abstract," as the
angler called his
                     " catch," when he returned without one, we must

go to the art of "catching fish;" and the first thing to be attended
to is the necessary fishing apparatus, which may be mcreased to any
extent ; but the young angler would be wise to limit his stock as
much as possible.          I
                         have fished many hundred miles of water, and
killed many a thousand of fish, with no better equipment than this : —
One rod of about fourteen feet long, with three tops, — one stiff top,
for bottom fishing and trolling, ana two for fly-fishing. Two reels
or winches, one holding a silk and hair line of thirty-five yards in
length for   flyfishing, and the other holding     similar line of forty

moderate-sized creel or fishing basket.     One oblong    tin bos, about
eight inches long, four inches deep, and six inches wide, divided into
two compartments at the centre, the lids opening each way, and
pierced with holes, which serves to carry dead minnows and ground
bait. A   landing net; some shoemakers' wax in piece of soft leather;

                     a
and other kinds of wood.      Bods are of different lengths, some fitted
as walking-canes, and others are made to pack in canvass bags         the    ;
latter are to be preferred, because you may have them of any length,
and they are maae more true. Those made of bamboo cane are best
for anglmg near towns. But the rods made of the white cane are much
superior for fine fishing, particularly for roach, being very light in
weight, but stiff.

striking a heavy fish.   Bods fitted with several tops all packing to
gether, are at once the best and most convenient. Some anglers have

  one rod for trolling, another for barbel, perch, or other heavy fish, as
well   as those for fly-fishing — which hoys may have when they become
  men  — but athoroughly good rod will suit the juvenile for all purposes.
I   have now one with which       I can fish from a bleak to a pike, by only
  changing the top   and  second joints.
    A good trolling rod should be made of the choicest stout and well
 seasoned bamboo cane, about sixteen feet in length. When trolling
 with the gorge or live-bait fishing, a long rod is necessary, to enable
 the angler to drop in his baited hook over high sedges, rushes, &c., as
 also when the water is bright, for he should then keep as far away from
 it as he can, which a lon^ rod enables him to do while dipping, casting,
 or spinning his bait.     It either a jack or pike see him, it is very rare,
 indeed, that  he will take   the bait; and again, with a long rod you will
 be able to drop your baited hook in some very likely place for jack or
 pike, such as a small hole, division or clear place among a bed of
 weeds, in a river or any other water where there are many weeds.
    There is some difference of opinion among anglers about the num
ber of rings necessary for trolling rods : those who have their line on
a thumb winder, or on a bank runner, seldom place more than two or
three rings on their rod, and others have only one large ring at the
top ; but if a winch is ustd, there should be a ring to every joint
except the butt, — that    is,  fasten the winch to the butt about     a foot
from the bottom, and let that joint be without        ring — each ring made
                                                      a
of double twist wire, fixed so as always to stand out, and nearly large
enough to admit the top of your little finger the top joint should
                                                      ;
have two rings, the top one nearly three times the size of the others;
this prevents any obstruction of the line running which      is   of material
consequence.      When not in use, rods should be kept nicely stowed
in moderately dry place, and they ought to be well scraped and re-
    a
varnished every three years should the joints become loose
                             ;                                    by  shrink
ing, they   should  be  slightly  moistened.    Should  any accident  befala
rod while fishing, and should you not have      a  spare top with you, your
only remedy wifl be to splice your rod. To do this the broken pieces
must be cut in slanting direction, so as to fit each other, then stuck
                a
together
           by
           a     thin coatmg of the marine glue, and lightly wrapped
round with waxed silk, or very strong yellow hempen twine.

   Next to the rod the line    of the utmost importance.
                                 is                         Good lines
should be well twisted. The twisted lines should be made wholly of
silk, or silk and hair, but those made of gut are the strongest and
best for young anglers   ;the twisted hair are the cheapest, and the
single horsehair the finest.   The young angler will find       line of
                                                                  a
about four yards in length the most useful.      single hair line, with
                                                    A
a  small porcupine float,  iscommonly used for general fishing the     ;
plaited silk lines are the best for trolling, and are less inclmed to
break or tangle than the twisted.

   The line must be shotted, that the float may partially sink in the
water; and in putting on the shots, place them all together within
three inches of the bottom loop of the fine ; to which loop fix the loop
of the hair or gut to which the hook is tied.    Place two small shots,
the smaller the better, about two inches from the hook, which will
cause the bait to swim well and steadily, and the rest above the first
loop. When you place shot on the lme, do it with a pair of pliers,
which is the best and easiest method ; some boys fasten them with
their teeth, which is a bad and ungentlemanly practice, and they often
bite the gut through, which causes delay and vexation.            When
you make a line of silk, gut, or hair, remember it must be always
finest at the bottom, where the hook is fastened, very gradually m
creasing in thickness to the top.

   There are various kinds of floats, each adapted for different kinds
of fishing.    The principal are: 1. Tip-cappea floats; 2. Cork floats;
3. Plugged floats.      The tip-capped floats are made of several pieces
of quills, or of reed for the middle, and ivory or tortoiseshell for the
top and bottom, and narrow at each end, gradually increasing in cir
cumference to the middle.       They are superior to afl others for angling
in waters which are not very rapid, particularly in roach fishing, as
the least movement or fine "bite sinks it below the water.         The tip-
capped   float is also best for pond fishing  for      and  tench, as it re
                                                  carp
quires but few shot to sink     it, and consequently disturbs the water
but little when cast. The young angler should note that the caps
which fix the lines to the float are not rough at the edge, as this
roughness chafes and weakens          afine line;
should this be the case, he should smooth
them before use.
   Cork Floats are generally made of quills
at the top, with      piece of cork, which      is
                  in a
burned or bored      the middle to admit the
quill, and then filed or ground down smooth
and painted.    The bottom    isplugged with
wood, and has    a  ring to let the line pass
through.    Cork floats are well calculated
to fish in heavy or rapid streams, as they
require   a great many shot to sink them,
which weight of shot prevents the baited
hook from passingtoo rapidly over the bottom.
Cork floats are made of various sizes and
forms instead of common quills, some
      ;                                         in
troduce the quills of the porcupine, which
make an excellent strong float.

   Plugged Floatt. — These kind of floats are the cheapest, and made
of indifferent quills, some of them of one goose quill with a wooden
plug at the bottom, from which they take their name : they are very
apt to loosen by the plug coming out. They are often used by the
young angler, because they are cheap; but we may say in the words
of the ancient Roman,
                           " Bad is the best."
                            EEEI.S  OB,  WINCHES.
   A   reel or winch is a most necessary addition to the rod and line,
as  it enables you to vary the length of your line at pleasure, and to
                                   play your fish. The best winches are
                                   those to fix in a groove on the rod, and
                                   are fastened with brass ferrules made
                                   for the purpose on the butt, because
                                   you can fasten such a winch to any
                                   sized joint.
                                      There are two kinds of winches,
                                   multipliers and plain: the multiplying
                                   winch is the most useful, as long as
                                   it lasts, but is apt soon to get out of
                                   order, unless carefully used and con
                                   stantly oiled, and care be taken that no
sand or gravel is allowed to get into it ; but as young anglers are
seldom very careful in such points as these,            I would recommend
them at first, to purchase a plain and strong winch, which will answer
every purpose, and be much less expensive.
                                 REEL LINES
Are mostly made of silk and horsehair, twisted or plaited together,
but some are made entirely of silk.         I prefer, however, a plaited silk
and hair line, as it is less likely to twist, runs more freely, and is less
likely to rot. The length of lines vary from fifteen to eighty yards ;
but for general purposes twenty or five-and-twenty yards is quite long
enough. The line should always be unwound after a day's fishing, as,
if it is allowed to remain wet on the reel, it soon rots.
                                    HOOKS.
   Hooks are to be bought at the " angling shops," of all sizes, and
suitable for the kind of fish to be caught.           There is a great con
troversy among adept anglers about hooks, which is sometimes as
violent as those upon politics or religion.        Some anglers prefer what
are called the Limerick hooks, some the Kendal ; while others again
prefer the Kirby or Sneckbend.          We are hooked to the Kirby, as we
consider those to be best for holding the fish — a most important

                                  HOW TO BAIT A HOOK.
   To bait a hoot with a worm, use the following method                                  :   First enter
the point of the hook close to the top of the worm's head, and carry
it carefully down to within a quarter of an inch of its tail; to do
which you must gently squeeze or work up the worm with your left
thumb and finger, while with your right you are gradually working
the hook downwards.        The small lively piece of the worm at the
point of the hook moving about will entice the fish; but, mind, if too
much of the worm hangs loose, though it may entice fish to nibble,
yet they will seldom take the whole m their mouth, so as to enable
the angler to hook them; on the contrary, he is frequently tantalized
with a bite, and, when he strikes, finds part of his worm " bolted,"
the hook "innocent," and the fish "non est." Therefore, to bait
 a hook well with a worm is necessary to ensure hitting a fish when you
 strike; and it consists in drawing the worm without injuring it (use
 him as you would a friend, Walton says,) quite over and up the shank
 of the hook, leaving only a small lively part of the tail below.     you                             If
 bait with half a worm, prefer the tail end, and enter the point of the
 hook into the top part of      and bring    down nearly to the end of
                                           it,               it
 the tail, leaving only very small piece of
                                a                loose.     you bait with
                                                                  it                If
 two worms on the same hook, draw the first up above the shank,
 while you put the second on in the same manner as directed with one
 worm, but enter the hook near the tail of the second worm then                                      ;
 draw the first one down on the second over the shank of the hook,
 and all will then be well covered, and will be very bon-bon for perch,
                                                                     a
 chub, carp, barbel, and all large fish; but when angling for gudgeon,
 and other small fish, half   red worm    asufficient, and the tail end
                                                            is                                               is
 best.      If
             blood-worms are used, put on two or three, in doing which
 be tender, or you will burst them.

 118                       EVERY    BOY  S  BOOK.
   1. Lob-worms    are found in gardens or churchyards, late in the
evening; they    have  a red head, a streak down the back, and a broad
tail. This is a good worm for salmon, chub, trout, barbel, eels, and
large perch.
   2.  Brandling is found in old dunghills, rotten earth or cow-dung,
and the best in tanners' bark.    It is a good bait for any kind of fish.
   3. The Marsh'worm is found in marshy grounds, or on the banks of
rivers; and is a good bait for trout, perch, gudgeon, grayling, and
bream.
   4. The Tagtail is found in marly lands or meadows, after a shower ;
and is a good bait for trout when the water is muddy.
   5. The Ash-grub is found in the bark of trees. It is a good bait for
grayling, dace, roach, or chub.
   6. Cowdung Bait is found under cowdung, from May to Michael
mas ; and is a good bait for grayling, dace, roach, or chub.
   7. Caterpillars can be found on almost           every tree or plant.
Almost any small caterpillar will answer.
   8. The Cabbage caterpillar is found on cabbages.
   9. The Crabtree-worm can be taken by beating the branches of the
crab-apple.
   10. Qentils.    These are bred in putrid liver, or may be obtained
from the butchers.     They arc an excellent bait for all kmds of fish.
                              TUB CADDIS 7LT
   11.   Cad is found in the ditches, or on the sides of stony brooks.
It  is an excellent bait for trout, grayling, roach, dace, or chub.
   12. Flag-worms are found among flags in old pits or ponds, and are
good bait for grayling, tench, bream, carp, roach, and dace.
   13. Grasshoppers, found in sun-burnt grass, and are good bait for
various kinds of fish.

   14. Wasp-grubs are to be obtained from wasps' nests, and arc
a ^ood bait for most fish that will take gentils. *
  15. Beetles are found everywhere, and sometimes in cowdung.
They are a capital bait for chub.
   16. Salmon-spawn is a good bait for trout, chub, and other fish;
but must be prepared in a peculiar way before it can be used.
   17. White-bread Paste is prepared by dipping white bread in honey,
and working it in the palm of the hand.              It
                                                 is a good bait for carp,
tench, chub, or roach.
   18. Cheese Paste is made with rotten cheese and bread, worked up
in the hand. It is a good bait for chub.
   19. Wheat Paste is made by bruising wheat and working it with
milk, and makes     good grouna bait.
                        a
   20. GroundSail should be used in the spot about to be fished, and,
if possible, the night before, and should be fresh. For carp, chub,
roach, or dace, use white bread soaked in water, and mixed with bran
and pollard.    For roach, dace, and bleak, mix clay and bran together
in balls the size of a pigeon's egg. For barbel, chandler's greaves,
boiled and worked up into a ball with clay.       For carp, tench, eels,
malt soaked in water is good ; or gentils may be thrown in.
                        TO   BAIT A HOOK WITH OENTIM.
  To bait a hook with gentils, enter the point of the hook into the
gentil near either end, and bring it out at the other end ; then draw
the point back again just within the gentil, enough to hide it. The
best way to bait with a gentil whose skin is somewhat tough, esj
cially in cold weather, is oy piercing the skin in the first instance.
                             TO   BAIT WITH GREAVES.
   First select the whitest pieces from those you have soaked, and put
four or five of them upon your hook, or as much as will cover it from
the bend to and over the point; these pieces should not be bigger
than a pea, and should be put on the hook separately, one after the
other —not a large piece doubled, as some slovenly boys will do, for
then the hook is prevented from entering firmly the fish you may
strike. These little particulars of baiting are of considerable advan
tage to young anglers, who ought to remember also that it is a bad
practice to soak greaves in hot water, for it makes them rotten, and
they in consequence soon fall off the hook.
                        TO SCOUR    AND PRESERVE      WOHMS.
  To do this, the young angler should provide himself with a quantity
of fresh moss. Wash out all the earth and squeeze                  it, but not too
dry; then put     into jar and squeeze
                   it        a                   tightly down throw in the
                                                it                :
worms upon it. The jar should be kept                in cool place in summer,
                                                          a

and the moss changed once in three or four days. Gentils should be
thrown into a mixture of damp sand and bran to scour them, and will
be ready in two or three days.
                                  THE PLUMMET.
   Plummets are used by anglers for sounding the depth of a
stream or hole.  They are of two kinds, either the folding plummet
or the common plummet.      The folding plummet, which is the better,
is made of a slip of sheet lead, folded up ; and this the young angler
should never be without.
                             PLUMBING THE DEPTH
Is   performed    in the following manner : If a folding plummet, unfold
                         about two inches of          it,
                                                   pass the hook over its
                         side, and then fold the plummet up again   your         :
                         hook     isnow secured from drawing away   from
                         the plummet.      As success depends much in
                          angling at     proper depth, the young angler
                                            a
                          should take due pains, and measure the depth
                          accurately before he begins fishing. When the
                            plumb-lead      touches the bottom, and the top of
                            the float  is   even with the surface of the water,
you will nave tne true depth.
                     LANDING-HOOK           AND LANDING-NET.
     The landing-hook or gaff     is   a   large hook, which   is   sometimes barbed
like  fish-hook, and sometimes plain, fastened on one end of rod this        a
       is a
                                                                                     ;
rod      occasionally composed of several pieces, which run one into
another, like the slides of   telescope.
                                  a           landing-net
                                                    A         small net isa
mounted on an iron ring, which       fastened, Eke the landing-hook, to
                                            is
the end of    apole.
                            CLEARING-RING AND LINE.
   The clearing-line   made of several yards of strong small cord, to
                       is
the end of which      fastened
                       is        heavy ring of lead or brass.
                                       a                          the            If
hook should get fast in heavy weed, post, or anything else, this ring
                              a
is put over the rod, and suffered to go down to the hook.     The rod

                                   ANGLING.                                     121
should be held in the right hand, the top pointing downwards, and
the clearing-line in the left, the ring falling on the nook, which, from
its weight, generally clears the hook from what it may have struck
against.     If
              not, the angler should hold the rod firmly, and draw the
line sideways, and break away. In this case, the angler seldom loses
more than a hook, if he acts as above directed ; out without the
assistance of a clearing-line he frequently loses his float as well as his
hook and line, and sometimes breaks his top joint.       The brass clear
ing-rings are to be preferred, because they are jointed, and in con
sequence can be used when the angler has a winch in his rod, in
which case the leaden ring could not oe passed over the winch.
                                   DBAG-HOOK.
   The drag is a piece of iron with three or four stout wire hooks
without barbs, placed back to back, which is fastened to a strong
cord line, which is used to draw away weeds. The landing-hook                       is,
however, infinitely preferable, and not so troublesome.  We therefore
advise the angler not to use the drag-hook at all, and merely describe
it,that he may know the use of every angling implement.

the other, which disgorges the hook, and it is then easily drawn out.
In attempting to get a gorged hook from a fish without this instru
ment, you run a hazard of breaking the hook and hurting yourself.
When the fish is hooked through the lip, the angler has only to hold
the fish steadily in one hand, while with the other he carefully takes
away the hook.

  THE Salmon is the king of fresh-water fish          It is handsome in
form, its head is small, its nose pointed, its back and sides

belly silvery, and its flesh the well-known salmon colour. The female
may be distinguished by having a longer snout than the male fish.
   Salmon bite best from six till eleven in the forenoon, and from
three m the afternoon until sunset, especially when there is a moderate
breeze upon the water.        The chief months to angle for them are
March, April, May, and June. They are to be fished for with lob
worms or mmnows, but a large artificial     fly

fishing for salmon with lob-worms the trolling tackle is to be used,
and two of these worms well scoured put upon the hooks.
   In the large streams of Scotland, salmon are caught in various
ways: — by the stake net, an artificial space or dyke in a river; by
burning the water, as it is called; i.e. holding a torch above the
stream and driving the fish into nets ; also by spearing, which                   is,
however, considered illegal.   Few of our young readers will be able
to go salmon fishing till they have reached maturity, and, therefore,
to give the various modes of attacking the fish would be superfluous.
                                 THE TBOUT.
  This beautiful fish    is  much prized. Izaak Walton says of        it,  " It   is
more sharp-sighted than any hawk, and more watchful and timorous
than your high-mettled merlin        is     bold."    In its habitsit   is  avery
solitary  and   predaceous     fish.    Its  general length is    from twelve  to
sixteen inches,    its weight quite     uncertain.
   The trout are found in lakes and rivers and minor streams, and are
finest in appearance from the end of March to the end of July or
middle of August their spawning time from
                    :                                is   November to January.
The   most  brilliant  and  beautiful    trout  are  generally found in streams
that flow rapidly over rocky         bottoms.     They feed upon worms, min
nows, and other small fish, but their most favourite food            is  the fly,
upon which they thrive and fatten prodigiously.
   In angling for the trout we must have stout rod, running tackle,

         and artificial flies.    The minnow   is,    however, the most taking

  ait, which should be cast lightly on the water, and drawn trippingly
against the current.       The angler must not be in too great      a   hurry to
strike, as the trout    is very apt    to  nibble  at his bait before swallowing
it; rather let him try once or twice and then nick him. The favourite

haunts of the trout are mill tails, deep dark holes and eAiies, pools,
the roots of trees, and the "nethers" of bridges and weirs.
                          THE JACK OR PIKE.
   The mighty luce or pike, says Walton, is taken to be the tyrant,
as the salmon is the  king, of the fresh waters. His aspect is repulsive.
              ,
He is a ragged, savage, ugly looking fish.      His teeth are very sharp
and very numerous, being upwards of seven        hundred,   and his vora
cious appetite is such that nothing comes amiss to him. He has been
known to swallow the plummet, and the clay and bran balls of
                                                     " rats and mice and

been known to pull under water.   He often grows to an enormous
size (no wonder), and has been taken upwards of thirty pounds in
weight.
  Pike are fond of dull, shady, and unfrequented waters, with a
sandy, chalky, or clayey bottom.      In summer they are found among
or near flags, bulrushes, or water docks.        They seldom seek a rapid
stream, their favourite retreat being in the vicinity of a whirlpool, or
a sharp bend of the stream.       In winter they retire into the depths,
under clay banks, or under a projecting stone or stump of a tree.
   The pike is in its prime during September and October, but is in
season from May to February ; the baits used for          it, gudgeon, min
nows, chub, bleak, and young frogs, and should be about three or
four inches    length; and trolling for them
               in                                is "excellent sport." The
rod should be strong; the line of silk, at least thirty yards long, wound
upon the winch already described.        Hooks for trolling, called dead
gorges, and other sorts for trolling, snap and trimmer, and fishing
needles, are to be bought at every shop where fishing tackle             sold
                                                                         is     ;

more.     Allow him ten minutes for gorging the bait, wind up the line
gently till you think it is nearly at its stretch, and then strike. Manage
him with a gentle hand, keeping him, however, from roots and stumps,
which he will try to fasten the line upon.           In clear water veer out
line till he is sufficiently tired, and a landing net can be used; but by
no means, however apparently exhausted he may be, attempt to lift
him put with the rod and line only, for the moment he quits the water
he will open his mouth, and from his own weight tear the hook from
his stomach, and he will be lost.
   In trolling, the bait hook should never be thrown too far; in small
rivers the opposite bank may be fished with ease, though the violence
of its falls upon the water in long throws soon spoils the bait by
rubbing off its scales. The bead hook is used by putting the lead
into the mouth of the live bait, and sewing it up ; the fish will live
some time, and, notwithstanding the lead, will continue to swim.           In
angling   for this  fish always  prefer  a rough wi.id, and when  the stream
is clear for trolling.      Pike never bite in white water after rain, &c.
If a pike goes slowly up a stream, after taking the bait, it is said to
be the sign of a good fish.
                                 THE  GUDGEON
Is  one of the most delicious fish for eating, although small in size.

warm days, from an hour after sunrise to within the same space of
its setting; and during the rest of the year, in the middle of the day,
when it is warmest.
   In angling for gudgeon the tackle must be very fine, a single heir
or fine gut lme, a hook, No. 8 or 9, a short rod and line, and a small
porcupine float.       They will take the small red-worm greedily, and

 blood-worms — the first is perhaps the best — and a rake or the boat-
hook should be kept frequently stirring the bottom.       To the spot so
stirred gudgeon assemble in shoals, expecting food from the discolour
ing of the water; and by now and then throwing in a handful of
gravel mixed with dead gentils, they are also kept together, and
sometimes great quantities are taken.       They are apt to nioble at the
bait ; the angler ought not, therefore, to strike at the first biting.
    Should any young angler desire a good day's fishing for gudgeon,
and a pleasant walk into the bargain, he should seek out some
sequestered gravelly stream, and providing himself with a rake, he
may have sport till he is tired of it.    He will find them scattered up
and down every river in the shallows during the heat of summer,
but in winter they get into deeper water, and are to be fished for
there with your hook always touching the ground, if fished for with a
float.   Some persons, however, prefer fishing for them with a running
line upon the ground without a cork, but this requires a gentle rod
and a gentle hand.
                               THE BOACH.
    The roach is a handsome fish either in or out of the water. It
inhabits many of our deep still rivers, delighting most in quiet waters.
                             ROACH   AND DACK.
It  is gregarious, keeping in large shoals. It delights in gravelly,
sandy, or a kind of slnny marl bottom, under a deep gentle running
stream ; in summer they often frequent shallows near the tails of fords,
lie under banks among weeds, under the shades of boughs, and at or
opposite the mouth of a rivulet or brook, that empties itself into a
large river. In winter they like to get into clear, deep, and still
waters.
   The tackle for roach must be fine and strong, a six-feet rod and
a five-feet line, a porcupine float, and hooks No. 11 or 12. The bait,

In fishing for roach in ponds, chew and throw in white bread, baiting

   Dace are gregarious — are great breeders — very lively — and during
summer fond of playing near the surface.        Their haunts are deep
water, near the piles of oridges, where the stream     gentle, and has

                                THE PERCH.
    " Perch feed on perch," is an old maxim ; the perch being the only
one of all fresh- water fish that feeds on its own kmd. His excuse is a
prodigious appetite, like that of Saturn, who ate his own offspring.
Notwithstandmg this wicked propensity, the perch is a beautiful fisli,
the back and part of the sides bemg a deep green, marked with broad
                                                •

 black bars, pointing downwards ; the spaces between are golden, the
 belly white, tinged with red, and the ventral fins tinged with scarlet.
 They vary greatly in size. The largest perch we ever caught weighed
 three pounds twelve ounces, and was taken with a roach bait near
 Richmond.      Their general length is about ten or twelve inches.
    Perch are found in clear swift rivers with pebbly, clayey, or sandy
 bottoms.    They are fond of water moderately deep, and frequent
 holes near to gentle streams where there is an eddy, the hollows
 under banks, among weeds and roots of trees, piles of bridges, or in
 ponds which are fed by a brook or rivulet.       The perch is a bold biter
 m the summer, but scarcely ever in the winter. In the middle of a
 warm sunshiny day, you are sure to have him with a proper bait. He
 bites best in the latter part of the spring, from seven till eleven in the
 forenoon, and from two to six in the afternoon, except in hot and very
 bright weather ; and then from sunrise to six in the morning, and in
 the evening from six till sunset.
    The baits for the perch are various, as well as the manner of using
 them. Of worms, the best are small lob-worms, which have no knot ;
 brandlings, and red dunghills, or those found in rotten tan, all well
 scoured.    The hook may be varied from 2 to 6, being well whipped
 to a strong silkworm gut, with a shot or two a foot from it. Put the
 point of the hook in at the head of the worm, out again a little lower
 than the middle, pushing it above the shank of the hook upon the
                                      K

gut   ; take a smaller one, beg:.nning the same way, and bring its head
up   to  the middle of the shank only; then draw the first worm down
to the head of the latter, so that the coils may hang one above the
other, keeping the point of the hook well covered.        This is the most
enticing    method  that can  be  adopted  in  worm-fishing. Use a small
cork float to keep the bait at six or twelve inches from the bottom, or
sometimes about midwater; in angling near the bottom, raise the bait
very frequently from thence almost to the surface, letting it gradually
fall again. Should a good shoal be met with, they are so greedy that
they may be all caught, unless one escapes that has felt the hook ;
then all is over, the fish that has hooked becomes restless, and, some
how or other, the whole shoal leave the place.
    Other baits for the perch are, roach, sticklebacks with the spines cut
off, miller's-thumbs, horsebeans boiled, cadbait, lobs, and gcntils;
but the best and most enticing bait is a live minnow. To draw the
fish together, three or four balls of stiff clay should be procured, and
 holes made in them ; one end of a lob-worni should be put into each
 hole, and the clay closed fast upon them, and these, a yard or two
 apart, thrown into the angling place.    If  yon find the fish shy, try not
 long in one spot.     In baiting your hook with the minnow, fix vour
 hook through his back fin, and use a small reel with your rod. 1'our
 hook should be No. 5, fastened to a link of gimp.
                              THE GRAYLING.
    The grayling is a fish of elegant form; the back is of a dusky green,
 inclining to blue; the sides of a fine silvery grey (from which the fish
 derives its name), marked with black spots, irregularly placed ; and
 when first taken, this fish seems to glitter with spangles of gold,
  [t is rather a hog-backed fish ; and, from the nose and belly touching
  the ground together, is supposed to feed mostly at the bottom. In

length it seldom exceeds sixteen inches, but some have been caught
upwards of five pounds in weight.
     The haunts of the grayling are in rapid, clear streams, particularly
such as flow through mountamous countries.1 They are usually taken
in the same manner as the trout, and with similar baits. They do not
bite freely till late in August, or early in September, and may be
found at the tails of sharp streams and in deep water.                     They rise
more boldly than the trout, and            if missed     several   times   will still
pursue the bait.      They will bite during the whole of the cold cloudy
days ; but the preferable time to look after them is between eight and
twelve o'clock m the morning, and from four in the afternoon till sifter
sunset. Grasshoppers, wasp-grubs, maggots, brandling-worms, and the
artificial fly, are the most killmg baits.
                                    THE CHUB.
     This fish takes its name from the shape of the head, not only in
our own, but in other languages.           He much resembles the carp, but
is of a larger form; the head and back are of a deep dusky green; the
sides silvery, but in the summer yellow.            The tail is forked, and of a
brownish hue; and altogether the chub is rather a handsome fish,
although its flesh is not m much esteem.
    The haunts of the chub are in rivers whose bottoms are of sand or
clay, or which flow over a rocky bottom, in deep holes, under hollow
banks ; in summer particularly, where shaded t>y trees, weeds, &c.,
they frequently float on the surface, and are sometimes found in
streams and deep waters, where the currents are strong.                    In ponds
fed by a rivulet they grow to a large size.
    To fish for chub, you should have a stout long rod, a strong line
(and if you use a reel, you will be the better able to fish under bushes),
with a yard or more of the best silkworm gut at bottom ; a hook pro
portionate to the bait used ; a swan-quill float ; and the line so shotted,
eight or ten inches from the hook, as to sink the float to a quarter of
an inch above the surface.         The same groundbait is to be used as for
carp,    and the  hook backed   with  a sufficient quantity of salmon's roe to
fill  the bend   properly :  this, rightly managed, is a tempting bait.
    By daybreak the young angler should be at the river; and, after
baitmg his hook with a cockchafer, let him move it two or three times
near the surface, as in the act of flying ; then let him drop it in the
water, tapping the rod gently, which will cause the appearance of its
struggling to escape. This attracts the chub, who are so fond of this
bait, that they will rise two or three at a time to seize it. But mind
and be ready with your landing-net.
    The chub will take a grub, wasps, maggots, paste of fine new bread
worked in the hand, and tinged with vermilion, to make it look like
salmon-roe ; but the best bait for bottom or float-fishing for the chub

is old Cheshire cheese, worked with the crumb of a new roll, or the
pith from the backbone of an ox. In baiting with the cheese, put
a round lump the size of a cherry on a large hook, so as to cover the
bend, and some way up the shank ; fish six inches from the bottom,
or in cold weather the bait may lie on the ground. When there is a
bite, the float will be drawn under water: strike immediately, and
give him play, holding a tolerably tight line, to keep the fish clear
from weeds and stumps.
   The best time for fishing for chub is chiefly before sunrise to nine
in the morning, and from four till after sunset in the summer; but, in
winter, the nuddle of the day is best. In hot weather, the chub is to
be fished for at or near the top of the water, and not deeper than
midwater; and in cold weather, close to or near the bottom; and
the main point on taking the fish is for the angler to keep himself out
of sight.
                                 THE CABP.
   Carp are esteemed among the richest fresh-water fish we have in
the kingdom, and arc as cunning as foxes. The angler, therefore, must
be "wide awake" to catch him, and also as patient as a saint.            He
may, however, fish for him at any time in the day during warm
weather.    The bait may be either worms or paste.          Of worms, the
bluish  marsh  or meadow   is the best; but a red-worm, not too big, will
do, or a large gentil : of paste, the best is made of bread and honey ;
and the spot intended should be well baited beforehand.           In a large
pond,  to draw  them   together,  throw  in  either grains, or blood  mixed
with cowdung, or bran, or any kind of garbage; follow this with
some of the small baits you intend to angle with.
   If you fish for carp with gentils, put on your hook a small piece of
scarlet cloth, about the bigness of a pea, soaked with oil-of-peter (by
some called oil-of-the-rock), and keep your gentils for two or three
days in a box smeared with honey ; and while you are fishing, chew &

                                                                    133
little bread, and throw it in about the place where your float swims.
 In this way, with due patience, you will prove a match for these
 crafty fish.
                                THE TENCH.
    The tench is one of our most useful fresh-water fishes, for the ease
with which it may be preserved and its increase promoted, and the
goodness      of its flesh. It is very usual to breed it in ponds, but
naturally, like many others of the carp tribe, it is generally found in
lakes and still waters ; its favourite haunts are in places well shaded
with bushes or rushes. In standing waters, it lies under weeds,
near sluices, and at pond-heads.
    To fish for tench, make up some paste of brown bread and honey ;
and you may use a marsh-worm, but he will take the bread in pre
ference, particularly if you add to it a little tar. He will also take a
small red-worm, the head nipped off, and a cad-worm put on the hook
first; but he will only feed in the three hot months. He will likewise

 134                      EVERY    BOY'S   BOOK.
bite at a lob-worm, or a green gentil    ; but the pastes are by far the
most killing baits.
                          THE POPE, OR BUFF,
Is something like   a perch in shape, but more bluff and bulky.     He is
found principally in slow, deep, quiet rivers, which have a loamy
bottom.     The spawning time is in April. The best baits for him are
red-worms and brandlings. The places where he is to be had are
where the water is deep and still ; and these places should be baited
with some clay-balls, with which worms are nuxed. Should the water
be muddy, worms will do alone ; but if clear, clay must be used to
render it opaque before you fish.     The fish will bite at any time of a
warm summer's day, when the sky is cloudy. In angling, use a No. 8
 or 9 hook, with a quill float ; and the moment you feel a bite, strike,
 without allowing much line.
                                THE BREAK.
     The bream, at full growth, is a large and stately fish, and is often
 times as fat as a hog.    He is principally found in large ponds or in
 lakes, and in still rivers where the waters are deep and shaded by
 weeds ; and may be taken in summer from May to the end of Septem
 ber; and in these months from sunrise to eight o'clock in the morning,
 and from five o'clock till twilight in the evening.
     The baits are many : paste made of brown bread and honey, gen-
 tils, wasp-grubs, flag-worms, and brandlings. Use lob-worms, cut in
 pieces, and grains, as groundbaits in the places where you intend to
 angle.   Use a gut line, quill float, and No. 10 hook. Sound the
 bottom, which should be eight or ten feet deep, and stand at least
 two yards from the bank from which you fish.        Strike as soon as you
 feel a "bite."

                            THE FLODNDEB.
   The flounder is a well-known flat-fish very common about our own
coasts ; and should any of our young friends be at the seaside, it is
well that they should know how to take flounder. They are also found
m rivers, at some distance from the sea. They may be taken in May,
July, and August, — not in June, as that is their spawning time. The
best baits are red-worms and marsh-worms, on a No. 6 hook ; and you
should fish at the bottom, trailing the bait gently along.
                                  EELS.
   Eels are denizens of the mnd ; but they are fond of clean, not foul
mud, and ought never    to be sought after in filthy places.   There are
many modes of taking     them : by rod and line, by dead line, by snig
gling, by bobbing, and  by spearing.    When a rod is used, you should
put a maggot or red-worm on a No. 8 hook ; the bait should touch
the bottom ; and, when you have a
                                     " bite," the float should be drawn
quite under water before you strike.

 136                        EVERY     BOY'S  BOOK.
   The dead line is a line of whipcord, with hooks about six inches
asunder, baited with lob-worms or small fish.        You should also have
a bank-runner — a reel on a pin or stake stuck into the ground on the
edge of the bank; the line and baits should be thrown in, and left for
the eels to amuse themselves with, — looked to, and drawn up at your
leisure.
   In sniggling, a lob-worm is put upon a stout worsted needle ; the
line is on a winder; and the fish will be found near flood-gates,
wharflngs, bridges, piles, holes in the banks of rivers, ponds, and
canals.     The bait should be put into the lurking-places of the eel, by
means of a stick with a forked head ; and when the bait is taken,
which will easily be known by the pull of the string, strike.
   Bobbing for eels. — In this process long red-worms are strung on
      threads of worsted, until a bunch as large as the two fists is formed
      around a piece of lead.      The whole is sunk to the bottom, or
      nearly  so, then raised a little, then depressed, so as to induce the
       eels to bite.   When this occurs, heave up without hurry. The
       number of eels taken in this way is often prodigious.
          In spearing eels, the spearer usually goes into the mud in a
       pair of pants or mud pattens, pieces of square board fastened
       into the heel to prevent sinking.      He takes an eel-spear in his
       hand, something like Neptune's trident, and progs the mud all
       under (not all over), and the eels are caught between the
     I forked blades of the spear.        Great numbers of eels are taken
        in this way on the muddy ooze of salt or fresh-water rivers.
                      THE STICKLEBACK AND MINNOW.
    The stickleback is a dark-coloured little fish, found in ditches and
  ponds.     They are best caught with a small hand-net, and are used

as bait for perch.    The minnow is very beautiful in appearance, being
of a rose colour underneath, and may be taken with a worin and a
No. 13 hook at any time of day; but more easily with a small hand-
uet.    They are commonly found in little rivulets, rills, or small sandy
streams, and are highly prized by the angler as baits for many kinds
of fish.
                                 THE BARBEL.
   The barbel is a bold, sturdy, handsome-looking fish, although its
flesh is coarse to the eater; but he is a rare fellow for sport, and
often affords great amusement as well as chagrin to the angler by his
bolting off with the line by a " coup de barbel," and breakmg it with
his tail Isaac Walton says, that barbel " flock together like sheep."
   Barbel are to be found in the strongest runs of water. In summer,
they love the shallowest and sharpest streams, and will lurk under
weeds, and will root and dig in the sand like pigs.           Sometimes he

retires to deep and swift bridges, or to flood-gates or weirs, and will
rest himself against piles or hollow places.        In winter, he gets into
 deep water.
    In fishing for barbel in large streams, you should go out in a boat pro
 vided with greaves, gentils, and red-worms; and, before you begin fish
                                                  —
 ing, you should throw in plenty of groundbait such as soaked greaves,
bran and clay made into small balls, maggots, and a paste made of
 sheep's suet, cheese, and honey compounded together.           They may be
 angled   for with a stout  rod,  strong running line, cork float, and No. 7
 or 8 hook, baited with marsh-worms or greaves.         The barbel being a
 sharp biter, strike the moment you feel a nibble. He may be caught

from May to October all day, but best in the morning and evening.
After he is struck he will frequently make a run, but you must play
with him gently; keep him clear of weeds, and try to get him mto
deep water; in hauling him to land mind what you are about, or you will
be safe to lose him; and when you have him, mind he does not bounce
out of your hand and drop down the stream again.
                                FLY-FISHING.
    Fly-fishing, as its name imports, means fishing with a fly. The
fly, however, may be a natural fly, or an artificial fly; as, notwith
standing the march of intellect, fish have not yet learned to tell one
from the other; and, till this shall be the case, we may anticipate much
                   "                                                "
sport with the fly;" for fly-fishing is infinitely preferable to bottom-
fishing," and is a vast deal more gentlemanly and elegant         — requiring
more address, neatness, skill, and tact ; and above all, fly-fishing does
not require such cruel preparations in the impaling of worms, grubs,
grasshoppers or brandlings. The fly-fisher, rod in hand, and his book
of flies m his pocket, free from all encumbrance, roams for miles along
the banks of some beautiful stream, listening to the melody of birds
and waters, and regaled by the smell of herbs and flowers, and en
joying health, exercise, and recreation.
    Fly-fishing requires a hawk's eye and a lady's hand ; and is to be
practised with a rod of proportionate length and strength to the
breadth of the stream, running tackle and fine line. The natural flies
are the stone fly, found by the sides of rivers under stones, &c. ; the
hawthorn fly, found on hawthorn trees ; the ash fly, or oak fly, usually
found under the bark of the oak or ash-tree ; ant flies, found in ant
hills ; fern flies, found among ferns ; and the green drake, commonly
                                             fly
called the May fly.       The common         is   also used upon occasion.
These may be found in the various months of the vear. In March
(he horsedung and cowdung flies may be used for various fish.
In April the dun or brown drake fly. In May the stone fly, and
yellow May fly, and black caterpillar fly are Inning             In Jane the
lady fly, the black and blue gnat, and the red spinner must be looked
for. In July we have the orange fly, the large red ant fly, and the
badger fly.      In August the hazel fly and small blue          fly
                                                                   are killing
baits;   and  in             the willow  fly concludes  the flying season, so

save him  a    vast deal of trouble; at all events he must always be pro

     In making yonr fly, inutate as nearly as possible the natural              fly
                                                                                you
wish to represent to do this properly,
                        ;                           it  will be well to dissect          a
natural fly, and to imitate its several parts, and then to reconstruct
it  with  a  reference to the whole. With      a    hook of the proper size, and
a  feather of the right      colour,  the fly-maker may now commence.           His
feather must be stripped down on each side, leaving just so much
as will do for the wings at the fine end       ;   a piece of fine gut, free from
imperfection,      and   properly    tested   as  to  its strength; dubbing or
 hackle   ; and     piece
                    a      of  fine silk well  waxed    with shoemaker's wax.
     Let the essay be now made. Hold your hook the left hand, wrap
                                                               in
the silk round the bare hook two or three times, and put the finest
end of the gut on the under side of the hook.                 If
                                                               you are working for
a   tackle  fly, begin  at  the  band   and  work   up  to the  head, after turning
 three or four times round the hook and gut fasten on the tackle, and
                                                       ;
 continue the winding of the silk until        it   reaches the end of the hook,
 then turn     itback two or three times, to form the head. The dubbing
 must now be twisted round the silk, and wrapped upon the hook for
 nearly half the proposed length of the body; fasten
                                                                                      by

                                                                          it          a
 single loop, that both hands may be at liberty to manage the tackle.
     When sufficient of the feather       is    wound upon the hook, the re
 mainder should be held under the thumb of the left hand, and the
 entangled fibres picked out with         a     needle.    The silk and dubbing
 must now be twisted over the end of the tackle, until the body of the
 fly is  of the length required, and then fastened. If gold or silver
 twist    is used, the twist should be fastened to the lower end of the
 body    before  the dubbing  is    applied to the silk.
      To make a winged fly, the same method must be observed                   in
                                                                               tying

    It would of course be impossible, in a work of this description, to
give a list of all the artificial flies used by experienced fishermen, but
the above are a few of the most killing.           For bleak, dace, roach,
chub, &c., a piece of a maggot, or a small piece of white leather, should
be placed at the end of the hook.
    Having thus given the
                                " order of flies," natural and artificial, we
may imagine the young fly-fisher, with rod in hand, proportionate to
his strength and the breadth of the stream, ready to throw his fly;
but let his rod and running tackle be in good order, and the idea of
the coachman's whip out of his mind.          He is not to flog the water,
but to tickle it. The novice should teach himself to handle the line,
by beginning with it alone, (i.e. without flies or hook,) trying a short
length first, and lengthening it gradually. In using the rod, it should
be drawn gently back without force, and thrown forward again when
the line has reached its full extent behind him.        Take care in doing
this, that the fly be not whipped off. When tolerably expert, put on
one fly, and try awhile with that, adopting two or three when able
to use them properly.
     In fly-fishingjceep as far from the water as possible, especially if
fishing for trout.    Let only the  fly  touch the water, and keep moving
it gently and slowly    on the  surface.   Whena   fish rises, leta  moment
elapse before yon strike, and then do     it  sharply.  If   your tackle be
sufficiently strong, take your fish out at once; but,    if   fishing froma
bridge or high bank,  it   may be necessary to play him.
   When you have two flies on your line, you must try to throw your
line so that the bottom    fly shall reach the water first;  itmust be done

always as lightly as possible, so that it may resemble a natural                         fly
settling upon the water. You must suffer the line to float gently
down the stream, at the same time dragging along towards you to the
left hand.
    The best time for angling with the fly   when thereis      gentle    isa
breeze  upon  the water  south; and west winds  are to be  preferred,
when the water has been disturbed          by
                                      heavy rains and   just resum  is
ing its natural colour, or when the day     dull and cloudy after
                                                      is                                 a
moonlight night. The best time, morning and evening.         In cold
weather the fish bite deeper, and you should then let the      sink           fly        a
little. Take care to have the wind in your back, and the sun in your
face,   if   possible.
   When you see       rise, throw your
                         a                      fly
                                              about half   yard above the
                                                                a
fish's nose, and let      fall down with the stream watch

and strike as the fish rises, giving him an "infinite little moment" to
taste. When you have hooked, play your fish carefully, keeping up
his head and running him down the stream, at the same time driving
him towards you.         If
                         you see    fish rise at
                                      a           natural fly, throw your
                                                       a
bait    little before hnn, so that he may take
        a                                                 as "one of the

   To know what flies the fish are most likely to take, observe what
natural flies are about the water, or on the grass, trees, or bushes in

   THE {?arne of cricket is the noblest of English pastimes.        It com
bines athletic power, grace, quickness of eye and of hand, nimbleness
of leg, and scientific skill.  It is played oy high and low, rich and
poor, man and boy ; and there is no game, either native or foreign,
can compete with it for manliness, fairness, and healthfulness.       Everv
one should learn to play         it,
                                 and all should begin early.        How

originated, or who evolved its beautiful laws and regulations,              it
now difficult to discover.    We have nothing like        among the sports
of the Greeks and Romans, and we can       only trace

the time of Henry m. in the Royal Library, presents two players
only ; and he who is possessed of the bat, holds the ball also, which
he either threw into the air, and struck with his bat as it descended,
or cast forcibly upon the ground, and beat it away when it rebounded.
But   we should be rather inclined to trace the game of cricket -to
trap-ball, which was, no doubt, an improvement upon the early games
played with the bat and ball. This may be traced as far back as the
fourteenth century, and a curious specimen of the manner in which it
was then played is given on p. 39, from a beautiful MS. in the pos
session of Francis Douce, Esq.     Here are only two players, but the
game then consisted of six or eight of a side, and the size of the bat
mdicates the holder to have possessed no great judgment in striking
                                              " stool-ball," from
the ball. There was another game, called                          which
some have supposed cricket to have been derived ; but there is no
evidence in favour of this position, and it seems rather more rea
sonable to look upon it as a modification of "trap-ball" than any
other game.

14G                         EVERY   BOYS BOOK.
   About a hundred years ago, the wicket was only two straight, thin
batons, called
               "
                 stumps," which were fixed into the ground six inches
apart, and over the top of which was laid a cross piece of wood, called
    " bail." There was at this time little
the                                         regulation with regard to
the length of bats or weight of balls.     But in course of time the
width ot the bat was prescribed to four and a quarter inches, and the
weight of the ball was regulated so as not to be less than five ounces
and a half, or more than five ounces and three-quarters ; while the
stumps were increased to three and the bails to two, and gradually
the game was scientifically improved.     Rules and regulations were
made, arising from the necessities of the play; and we have now, as
the result of more than a century of
                                      "
                                        playing" and methodizing, an
athletic game almost as scientific and complete as the sedentary one
of chess.
                        SINGLE   AND DOUBLE WICKET.
  There are two games of cricket,          one of which        is called Single
Wicket, and the other Double Wicket.
                   OF    THE GAME    OF SINGLE       WICKET.
   Single wicket is usually played by five persons on each side, but
the numbers may be varied at the discretion of the parties.
   At single wicket, the " striker," with his bat, is the protector of
                                the wicket; the opponent party stand
                                in the field to eaten or stop the ball,
                                and the "bowler," who is one of them,
                               takes his place by the side of a small
                               baton or stump, set up for that purpose,
                               twenty-two yards from the wicket, and
                               thence delivers the ball, with the inten
                               tion of beating it down. It is now usual
                               to set up two stumps, with a bail across,
                               which the batsman, when he runs, must
                               beat off before he returns home.       theIf
                               bowler proves successful, the batsman
                               retires from the play, and another party
                               succeeds.    If, on the contrary, the ball
                               is struck by the bat, and driven into
                               the field beyond the reach of those who
                               stand out to stop        it,
                                                      the striker runs to
the stump or stumps at the bowler's station, which he strikes with
his bat so as to throw off the bail, and then returns to his wicket. If
this be performed before the ball     isthrown back, and       one of the
                                                                 by
players struck against the wicket so as to knock its b'ail off,           it   is
called " run," and
      a                notch or score
                        a                   made upon the tally towards
                                           is
the game. If, on the contrary, the ball       thrown up, and tlie wicket,
                                                is
beaten down   by the opponent party, before the striker      home or can
                                                               is

                                 CRICKET.                            147
ground his bat within three feet ten inches of the wicket (at which
distance a mark is made in the ground, called the "popping-crease"),
he is declared to be
                     " out," and the run is not reckoned. He is also
out if he strikes the ball into the air, and it is caught by any of his
antagonists before it reaches the ground.
                        PAB.TICIJLABS     OP   THE GAME.
   The above is a general outline of the game, but it will be necessarv
to inform the young cricketer of a few other important matters which
enter into its particulars.
   The first innings at smgle-wicket must be determined by chance.
The bowler should pitch the wickets, and the striker measure the
distance from the bowling-stump.
   Measure a distance the length of the bat, and then one of the
striker's feet, from the middle stump, in a direction towards the
bowling-stump : there make a mark.       This is the popping-crease, as
in double-wicket.
   Now begin to play. Place your bat upright on the mark at the
place where your measure came to the poppmg-crease, and this will
show you are on the ground, and ready.
   The bowler now begins to bowl, and first cries "Play." The striker
or batsman now strikes at the ball as it comes within the range of his
bat ; or if it comes in a bad manner, or should it not be convenient
for him to strike it,         " block" it. But in
                      he may                       blocking he must be
careful never to let the tip of the bat come before the handle; as the
ball in sucha   case would probably rise in the air, and the
                                                             " blocker"
would be caught out.
   Should the batsman strike the ball, he ought, should the ball       fly
wide enough, immediately to run towards the bowling-stump, bat in
hand.    He should strike the bowling-stump, and then return to the
popping-crease, and, grounding his bat on the mark, he       home.
                                                                is
                   THE LAWS FOR SINGLE WICKET.
    1.When there shall be less than four players on        side, bounds
                                                                a
shall be placed, twenty-two yards each, in       line from the off and
                                                    a
leg stump.
    2.The ball must be hit before the bounds to entitle the striker to
a  run, which run cannot be obtained unless he touch the bowling-
stumpor crease in line with
                   a               with his bat or person.
                                    it,
    3. When the striker shall hit the ball, one of his feet must be on
the ground behind the poppiner-crease, otherwise the umpire shall
call " No hit."
    4.When there shall be less than five players of      side, neither
                                                                a
byes nor overthrows shall be allowed; nor shall the striker be caught
out behind the wicket, nor stumped out.
     The fieldsman must return the ball so that
    5.                                           shall cross the

bowling-stumps and the bounds. The striker may run till the ball be
so returned.
   6. After the striker has made one run, ho must touch the bowling-
stump, and run before thei ball shall cross the play, to entitle him to
another.
   7. The striker shall be entitled to three runs for lost ball, and the
same number for ball stopped with bat or other object.
   8 When there shall be more than four players to a side, there
shall be no bounds : all " hits," " byes," and " overthrows" will then
be allowed.
   9. The bowler is subject to the same laws as at double wicket.
  10. No more than one minute shall be allowed between each ball.
                           ADDITIONAL PARTICULABS.
  With   three players, the bowler and striker will be the same as
when two are at play. The second player will be fieldsman, who,
when the ball be hit nearer to him than to the bowler, will pick it up,
or catch it if he can, and return it to the bowler.
     If
      the striker should attempt to run, the bowler should imme
diately run to the wicket, and the fieldsman should throw the ball to
him, so that he may catch      and touch the wicket with
                                    it,                     to get the            it,
striker out.
   When the first striker    out, the fieldsman will take his place; the
                                   is
striker will bowl, and the bowler will take the field.
   When four players are engaged, the fourth should stand behind the
wicket; when more than four play, the additional players should take
the field.
   The rule in the case when many play                      is,
                                              that as soon as striker              a         is
out he becomes bowler then he becomes wicket-keeper, and then he
                               ;
takes his place in the field on the left of the bowler, and afterwards
the other places     regular progression, until
                      in                                his turn to haveit   is

   Sometimes,   as the distance    of twenty-two yards between the
bowling-stump and the wicket        too great, as the above distance has

   The object of the game is to get the greatest number of runs, and
this is to be done by the strikers.     Each side having been in once,
and out once, the first innings are concluded ; but in most matches
other innings are played.     The scorers keep the account of runs to
each striker, separately for each innings.    The side that has obtained
thegreatest number of runs wins the game.
   The players consist of the " in" party and the " out" party. To
determme which shall be " in" party first, it is usual to toss up for
first innings. The party that wins then sends two batsmen to the
wicket, and the out party takes the field, the bowler to give the balls,
and the remainder as shown in the diagram.            The object of the
bowler is to strike down the wicket ; that of the batsmen to defend
it. The object of the other parties is to catch the ball, or to stop                               it,

   The batsman should stand      as close   to the block-hole as possible,
                               and as near to the popping-crease as he
                               can, so as to be on his ground; but
                               he must not stand before his wicket.
                               His right foot should stand firmly just
                               behind the popping-crease ; his left foot
                               shouldbe at ease, and towards the bowler.
                               The bat should be held so as to cover
                               the middle stump of the wicket ; and
                              the striker should keep his left shoulder
                               forward, and the left elbow well up.
                                  In  striking the ball, the hands should
                               be pretty close together, but free of

the opposite partner. Look towards the wicket it is your intention
to save from the returned ball, and ground your bat by a long reach
as soon as you can.      Run rapidly the first time, and try to get

The ball sTiould be delivered with     run, with one foot in and should ;
be held with the seam across, so that the
ends of the fingers touch it. If the bowler
wishes to make his ball twist after leaving
his hand, he gives    dexterous turn with
                     it  a
the back of his hand to the ground. The
object of the bowler being to get out the
striker  by sending his ball through the
wicket, or to give nun such balls as will
puzzle him to block or to obtain        run     a
from, he should vary the style and
strength of his bowlmg from time to
time.   It beet to bowl slow at first,

about five yards for quick bowling.

Is   placed about    ayard and half behind the wicket, and stands with
his left  foot forward; his eyes and hands seem ever ready for action.
The best wicket-keeper we ever knew was Captain Ponsonby, of the
Zingaree Club, who seemed to be

sometimes vary their places. They must be able to throw the ball up
well to the wicket-keeper. Long-field off side covers mid-wicket.

    1.  No bet is payable    in any match    unless  it be played out or
 given up.

 bet depends on the first mnings, unless otherwise specified,
    3. If the bet be made upon both innings, and one party beats the
 other in one innings, the runs in the first innings shall determine it.
    4. If  the other party go in a second time, then the bet must be
 determined by the number in the second.
                   GENERAL    HINTS AND INSTRUCTIONS.
    Dress. — A horse-hair  cap, which is light to the head, and acts as a
 ventilator, having a narrow peak to shelter the eyes, without impeding
the sight, is best for the head. A leather jacket, or a Guernsey, well
 spun, is best for the body while playing, and a good soft Welch
flannel one to slip on when playing is over, is good for the body.
A pair of chequed woollen trowsers, mode moderately tight, but free
for running, with a gutta percha belt running through the waisthand,
is good for the nether limbs.     The feet should be encased in worsted
socks, and the shoes should have hard soles, with a few spikes
upon them.       There are certain parts of the body which ought to be
padded, of which cricketers wifl inform yon.        And for bruises acci
dentally gained, there is nothing like Mcasom's Medicated Cream, of
which every cricketer should have a supply.
    Hints upon Baiting. — Ground your bat exactly opposite the middle
stump of the wicket, and keep your left shoulder well forward.
Practise well the method of hitting upright, arid keep the handle of
the bat well inclined towards the bowler. In forward play it is not
safe to play the bat above four feet from the pitch of the ball. When
balls come wide, say five or six inches, cross your left leg over
without moving your right, and you may hit all such balls.          Never
step on to strike if you can possibly avoid it. The best balls to meet
are those that come just within the popping crease, and they should
be struck promptly and with vigour, and sent in the right direction.
    Hints upon Bowling. — The Bowler should use one particular method
in delivermg the ball, and keep to the same distance.          lie should
endeavour to discover the weak stump of the batsman, and play
against it.    He should give fair balls; for there is a gentlemanly way
of playing, as well as an nngentlemanly one. The most puzzling
balls are those pitched rather wide of the leg, or off stump.
    Defence of the Wicket. — The defence of the wicket consists princi-

pally in blocking and striking, and the great error of young cricketers
is in " slashing at every ball that falls either in or out of their way.
It requires considerable judgment to know when to strike and when
to block a ball. In blockmg, he should be careful to smother the ball
on the home block, and in striking, not to spoon      it,
                                                        so as to give the
opportunity    of
                a   catch.  One of the  most  effective   defences of the
wicket     called the draw, which
          is                       isadopted  when    aball   pitched some
feet short in length comes up within the line of the leg stump.         In
this, the bat  is  drawn up with its point to the ground in perpen
                                                               a
dicular line, and the "hop of the ball" caught          a little above its
centre.
    Hints upon running. — When the ball    isstruck, follow its direction
with your eye, and "run" the moment         it    out of the way of the
                                                 is
fieldsman.  Do not be in too great hurry to run as soon as you take
                                    a
your innings, but play    alittle first, and wait till the opportunity
occurs. Be careful and not lose your caution and circumspection
after one or two successful runs, or you will soon find yourself
" bowled out " or "
                    stumped."

   A KV i  o>i horseback is a king on his throne ; he feels more than
 "boy" the     moment he gets astride of anything in the shape of a
nag. Boys have an instinct for riding, an impulse they cannot resist,
like the instinct for eating, breathmg or moving. In his earliest
                     " boyhood of
days, in the very                      being," Ride a cock horse to Banbury
Cross, is a ditty of infinite delight, and long before the davs of cor-
deroys, the equestrian exercise of "Grandfather's Stick" aftords him
"joy ineffable." Then comes the noble game of Hippas, or the
wooden "Bucephalus,"          on which he feels greater than Alexander;
and last, though verv little, yet still not least, the "pet Shetland,"
which adds to the bliss of oeing mounted, a positive progressive
locomotion, and the "greater than Alexander" is made greater still.
Considering, therefore, that all boys love riding, it is for^us to tell
them how they may "mount the fiery Pegasus," and^ride with
elegance and safety,

                     THE HORSE AND ITS CHARACTER,
    If the lion be the king of beasts, the horse is the emperor.       His
great services to mankind and his noble nature claim our highest
admiration. His courage, strength, fleetness, his symmetrical form
and grandeur of deportment, captivate our minds ; nor is this all, for
when called to bear the warrior to the battle field, nothing can excel
his resolute fierceness, his courageous ardour.            In the poetical
language    of the  sacred  writings,
                                       " His  neck is clothed with thunder,
the glory of his nostrils is terrible: he paweth the valley, and rejoiceth
in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh
at danger; and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the
sword.
    The generic characteristics of the horse are a broad and wide hoof;
six cutting teeth or nippers in each jaw ; two very small tusks or
canines; grinders, with a flat crown, presenting when worn different
figures, formed by the enamelled plates of the interior. His thin and
muscular lips act in some degree as a hand when cropping the grass,
and he is enabled by a peculiar structure of the bones and muscles of
his face so to move his jaws as to grind down his corn.          His age is
known by his teeth.
                  HOW A HORSE'S AGE MAY BE KNOWN.
    There are various ways of telling the age of a horse, but that most
depended upon is a careful inspection of the teeth.         Five days after
birth, the four teeth in front, called " nippers," begin to shoot; these
are cast off at the age of two years and a half, but are soon renewed,
and in the following year two above and two below, namely, one on
 each side of the nippers, are also thrown off; at four years and a half
 other four, next those last placed, fall off, and are succeeded by other
 four, which grow much more slowly. From those last four corner
 teeth it is that the animal's age is distinguished, for they are some
 what hollow in the middle, and have a black mark in the cavities. At
 five years old these teeth scarcely rise above the gums ; at six, their
 hollow pits begin to fill up, and turn to a brown spot, and before
 eight years the mark generally disappears.           A horse's age is also
 indicated by the canine teeth or tusks, for those in the under row
 generally shoot at three years and a half, and the two on the upper at
 four; till six they continue sharp at the points, but at ten they appear
 long and blunted. After the inside of a horse's teeth are worn out
 it is very difficult to tell a horse's age, and horse jockeys have various
 artful tricks which deceive the unwary.
                         THE PACES     OP THE HORSE.
    The horse has three natural paces, namely, walking, trotting, and
gttlloping.     In the first he moves off with one of the fore feet,
 which is immediately followed by the hind leg on the opposite side,

 160                      EVERY   BOY'S BOOK.
 and so with the other fore and hind leg.       His trot differs from his
 walk, not only in its greater velocity, but also in this, that he always
 moves the two opposite legs together. The gallop is a series of leaps,
 and it is true ana regular, when the horse lifts his two feet on one
 side at the same time, and follows with those on the other side.
These three natural paces may be converted into artificial paces by
the skill and tact of the rider, as we shall have occasion to advert to
as we proceed.
              PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS      OF  THE HORSE.
    A horse should have the breast broad, the hips round, and the
mane long ; the countenance noble and fiery, without being wicked.
He should have a nose like a sheep, or rather of an eagle form; the
head, legs, and skin of a deer; the throat and neck of a wolf; the
ear and tail of a fox: so sayeth the old writer Camerarius; and we
may add to this somewhat too general a description, that the head
should be rather small than large, and well set in the neck; the eye
should be large and a little prominent, and the eyelid fine and thin ;
the ear should be small and erect, and quick in motion, and the
nostril   expanded.    Capacity of chest is also essential in every
horse.    The thighs should be very muscular, and the hocks well bent
and well under the knee.
                      SOMETHING    ABOUT PONIES.
    A horse between thirteen and fourteen hands high is called a
 'Galloway," from a beautiful breed of little horses once found in
the south of Scotland, on the shores of the Solway Firth, supposed

to be originally of Spanish extraction, and a relic of the Spanish
Armada. They are the best of all horses for boy riding, and they
will sometimes perform wonders.      Dr. Anderson had one, whom he
rode for twenty-five years, and twice during that time he rode him
more than a hundred miles in one day; and in 1754, Mr. Cooper's
galloway went one hundred miles a day for three successive days over
the Newmarket course without any signs of fatigue.       Many of the
galloways now in use are procured either from Wales or the new
forest.  The Welch pony is one of the most beautiful little animals
that can be imagined.   He will live on low common fare and never
tire. The Shetland pony is a beautiful little animal for very little
riders; and  I remember one, the owner of whom shall be nameless,
who was bought for five pounds, at a country fair, and was carried
home in a four wheeler.   Then let my young friend get a " galloway,"
or a Shetland, and by attending to what is to follow, he will soon
learn how to ride.
                         HOHSE EQUIPMENTS.
   These consist in riding of bridle, saddle, whip, and spurs.     The
saddler ought to fit the horse, and the rider ougnt to fit the saddle;
besides which, the rider and -the horse ought in some degree to match.
A short podgy youth looks very ill upon a long-legged spare horse,
and a long spare man very ill upon a podgy horse. The saddle should
press only on the ribs on either side     of1the back bone, leaving
                                         In putting on the saddle,  it a
thorough channel above the spine.
should be placed so that the pressure should be clear of the shoulders
and loins. The pommel should be as low as possible, bnt not resting
on the points of the shoulders.  A   high pommel isvery dangerous, as
isa hign cantle, i e. the part that rises behind. The 'skirts or flaps

162                         EVERY   BOY S BOOK.
should be long and wide, and the pommels sufficiently wide, but not
so much so as to cut the horse's ribs.        The stirrup leather should be
broad, well made, and strong. The stirrup irons should fit the rider's
feet, and yet be so roomy that he can easily disengage himself from
them.
    The Sit and Bridle. — The bit is composed of five principal pieces,

                                          which should be in the corner of
                                          the horse's mouth, without press

                                          freedom. The snaffle is preferable
                                          for common use in every way;
 out if the rider cannot control his horse, he must resort to the
curb bit, which should be hooked underneath the snaffle.
                          PREPARATIONS     TO MOUNT.
     Your horse being saddled and bridled, the young horseman has
 now to mount ; but before doing this, he should be careful to look
well at the equipments, and observe whether the saddle be rightlv
placed, the stirrup straps of the right length, the saddle girths well
 secured and properly tightened, or if the bits be placed too high or
 too low, and the throat strap too loose or too tight.
                         HOW TO MOUNT THE HORSE.
     In mounting, the rider approaches the horse near the left shoulder,
  with his left breast near that shoulder, his whip being in his left
 hand. He next draws up the snaffle reins gently with his right hand,
 so as to equalise them and get their centre; he then passes them
 between the second and third fingers of his left hand. He next places
 his left hand, and with the riahl throws the loose end of the rems to
  the off-side of the horse.    He next takes hold of a lock of the mane
 with the    left hand, holding with it the bridle ; with the right hand he
 holds the stirrup by its strap, so that he can put his left foot in it on
 the inner side ; and having done this, his right hand is now placed
  upon the off cantle of the saddle, grasping it firmly; he then springs
  leisurely from the right foot, rises erect in the stirrup, brings his
  heels together for an instant, and then passes the right leg, well
  extended, over the rear of the horse ; at the same time ne shifts his
   hand to the pommel, or off holster, and thus seats himself quietly.

Be careful in not taking the reins too short, lest it should make the
horse rear, run, or fall back ; they ought also to be of an equal
length, and just tight enough to let the horse know that you
                                                                  " hold
him," and no more.
                      POSITION   IN THE SADDLE.
   The rider should be upright, but without stiffness ; the head held
up with ease, the small of the back drawn in, the chest protruded,
the thighs and legs turned in without restraint, so that the forepart
of the mside of the knees may press on the saddle, and the legs hang
down easily and naturally; the feet being parallel to the horse s sides,
neither turned in nor out, but so that the toes should be kept a little
higher than the heels. By this position, the natural weight of the
thighs has a proper and sufficient pressure of itself, and the legs are
in readiness to act when necessary ; for which purpose, they should
always be near the horse's sides, but without touching or tickling
them.
                     POSITION WHEN       nr MOTION.
   The body must be kept easy and firm when in motion, the left
elbow should lean gently against the body a little forward, and the
hand in general should be of about the same height as the elbow; the
right arm must be placed in symmetry with the left, only let the
right hand be a little more forward or backward, as occasion may
require. The left hand, which holds the reins, must be kept clear of
the body, about two inches and a half forward from        it,
                                                            and imme
diately above the pommel of the -saddle; the nails should be turned
towards the buttons of the waistcoat, and the wrist   alittle rounded
with ease, the joint being kept perfectly pliable.

                              TO DISMOUNT.
   Seize the surplus part of the reins with the right   hand, and place
it on the off holster  ; at the same time slip the left  hand along the
reins, and  grasp a lock of the mane ; throw the right   foot out of the
stirrup, and pass the right leg well extended over       the croup, and
without touching the horse, shifting the right hand with the reins to
the cantle.     Now bring the right heel against the left, remain an
instant erect in the stirrup, then descend lightly to the ground on the
right foot, and disengage the left, placing the reins over the pommel
of the  saddle.
                       HOW TO HOLD THE REINS.
    When you ride with a snaffle, which is the best for young riders,
you have, of course, only one rein to attend to.    In holdmg this, you

                             HORSEMANSHIP.                           165
are to j>ass the left rein under your little finger, the right rein under
the third finger, keeping them both smooth through the hand, and
with the bight of the rein hanging over the fore-finger, the thumb
being closed firmlyon both the reins, which pass between the thumb
and fore-finger.    When, however, the curb is used to the horse, you
have to hold two reins instead of one; the curb rein and the snafHe
rein. In this case, the curb reins are held as we have described the
snaffle reins to be, and the snaffle reins are placed as follow : the left
snafHe rein enters under the second finger, and the right under the
first finger, both passing up through the hand, and out of it over the
fore-finger, and are held together as one.      No description, however,
can possibly teach the manner of holding the reins, and the young
rider must be shown by some one who knows how to hold and
handle them.
   Both bits should not act at the same time, but the reins should be
so adjusted as to make either bit take effect by slightly turning the
hand towards the body, nails upwards, for the curb, and upwards and
towards the body, naus downwards, for the snaffle.
               SHORTENING    OB LENGTHENING THE REINS.
    It will often be required of the young rider to shorten or lengthen
his reins while in the act of riding, and he ought to learn to do this
with judgment and expertness.        To shorten or lengthen the hold on
either rem, take the surplus part of either rein with the right hand,
and shift the bridle hand ; supporting the horse with the right hand
meanwhile, and feeling his steps, slip the left hand up or down the
reins to adjust them at pleasure. In doing this, do not move the left
hand from its position, but merely slacken the fingers ; then hold as
before.
                     POSITION  O? THE BRIDLE-HAND.
   The hand should be in a right line with the elbow, which should as
from the upper arm hang naturally. The distance of the hand above
the pommel should be about four inches, and one inch in advance of
it. The palm of the hand should be turned sufficiently to the right

166                      EVERY      BOY S BOOK.
to keep the elbow close and in a proper position, the thumb pointing
to the horse's off-ear.
                       IBS   SEAT AND BALANCE.
   The seat should be on that part of the horse which is the centre of
motion, and is to be maintained only by a proper balance of the body,
the clasp of the thighs and calves, when required, and the bending of
the back, being all that is necessary to preserve the equilibrium.   A
good  rider never  holds  on by the  bridle or bv the stirrups, and his
movements always harmonise with those of tne animal : m short, he
and the horse seem all of a piece ; and when the horse feels this, he
has great confidence in his rider, and will do anything.
                              THE STIRRUPS.
                                 The stirrups should hang with the eye
                              inside, and the flat sides of the leather
                              against the saddle-skirts; and when the
                              rider's foot is in  it,the flat side of the
                              leather should be next his leg. When the
                              foot  isplaced in the stirrup, the ball of the
                              great toe should rest upon the inner side
                              of the bottom iron. The heel should be
                              an inch lower than the toe, and the foot
                              parallel to the horse's side. The reason
                              why the heel should be lower than the toe
                              is, that the angle at which the foot  is then
                          placed gives more resistance, and has more
                          hold upon the stirrup iron. The young
                          rider must understand that he    not to ride
                                                              is
                          on his stirrups, as they are only intended
                          to support the weight of the legs, and
to enable him to mount and  dismount.
                TO CROSS     THE BEINS IN EITHER HAND.
   To cross the reins in the right hand, draw the left rein over the
first finger, and through the right hand, the surplus part hanging
below on the off side of the withers, and drop the left hand to
the side.
   To cross the reins in the left hand, draw the right rein over the
first finger and through the left hand, the surplus part hanging below
the little finger on the near side of the withers, and drop the right
hand to the side.
                 FACES AND MOTIONS OF THE HOBSB.
   Walking. — The   horse in walking has four distinct treads or beats,
as each foot touches    the ground   as follows
                                     ;           first, the right or off
                                                  :
fore-foot
        ;   second, the left or near hind-foot  third, the near or left
                                                  ;

                              HORSEMANSHIP.                                167
                                                                        is easy
fore-foot ; and fourth, the right or off hind-foot. This pace
                                                                of their  walk ;
to the horse, but horses vary greatly in the quickness
some horses will walk as quickly as others will trot.           The perfection
of walking is when     the  horse  puts  his  feet  flatly  on  the ground, m
regular time and exact distances.       To keep a horse to a good brisk
walk, some exertion is necessary on the part of the rider, who should
  keep his reins moderately tight, sit steadily in his seat, and
                                                                         animate
  him by the pressure      of the  thigh,  or  by  the   voice.    Without    this
  attention on the rider's part, he will get        into   a slovenly  habit,   or
  perhaps stop altogether.
     In turning, the horse should be moved gently round, and plenty of
  room be given him.       The bridle hand should be slightly raised, and
  then drawn to the side, the legs corresponding with the motion ; thus
  one rein is tightened on the side to which the horse is turned, and
  the other presses slightly against the horse's neck, both of which he
  understands. But some caution is necessary in regard to the pressure
  of the legs ; for if one is closer than the other, the horse will throw
  his haunches out or in, which will cause a shortening of the step in
  one of the hind legs, and consequently the stride will be diminished.
  When the turn is finished, the rider, of course, returns to his former
  position.
      Trotting. — In trotting, the off fore-foot and the near hind-foot give
  one beat, and the near fore-foot and the off hind-foot give another,
  two legs crosswise being off the ground and two on.
     In the trot, the rider must sit close in his saddle, and manage his
  horse so as to distribute his labour equally; he must preserve his seat

   168                       EVERY  BOY'S BOOK.
  more by the balance of his body than by any pressure of the legs.
  When he wishes the horse to move quicker, he should then press
  with his knees, and bring the balance of his body for a moment over
  the horse's shoulders, which the horse will understand.      The rider
  should know when and where to put the horse at the top of his
  speed in the trot, without forcing him to break into a canter.      He
 will discover easily when the horse is about to break by the irregu
 larity in the beats of his feet. To make the trot easy, the rider
 rises slightly in the stirrups, and bends rather forward ; but it should
 be the action of the horse that raises him, and not any effort from
 himself.    The foot the horse leads with determines when the rider
 should rise ; as he should rise and fall with the leading foot, — rising
 when the leading foot is in the air, and falling when it comes to the
 ground.
    Galloping. — In this pace, the horse makes three quick and distinct
 beats : first, the near hind-foot ; second, the near fore-foot and the
off hind-foot, which touch the ground at the same time ; and, lastly
the off fore-foot.
    When the rider wishes to gallop from a walk or trot, he should
first raise the bridle-hand firmly, then slacken rein, and close the legs
or give spur until the horse obeys ; and confine him to the speed he
wishes by drawing a firm rein and relaxing the pressure of the legs.
    The position of the horse in galloping always calls for a cor
respondmg one in the rider ; for instance, if the horse leads with the
right leg, the rider's leg on that side will be more advanced than the
left, and the inside of the thigh will be closer to the saddle; con
sequently the other thigh will be turned a little outward, and the leg

farther to the rear. The hips and upper part of the body are affected
in the like manner.
   The rider, while galloping, should from time to time glance his eye
over the ground the horse is to pass over.        It is immaterial which
foot leads wnen galloping on a straight line, but it would be injurious
to the horse were he always to lead with the same leg. To change the
step (the horse galloping with the off fore-foot in advance), the rider
should draw the right rein and close the left leg; and he should
change from the near to the off fore-foot on the same principles, but
by inverse means.
                         STOPS,   BACKING,  ETC.
   To stop a horse without injury to himself or Ms rider, his haunches
should be brought under him, by closing the legs, and the rein drawn
firmly and steadily, and the rider clinging or embracing the horse
with his legs, and throwing himself somewhat on the cantle, without
pressing the stirrups.    In stopping in the trot, he should pull the
reins gently, and throw his shoulders a little backward ; and when he
would stop in the gallop, seize the time when the horse's fore feet are
coming to the ground.     If  the rider can stop within a space of eight
feet from a full gallop, and maintain his position, it will show the
superiority of the bridle-hand over the horse, and should be termed
the very acme of horsemanship.
   Backing. — For a horse to back properly, he should be upon his
haunches, have one of his hind legs always behind him, on which to

170                     EVERY    BOY'8  BOOK.
rest and balance, and to  impel or push himself backwards      ; his head
steady, and his legs well gathered.
   To aid or assist the   horse in this movement, the rider should
incline the body slightly  forward, hold the hand a little lower than
nsual, the reins equally and steadily, and yield and check, instead of
making a dead pull. To prevent th'e horse from swerving, the rider
shoula press the legs gently to the rear of the girth.
   Leaping. — The  most secure position for the rider in all leaps, as in

                               HORSEMANSHIP.                             171
all critical situations, is to yield to the seat by bending the loins, to
cling with the thighs and calves of the legs, and to accommodate
himself to the horse's motions, and not depend upon the stirrups for
 support.
     In leaping a ditch, gully, or space, the rider should give the reins,
 to enable the horse to extend his neck, see the object, and to measure
 his step ; maintain his seat erect, yield the body slightly, and cling
 with the legs.    While the horse is descending, the reins should be
 gathered,   in order  to support and check him when he strikes the
 ground.
                              CORRESPONDENCE.
     This physical and mental agreement and understanding between
 the horse and his rider has been termed
                                               "                     for want
                                                  correspondence,
.of a better term ; for  when  the hand with   the  reins is held in a proper
 position, and at a proper distance, the slightest change or motion of
 it is felt by the animal, and, if well tramed, attended to by him.
 When this relation is preserved between the hand of the rider and the
 horse's mouth, the horse is under perfect control, and seems to know
                                              "
 the will of the rider. This is called the       support." In trotting, the
 young rider will feel a kind of tug at the rems every time the norse
 puts down his" feet, which tug is felt reciprocally by the horse.       This
 is called the appuy." In riding, therefore, these little matters must
 be strictly attended to, as without them the horse is not under
 control, and he may run away with you from mere wantonness, caper,
 trot, or gallop at his will.
             GATHERING    THE HORSE AND MOVING FORWARD.
     By slightly raising and at the same time drawing the bridle-hand
 towards the body, and closing the legs, the rider prepares the
 horse for any movement.        This is called " gathering" the horse, or
  pushing him to the bit. When the rider wishes to move forward, he
  lowers the bridle-hand, and gives a slight closing motion to the legs
 just behind the girths, which the horse nnmediately understands, and
  moves forward.     The legs are then relaxed, and the pace settled.
                           THE WHIP AND SPURS.
     The whip or spurs should at all times be very carefully used, espe
  cially by young horsemen, as either are liable to put a good horse out
  of temper, and render him fretful, fearful, nervous, and unsteady. It
  is proper that the horse should always know you have a whip, and
  that you can use it ; but it should never be applied in the smallest
  degree but for some specific purpose : when applied around the belly
  behind the girths, the lash pomts downwards; and when applied
  across the bridle-hand before, it is held with the lash upwards ; but
  it should never be applied over the head or neck. The spurs should
  rarely be applied, and then with the greatest caution ; and we would

   172                     EVERY    BOY'S  BOOK.
  advise the young horseman never to think      of wearing spurs until  he
  becomes an experienced rider.
                        MANAGEMENT     OP THE   HORSE.
     There are many little particulars to be attended to in the general
  management of the horse, by animations, soothings, caressings, cor
  rections, &c. A gentle pressure of the legs, a kmd word from the
  rider, animates the horse.      Sometimes a horse requires encourage
  ment, as in going over a bad piece of ground, or in passing some
  object likely to startle or alarm him. He may then be spoken kindly
  to, patted, and urged forward by the motion of the legs, and a slight
  tap with the whip.      At other times a horse shies from excess of
  caution, often not from viciousness ; and in such cases he should be
  soothed by mild tones, gently stroked or patted on the neck ; while
  the rider should relax his body, and let the horse feel himself at ease.
  Sometimes a horse shows great carelessness in his movements and in
  his paces, and has evidently his mind off his work ; it is then he may
  be spoken sharply to and corrected, but always with decision and
 humanity combmed.         Never let the horse hate you ; rather let him
  fear and love you.     In all corrections and chastisements, the rider
 should rather endeavour to work upon the mind than the body of the
 horse, and should use it as a father would use his child.
                            VICES  Or THE HORSE.
     The principal vices of the horse are, restivenesi, rearing, shying,
 stumbling, lying down, kicking, bolting, $-c.
     Restiveness consists in the horse refusing to move, turning round,
 moving backwards and forwards, sidling or passaging contrary to the
 will of the rider. The first thing for the rider to do is to ascertain,
 if possible, the cause of this conduct of the horse, and to look at the
 equipments.     The bit may touch and iar the tushes, — the head or
 throat strap may be too tight, — the saddle may be too far forward, or
 may rest upon the spine,-;—or the horse may see something to annoy
 him, not noticed by the rider, — or he may remember he has not been
 fed ; and many a horse, if taken out of the stable just before the
 usual time of feeding, becomes restive.
    In many cases of sudden restiveness, a sharp application of the
whip, a pressure of the legs, and a determination, as it were, of the
body of the rider to go forward, produces the effect. But if the horse
refuses to move on, this must not be repeated, and the rider should
cease to contend with him by these means, but, on the contrary, try
to conquer, by assisting in afl his movements until he is unwillmg to
continue his opposition.       If he backs, passages, or turns round, the
rider should encourage him by all the aids necessary to compel the
movement ; and, if he stands stock still, should slacken the rems and
assume an air of indifference ; and in a short time, when perhaps his
temper is worked off, he will move on quietly.       Should he, however,

still continue his pranks, the rider must oppose him by going with
him.    If, for instance, he wilfully turns to the right, he should not
be pulled to the left, but turned to the right, and forced for a time in
the direction he wishes to proceed, till his head comes in the right
direction, and then urged forward.      If   the horse passages to an
object, the rider should turn his head towards   it, and then oack him.
In all cases the seat must be kept firmly, and the temper also the ;
loss of the latter often occasions the loss of the former.
   Rearing. — This vice of the horse   is  the most dangerous to the
rider. Whenever     a   horse rears, the rider should lean forwards,
slacken the reins, and with the right hand he may seize   a  lock of the
mane. By bending forwards, the weight of the rider's body     is thrown
on the horse's shoulders, and tends to bring him down on his fore
feet; or he may turn him quickly to the right or left, which will
compel him to move      a hind-foot, and throw him off the balance.
When he descends       on his fore-legs, the whip or spur should be
applied suddenly, the legs pressed close, and he will generally move
forward.
   Shying often proceeds from timidity — often from     a want of con
fidence m the rider. When he does this, his head should be kept well
up, and the leg should press the side towards which he turns. To
dispel his fears, he should be caressed, and not chastised, (for that
would increase his shying,) and urged gently forwards. Sometimes           it
is advisable to slacken the rein, stop, and let him walk gently towards
the object at which he shied.      Our " Bessy," one of the nest cobs
ever ridden, used to shy at  a  wheelbarrow; but was completely cured
of the trick   by  being suffered for several times to go up to the
barrow, which she seemed to look at with great curiosity, smelling

 174                    EVERY BOY   8  BOOK.
it with much caution; but this completely cured her of shying. When
a horse curvets irregularly, and twists to and fro, his head must
be turned to one side, or both, without letting him go out of his
course.
   Stumbling. — This is not so much a vice as a misfortune, and is
caused by a weakness in the knees, corns on the feet, or sometimes

by the fault of the rider in letting the horse carry his head too low.
In a horse prone to stumble, keep your legs close to his sides, par
ticularly in going down hill; but, what is better still, do not ride
such a horse.
   Kicking. — When a horse kicks, the rider should keep his body
upright, but flexible, and inclined rather backwards, while the balance
is well preserved by the muscles of the thighs, and the legs are to be
kept close, ready for grasping, if necessary.      A horse generally tries
 to get his head down in the act of kicking, which enables him to per
 form that operation with ease to himself and discomfiture to his
 rider. Therefore his head should be kept well up ; and while in the
 act of kicking, he should be suddenly turned and urged round two or
 three times, which generally cures hnn for the time.         But don't ride
 a kicking horse.
    lying down, Soiling, S.c. — It sometimes happens that in passing
 through water a horse will attempt to lie down. This fault should be
 seen beforehand, and if a horse exhibits the least propensity to do so,
 on coming to the water, he should be urged sharply over or through
 it by one or two smart applications of the whip. If he attempts to
 bolt or run away, the hands must be depressed, and strong pulls
 given ; but the rider must keep himself in the saddle, and, although
 pulling at the reins, still try to guide the horse ; for if he can continue
 to do this, the horse must of necessity soon come to a standstill for
  want of wind. By self-possession and firmness, danger is rarely to be
  apprehended in a horse's bolting, as he is generally careful not to
 hurt himself, unless under great fear; and the best advice we can

the greatest danger is in
                          "
                            being thrown."
      Such are a few of the      of the horse.

                                  DRIVING.
             " The rash boy Phaeton his proud chariot drove
               Till he was smitten by almighty Jove :
               Take heed, youne driver, while you like him boast,
               You are not ' spilled ' against an ugly post." — Swift.
                               INTRODUCTION.
   OUB young friends ought to know, not only how to ride, but also
how to drive.     From the very earliest times, horse and chariot races
were considered the noblest of sports, and Apollo is represented as
driving the chariot of the sun.         The four horses were typical of the
four seasons of the year. Four horses driven abreast was common               •
also to the Olympic games, and the Hippodrome was the scene of
chariot races in which even a greater number was sometimes used.
   It was, indeed, an imposing sight to see the Hippodromic course
at -the time of one of these chariot festivals. The place set apart for
the contest was about a mile in length.            Over a bar that ran across
the entrance of the lists was placed a brazen dolphin, and upon an
altar in the middle of the barrier stood an eagle of the same metal.
By means of a machine, put in motion by the president of the games,
the eagle suddenly sprang up into the air with its wings extended,
so as to be seen by all spectators ; and at the same moment the
dolphin sank to the ground, which was a signal for the cars to
arrange themselves in order for the race. Besides the statue of Hip-
podamia, and the table on which were placed the crowns and palm-
branches, there were several images and altars in the course, particu-
                                        N

larlv that of the genius Taraxippus, who, as his name imports, was
said to inspire the horses with a secret terror, which was increased
by the shrill clangour of the trumpets placed near the boundary, and
the deafening shouts and outcries of the multitude.
    While the chariots were ranged in line ready to start, the horses,
whose ardour it was difficult to restrain, attracted all eyes by their
beauty, as well as for the victories which some of them had already
gained.    Pindar speaks of no less than forty chariots engaged at one
and the same time.      If  we recollect that they had to run twelve
times the length of the Hippodrome, in going and returning, and to
steer round a pillar or goal erected near each extremity, we may
imagine what confusion must have ensued when, upon the signal
trumpet being sounded, they started amid a cloud of dust, crossing
and jostling each other, and rushing forward with such rapidity that
the eye could scarcely follow them.       At one of the boundaries a
narrow pass was left only for the chariots, which often baffled the
skill of the expertest driver; and there were upwards of twenty
turnings to make round the two pillars; so that at almost every
moment some accident happened, calculated to excite the pity or
insulting laughter of the assembly.    In such a number of chariots at
full speed, pushing for precedence in turning round the columns, on
which victory often depended, some were sure to be dashed to pieces,
covering the course with their fragments, and adding to the dangers
of the race. As it was, moreover, exceedingly difficult for the cha
rioteer, in his unsteady two-wheeled car, to retain his standing
attitude, many were thrown out, when the masterless horses plunged
wildly about the Hippodrome, overturning others who had, perhaps,
previously escaped every danger, and thought themselves sure of
winning. To increase the confusion, and thereby afford better oppor
tunities for the display of «1H11 and courage, there was reason to
believe that some artifice was employed for the express purpose of
frightening the horses when they reached the statue of Taraxippus.
So great sometimes was their consternation, that, no longer regarding
the rein, the whip, or the voice of their master, they broke loose, or
overturned the chariot, and wounded the driver.
   Such is the ancient description given by a Greek writer of the
chariot races of the Hippodrome.      We have no coach racing now-a-
days, except omnibus racing in the streets: not a great deal of
"coaching."     Now and then, indeed, we see the "Brighton four-
horse," and start with wonder at the sight. But still there are
necessities for private driving, more important at the present than at
any former period ; and we hold driving to be not only a necessary,
but an indispensable accomplishment to every young gentleman.
                       THE HORSE IN HABNESS.
   A   horse  fully equipped in harness, attached to a dennet or
stanhope, is one of the most beautiful tilings to look at in the world ;

  and before  the youngster should start, he ought to make himself
 perfectly acquainted with the horse, the harness, and the various
 descriptions of carriages he may be called upon to drive.
    The Coach, or stage-coach.     The form of this is so well known as
 to need no description.
    The Town-coach, or carriage, is also well known.     Like the stage
 coach, it has two seats inside, and the coach-box is covered with that
 kind of drapery called a hammercloth, on which the arms or crest of
 the owner of the coach is emblazoned, and where sits in pompous
 dignity the coachman, in smart attire, seeming almost as if he were a
fixture belonging to the cumbrous machine.
    The Chariot may be termed half a coach ; for the general form and
appearance resemble those of a coach, except that the body contains
 only one seat, there being no persons seated with their backs to the
 horses.    This is likewise the form of the hired carriages called
Post-chaises, which have no coach-box, as the driver generally sits
upon one of the horses.
    The Landau is a double-seated coach, which has a provision for
being made into an open carriage, by means of a jointed head.
    A Barouche is a coach without a roof, which has of late been com
pletely superseded by other kinds of carriages.
    The Phaeton is a form of vehicle very convenient for many pur
poses, as there are two seats, one behind the other; so that a servant
can either sit on the front seat and drive, or occupy the hinder seat,
as may be preferred.     The lightest and simplest form of the phaeton
is that which is called the pony-phaeton, which is frequently driven
by ladies.
    The Cabriolet, or cab, as its name implies, is derived from France.
It is only made to contain two persons ; but it has a head which can
be opened or closed, according to the state of the weather ; and, by
means of an apron in front, the riders are entirely sheltered from the
                                    N2

weather.   Those most clumsy, dangerous, and awkward vehicles,
       " Hansom's
called            Safety Cabs," are to be avoided at all times.
   The Gig is one of the very lightest wheel carriages in use, and        is,
after all, one of the best vehicles for asure-footed, fast-trotting ponv.
   The Tilbury was named after the person who first invented it.          It
has  a very light appearance, but it    said
                                       is       bypractical persons to be
a  very heavy vehicle, on account of the ironwork necessarily employed
in its construction.
    Other two-wheeled carriages are, the Curricle, the Slanhope, the
Dennet, and the Brougham.        The curricle    isthe only two- wheeled
carriage having two    horses  abreast.   The horses  have   bright steel
                                                           a a
bar passing across their backs, from which  is  suspended   pole passing
between the two horses, and attached to the carriage   ;    bythis pole   it
is   drawn along.    The stanhope bears     a close resemblance to the
tilbury, as docs the dennet to the phaeton. The brougham              the
                                                                     is
most convenient of all the carriages, and, like its noble inventor, is
adapted to a   great variety of purposes.
    The Sritzschka and the Droitzschka (or drosky) are importations
from abroad.     Their great convenience has led to an extensive em
ployment    of them.   This form was brought over about          aquarter
of   a century ago, and their usefulness renders them very common.

                              THE BBOUGBAH.
The body of the vehicle contains only one seat for two persons, but
generally there is a boot behind for a servant.        The t>ody of the
carriage is so constructed that a person may recline at full length.
The awning or covering over the heads of those inside admits of being

young driver to make himself well acquainted with these terms. The
wheels of the vehicle, shafts, axle, and axle-bar, need not be de
scribed, as they are familiar to every one. We may, however, advise
the young driver that the near side of the road, the near wheel of a
carnage, the near leg of a horse, means the left side ; while the right
is called the o^side ; and thus, when you meet another vehicle, if you
go to the left, you are sure to be right ; but if you go to the right,
you arc wrong.

                          mSTORICAL MEMORANDA.
   THE sea service is the glory of Old England, notwithstanding all
the glorious land service of ancient and modern days.                     A country
having nearly ten thousand miles of sea-coast, with numerous ports,
harbours, estuaries, river mouths, and capacious bays, must ever be
a maritime nation, and look for its supremacy to the sea— to her
sons being amphibious ; and nothing is better calculated to develop
the inherent instinct for sea duties than the amusements of boating,
of rowing, of sailing, and other aquatic sports. Every young gen
tleman in England should know how to manage a boat, and to sail
a cutter ; and it will be our duty to initiate him into the methods of
doing so.
   The origin of ships must be traced to the ark of Noah ; but this
was not a sailing or a rowing vessel, but simply a large floating house
or receptacle for Noah and his family, and the various types of
animated nature. The first navigators were the Phoenicians, who

184                        EVERY     BOY'S    BOOK.
sailed   in various seas. They were succeeded by the ships of Carthage,
 Egypt. Venice, Genoa, Holland, and Portugal.             The Saxons under
 Alfred, and the Danes under Canute, had formidable navies. Alfred,
who ascended the throne in 872, commenced the first English fleet
in person, and is said to have suggested a variety of improvements
in the structure, as well as greatly to have increased the size of the
vessels, some of the largest of which carried sixty oars.           After the
death of Alfred, the naval power of England seems to have lain
dormant ; and this, no doubt, tempted the Norman invasion in 1066,
under William the Bastard, who sailed for the coast of England with
a fleet of 900 vessels ; and so sensible was he of the importance of
the naval service, that he gave certain privileges to certam towns on
the sea-coast, which were from their number called the Cinque Ports.
Richard I. fitted out large fleets; and his successor, John, asserted the
exclusive right of the English nation to the dominion of the seas. The
reign of Edward I. was also distinguished for successes at sea. Henry
Vn., on gaining the throne, in 1485, put the navv into a respectable
condition ; and a large ship, called the
                                              " Great Harry," which
                                                                           may
properly be termed the first ihip of the British navy, was built at a
cost of 14,000/. The discovery of America, about the period of the
accession of Henry VIII., gave a new stimulus to our navy, and
many ships were then built of large tonnage, some of a thousand
tons.    But          Elizabeth, deeply impressed with the maxim, that
" whosoever Queen
               commands the sea, commands the trade of the world,"
and that
            " whosoever commands the trade, commands the riches of
the world," and consequently the world itself, so encouraged and
restored the marine, that she may be called the "Restorer of the
naval power of England ;" and, in a few years after, the invasion of
the Spanish Armada put our naval power to the proof.               Charles  I.,
the great and courageous Cromwefl, and even the pleasure-loving
Charles II., were all impressed with the great advantages of           a    for
midable navy   ;  and  in the reign  of Anne,  fifty-two  French   ships,  con
taining more than 3,000 guns, were captured.                And durmg the
reign of George HI. the naval superiority was placed            bya   series of
glorious   successes  beyond   all dispute; and   it   to
                                                       is  be hoped    that the

            CONSTRUCTION     OP ANCIENT       SHIPS AND GAIXEYS.
   The Egyptian vessels are the earliest of which any well-authen
ticated graphic illustration has been preserved. We here give    view  a
of one of their earliest sailing vessels.    The celebrated Egyptian
vessel called the " Isis
                          " issaid to have been in length 180 feet,         in

breadth 45 feet, and in height, from the upper edge of the deck to the
bottom of the well, 43 feet. The well-known ship of Hiero, king of
Syracuse, was nearly 400 tons burden.
   They were in length about 125 feet, and in breadth 10 feet. Their
first requisite was swiftness, and no part of the side was left vacant
where an oar could be put out ; hence they had often three banks of
oars, one above the other. In most ancient ships, there was placed at
                             " the
the prow an image called             sign." The part of the vessel that cut
the water was called the "goose." At the stern, which generally re
sembled a shield, was set or some way delineated a representation of
the deity to whose tutelary favour the ship was committed, and to
which daily prayer and sacrifice were offered. War ships were chiefly
rowed with oars, that they might be able to tack about.            The first
long ships   were   rowed with  fifty oars, but afterwards  a larger number
was used. In the more perfect condition of ancient navigation, there
were some ships that had as many as five tiers of oars, and three
hundred rowers. Two large holes at the prow of the vessel, occa
                                                    "
sionally used for oars, were called the ship s        eyes ;" and a wooden
projection   at the  prow, covered with brass, was called a "beak;" and
pieces of wood placed on each side of the prow of a vessel, to ward
off the force of the enemy's beak, were called the ship's " cars."
Over these vessels were certain raised platforms, and on their fore
castles were towers on which the soldiers stood, whose shields were

 186                       EVERY   BOY'S    BOOK.
usually hung upon the railings which begirt the ship.        The sides of
the prow were called " cheeks." The anchors at first used were
often large stones, or even bags of sand; afterwards, however,
the ancient ships carried anchors with one, two, and four flukes. The
larger anchor was called the
                                 " sacred anchor," and reserved for the
most trying occasions. Among the ancients, ships were usually termed
" horses," which                                     The elder Pliny, for
                    explains many ancient fables.
instance, tells us of a boy who was carried by water some miles every
day oa the back of a dolphin to school ; the vessel, in all probability,
having a dolphin at the prow. Arion, the famous musician of Lesbos,
having made great wealth in foreign parts by his profession, was
returning home by ship, when the sailors resolved to kill him, and
seize upon his riches. Playing once again, at his last request, a
favourite tune, he leaped info the sea.       A dolphin, attracted by his
melody, received him safely on its back, and carried him again to the
coast where Periander lived.        Arion, doubtless, escaped by a boat,
the fore-part of which consisted of a dolphin.
    Having thus given the young reader a notion of ancient boats and
ships, we shall now proceed to make him acquainted with the modern
practices of rowing, boating, sailing, &c.
                                Of   BOATS.
    A Boat is properly a vessel propelled by oars. In a more extensive
sense the word is applied to other small vessels, which differ in
construction and name, according to the services in which they are
employed.      Thus they are light or strong, sharp or flat-bottomed,
open or decked, according as they are mtended for swiftness or
burden, deep or shallow water, &c.
    The Barge is a long, light, narrow boat, employed in harbours, and
nnfit for sea.    The Long Boat is the largest boat belonging to a ship,
generally furnished with two sails, and is employed for cruising short
distances, bringing the cargo and bales on board, &c.
    The Launch is more flat-bottomed than the long boat, which it has
generally superseded.       The Pinnace resembles the barge, but is
smaller.    The Cutters of a ship are broader and deeper than the barge
 or pinnace, and are employed in carrying light articles, single passen
gers, &c. on board.
    Yawls are used for similar purposes to the barge and pinnace.      A
 Qig is a long, narrow boat, used for expedition, ana rowed with six or
 eight oars. The Jolly Boat is smaller than a yawl, and is used for
 gomg on shore. A merchant ship seldom has more than two boats, —
 a long boat and a yawl.
    A Wherry is a light, sharp boat, used in a river or harbour for
 transporting passengers. A Punt is a flat-bottomed boat, chiefly used
 for fishing on a fresh water river. A Skiff is a small sharp-nosed
 boat, used in rivers.     A Dingy is a very small stiff boat used by
 yachts.   A Yacht is a pleasure sailing-boat.       A Lugger is a boat

which sails by means of one or more lug sails.      A Funny  is a small
light boat, used in rowing matches.
                              OP ROWING.
   Rowing may be considered of two kinds,
                                                " River Rowing " and
"Sea Rowing, and many particulars are necessary to be known relating
to each. In the former, the rower has principally to contend against
the force of the stream and the wind. In the latter, he has to cope
with the heaving wave, the turn of various currents, the surf at land
ing or starting, and other serious matters.
                            BITER SOWING.
    The river rowing of the Thames and Isis is not to be surpassed in
the world.    The various matches which come off every year on both
these rivers, through the different clubs, give an importance and in
terest to this athletic amusement not known in any other country ;
and the most astonishing feats have been performed in the waters
between Richmond and Battersea Bridge.       One of the noblest patrons
of the art is the Earl of Kilmorey, hnnself one of the most elegant
and accomplished of rowers, and to whom the public is greatly in
debted for his numerous improvements on the banks of old Father
Thames, and for his generous and considerate behaviour to watermen
especially; and we have witnessed with the greatest pride the personal
prowess of his lordship in the "handling of the oar.
                     DESCRIPTION   OP A  WHERRY.
    A wherry should be built of the lightest materials consistent with
her safety, and her whole form adapted not only to cut through, but
to move over the water, and combine swiftness, elegance and beauty.
    In the above diagram we have a model of a wherry of the latest
construction.    No. I, her bow, is nicely tapered, so as to hold but
little water, at the same time that her motion through it increases
her buoyancy.      No. 2, is the cutwater, or stem. No. 3, the row
locks. No. 4, the seats. No. 5, the foothoards.       No. 6, the stern
sheets. No. 7, the fore sheets.    No. 8, the rudder ropes.

                                 TAKING     YOUB.  BEAT.
   On entering a wherry, always take care to step as far into her as
you conveniently can, and as nearly as possible bear your feet near
her centre of motion.          Seat yourself midships, and, if possible, push
yourself   from     the   shore   while so seated, by the scull or boat-hook,
having your    boat's     head   towards     or opposite to the direction of the
current.     Your boat being afloat, seat yourself at your ease on the
thwart, rather off than far upon it ; place your feet on the middle of
the stretcher, the heels together but not close, the legs not quite
extended, but slightly bent at the knees, just so much that when you
make the pull they may be brought down and the legs stretched.                 Be
careful to adjust the height of the thwart to your person.              If you sit
too high or too low you will lose power, and much of your strength
will be thrown away.              Now place your oars in the rowlocks, or
rullocks, turn    their   concave   parts to the stern of the boat, and make
                          THE PITLL (WITH ONE HAND).
   In grasping the oar for the pull, hold the hand square and firm, but
with sufficient freedom to let the muscles of the arm have play. The
body is now to be inclined forward from the hips till the head comes
nearly over the knees, and the arms extended till the knuckles come
over the joints of the instep.           The edge of the oar being now turned
parallel  with   the   water,   so as  to  feel no resistance from the wind, the
dip  is made,  and     at  the moment      of doing this the oar is dexterously
turned so that its edge cuts the water in descending, and being com
pletely immersed and no more, the broad part of its blade is pressed
strongly and firmly against the water by the pull. When the pull is
fairly and evenly given, and in such a way as the whole power is
 brought to bear on the water without any jerking or trembling of the
oar, the time is come for lifting it out of the water, and in domg this
the hand or hands are brought close to the side, a little below the
 chest, the oar is slightly turned or feathered as it rises to the surface,
 then lifted, and the stroke is repeated.
                                            In rowing with one oar, two hands
                                        being used, suppose you are sitting to
                                        larboard, your left hand should giasp
                                        the smaller part of the handle, at a, and
               •

                                        your right the part at b, called the loom
                                        of the oar. In rowing for a short dis
                                       tance the back may be slightly curved,
 but when a long distance is undertaken it is best to hold the muscles
 of the back in an erect position.
                                      TWO HANDS.
    In  rowing with two oars, or sculling, the chief difficulty lies in not
 knocking your fingers with the handle portions of either oar. To

avoid this, one oar generally works over the other, the right, being
the stronger, over the left; besides this, the sculler should sit a little
obliquely, and throw hia right or left shoulder and hand more forward
than the other, and thus both hands will work clear of each other.
                            BACKING WATER.
    In backing water the oars are suddenly turned, the concave parts
facing the sculler or  rower, who pushes from him. This forces the
boat backwards.
                           TURNING          THE BOAT.
   In turning a boat it is usual to back water with one oar, or to
hold water, at the same time that you pull with the other. If you
wish to turn your boat's head to your left side, you pull with the
right oar and back with your left, and vice versa.
                        PASSING OTHER               CRAFT.
    Ifyou overhaul a boat or any other craft, the rower who passes
should take the outside,   *. the side furthest from the shore, leaving
                           »'.
the craft between the shore and him; he ought also to keep quite
clear, and far enough away, so as not to come foul of his sculls or
oars.   In meetingcraft, the boat that comes with the tide must get
out of the way.   When boats come very close together, eaeh should
" lay in," or draw to the side, the oars on the sides likely to come in
contact.
                                        CURRENTS.
   Currents in a river always flow into the bights or hollows of the
land.  In rowing with the tide, the middle of the river the best.
                                                              is
In rowing against the tide, the rower should take advantage of the
conformation of the land, avoiding the bights where the tide sweeps,
and creeping up under the lee way of points. Every river has its
peculiar points, bights, shoals, and eddies, and the young boatsman
should study these when he can, and always endeavour to know
                                                            "           a

                                  SEA BOWING.
      Sea rowing is a vast deal more difficult than river rowing, and
  requires much more strength and management, particularly when
  there is much sea on; and one of the most difficult things is
                             LAUNCHING    THE BOAT.
     In this operation two men get into the boat at the bows, with their
  oars ready to act ; other men, laying hold of the boat by the gunwale,
  force her along the beach till her nose dips in the wave, and at the
 moment this flows under her they nimbly leap in.             The principal
 danger here is in not leaping in at the exact moment, or in not keep
 ing the boat's head true to the wave as it comes on ; for sometimes a
 wave will, instead of being cut by her stem head, strike the boat on
 her larboard or starboard DOW, and throwing her over on her side, she
 is immediately capsized.       This it is the duty of the bowmen to pre
 vent.     If the crew should jump into the boat before she is quite
 afloat, their increased weight will cause her to ground, and then the
 waves of the sea and surf peat furiously upon her.
                                    BOWING.
     In sea rowing each man has a single heavy oar, and sits over to the
 opposite side of the boat from the rullock ; and he sits so that the
 oar works clear of the back of the rower who sits before him.          The
 rower should sit square, pull bodily, and the oar should be thrown out
 with a heave, feathered properly as it leaves the water, and time should
 be kept slowly and regularly.       The boat's head should be kept at all
times as much as possible to the swell, or her stern on a line with it.
It is a very dangerous matter to get a boat's broadside to the swell of
the waves.
                                   LANDING.
    In  landing on a sea beach, the rowers should always look ahead for
a proper place, for there are great inequalities in apparently the
smoothest t>each, and landing in one place may be very good, while in
another place, not twenty yards off, it may be dangerous.           When a
proper place    is descried,  the rowers  may give "good way"     on  shore.
The bowman should be in the bows, with his boat-hook in one hand
and the end of the painter in the other, and immediately the boat
grounds, should jump out and haul in. The other portion of the crew
should now jump out as quickly as possible, and assist him in pulling
the boat up. Then everything should be
                                                  " stowed awav" safe and
secure, and the boat left beyond the reach of the tide at high water.
                     HINTS AND CAUTIONS IN BOWING.
    1.  If you are rowing with others, always    keep the stroke.
    2.  If you are rowing a pair of oars or      sculls by yourself, always
put both oars into the water at the same time.

   3.  Keep  a good    look-out a-head, that you may not fall foul of other
craft.
   4. Do not put your oar too deep in the water, and mind that the
blade of the oar is thoroughly covered.
   5. Look well to your thowls, and see that they are not rotten
before you place them in the holes.
   6. Let your boat-hook lie clear of your oars, and all clear of the
painter.
   7. See that your foot-boards      are properly hitched to the parts of
the boat made to receive them.
   8. In pushing off a boat from a ship or other craft, be careful not
to stand on the seats of the boat, and not to overbalance yourself.
   9. Keep your boat neat, nice, and clean, and see that she is well
" baled out " before entering her.
   10. Should you be rowing in a boat in which there is a steersman,
always be sure to obey orders.
   11.  If you steer, always lean well forwards with each stroke, as it
assists the rowers.
   12. Keep the rudder ropes as tight as bars, and move the rudder
as little as possible.

                                     SAILING.
            "The  tar 's a jolly tar, that can hand, reef and steer,
               That can nimbly cast-off and belay;
              Who in darkest of nights finds each halliard and gear,
               And dead reckoning knows well, and leeway :
              But the tar to please me must more jolly be,
               He must laugh at the waves as they roar."— Dibdia.
   IT would be very difficult to trace to its origin the art of sailing.
Perhaps the curled leaf passing over the water, with one end erect,
might have given to observant man the first notion of a sail. It has
been supposed that the, Naulila, Argonaut, or sailor-fish, was sug
gestive of the first sailing-vessel ; but long before the Argonaut had
been noticed, sails of some kind or other had no doubt been common.
A man could not stand in the simplest boat without perceiving that
the wind exerted a power upon him and his boat ; and therefore the
idea of a sail must have been identical with the first launching of the
rudest boat. The science of sailing however, has grown up gradually
through a succession of ages, and has now reached a perfection of
which the ancients had no idea.
   We will first speak of the various kinds of vessels, which are dis
tinguished principally by the number of masts, and the number and
shape of their sails.
   A Sloop is properly a vessel with one mast, having her sails, with
the exception of her topsails, set in the plane of her length, which is
technically called
                      " set fore and aft." Her
                                                        topsail is a square sail,

rigged at right angles to the plane of her length.      The bowsprit is
generally elevated from the bows, inclining slightly to the deck. The
term " sloop" is now usually applied to a man-of-war, ship-rigged, and
carrying less than 18 guns.
   A fatter differs from a sloop in being without a square sail, and in
having her bowsprit horizontal; her mast at the same time "raking"
aft. Her topsail is fore and aft, and triangular in shape.
   A Brig is a square-rigged vessel, with two masts.

   A Schooner is a two-masted vessel, with fore and aft topsails, which
are called gaff-topsails.  Sometimes she has a square fore-topsail and
top-gallantsail.
   A Brigantine is. something bet ween a schooner and a brig, and is
worked either with oars (called sweeps) or sails.

   A Dutch Galleot is rigged like a schooner, but of a broader and
more Chinese build, her bottom being nearly flat.
   A Billy-boy is rigjged sometimes fike a sloop, and sometimes like a
schooner; but her Bottom is nearly flat, and she draws but little
water.
   A Snack is a small vessel with one mast like a cutter, used prin
cipally for fishing.
   A Canoe is a ooat used by savages, usually made of a trunk of
a tree, hollowed.
   A Felucca has two triangular sails, is used in the Mediterranean,
and is particularly swift.   It can also use oars in calm weather.
    A Junk is   a Chinese vessel, used either for war or merchandise.   It
is built very heavily.

   A Proa is used by the natives of the Ladrone Islands, and is remark
able for its swiftness and sailing close to the wind. The lee-side is quite
straight, and the weather-side is convex, like a common boat.          Both
head and stern are equally sharp ; and in working          her  there is  no
necessity to tack or turn at any tune. Besides this peculiarity of con

struction, the proa has on her lee-side what is called an out-rigger,"
 which is made of two poles, extending about 10 feet from her side,
 having at their extremity a piece of solid wood.       This prevents her
 from naving any lee-way.         She will sail with a good wind twenty
 miles an hour.
    The natives of the Society Islands use a canoe, averaging in length
 from ten to forty feet. It is made of a trunk of a tree, hollowed out ;
 and is just wide enough for a person to sit down.       It will carry from
 one to as many as thirty persons.          It also has an outrigger, like
 a proa. When a native leaves one island to go to another, ne joins
 two large canoes together, and builds on them a small hut, which will
 hold all his family.      This is the most convenient way to travel in
 a canoe, for it is difficult to see anything but one's knees when sitting
 down in the ordinary manner.          .These canoes carry a square sail in
 the fore-part.
    We will now speak of the vesseb           we have most to do with —
 viz. yachts.

                       VABIOUS    KINDS  OP YACHTS.
    Yachts are of various kinds, according to their size.    If more than
 eighty tons burden, the schooner is most suitable ; for, as the spars are
 more numerous, they are proportionably lighter.         The schooner, as
 has been before observed, has two masts — the foremast and mainmast;
 the one bearing the sail called the boom-foresail,       and the other a
 mainsail.   She has two or more headsails, called staysail, fore-staysail,
 andjib. Her topsails are either square or fore and aft.
    The Cutter has one mast and four sails — viz. mainsail, maintopsail,
 foresail, and jib. Some smaller craft have larger jibs, and no foresail.
    The "Dandy-ringed, Yacht differs from a cutter, in having no boom for
 her mainsail, which can consequently be brailed up by a rope passing
round it. She has a mizen-mast standing in the stern, which sets
a sail called a mizen, and which is stretched on a horizontal spar,         •
projecting over the stern.    This style of rig is more safe for a yacht,
as the boom in ordinary cutters is Cable to sweep persons overboard ;
and the sail can be taken in quicker by brailing it up than by lowering
it down.
   The Haltemer has only two sails, a fore and a main sail, of a
triangular shape. Each has a spar standing from the deck to the peak
of the sail, and a boom at the bottom, like a cutter. This rig, from
setting more canvass abaft, is well adapted for narrow waters.

sail and foresail rig, on a good-sized open boat.  She should be at
least twenty feet long, and five feet on her beam.   The foresail is
carried over the stem for about a foot, by means of an iron
bowsprit, which ships and unships on the nose of the boat.             Her
mainsail has a spar reaching from the lower part of the mast to the
upper corner of the sail ; a rope is fastened in the middle of this spar,

that it can be easily managed, while under it the boat is much safer
than under most other kinds of rig; for, should a squall arise, the
yachtsman has only to let      fly his foresheet and put his helm alee,

instance, to give ageneral description.
                       CONSTRUCTION    OF    THE HULL.
   The first step in the construction of the hull        laying down the
                                                           is

of wood, generally oak, upon blocks, that the rest of the timber may
be securely added  ;  the stem isthen joined to the fore-post, nearly at
right angles, slanting little forward as
                        a                   ascends
                                             it        and the stern-post
                                                           ;

 timbers   and ribs are next cut out of solid wood, and placed trans
 versely on the keel, their width varying according to the lines of
 a plan previously drawn out, — being, of course, farthest apart at the
 beam ; these, as well as the planks of larger craft, are made to bend
 into the required shape by being steamed and bolted in while hot.
 The skeleton being completed, her planks are then secured by copper
 or iron nails to the timbers, and riveted. The deck is made of narrow
 pltnks, TO Tming fpre and aft. From the level of the deck, her sides
 are raised by upright timbers, called " stancheons," cased over by the
 bulwarks, and surmounted by a rail called the "gunwale." Some
 yachts are only half-decked, the after-part being left open and fitted
 with seats ; but, in order to prevent the water from getting in, a por
 tion of deck, called water-ways, is left at each side ; which opposes a
 f irther barrier by its terminating on the inner edge in a high crest or
 combing.     The stepping the mast requires great care, since the good
 or bad sailing of the boat depends very greatly upon it.    If we divide
 the length of a good yacht into three parts, the point at which the
 foremost part joins the middle part will be the widest part, and there
 will be nearly the place for the cutter's mast. But the American
 builders have departed from this rule in the construction of their
 celebrated yacht,
                     " The America," whose model, after all the study
and ingenuity that have been applied to yacht -building, seems to
resemble the simple yet beautiful model which nature has given us in
the duck. The bow of this vessel rises very gradually for some dis
tance along the keel, like the breast of the duck ; and, further imi
tating the same model, her beam or widest part is abaft, or further
back than the centre. This superior vessel wUl sail nearly four points

off the wind, and will probably work an entire change in the present
style of yacht-building.     We have now glanced at all the principal
parts  of the hull,   except that all-important part, the rudder ; which
            a
swings by hinge      from  the stern-post, and is moved by a handle fixed
to its upper part, bearing the name of
                                           " a tiller," and which is used to
steer the boat.     Before proceeding with our instructions for sailing
a yacht, it will be necessary to describe the action of the rudder ; is
the art of steering is the nicest and most important branch ot
seamanship.
    The rudder is a flat board, with a pole rising up on the side, which
is fastened to the vessel ; on the top of which is fixed the tiller.   In
                                 large   vessels,  there  are  two  ropes
                                 fastened to the tiller, which are car
                                 ried through blocks on each side of the
                                 vessel; then brought back througi
                                 blocks fastened on the mkenmast, and
                                 passed round a wheel, by which meant
                                 a greater command is obtained over
                                 the rudder. When the tiller is moved
                                 to the right (starboard), the rudder,
                                 of course, is forced in the water to the
                                 left (port). As the vessel moves on,
                                 the water presses against the rudder
                                 on the port side, and thus forces her
stern to the starboard side, and her bow to the port. When the
tiller is moved to the left, it of course produces a contrary effect.
If   the ship is moving backwards, then, by moving the tiller to
the right, the bow is also turned to the right ; for the water presses
against the rudder behind it on the left side, and thus pushes the
stern to the left. In steering, care must be taken not to steer too
much, — that        is,
                 not to move the rudder too violently or more than                      is
necessary, — as this materially stops her way.

         SOMETHING    ABOUT THE MASTS, SPARS, ROPES, ETC.
  The Mast (8) is a spar set nearly upright, inclining a little aft, to
support yards and sails.  In a yacht, it is kept in its place by two
shrouds on each side, made of strong rope, and fastened to the sides
of the vessel.
   The Bowsprit (6) is a spar carried out from the forepart of a yacht,
secured at its inner end between two strong posts piercing the deck,
called "the bitts."   It  is kept in its place by the bobstay (7), which
is fastened to the stem, and by a shroud on tach side secured               '
to the bow.
    The floom (15) is that spar which sets out the mainsail below, and
is attached at one end to the mast by a swivel cable, called the
 " goose-neck," and is eased off or hauled in at the other by the main-
sheet (24i), which is a rope passing from the end of the boom through
a block on the side of the vessel.
    The Gaff (14) sets out the mainsail above, and slides up and down
the mast by means of a crescent end, which embraces it. The sides
 of this curve are called " horns."
    The Topmast (9) stands above the mast, and is made to slide up
 and down.     On it a topsail (»'.

                                                                       ;
 but both sail and mast are generally lowered in squally weather.      It

is kept steady by a backstay (17) on each side of the foretopmast-
stay.  The latter is brought down to the bowsprit.
   Ropes. — There are various ropes to hoist and lower sails,      called
                                 haulyards (pronounced halliards).
                                 There are also other ropes of great
                                 importance, especially those called
                                 the sheets, which are to haul in the
                                 sails, and make them stand to the
                                 wind. In a yacht, the mainsail has
                                 sometimes a sheet each side ; and
                                 sometimes only one sheet reeved
                                 through double blocks,     which travel
                                 on an iron rod, called
                                                        " a horse," from
                                 side to side. The iib has two sheets,
                                 the starboard and port (right and
                                 left). The foresail has the same,
                                 except in some instances, when it
                                 has but one sheet working on a
                                 traveller, like the mainsail.       The
                                 topsail has only one, which is rove
                                 through a sheave at the end of the
                                 gaff and a block at the throat of the
                                 gaff, and then down to a cleat or

haulyards are for hauling up the colours, and pass through a small
sheave in the truck (10), at the end of the topmast.       The ensign
haulyards are reeved through a small block at the peak end, and lead
down to the boom.       The other ropes on board a yacht are for the

used for the sails are called "running rigging."
                           SAILING A YACHT.
     If
      the reader has paid attention to our instructions, he ought now
to   bepretty well conversant with build, rigging, spars, and sails of
a yacht ; the next thing, therefore, is to explain the actual practical
sailing of a yacht. The number of hands must depend on the tonnage
of the boat and the number of sails.      It is best to have a steersman,
and one hand for each sail.       Our yacht is now lying at anchor, or
moorings, which consists of a chain and buoy, fastened to a heavy
anchor sunk in the bed of the river.    Having got on board, by means
of the little boat called a "dingy," we first unloose the fore and
mainsail, and forestaysail; haul out the jib on the bowsprit, ready for
hoisting; hoist the colours, with the name of the yacht or club to
which she belongs, to the gaff-end ; and stand by to hoist the canvass.
We will suppose it just past high water, the yacht swinging ebb, and
the wind up stream ; we shall, therefore, have tide with us, and the
wind against us. We now hoist the throat and peak halliards, till the
former is well up block to block; then, by hauling at the peak-
halliards till the after part of the sail is taut (tight), the mainsail is
set, and she swings head to wind.        The next thing is to hoist the
forestaysail  and  the jib, which  must  be  well purchased up, and the
sheet well hauled in, before we can get her on the wind, i. e. sail close
up to the wind. The ropes must now be coiled up, and hung on the
cleat belonging to each. Our canvass being now up, we may cast off,
slack out the mainsail, haul in jibsheet on the contrary tack to which
we intend to sail, and we are under weigh.
   We have already told the reader that " starboard" means right, and
"port" means left. Formerly, the word "larboard" was used for left;
but, owing to the similarity between the two words starboard and
larboard, the word port was substituted for the latter. A boat is said
to be on the starboard tack, when the wind is blowing from the star
board side ; the port side is then called the lee side, and the starboard
the weather side. She is on the port tack when the wind blows from
the port side, which is then called the weather side, and the starboard
the lee side. When in steering she is brought nearer the wind, she
is said to " luff;" and when further from        it, "
                                                  to bear away." When
the helm      put so as to cause the boat to luff, the helm
               is                                           is   "put up;"
when      causes the boat to bear away,
          it                               it   "put
                                                is     down,"  or a-lee.
   Proceeding to our cruise, we must     haul    the jib-sheet well in, put
the helm up, and sail close to the wind; as, the wind being agamst
us, we shall have to " beat up," that   is, sail       zigzag direction. In
                                                       in

 sailing close to the wind, we must always take care not to tail too close,
 but always keep the canvass quite full.              Upon the skill of the steers
 man, mamly depend the motions of the boat ; he must endeavour to
 attain the happy medium of keeping the boat close to the wind, and
 yet not allowmg the canvass to snake. The practised yachtsman feels
 with his helm every variation of the wind, and meets it with a turn to
 port or starboard; but the young sailor would do well to watch the
 colour at the masthead, and, by keeping it in a line with the gaff, he
 will not steer very wildly.            We are now getting near the opposite
 bank from whence we started, and must therefore tack.                      If the boat
 is quick in stays         e. will go round quickly), and the bottom

 the mainsail must be        hauled     to  the  middle of the boat, or amidships,

always able to move to which side she pleases.                 As we get into wider
water, we shall find more swell, that impedes the boat to windward;

  but, if the waves   be lone enough, there is a way of easing her over
 them, by putting    down the hehu slightly, iust before the highest of
 them strikes her    bow ; thus, by stopping the boat's way, she strikes
  the sea with less  violence.
                               BRINGING UP.
     Our destination outward bound being in sight, we must prepare to
 brine up. The anchor must be got on deck; the cable passed through
 the hawsehole, and shackled or fastened to the anchor, with its stock
 made ready and secured ; then suspended over the bowsprit shrouds,
 and made ready to let eo.     Lower the head-sails, put do"wn the helm
 till she is head to wind, and when she is fairly stopped we may drop
 the anchor.
                               MAZING SNUG.
    The mainsail may now be triced up, with the peak lowered, and
 with the helm to one quarter or the other, according      as the tide sets;
 we may then.hope to lie securely as long as we choose.
                                GOING BACK.
    In getting under weigh once more, first haul the cable short ; get all
 the canvass ready to set up ; weigh anchor, and, as the wind is fair,
 set the head sails first and the mamsail afterwards ; the peak should
 not be two high in running, nor the back of the mainsail fast, but
 raised slightly to let the wind into the head sails.      The tide is now
 against us ; we must, therefore, keep out of the strength of it as much
 as possible.
                                  JIBING.
    In rounding the next point we shall jib, or jibe, one of the most
 difficult manoeuvres in sailmg; for in doing so there is danger of broach-
ing-to, so as to run on shore; of being swept overboard by the boom
as it passes from side to side; and of carrymg away or snapping the
boom itself.     To avoid these mischances, give the shore a wide berth;
take in the mainsheet, keeping its coils clear for running out ; trice
up the tack of the mainsail, and if the breeze is strong, lower the
peak ; you ma- ihen put your helm to the opposite side to which the
boom swings and, on the instant the mainsail has traversed to the
other side, change your helm to the reverse and meet her; — this pre
vents the broacEng-to which would otherwise occur.
                        BRINGING UP AT MOOBINGS.
    We are still against the tide, and our moorings are in sight. To
bring her up handsomely calls for more skill than even handling her
•well.    Our object now must be to lay her still at the moorings from
whence we started, and at the same time to have enough way to reach
them.      In our present case it will be best to round her to about an

 206                        EVERY    BOY  S BOOK.
 hundred yards short of the moorings, and, when head to wind, lower
the mainsail, leaving the head sails standing— this with putting up the
helm will bring her nead round again— then take in the jib, and, if she
has way enough, the foresail also ; and with the opposing tide we may
steer our craft so steadily to the buoy as to take it on board with
 ease.
   Having informed the young sailor of what is necessary to be done
on board, we will now impress on his mind a few useful nautical
terms and maxims, which may lead to the preservation of life and limb.
    OF   THE MAHINERS'      COMPASS,   AND VARIOUS NAUTICAL TERMS.
   The ancients, whose only guides over the trackless waters were the
heavenly bodies, so often obscured by clouds, could not venture far
from shore.        It is the compass which has enabled us to steer
boldly   across  the  deep.  The directive power of the loadstone has been
long   known   to the  Chmese, and it was brought over to Europe about the
year 1260.      The communication of the magnetic power to steel and
suspending it on a pivot, is undoubtedly an European invention. The
compass is composed of a magnetic needle suspended freely on a pivot,
and supporting a card marked with the thirty-two points of direction
mto whicn the horizon is divided, and which are thence called the
points of the compass.       The needle always points nearly north, and
the direction of the boat may be easily seen by looking at the card.
The whole apparatus on board a ship is enclosed in a box with a glass
cover, to allow the card to be seen without being disturbed by the
wind. This box is also sometimes suspended, to prevent the needle
being affected by the motion of the vessel.      The whole is then placed
at the binnacle, in sight of the helmsman.      In the inside of that part
of the compass-box which is directly in a line with the bow, is a clear

black stroke, called the lubber line, which the helmsman uses to keep
his course ; that        is,
                     he must always keep the point of the card which
indicates her course  pointing at the lubber line.    Every young yachts
man must learn to box the compass        that              is,
                                                   to repeat all its points
                                                   ;
in order.
                               CAUTIONS AND DIRECTIONS.
      Never leave anything in the gangway, and keep the decks clear.
  2. 1.
      Coil up all ropes and have;      place for everything, and every
                                               a
thing in its place.
  3.  Take care that in tacking or jibing the boom does not knock you
overboard.
  4.  Stand clear of ropes' ends and blocks flying about, when you are
tacking, and the sails shaking.
   5. Keep      good look out ahead, and also for squalls, which may
                     a
generally be  observed   to windward.
      Always obey the orders of the steersman promptly.
  9. 8. 7. 6.
      Keep all your standing rigging taut.
      When the boat        on the wmd, sit on the weather side.
                               is
      Should the boat capsize, keep yourself clear of the rigging, and
swim ashore.
   The young yachtsman should on no account attempt to take com
mand of boat till he

ever ready  to  lend assistance with the greatest promptitude.      Quick
ness and agility are the characteristics of    sailor without these, nu

quickly,    often attended with the most important consequences, m
                is
which the losing or saving of life may be concerned; and we would
therefore advise all who are emulous of being sailors, to be attentive
to their duties, quick in their evolutions, and steady in all their doings.

The splendour of their colours, the beauty of their forms, the expres
siveness of their eyes, and above all, the melody of their voices,
inspire us with sentnnents of love and admiration; while the exquisite
art with which they construct their nest, fills us with astonishment,
and leads us towards the great and good Creator, who has embellished
their existence for their individual enjoyment and his glory.
   Birds are constructed principally for flight. Their lungs are fixed
against their ribs, and are enveloped with a membrane pierced with
large holes, through which the air passes into several cavities of the
breast, belly, under the wings, inside the bones, and even the stumps
of feathers and the beak ; so that their bodies are thus rendered ex
ceedingly light.    They are generally covered with feathers, which
admirably adapt them to the various temperatures to which they arc

exposed during flight.         Their eyes are so formed as to enable them to
distinguish   near  and   distant   objects equally well.
    Birds are remarkable for the ingenuity with which they construct
their nests, and with the care and tenderness they show to their
young.      Birds have memory, knowledge, gratitude, affection, and
even nnagination, for they dream ; and it will De our business to show
with what facility they may be tamed, taught, and trained.
    In a state of nature, birds are free denizens of the air and earth.
In captivity, they are secured from the vicissitudes of the seasons, and
the various accidents to which they are subjected by their own species,
for the rapacious birds feed upon the non-rapacious.              If caught when
they are old and forced into a cage, they often pine and die ; but
nestlings — those taken from the nest at a very early age, or which,
as Cowper defines them, are

the young bird-fancier is bound to aiford them; and which not to

                                          BIRDS.                                 215
    The common brick trap is well known by moat youngsters. It
consists of four bricks placed as in the drawing, two lengthways,
upon their edges or narrow sides, one in front,
and the fourth between the two side bricks ;
this is so placed that it will fall and lie
easily upon the front brick. Within the trap
a stout peg is driven into the ground, upon
which a forked twig is placed horizontally ;
above this a stick is placed, one end being
on the twig and the other end supporting the brick in a slanting
position. The end of the twig that rests on the peg is cut flat, to
give it a better hold. The bait is strewn upon the ground on the
mside of the trap. When the bird flies to the trap he generally
perches for a moment on the forked twig, this his weight causes
 to give way, and the sustained brick, falling upon the outer or front
 brick, encloses and secures the bird. Caution should be used in
placing the upper brick, so that it does not fall between the two side
 bricks unsupported by the front brick, as in such a case the poor bird
 would be crushed to death.
     The sieve trap, another simple trap, is made by the use of a large
 sieve, which is propped up in the manner
 shown1 in the drawmg.               To the centre of
 the stick a fine long line should be tied,
 and having strewn some bait under the
 sieve, hide yourself in some place a short "
 distance off, with the end of the string in
 your hand, and watch. When you observe
 a bird well under the sieve, give a sharp jerk, and the stick being
 withdrawn from the sieve, it will fall down over the bird.
                                   THE LIMED TWIG.
     The mode of catching birds by the adhesive quality of birdlime,1 is
 one of the most simple methods.                The substance is easily made by
 chewing or macerating wheaten grain till it becomes "sticky," which
 every boy well knows how to do.                When large numbers of birds are
 to be secured, a large branch or bough of a tree, after being trimmed
    (1)  Birdlime. — This may in towns be readily purchased of the " bird-faneiers."
  But as it may not easily be procured in the country, the following is a good method
  of making it : —
     " The bark of the holly, peeled in the month of June, should be boiled with water
  in a pipkin till the green bark is separated from the grey ; the green bark should
  then be laid upon the stone of some outhouse and covered with rushes ; in about
  a fortnight's time it will turn into a kind of slime : this should be beaten up in
  a mortar with a few grains of wheat, after which it may be put in an earthen vessel
  and kept ; when required to be used, it should be melted over the fire, with a little
  goose-grease,   in a dry pipkin — the twigs should then be smeared with it."

 216                            EVERY    BOY'S  BOOK.
 of the leaves and small shoots, is coated all over with birdlime which
 has been prepared on a larger scale than by chewing. The bough is
 then fixed on a low dead nedge, near a pond, or other place favour
 able to the resort of small birds. The bird-catcher, concealing himself
 as near the bough as he can, imitates the notes of the birds he wishes
 to attract. The birds approach, alight on the bough, and stick fast,
 when they are easily secured.           Sometimes the birds are attracted by
 a decoy,whieh may be a bat or an owl, of which the latter is the
 best.    Whenever an owl shows himself by daylight it is sure to be
 followed by all the small birds that see it ; and, when it is fastened
 near the limed bough, the birds will collect around it in great num
 bers, and will sooner or later settle on the bough, from which they
 may be easily taken.
                                  THE srnraotB.1
     The springle is a somewhat complicated engine, but very effective
 as  a bird-catcher.      It consists of five parts, as follows : —
                           1. The Stump. A small stout stake of wood,
            1           about five inches in length, which is fixed firmly in
            •           the ground, with its head about an inch above the
            f           surface.
                            2. The Spreader. This is a small bent switch,
                        having a notch at its thicker end. It is kept in its
                        bent position by a piece of small cord whipped
                        over its smaller ana larger end, which are tnus
                        united just above the notch.
                           3. The Bender is also a piece of pliant wythe
                        or hazel.     It is about eigh teen inchesj long; both
                        ends of it are fixed into the ground so as to form a
                       kind of arch.                    ,
                           4. The Springer. This is a hazel rod of about four
                       feet in length, thick at one end and tapering at
                       the other ; to the tapering end is fixed a piece of
                       string.
                          5. The Catch A is a small piece of wood fixed
                       at the end of the string of the springer.               It is
                                                                                      '
                       about half an inch long, a quarter broad, and the
                       eighth of an inch thick. It is slightly bevelled off
                       at one end, so as to adapt it to the notch of the
                       spreader.
    6. 'The Noose is a slip knot, formed          of horsehair, fastened below
the catch.
   (1) There are various kinds of traps to be bought at the bird-fanciers, of perfect
construction, and adapted to the taking of any kind of bird : very effective traps
may be bought at such places, particularly the "worm trap," for about eighteen
pence each ; we should, however, advise our young friend not to purcha&e such
things ready made, but to take the trouble of making them himself.

                                BIRDS.                                217
                      HOW TO SET THE SPB1NGLE.
  In   setting the springle, the following directions are to be
attended to.
   1. The stump is driven firmly into the ground.
   2. The spreader is placed around the stump, so that its bight is in
contact with it.
   3. The bender is fixed into the ground
at about the length of the spreader from
the stump.
   4. The thick end of the springer is
now fixed in the ground, at a little dis
tance from the bender, and the small
end of -it bent down till one end of the
catch is placed upwards, and on the outside of the bender.
   5. The spreader is now raised about an inch from the ground, and
the small end of the catch is put into the notch,
   6. The horsehair slip knot is now arranged loosely round the
fender, and the trap is set.
   A little seed is now scattered within, and for some distance around,
the spreader.
   The operation of the trap is as follows : —
   The bird, attracted by the bait, soon perches upon the spreader,
which falls owing to its weight ; the catch being thus set at liberty,
the springer flies up, and the rjoor bird is caught either by the legs,
wings, or body, by the horsehair noose or slip knot.
   The bird-catcher usually watches at a short distance to seize the
bird as soon as it is ensnared, or it would in a short time flutter
itself to death or be strangled.
                          NIGHTINGALE TRAP.
   The nightingale is often caught by a kind of trap composed of a
board and purse net^which, by means of an elastic spring, falls when
the bait is seized, 'in' the-, same. manner as the lid of a common cage
trap. It is placed soon after sunrise on a bank, or some conspicuous
spot in a wood frequented by nightingales.       The bird-catcher, stand
ing at a short distance from the trap, then imitates the note of the
hen nightingale, at the sound of which the male birds      fly with great
swiftness towards the place, and are      by
                                           a bait caught in the trap.
                          SPRINGES   FOR LABKS.
   Larks are frequently caught       by
                                    what are termed springes, in the
following manner — line, ten or twenty yards in length, having
                  :   A                                                 a
horsehair noose fixed at every six inches of its length,         is
                                                               pegged
down to the ground, and few oats are sprinkled along it. The bird-
                           a
catcher places himself at such  distance as not to frighten the birds,
                                a
while he can at the same time see when they are caught.    The larks,

pitching   down, to get at the oats, get entangled in the horsehair
noose attached to the line, and are easily caught. In some parts of
the country, particularly in Dnnstable, tie lines are several hundred
yards long, and many thousands of larks are taken annually by these
means, and sent to the London markets, to be vilely — eaten !      The
man who eats a lark ought never to hear one sing again as long as he
lives.
              HOT  WOODCOCKS    AND SNIPES ARE CAUGHT.
   In Lincolnshire, and other fenny countries, a modification of the
above plan is employed in the capture of woodcocks and snipes.
Small barriers formed of stocks and stones, or the tops of brooms
stuck in the ground, are made across the wet furrows of a field, with
openings here and there, while horse hair nooses are placed near these
openings.    The birds, finding a passage through the openings, arc
generally entangled by the noose, and then secured.
                             DECOY BIRDS.
   The most ingenious method of catching birds is that employed by
the London bird-catchers in the neighbourhood of London, in which
decoy birds are employed in addition to nets.       The apparatus for
this practice is heavy, and is carried on a man's back. This method
of bird-catching has been long practised, and is brought to a must
systematic perfection.     The nets are a most ingenious piece of
mechanism, generally twelve yards and a half long, and two yards
and a half wide ; and no one, on bare inspection, would imagine that
a bird who is so very quick in all his motions could be caught by the
nets flapping over each other, till he becomes eye-witness that the
puller seldom fails.
   The first thing this kind of bird-catcher has to do is to train bis

                                    BIRDS.                              219
decoy birds, or as he terms them, his call birds.          It is known that
the moulting    of  a bird has  a considerable  effect on the song or voice,
and the men contrive that the birds to be employed as call oirds shall
moult earlier than those in the wild state.          For this purpose they
confine a certain number of birds in close boxes, covered with thick
layers of flannel, and keep them in as confined and close an atmo-
phere as possible.      Of the few birds that survive this treatment, the
moulting takes place at an earlier period of the year than when in a
wild state, and they thus become what is termed "in song."
     A certain number of different kinds of birds being thus prepared,
the bird-catcher proceeds to the field, or place he has chosen for his
operations, and spreads his nets on the ground.            He generally has
with him about five or six linnets, two goldfinches, two greenfinches,
 a woodlark, a redpole, a yellow hammer, a titlark, and a Bullfinch ; all
trained to act as call birds, and all placed in little cages, at small dis
 tances from the nets.      The sight and hearing of these birds infinitely
 exceed in acnteness those of the bird-catcher, and as soon as any of
 the wild birds are perceived, one of the call birds of the same species
 immediately raises his voice, and all the rest soon follow in a loud,
 clear, and cheerful chorus.       This call is not a song, it is a peculiar
                                             "             "
 kind of chirp called by the bird-catcher short jerks ; and when these
 short jerks are heard by the wild birds, they are instantly arrested in
 their flight, and attracted down to the spot near which the nets are
 placed ; and the bird-catcher, watching his opportunity, closes his nets
 upon them.
     A curious additional contrivance is sometimes practised for the
 capture of larks.     A few small pieces of looking-glass are fixed to a
 piece   of wood  placed in the middle of the net, and set into a quick,
 whirling   motion,   by a string which the larker commands.        The glit
 tering reflection of the bits of glass attracts the larks, who drop down
 to within a foot of them, when the larker, watching his opportunity,
 pulls up, and rarely misses them.
     There is a curious mode of taking birds which is practised in some
 parts of France. A frame is constructed of wood, generally of the
 stripped branches of some of the slender straight-
 growmg poplars, in the centre of which a seat is
 placed for the bird-catcher to sit upon.       The frame
  so constructed is afterwards covered with boughs
 and evergreen shrubs, among which are openings for
 the entrance of the birds, and also for the hands of
 the bird-catcher to come out, who is seated like a
 jack-in-the-green within.      When the birds alight on
  or about the sides of the holes, the bird-catcher
 nimbly seizes them by the hand, or by means of a small flap trap
 which he thrusts out at one of the holes, and upon which the birds
  alight. Modifications of this plan might be successfully adopted by
  the juvenile bird-catcher.

                                  Cages   of Birds.
                              THE BREEDING-CAGE.
   The breeding-cage should be constructed of teak or mahogany, and
be about   four feet long, eighteen inches wide, and two feet high ; and
should   be  made to stand flat on the stand, or it may be hung up
against the side-wall of a room.            The back of this cage is of wood,
and the sides, top, and front, of wire.               It should have perches of
various heights    for   the   birds   to  hop    on,  and boxes in the further
right-hand corner for     them    to  build   m.    The   bottom should be pro-
viaed with a slide to draw         in  and out, for the purpose of cleanmg ;
and it should have drawers for food, and glasses for drinking from.
At the proper time, a net, filled with moss, hair, and other building
materials, should be suspended from one of the top bars; and the
whole should present a cheerful but comfortable appearance.
                          THE NIGHTINGALE'S CAGE.
   This has the back and sides of wood, and is about two feet long by
one wide, and sixteen inches in height. The top forms a broad angle,
                    and should be covered with some soft material,
                    stretched under the arch, so that the bird, when he
                    flutters and attempts to rise, may not hurt his head.
                    It should also have two perches, covered with list,
                    which should be glued on, so that the bird may not
                     injure his feet.        The feeding-trough is placed in
                    one of the front corners, and the drinking-place
                    in the other.         The price of these is about loj.
each ; very superior     ones,   a  guinea.
                                              THE   LARK'S CAGE.
                              The lark's cage has also a gabled roof and
                           boarded back, the sides and front being of wire,
                           the latter part being bowed out, so as to
                           afford room for the "turf," upon which the
                           bird generally stands.           The water-place for
                           drinking     and   the  food-trough are at opposite

sides of the cage.    No perch is required for the lark.     The price of
these cages is about 5*. or 6*.
                          THE LINNET'S    CAGE.
   The linnet has usually a very small cage, sometimes entirely sur
rounded by wire; at other times it has a wooden
back, with wire only at the front and sides.    It ought
to be at least two feet long, sixteen inches broad, and
the same in height, with proper perches, a sliding
bottom, food-box, and a glass for water.     It is a very
wretched thing to put linnets into cages in which they
have no room to take exercise, by which means they
are soon destroyed.
                        THE BLACKBIRD'S     CAGE.
   The blackbird's cage should be commodious.           It is made prin
cipally of wicker, with a gabled top of wood. The food and water are
placed in two little boxes at the sides, and there should be a drawer
at the bottom for cleaning.    These may be had at the bird-shops for
various prices, varying from 5a. to 15s.
            THE BLACKBIKD'a  CAOE.                THE CANARY'J CAGE.
                          THE CANARY'S CAGE.
   These are made of various sizes and fashions — Gothic, Oriental,
Chinese, Persian, and Rustic. But, to be of any service to birds, they
should be well-sized and comfortable, so that the bird may have
elbow-room.
                  HOW TO KNOW COCKS FROM HENS.
   In  the purchase of birds, it is of great importance that the young
bird-fancier should be able to tell cocks from hens ; and the following
directions will enable him to do this with facility : —
   The Blackbird. — There are two kinds of blackbirds, the black and
the grey. The hen of the black kind is generally as black as the cock
of the grey kind. The cocks of both are blacker than the hens ; and
the best plan is to take the blackest and biggest birds of the nest.

   The Bullfinch. — The romp is whitish, the back bluish, and there is
a cast of reddish feathers under the wing of the cock bird.

                              THE CANAB.Y.
   THE canary-bird, or canary -finch, is a well-known captive songster
in this and most other European countries. It is a native of the
Canary Islands, and in the wild state its prevailing colour is brown,
mingled, however, with other colours, but never equalling the beautiful
yellow exhibited by the captive bird. Dr. Heincken, who describes
its character and habits in Madeira, where these birds abound, says
it builds its nest in thick, bushy, high shrubs and trees, with roots,
moss, feathers, hair, &c.   It pairs in February, lays from four to six
pale blue eggs, and hatches five, and often six times in the season.
   The canary is a delightful songster.- It was brought into Europe
early in the sixteenth century ; and is believed to have spread from
the coast of Italy, where a vessel, which was bringing to Leghorn
a number of these birds, was wrecked. The climate being favourable,
the birds increased; and would have been naturalized, but from a
desire of persons to obtain them as a domestic fancy.
   Those canaries that have the upper part of the body of a dusky
green colour, or linnet-brown, and the under part the yellowish green
of the green bird, with dark brown eyes, are the strongest, and most
nearly resemble the primitive race. The yellow and white have often
red eyes, and are the most tender.        The chestnut are the most
uncommon, and hold a middle rank, for strength and length of life,
between the two extremes.

       •
     The canary most admired among us now, is one with the body
white or yellow, — the head, particularly, if crested, — wings and tall
              dun.    The second m degree is of a golden yellow, with the
Cwish   , wings  and   tail black, or at least dusky grey. "Next follow the
grey or blackish, with a yellow head and collar; and the yellow,
witn a blackish or green tuft; both of which are much valued.
Those that are irregularly spotted are not much sought after, except
for breeding purposes.
     In choosmg canary birds, the bold and lively looking should be
preferred ; and the melody of the song should also be regarded, for
some will open with the notes of the nightingale, and, after running
through a variety of modulations, end like the titlark ; others, again,
will begin like the skylark, and, after soft and sweet notes, end like
the nightingale. Lessons may be taught to this beautiful bird in its
 confined state, but its native song is loud and piercing.        Some birds
not only learn notes with correctness, but have been taught to
pronounce words.
     Breeding. — Canary birds sometimes breed all the year round, but
they usually begin to pair in April, and to breed in July or August.
In Germany and the Tyrol, where the breeding of these birds forms
the occupation of numbers, and from whence the rest of Europe is
principally supplied, the apparatus for breeding them is large and
expensive.       A large building is erected for them, with a square space
at each end, and holes communicating with these spaces.             In these
outlets are planted such trees as the birds prefer.           The bottom is
strewed with sand, on which is cast rapeseed and chickweed, and
such other food as they like.          Throughout the inner compartment,
which is kept dark, rooms are placed for the birds to build m. With
this, however, the breeding of these birds is made less expensive.
    In pairing the birds, two birds should be matched which are strong
and vigorous ; this should be done about the middle of March.             The
cock and hen may at first be put together in a small cage, to pair
them ; after which they may be turned out into the proper breedmg-
cage. After the hen has laid, and while she is sitting, both birds may
be fed with groundsel having seed on        it,   and afterwards chickweed
with seed on it. When the young are hatched, let the old birds have
plenty of soft as well as other food.
    If you desire to bring up the young birds hand, they may have
                                                      by
the same food as linnets.         They should be taken from the nest when
about a     fortnight  old.  After they are thus taken from the parent hen,
they may be fed with the yolk of egg, boiled hard, chopped up with
a  little bread, and about one-third of scalded rapeseed.     It   should all
be mixed very fine, and given to them in small quantities at        a   time.
Take particular care that the rapeseed     is    not sour.  The  food should
also be made fresh at least once a-wcek.
    The canary  is    subject to many distempers  ;   one of the principalis
produced   by     their over-eating, which brmgs on kind of surfeit, and
                                                       a

 they often swell to an extraordinary size, and appear to suffer much
 pain.   They should then be fed sparingly, and kept verv warm. The
 bird  should, at this time have white oatmeal placed with his seed, to
 scour him, and a little liquorice in his water.   Ifthe bird should be
 very ill, let him have a little Naples biscuit, steeped in white wine,
 and force a little of it down his mouth.
    Sometimes the canary has the disease, which is also common to
                          "
 other birds, called the pip." This is a small abscess which appears
 under the feathers of the rump. When this is ripe, it may be opened
 with a small needle, and all the matter gently squeezed out of it;
 afterwards a little bit of sugar, moistened by the mouth and put on
 the wound, will cause it to heal.    Sometimes a kind of scurf appears
 on the head of the canary ; this may be cured by the application of
the oil of sweet almonds, or a little very fresh butter.
    Moulting. — Moulting is natural to all birds, and while it lasts the
health of the bird is often precarious. When birds begin to moult,
that  is,  change their feathers, they appear roving, melancholy, and
drowsy. In the first year of moulting, the bird casts only his down
and small feathers, but in the second his tail and wing feathers.
When in moult, birds should be kept warm, and have good nourishing
food.     Naples biscuit, bread, and hard-boiled egg, bruised hemp and
lettuce seed, and rapeseed, are then good for them, and    alittle saffron
in their water, which will greatly help them to cast their feathers.
    Their Nests. — The best thing to give them to build with   is fine hay
and elk's hair; but they will sometimes use the dry        duckweed,     or
any other matter fit for the purpose, they may find at the bottom of
their cage.
                            THE COMHON LINNET.
   The linnet  is  well-known song-bird.
                    a                     It usually builds some    in
thick hedge or furze the outside of its nest
                        ;                       composed of moss,
                                                  is
dried grass, and roots, and the inside of fine soft wool and hair. The
female lays four or five eggs, which are white, spotted with blue, and
                                    Q

irregularly spotted with brown at the larger end. The young are
hatched towards the end of April or the beginning of May.
   The song of the linnet is very lively, ana sweetW varied; its man
ners are gentle, and its disposition is docile.        When confined with
other birds, it easily adopts their song ; and, when taken young, it
may readily be taught to modulate its voice to any sound to which it
is accustomed.    But its native strains are more delightful than any in
which it is capable of being instructed. It has been asserted that the
linnet may be taught to pronounce many words distinctly.
   The education of linnets should commence as soon as their feathers
begin to shoot.    The bird should be separated from the rest of the
brood, and at this early period is fed on soaked bread, eggs boiled
hard, and rapeseed that has been steeped in water for some time.
   Different plans are adopted for teaching particular tunes to a yonng
linnet. Sometimes, when the bird does not show much disposition to
profit by instruction, he is taken on the finger, and held before a
mirror, the tune being whistled in a distinct manner for some time.
Seeing before him what he believes to be another bird of his own
species, the linnet then begins to tune up ; and not having learned
any of his native songs by companionship with his fellows, he makes
the first attempt to nnitate that which his master has whistled to
him.    The teaching is more likely to succeed by candlelight than by
davlight.
   1The treatment   of linnets, when they become cageable, is very
simple.    Square cages are more suitable for them than round ones,
since they are less disposed to giddiness therein, and also sing better.
Should it be wished to give them liberty in a room, a small tree or
roosting-place should be set up in one corner of the apartment ; and
on this the birds will remain perched and sing cheerfully all day
long, only leaving their perch to eat and drink.        Unless a roosting-
place is provided, they will remain on the floor, to the danger of
being trodden on.
   The general food of tame linnets is summer rapeseed.              When
young male linnets are being trained       for  song, they may   be  fed as
before directed, or with oatmeal and rapeseed bruised in milk-and-
water.    They are given about as much as their bills will contain at a
time, and are kept clean and warm. They become familiar if fed with
the hand and chirped to.       When they can feed alone, the summer
rapeseed is given to them   entire,  but still moistened in water, so that
they may break it the more easily.      Their food is now varied by the
addition of millet, radish, cabbage, lettuce, and plantain-seeds, and
sometimes a few melon-seeds or barberries.         The more their food is
varied, the fewer maladies they will have ; but care must be taken
not to over-feed them when confined in a cage. A supply of summer
rapeseed must also be within the bird's reach; but the other kinds of
food must be given sparingly, and by turns.         Birds that have liberty
to range in an apartment may be more freely fed than those that are

wholly confmed to their cages.      Hempseed must be given sparingly,
because   it fattens them so much that they either die or leave off
singing.    A little salt mixed with their food is very agreeable to
them,   and preserves them from many diseases.
   Linnets are very fond of bathing, and of dusting their feathers
with sand ; they should therefore have a bath of fresh water daily
attached to their cage, and should also be supplied with a bed of fine
sand, renewed from time to time.      A small piece of chalk should also
be put into their cages to prevent looseness, to which they are verv
liable, and also to guard against epilepsy, the symptoms of which
are silence, melancholy, ana a bristling of the feathers ; the bill at
length becomes hard, the veins thick and red, the feet callous and so
swollen that the bird can scarcely sit on its perch.    Linnets are also
very subject to asthma, which may easily be detected by the short
ness of breath, and by the bird keeping his beak open as if to gasp
for air. This disease is generally produced by dry, heating food, and
bv dry, stove-heated rooms.      The oest remedy is to leave off giving
them dry and heating food, and to give them bread and milk, lettuce,
and rue, and water-cresses.     The bread and milk should be very fresh
and sweet, for if it should be in the least sour it will do the bird a
great deal of harm.       This treatment generally relieves, and often
cures this and other diseases of these birds.
                             THE GOLDHNCH.
   Of all the British finches   none equals the goldfinch in beauty of
plumage and docility, hence    it is one of the most frequently kept in
captivity; for though its song is soft and pleasing, it is deficient in
power, which the beauty of the bird in some degree makes up for.
   The nest of the goldfinch is often found in an orchard, large garden,
or plantation, in an apple or pear tree, or carefully placed in some
thick evergreen shrub, — somewhere in the neighbourhood of man, but
not immediately within his view. The bird lays five or six white eggs,
marked with deep purple spots at the larger end. They feed their

young with caterpillars and insects, and the old birds feed on various
kinds of seeds, particularly those of the thistle, dandelion, and
groundsel.
    Goldfinches are more easily tamed than many other birds, and so
reconciled are they to their cages, that they seem really attached to
them.     If a young goldfinch be brought up under a canary, or wood-
lark, or any other smging bird, it readily catches their song ; and it
is also remarkably docile ; and with attention on the part of the
teacher it may be made to repeat tunes on the flageolet.      Yet it is not
worth the pams of the teacher or the effort of the bird thus to substi
tute artificial strains for the pleasing natural melody it pours forth.
    Various tricks are sometimes taught to goldfinches, which are very
trifling, and do not really enhance the value of the bird. Thus they
are frequently trained to let off a small cannon, and to imitate death.
They have also been instructed to draw up their food and water by
means of a long chain and pulley, furuishea with a soft leather bane],
hung from holes through which the wings and feet are passed.           The
ends of this band meet under the belly, and are fastened to a ring, to
which the chain is attached.       At the end of the latter is the bucket,
which contains the food or water.
    The best kind of cages for goldfinches are square ones, and the
larger the cage the better, as this bird is very nnpatient of confine
ment in a small one.      In the cage should be a bath, with clean water,
as the bird is very fond of bathing, particularly in the summer time.
Its food should vary. In the wild state it subsists on various kinds
of small seed, such as those of the lettuce, dandelion, thistle, radish,
goat's beard, chickweed, groundsel, &c.        In the house it should be
fed with poppy, canary, and hemp seed, varied with lettuce and rape-
seed.    Green food should be given occasionally, such as chickweed,
water-cresses, lettuce, or endive.
   The goldfinch is troubled with many diseases, most of which how
ever may be kept away by care and attention on the part of the little
naturalist ; pure water, dry food, roomy cages, warmth in the winter,
and sunshine in the summer, will do much to prevent diseases, and
even to cure them when they appear.          There is a great demand for
the goldfinch as a cage bird, ana a fine male usually sells for six or
seven shillings.
                              THE BULLFINCH.
   The bullfinch is a native of England, and also of most parts of the
European continent.        It is attached to sheltered and well wooded
districts, which it seldom leaves, and is therefore not so frequently
seen as many other birds.       It generally constructs its nest, which 1s
composed of small dry twigs, in the thickest parts of a white or a
black thorn hedge.      The female lays about four or five bluish-white
eggs, marked with dark spots at the larger end, and breeds about the

 latter end of May.    High trees are sometimes chosen      as the place for
  its nest.
     The song of the bullfinch in its wild state is not very interesting, —
 very low and mournful ; but the power he has when caged of acquir
 ing distinct tunes is very surprising, and has made the bird an object
 of a considerable and lucrative trade.      The education of the bullfinch
 is carried on in Germany, where the patience and ingenuity of the
 people are well calculated to surmount the difficulties attending the
 task, and of which we shall furnish an account, deeming it to be inte
 resting to our young readers, who may do the same if they choose to
 take the trouble.
     In the month of June the young ones, which are sought for in the
 nests of wild birds, are taken when about ten days old, and brought
 up by a person whose care and attention to their wants render them
 completely docile.    At the end of two months they begin to whistle,
but their education commences earlier. The tune they are to learn is
played to them repeatedly on a little instrument called a bird-organ,
the notes of which nearly resemble those of a bullfinch. It is true
that the birds learn more quickly, and remember their tunes much
better, if it is played to them at the time they receive their food, or
immediately afterwards.      It  is essential that the birds should hear no
other sounds than those it is intended they should imitate ; and, in
order to get a very correct songster, it is desirable early to separate
him from the other birds, lest, through his facility of nnitation, he
should spoil the tune, by intermingling with it the correct notes of
other learners.     These birds are such good imitators, that if the bird-
organ be somewhat out of tune, the unpleasant effect is perpetuated
in their song ; hence some persons consider that the good whistling
of a person is a far preferable means of instruction to the instrument

in question.      Dr. Stanley, the late good and lamented bishop of
                           "
Norwich, observes that no school canoe more diligently attendee by
its master, and no scholars more effectually trained to their own calling,
than a seminary of bullfinches. As a general rule they are formed
into classes, about six in each, and kept in a dark room, where food
and music are administered at the same tune ; so that when the meal
is ended, if the birds feel disposed to tune up, they are naturally in
clined to copy the sounds which are so familiar to them.       As soon as
they begin to imitate a few notes, the light is admitted, which still
further exhilarates their spirits, and inclines them to sing.     In some
establishments the starving system is adopted, and the birds are not
allowed food or light until they sing.     When they have been under
this course of instruction, in classes, for some time, they are com
mitted singly to the care of boys, whose sole business is to go on
with their education.      Each boy assiduously plays his organ from
morning till night, for the instruction of the "bird committed to their
care, while the class teacher goes his regular rounds, superintending
the progress of his feathered pupils, ana scolding or rewarding them
in a manner which they perfectly understand, and strictly in accord
ance with the attentions or disregard they have shown to the instruc
tions of the monitor. This round of teachmg goes on unintermittingly,
for no less a period than nine months, by which time the bird bas
acquired firmness, and is less likely to forget or spoil the air, by
leaving out passages, or giving them in the wrong place.           At the
time of moulting, the best mstructed birds are liable to lose the recol
lection of their times, and therefore require them frequently repeated
at that time, otherwise all the previous labour will be thrown away.
There are celebrated schools for these birds at Hesse and Fulda, from
whence all Germany, Holland, and England receive supplies of the
little musicians.   In some cases the birds have been taught to whistle
three different airs, without spoiling or confusing them, but in general
a simple air, with perhaps a little prelude, is as much as they can
remember."
    When a tune is thoroughly learned, the birds retain    it for the rest
of their lives.
                               THE THRUSH.
    Birds of the thrush family are exceedingly numerous, and' are
found in nearly every part of the world, the several species being
adapted to nearly every climate. The song-thrush, mavis, or throstle,
is a well-known and much-admired bird m this country,— charming
us not only by the sweetness but the variety of its song, which it com
mences early in the spring, and continues to the beginning of autumn.
It is one of the smallest of British thrushes, and is widely distri
buted.    In Scotland, and in the cast and north of England, it is
 called the Mavis.
    The nest of the thrush is a compact structure, formed without of

moss and fibres, and strengthened by an internal plastering of mud.
It is generally situated in the midst of a thick hedge or bush.   The
eggs vary in number from three to six, and are of a pale bluish-green
colour, with small spots of rust-colour or black. During the hatching
of the young, the male bird is very attentive to its mate, and shares
her assiduity in seeking food for her offspring. The social disposition
of these birds is shown by their often choosing a place for their nest
almost within sight of the windows of a country residence.
   Thrushes feea chiefly on slugs, worms, and snails ; of which latter
especially they destroy such numbers, that they deserve to be held in
especial esteem by gardeners, and to be forgiven      if,
                                                        when there    isa

the garden.

not in variety, to that of any of the warblers. It     one of the birds
                                                      is
of plenty, and its voice is seldom heard among the scenes of
desolation.
   In placing the thrush among cage-birds, we do not intend to
recommend its capture for that purpose.         In the heart of cities,
indeed, where the natural song of the bird can never be heard,
perhaps  it   excusable to deprive
              is                     it  of liberty, for the sake of the
heart-cheering strains which, even    in such situations,   itpours forth
to gladden the spirit of the pent-up throng but, in situations where

summer,   itseems  a piece of cruelty to mate    itprisoner.
   Where kept in   confinement,  however,   a  very large cage   isneces
sary for the health and comfort of the thrush, that    it may be able to
take exercise without injuring its feathers.       If possible, the cage

should be three feet and a half long, and nearly as many high. Oat
meal, moistened with milk, is very suitable food for this bird ; it may
also be fed with a paste made of the crumb of bread, rapeseed or
hempseed bruised, and meat cut small.     Grapes and other fruits are
givem by way of variety.    A plentiful supply of water is necessary,
both for bathing and drinking.
    With care and attention, the thrush may be preserved in captivity
for seven or eight years : it may even be taught to whistle many airs
on the bird-organ ; but few persons of taste would ever wish to sub
stitute other strains for those with which it delights our ears        ir.

woodlark hold the first place.    The skylark      the most harmonious

country, larks have usually two broods       in
                                            the year. The eggs, to the
number of four or five, are of     greyish colour, with brown spots
                                        a                               ;

fortnight the young ones quit the nest.    Their mother teaches them
how to procure their food, which at first consists of caterpillars,
worms, and ants' eggs. When full-grown, larks feed on grains, herbs,
and vegetable substances in general.
   If persons are desirous of bringing up young larks for the aviarv
or cage, they must attend to the directions of Bechstein, who recom"-

or  a little niinccd lean meat. The males will soon be distinguished
by their yellow colour. As they advance towards full growth, they
may be fed with a paste made with grated carrot, white bread soaked
in water, and barley or wheat meal, all worked together in a mortar.
In addition to this paste, larks should be supplied with poppy-seeds,
bruised hemp, crumbs of bread, and plenty of greens, such as lettuce,
endive, cabbage, or water-cress ; with a little lean meat or ants' eggs
occasionally, by way of delicacy.     Old larks, on being first made pri
soners, are fed only on oats or poppy-seeds, in order to reconcile them
to their captivity.
   Larks may be kept in rooms, in aviaries, or in large cages. It is
pitiable to see the narrow prisons to which these birds of the sky are
ever doomed.       The cage should never be less than eighteen inches
long,   nine  wide, and fifteen inches high ; and a deep layer of sand
should always cover the bottom, in order that the bird, accustomed
as it is to roost and nestle on the ground, may have the means of
scratching and dusting its feathers in the natural manner.      The cage
should be without any cross-stick, and furnished with a piece of fresh
turf, to be often renewed.
   The greatest attention to cleanliness is required with this bird, the
feet being very tender and subject to disease in a state of confine
ment ; even a thread or hair becoming entangled in them easily cuts
the skin and maims the bird, so that the toes shrink and fall off. The
extreme length of the hind-claw is the reason why the lark is inca
pable of perching, and therefore needs no rods to be placed across
his cage.
   Larks usually live for nine or ten years in captivity, if they are
well looked after; but instances have occurredT of much greater
longevity : some have been known to attain the age of twenty -four
years.     Like most other caged birds, larks are subject to epilepsy ;
and to see him in his cage is to us always an unpleasant sight. His
soaring nature, ever prompting him to upward flight, and to pour
forth his rapturous song m the fields of the air, makes his cage
a prison. Where other birds would soon grow reconciled and happy,
the lark generally exhibits a continual restlessness and impatience of
his prison bars, or sinks into a state of gloom and despondency.
Where the attentive kindness of the owner has made the poor lark's
prison as comfortable a home as possible, the bird will grow familiar,
and, however he may secretly pme for the air of the heights above
the clouds, he will eat from the hand or from the table ; but, at the
best, he continues to exhibit his natural instinct, and to put himself
in the attitude of springing perpendicularly into the air, especially iu
those seasons when it would naturally do so if it were at liberty.
                              THE BLACKBIRD.
   The blackbird is a well-known bird of song, whose deep-toned
warblings are not to be mistaken for those of any other inhabitant of

 234                       EVERY  BOY'S   BOOK.
the groves.     As a cage-bird it is very common           in towns and
cities, and is greatly prized among bird-keepers and bird-fanciers;
but its songs are never so delightful as when they are heard from the
depths of the woods, or from the top branches of some friendly
thicket, in the sweet time of spring.
   The blackbird feeds upon berries, fruit, insects, and worms. He
leads a solitary life, except during the breeding season ; this com
mences early.     The place chosen for its nest is a thick bush, an ivied
wall, or a low  tree.  The hen bird lays four or five eggs, of a bluish-
green colour, marked irregularly with dusky spots.        The outside of
the nest is formed of moss, lichen, and small roots, worked up with
clay or mud, and lined with the softest materials that can be found.
Both parent birds work very hard till the nest is completed, and it is
generally finished in about a week.    Blackbirds' nests are very often
found near houses, and one builds regularly every year in the planta
tion by the side of my lawn at Holly Lodge ; and the old hen is so
tame that, while close sitting, each year she allowed me to come and
stroke her back with my fingers.
   Blackbirds have generally two broods in the season ; the one near
me always has two. The young blackbirds are very great feeders,
and keep their parents actively employed in procuring them food. A
great number of worms and caterpillars are carried to the nest, and
the young ones thrive well on this food.       As soon as they are old
enough to manage for themselves, they separate from their parents,

and from each other, and pursue their search after food in places
where it most abounds, — adding to their insect diet various other
kinds of food.     In my garden, they play " old gooseberry" with the
currants.
    Persons wishing to bring up young blackbirds usually take them
from the nest as soon as they are leathered.       They may be fed at
first with a liquid paste, made of steeped bread, yolk of egg, and
bruised hempseed; afterwards, with sneep's heart, minced meat,
bread crumbs, and different meats, fruits, and berries.
    If it is desirable to teach the young birds to sing artificial tunes,
they must be taken when the quills of the feathers are just beginning
to be developed, because they have not then learned their natural
song; and will acquire another more rapidly.       The bill of a young
cock is black, and does not turn yellow till he is about nine or ten
months old. The plumage of the female is more dusky than that of
the cock, which is of a pure jet.
    The cage of the blackbird should be large, but he must be its sole
occupant, for he is naturally uneasy and quarrelsome with his fellows,
and particularly so in confinement.    In very large aviaries filled with
shrubs and bushes, it is a very pretty sight to see them forming their
own nests, and bringing up their young, which they will do jf pro
vided with proper food.
    The principal disease to which the blackbird is liable is the pip, an
inflammation and abscess of the rump gland, which, when ripe, should
be pierced with a small needle to let out the offending matter.         A
little chalk should be afterwards put into the bird's water. When
a blackbird is pining or sickly, a spider brought to him, which he will
generally take easily, is the best remedy.      With proper care this
bird will live ten or twelve years; but in order to preserve them in
health they should be kept very clean, and have plenty of fresh water
given them for bathing every day.
                             THE WOODLAB.K.
    The woodlark is not so much an inhabitant of woods as of wilds ;
and it is found in the southern and eastern counties of England, and
is an inhabitant of Germany, Holland, Siberia, Poland, and Italy. It
bears some resemblance to the skylark, but is one-third smaller. The
habits of the two species are also somewhat similar ; but the wood-
lark sometimes perches and pours forth his song from the summit of
trees, which the skylark never does.
    The nesting time of the woodlark varies in different parts of the
country.     The old birds generally build in March, and hatch their
brood in May. The young of the woodlark are in great request
among bird-fanciers.     The nest is usually concealed near the borders
of woods, in some furrow covered with grass or brambles, and in
the midst of a thick carpeting of moss. The nest itself is made of
grass, and usually has a soft lming of hair. The eggs are four and

236                      EVERY BOY'S       BOOK.
five in number, of a dirty white tinged with brown, and having
patches of a darker brown and grey.
   The song of the woodlark has been evet- celebrated for its softness,
sweetness, and richness ; and to hear the woodlark on a wild and
lone hill-side, where there is nothing to give accompaniment, save
the bleating of a flock or the tinkling of a sheep-bell,   is,to minds
constituted in certain way, delightful.
              a
   The food of the woodlark     is various.   Early in spring, before
the insects are plentiful,it  feeds on the buds *of herbs, on water-
cresses, and sometimes on the buds of filbert-trees.   In summer     it
feeds on insect food, and in autumn on various seeds.   When taken
to be brought up he should be put into     acage with adouble perch,
and given, in addition to the usual paste, poppy-seed, oats, hemp,
sprouting wheat, fresh candy, fresh and dried ants' eggs, minced ox
hearts, meal, worms, and the like. The best things to induce young
                                                                 a
bird to eat are poppy-seeds and ants' eggs.    At first his food should
be thrown on the bottom of the cage, and afterwards, when the bird
is more familiar,  itmay be placed    in
                                       the trough.    Nestlings may be
taken when about ten days old.
   Woodlarks are seldom happy   in  confinement, and with the greatest
care they often pine under captivity.        They are in appearance
tranquil, but their appetite fails and when spring returns, unless
                                  ;
restored to their liberty, they frequently perish, asit   were broken
hearted.   In truth, the woodlark is fond of the sky and the cloud    ;
and to confine a  bird with these soaring instincts within the narrow
linuts ofa  cage, betraysa  strange want of benevolence.

                            THE TITLARK.
  This bird is of an elegant and slender shape, and in many parts of
England is a very common bird. It is met with in marshes, barren
moors, and mountainous     heaths.   Its nest, made of dry grass and
stalks of plants, lined with fine grass and horsehair, is placed upon
the grouna amongst furze and long grass.       It generally lays eggs
twice a year, and these are usually six in number, varying in colour,
some being pink, some grey, brown, or field green.        While the hen
is sitting, the male bird  generally sits up    in an adjoining tree and
pours forth its short but pleasing song.
   The food of the titlark in a state of nature is ants' eggs, beetles,
caterpillars, and every kind of   flyand.flitting thing. When young
birds are procured they should be put into    a    two-perched cage, and
fed with meal, worms, ants' eggs, and small caterpillars. As the
birds grow up they should be provided with     a     bathmg pan, and be
kept particularly clean in every respect.      The young naturalist will
find them very difficult and tender birds to bring up, and they will
scarcely repay him for his care and attention.

number, of a pale reddish brown, obscurely marked with a deeper
shade of the same colour, and with grey.
   The young birds of both sexes when first fledged resemble the
female.    They leave the nest at an early period, especially if dis
turbed. Following their parents as well as they can, they hop from
branch to branch, but gather closely together at roosting time.
The whole family may then be observed perched on one branch,
the male at one end and the female at the other, and the little
ones in the middle.
   On the first arrival of the blackcap, insect food is not to be had,
and the birds are fain to content themselves with the ripe berries of
the ivy.    By the time the ivy berries are over, the little green larvse
of the smafi moths are getting plentiful, rolled up in the young
shoots and leaves ; this is their chief food until the strawberries and
cherries become ripe ; after that there is no want of fruit or berries
till their return, and there is no sort of fruit or berry they will
refuse.   After they have eaten the elder-berry in autumn they im
mediately   leave us.
   The blackcap has the wildest and most witching note of all our
warblers. The song when the bird is at rest seems to be by turns
like that of several Trirds.    The bird appears to be much excited
while singing,   and  often  chooses  a conspicuous station, such as the
topmost bough of a low tree; the sound of the human footstep,
however, causes it suddenly to drop from its elevation into the midst
of the thickest bush.
   There are various ways of procuring these birds for the cage.
The young ones taken towards the months of August and September
are to be preferred.      To accustom them to their confinement the
extremities of their wings are to be tied, and they are fed with the
paste used for nightingales, which is rendered more attractive if

  The nightingale inhabits Europe from Italy and Spain               the               in

countries of Europe, as "winter approaches, and retires into warmer
regions. It has been observed arriving            Lower Egypt during    in

the autumn, and in the winter ou the fresh plains of the Delta.     In
some parts of Asia Minor it is common, and never quits the woods
in which it has taken up its abode. It is said to be found in England
only as far north as Yorkshire, and not further west than the eastern
part of Devonshire. It appears in England about the beginning of
April, and leaves us at the end of summer.
   When the nightingale first appears in this country it remains for
some time in hedges and thickets, and the borders of uncultivated
ground, where an abundant supply of food can be procured ; but as
soon as the larger trees are covered with foliage it retires into the
woods, and hides in the thickest recesses.     The neighbourhood of
some purling stream is generally chosen by the bird, and the nest,
                • .;
 usually commenced about the beginning of May, is formed of coarse
weeds and dried oak-leaves on the outside, and with horsehair, little
roots, and cowhair on the inside.      It is placed near the ground, in
brushwood, at the    foot of  a hedge, or on the low branches of some
thick shrub, and is so slightly constructed, that an attempt to remove
will often cause it to crumble to pieces.
    The nightingale lays four or five eggs of a greenish-brown colour,
and the male supplies food to the female while she is sitting.      The
little ones have their bodies covered with feathers in about a fortnight
from the time of their hatching, and quit the nest before they are able
to fly, following theirparents as well as they can by jumping from
branch to branch.     When they are fully fledged the bira leaves them
to the care of her mate, and begins to construct a new nest for her
second brood.
    The nightingale is often taken for the cage, but great patienc".
attention, and care are necessary in its management.       If  taken at
his full growth he becomes, under proper precautions, reconciled to
his misfortune, and begins to sing in about a week afterwards.      The
bird may be either allowed to    fly about the room or be confined to
his apartment of the cage, which should never be less than two feet

iu length and eighteen inches broad, and in height fifteen inches in
the nuddle and thirteen at the sides.      The sides of the cage should
be made of osier, about a quarter of an inch thick; the bottom of the
same material, but covered by a drawer about an inch and a quarter
deep.     The feeding-trough should be introduced at the side, with
edges high enough to prevent the bird from spilling his food. In the
middle of the front of the cage, and extending from top to bottom,
is a cylindrical projection in the form of a belfry, in which is sus
pended a drinking-glass.      This projection should DC made of osiers
like the rest of the cage. The middle and lower slides are covered
with green cloth firmly sewed on, that the feet of the nightingale
may be preserved from injury.       Green is also the best colour in use
for" painting the osiers and lming the roof of the cage, but the paint
 must be thinly laid on, perfectly dry, and the cage free from the
 smell of it before the bird is put in.
    In a slate of nature the food of the nightingale consists of insects,
 whether in the caterpillar or the perfect state ; towards the end of
 the summer it also devours elderberries and currants. The bird is
 naturally voracious, and when in captivity it will accommodate itself
 to almost any kind of food, provided it be mixed with meat ; but it is
 necessary to be very careful in its diet, in order to preserve health.
 When the birds are first caught, meal-worms and fresh ants' eggs
 are the first things that should be offered to them.     If it be not pos
 sible to procure these, a mixture of hard eggs or bullock's heart,
 minced, and white bread, is given ; but this artificial food is very
 injurious, and often kills the bird. The best things for his food are
 meal-worms,      and to procure these in good supply, fill a large
 brown    stone  jar with wheat, bran, barley, or oatmeal, and put into it
 some pieces of rag, or paper, or old shoe leather.    Into this jar half a
 pint of meal-worms is to be thrown —these may be bought at any
 baker's or miller's — and, by leaving them quiet for three months,
 covered with a bit of woollen cloth, soaked in beer or water, they
 will change into beetles. These insects soon propagate by eggs, and
 increase the number of maggots so much that your jar will maintain
  a nightingale.
     Ants' eggs are also the food of the nightingale, and for getting
 them out of the anthill, a fine sunny day in summer is to be chosen,
  and, provided with a shovel, the youth is to begin by uncovering a nest
  of the large wood ants, till he arrives at the eggs. These are then
 taken away and placed in the sun, in the middle of a cloth whose
  corners are turned up over little branches well covered with leaves.
  The ants, in order to protect the eggs from the heat of the sun,
  quickly remove them under the shelter which is prepared for them.
  In this manner they are easily obtained, free from dirt and from the
  ants also.
     Ants' eggs are the best summer food, and two or three meal-worms
  prove a sufficient addition. A stock of dried ants' eggs may be kept,

and mixed  with roasted ox-heart and raw carrot, both finely grated.
A   paste thatwill keep for years is often made of the following
              " two
ingredients :        pounds of rolled heef, a pound of grey peas,
a pound of sweet almonds, an ounce and a half of saffron,
and twelve fresh eggs.      The meat is finely hashed, the peas and
almonds are pounded as finely as possible, and the whole nuxed with
the eggs and an infusion of the saffron ; round cakes are then formed
and baked in a slow oven, to the consistence of biscuits."
   Nightingales suffer much during the moulting, and require at that
time a more succulent diet, and sometimes a spider, which acts as a
purgative. They have a habit of bathing immediately they have sung,
and should therefore be daily supplied with fresh water.     Their other
ailments are such' as are common to the birds already described.
Their feet are verv apt to become clogged and injured, unless occa
sionally moistened in warm water, and freed from dirt and scales.
   The bird dislikes change of situation during its captivity, and has
been observed to cease singing, and to remain entirely silent upon the
removal of the cage from its accustomed spot.        Some birds prefer a
lonely  situation, others seem to like a more sombre and sheltered
place.   On first placing one of these birds in a cage, it is necessary
to cover two or three sides of it from the light, as the bird is so much
alarmed when exposed at all sides that it soon ends its life by A ashing
against the bars.

                              THE ROBIN.
   The redbreast, or robin redbreast,    is  well-known favourite song
                                              a
bird, and is beloved  by every   one, for his confidence in man.   He is
the bird of faith and hope.      He is   seen     winter on the tops of

houses and stables, on railings or fences, and not unfrequently hops
upon the threshold of the door, or flies into the window.
   The nest of the redbreast is   constructed of moss and dried leaves,
intermixed with hair,  and   lined with feathers.    It placed near the

always artfully concealed as much as possible.      The female lays from
four to eight eggs, ofa  dull white, with reddish spots.   During the
time of hatching, the male sits at no great distance, and cheers the

solitary hours   a  delightful song.  The brood should be taken when
they are about ten days old, when they may be placed in      basket or

box, for bringing up.   If they are taken too late from the nest, they
pine after their parent hen.    They should be kept clean, and nicely
warm during the night.
   The food of the redbreast may be sheep's-heart and egg, minced

get strong they may be put into a cage, and fed with some of the
woodlark's meat, the cage may be similar to that of the nightingale,
and it should contain a little bath, as the redbreasts are very fond of
washing themselves.     They may be taught many pleasing tricks, and
made so tame as to       fly
                         about the room without flymg away.
   Redbreasts are subject to the cramp and giddiness, which make
them often fall off the perch.   To prevent this, keep them on mode
rate food, very clean, and rather warm.         When they look sickly
and cease to sing, give them       little insect food, such as earwigs,

few hog-lice may be put into their cage, which they will greedily de

 found in the midst of cities.     It usually builds its nest in the holes of
 forest trees, or on high and dangerous precipices.        Its nest is chiefly
 composed of moss, lined with hair and feathers.         It is easily known
 by the peculiar quick shake of its tail when it alights.         It feeds, in
its natural state, on flies, spiders, ants' eggs, and soft fruits, berries,
&c.     It should be taken from the nest when the tail feathers begin to
grow, aud fed upon ants' eggs and bread soaked in water. The food
given to the nightingale wifl afterwards suit the redbreast. The young
ones, if early trained, may be taught to whistle airs, and to imitate the
song of other birds.

    This beautiful little bird is a native of Pennsylvania, where it makes
its appearance in March, and retires in the autumn.             It frequents
 bushy places, and when caught or taken from the nest, soon becomes
 familiar.   It is with us in the winter, and leaves us in the spring.

   In consequence of their docility, they have been taught to perform
a great many tricks, to come and go at command, to draw up water,
go up a ladaer, to fall down as if dead, &c.      Their food is rape and
canary  seed, and they arc fond of groundsel, plantain, and seeded chick-
weed; they may also be occasionally treated with a few grains of
hempseed.

                           TALKING BIRDS.
   FOREMOST among talking birds are the parrots — a most numero-is,
splendid, and highly characteristic family of birds, subdivided into
several groups, chiefly according to the form of the bill and tail ; as
the macaws, cockatoos, lories, paroquets, &c.     The greater part are
tree birds, belonging to the order of climbers.    The foot of the true
parrot is a graspmg rather than a walking one, and partakes more of
the nature of a nand than of a foot. They all unite great beauty with
great docility, and their facility in imitating the human voice is
greater than that of any other bird.
   Parrots inhabit principally the luxuriant tracts of the torrid zone,
but are not exclusively confined to   it, and are found in latitudes as
far as forty or fifty degrees north and south of the equator.       They
are almost exclusively vegetable feeders, and the kernels of fruit and
the buds and flowers of trees are their principal food.
   In the natural state, many of them are social birds, often issuing
from the trees  in  large flocks, and laying the cultivated fields under

severe contributions. Social birds are almost always capable of being
tamed, nearly in the same ratio as they are sociable ; and this is par
ticularly true with regard to parrots, who may be trained to do
almost anything ; and they show great attachment to those who feed
them and are kind to them.     They also suffer less from confinement
than most other birds, because their habit of climbing enables them to
take a great deal of exercise in a small space.     They are long-lived
birds, and some have been known to attam the age of eighty years.
Both cock and hen birds are equally gifted with the power of speech.
As regards beauty, however, the cocks claim the advantage.
                               MACAWS.
   The macaws are not among the best talkers. They have the bill
rather short, but of great poiyer.   The upper mandible is very much
hooked, with the    lip
                      descending   far over the under one.  In wild
                                                                 a
state, they nestle in the holes of trees.  They are particularly distin
guished  by having their cheeks destitute of feathers, and their tail
feathers long.   They ore all natives of the tropical regions of South
America, where they perch upon the sumnut of high trees.            The
scarlet macaw  is  one of the most splendid with regard to colour, as
well as size for, from the top of the bill to the extremity of the tail,

for the most part, of a beautiful scarlet ; the quill feathers externally
of a bright blue, and on their under side ot a faint red; the first
feathers next the quills are of a bright yellow, some of the feathers
being tipped with green.     Other parts of the body are of a fine blue,
and the longest feathers of the tail are entirely red.
                      BLUB   AND YELLOW     MACAW.
   The blue macaw, or the blue and yellow macaw, is less common
than the red macaw, but little inferior in point of size. The feathers
on the head of this bird are green, gradually becoming blue on the
neck ; the upper side of the neck, the back, and upper sides of the
wings and tail, are of an exceedingly fine olive colour. All the blue
feathers of the back, wings, and tail, are of a reddish yellow on their
under sides.   The forepart of the neck, the breast, belly, thighs, and
covert feathers under the tail, are of a fine yellow orange colour, as
are the covert feathers withinside. The legs and feet are nearly black.
                           THE GREY PARROT.
   This species is remarkable for its loquacity, docility, and distinct

about twelve inches. Its colour is an elegant ash grey, deeper on the
upper parts and more inclinable to white underneath ; the whole of a
sober colour, having a very elegant appearance.       The tail is of the
brightest crimson, the temples, or orbits of the eyes, bare and white,

the bill black, and the legs cinereous. It is said to live to nearly a
hundred years; and the surprising facility with which it can be
taught, not only to speak, but to repeat sentences,         is sometimes
scarcely credible.
                                               THE GREEN PARROT.
                                             This beautiful bird is rather
                                          larger than the common grey
                                          parrot. Its plumage is a fine
                                          green, the feathers edged with
                                          purplish brown, in the front ;
                                          all round the base of the bill
                                          is bright red, the cheeks deep
                                          blue, and the top of the head
                                          yellow ; the edge of the wings

                      PAROQUETS, OR PARRAKEETS.
   These belong to the parrot tribe, but are much smaller in size, and
have longer talus. There are nume
rous species, the most beautiful of
which is the song paroquet, which
is not more remarkable for its beauty
                                          \
of form and gracefulness of move
ment than for its docility and imita
tive powers.     It is about the size
of a common pigeon, and its general
colour an elegant bright green above,
paler or yellower beneath.    It has a
moderately -broad black band or stripe
round its neck, and a red collar, near
half an inch in width, but narrowing
as it passes forward, immediately be
neath the black one, almost reaching
the front of the neck.     The bill is
of a bright orange colour, inclining
towards red ; the tail feathers often
of a bluish tinge; the legs ash-
coloured.
                               COCKATOOS.
   Cockatoos are distinguished from true parrots, although they
belong to the parrot fanuly, by a crest or tuft of elegant feathers on
the head, which they can raise or depress at pleasure.    They are, in
general,  natives of Australia and the Indian Islands, inhabiting the

252                         EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
woods, and feeding upon seeds and fruits.    They make their nests in
decayed trees ; and, if taken at an early age, are easily tamed. There
are several varieties of the cockatoo, of which the Broad-crested or
Great "White Cockatoo is the most common. It is about the size of a
                 •   very
a fine scarlet underneath, and cover the whole head. The orbits of the
eyes are bare and of a deep ash colour ; the bill is of a bluish black,
and very strong. It is of a mild and docile disposition, but can
rarely be taught any other words than its own name.
   The Great Sulphur-crested Cockatoo is somewhat larger than the
above; its colour is white, slightly tinged with yellow on the sides of
the tail and about the wing coverts ; and it has a longish tail.    The
Small Sulphur-crested Cockatoo is much smaller, but is much like
the above ; its crest is sulphur colour, and it has in addition a large
yellow spot beneath each eye : thn bill black, aud the legs deep lead
colour. It is a native of the Molucca Islands.
                      MANAGEMENT      OP PARROTS,       ETC.
  All   the varieties of parrots require great care and attention. Their
cages   should be commodious, strong, and comfortable.      The perches
                      should be thick in the middle, and conveniently
                      placed for the bird to exercise himself upon with
                      out injuring his feathers.    Beside the perches,
                      there should be hung, quite clear of them, at the
                      top of the cage, a ring or hook, freely movable,
                     upon which the bird can take exercise, and roost
                     at night; and the grasping part of this should
                     be of the requisite thickness for the size of his
                     hands or claws.     The above is a new form of
                     parrot-cage, which might be adopted with great
                     comfort to such birds.     It is bell-shaped, and it
                     gives the  bird much  more   room for swinging and
                     climbing, and exercise, than those in common use.
                     It ought to be at least five feet in height, and three
across the widest part.     Its bottom should be wired, and underneath
a shifting or sliding tray should be set, to receive the dirt, &c. There
should be a food-box at the side, set quite clear of the perches ; and
a wire or brass ring, freely swinging, in the upper part of the cage, of
such a size that the bird can easdy get into      it,
                                                   and yet so clear of the
sides of the cage that he can move round     it without inconvenience.
                               FEEDING,   ETC.
   The best food for parrots    different kinds of seeds, nuts, grain,
                                 is
Indian corn well boiled, and biscuits soaked in milk; which last
ought never to be given the bird quite cold.   It requires some little

                     NATIVE TALKING        BIRDS.                253
attention not to over-feed or under-feed the bird : if over-fed, they
soon grow diseased ; and if under-fed, they pine and languish. The
proper quantity to he given to each particular bird can be known
only by experience.   Their food should never be given them in any
kind of metal boxes or pans ; these should be made of glass or
earthenware.    They should, as well as every other part of the cage,
be kept scrupulously clean ; and the birds should on no occasion oe
allowed the smallest quantity of animal food.     A few chilis occa
sionally given them in cold weather will be of service, and their food
should be occasionally varied. Clean gravel should always be kept at
the bottom of the cage, and should be removed daily.     The diseases
to which such birds are liable are those common to other birds, and
may be treated in the same manner ; a detailed account of which will
be found in the chapter on Singing Birds.
                  NATIVE TALKING BIRDS.
                           THE STABLING.
   TEE starling is a native of almost every climate; and as it is
a familiar bird and easily trained in a state of captivity, its habits
have been more frequently observed than those of most other birds.
They make an artless nest in hollow trees, the eaves of old houses,
towers and cliffs overhanging the sea. In the autumn they        fly
                                                                 in
vast flocks, and may be known at  a   great distance by their whirling
mode of flight, and they may be often seen in the company of ref
wings, fieldfares, jackdaws, &c.
  The principal food of the starling in wild state consists of worms,
                                       a
snails, and caterpillars
                      ;   they also eat various kinds of grain, seeds,
and berries, and are said to be particularly fond of cherries.   They

254                      EVERY BOY    S BOOK.
are very docile in confinement, and may easily be taught to repeat
short phrases, or to whistle tunes with great exactness.
   They should be taken from the nest when about ten days old, put
into a basket with some clean straw, and kept warm. Whatever you
wish them to learn you should whistle or talk to them at every
feeding time.  The notion of its being necessary to cut their tongues
to enable them to talk, is a fallacy.
   In feeding them the same food used for the blackbird will suit
them; they should be given five or six pieces at a time about the
size of a horse-bean.    When they can feed themselves, the food of
the woodlark and a little flesh meat will from time to time be neces
sary.  To keep them in health they should occasionally be given
a spider or a meal-worm, and have a little saffron put into the
water.
                              THE RATEN.
   The raven can hardly be termed a cage bird, but yet it is a very
amusing creature, and worth the trouble of keeping if there is suf
ficient room for it. The raven is easily satisfied, and will eat anything
that a man will, besides many things that a man will not. It is cruel
to keep a raven in a cage, or even in a small mclosure, as the wild
spirit of the bird prefers freedom of action. A careful watch should
be kept upon   it,  as ravens are much given to mischief and theft,

                        NATIVE TALKING       BIRDS.                 2.55
committing each crime apparently for its own sake, as it tears to
pieces objects that have done no harm, and steals objects that can do
it no good.
                                 THE JAY.
   The jay is one of the most handsome of our British birds, and is
found not only here but in most of the temperate parts of Europe,
frequenting woods, and feeding on acorns, beech, maize, berries, and
fruits of various kinds. In confinement, however, he loses something
of the beauty of his plumage, and becomes of a duller tinge.
   Like his kindred the jackdaw and magpie, the jay can be taught
a variety of words and sounds, particularly those of a harsh and
grating character ; as that of a saw, or the taking of a cork out of
a bottle, the squalling of cats, &c.
   The jay builds in woods, and makes an artless nest, composed of
sticks, fibres, and slender twigs, and lays five or six eggs of an ash-
grey colour mixed with green, and faintly spotted with brown. In
a state of nature he is bold and impudent, and when domesticated B
fond of stealing and secreting small articles.
   The jay will eat all kinds of insects, worms, fruit, and grain ; little
comes amiss to him. When the young birds are first taken, they may
be reared upon cheese, biscuit, meat, and small worms.        They may
be easily taught  to speak,  by repeating constantly  the same words or
phrases to them.     The  best kind  of diet for him in a cage is wheat,
with occasionally a few acorns ; and when he is kindly treated he
soon becomes not only familiar, but playful.

  256                     EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
                             THE JACKDAW.
    The jackdaw, or daw, is another talking bird. They may be found
 frequenting church steeples, old towers, and ruins, where they con
 gregate in flocks, and where they build their nests and lay their eggs,
which are usually five or six m number.        The jackdaw is a pert,
active, and loquacious bird, is easily tamed, and may be taught, like
the magpie and jay, to imitate human sounds.           It has also the
mischievous faculty of stealing, and hiding money, spoons, and other
metallic or glittering substances.
    The jackdaw remains in this country during the whole of the year;
but in France, Germany, and other parts of the continent it is
migratory. His food in a wild state is pretty various, as he docs not
stand nice upon fish, flesh, fowl, grain, pulse, insects, and worms.
He is also very fond of wild garlic, of which he often smells as strong
as a Spaniard.
    The jackdaw is easily tamed, and is then of great use in a garden.
He often amuses himself in flying to and fro for a considerable time
together. He will be content m his captivity with a little bread and
meat ; and by his odd antics, and imitations of various sounds, affords
a great deal of amusement to those who will be kind to him.       He is
a great observer of sounds ; and one which we once had, always knew
the voice of the "butcher," who called out his profession at the
gate somewhat loudly.      Shakespeare calls him a prating coxcomb,
but he does not talk so well as the jay or magpie.

                               THE MAGPIE.
   The magpie is a very handsome bird, yet its propensity for mischief,
its noise, aud its restless and quarrelsome disposition, render it every
where an unwelcome intruder. It feeds both on animal and vegetable
 substances, and, when satisfied with its present meal, it will hide the
remainder of its provision for a future occasion.
   The magpie builds its nest of sticks and clay with great sagacity,
 defending it on all sides with sharp thorny twigs, leaving only a hole
for entrance, and furnishing the inside with a lining of fibrous roots
and other soft materials.     The female lays seven or eight eggs, of
a pale green colour spotted with black.
   The magpie is not verv particular in its food, for it often plunders
the nests of other birds both of eggs and younglings; but it has good
qualities also, for it frees our pastures of an incredible number of
grubs and slugs, and it often performs a friendly office to sheep and
oxen by picking the vermin from their bodies.
   The magpie may easily be tamed, and taught to pronounce words
and sentences by constantly repeating them to it ; but its tones are
too shrill and sharp to be perfect representations of the human
voice.
   When young, the best food for him is bread, cheese, and milk, or
curds ; as he grows up, he may be fed with small pieces of meat or
bread, and anv other matter you choose to give him, as he will only
eat what is good for him, and knows what that is.

     THE REARING AND MANAGEMENT OF PIGEONS.
                        HISTORICAL   MEMORANDA.
    THERE is nothing more delightful to the sensitive mind than the
sight of a pair of turtledoves.    They are emblematical of enduring
afl'ection and constant attachment, and afford lessons of love to
brothers and sisters ; for this reason, the rearing and management
of them is a delightful task to young persons, and the lessons they
may learn in these labours are many and important.
    Pigeons have been known from the earliest ages. The dove was
consecrated to the goddess of beauty, and a pair of turtledoves, or
two young pigeons, were a mother's first offering among the chosen
people of God.    The use of the carrier pigeon as a messenger, was
celeVated by the poets of Arabia, Greece, and Rome. JElian
mentions that when Taurostheus was victor at the Olympic games,
a carrier pigeon bore the intelligence to his father with great rapidity ;
and Pliny relates that at the siege of Modena a correspondence was
carried on by means of these birds between Decimus Brutus and
Hirtius. In the time of the crusades, instances are given where the
birds sent out by the besieged were captured by the besieging parties,
and let loose again with a message calculated to deceive those to
whom they were sent.      In such instances, the pigeons were brought

down by hawks kept for that purpose by the parties investing the
town.
    The practice of rearing other kinds of pigeons beside the carrier,
for fancy or amusement, has been for a long time prevalent in England.
In ancient times, the " dove-cote " was the natural appendix to the
family hall or farmer's homestead ; and at the present tune we may be
hold that dwelling of the picturesque, the dove-cote, peering above the
trees in unsophisticated districts; while in London, — m the very darkest
scenes of vice, misery, and degradation, — the pigeon-trap and pigeon-
house caps the house-top, and hundreds of the feathery brood wing
their way (not in the mid air, but in mid smoke!) among the millions
of chimneys which bristle up over so many square nules of space :
hence, we do not wonder that
                                    "                 " should be an in
                                      pigeon-fancying
teresting study, seeing that it is so universal.
    Pigeons live together in pairs; and when a cock and hen once form
 an attachment the union generally lasts, and the instances of faithful
 and enduring attachment between these birds are very many.           The
 pigeon   in a wild  state  breeds  only  once  a year, but the   domestic
 pigeons of the dove-cote will breed every month or six weeks, and
 when the weather is severe, and the fields are covered with snow, they
 must be fed. In fine weather, however, they will provide for them
 selves, and will amply repay the keeper for his trouble.
    Whatever number of broods a pair of pigeons may bring up in a
 year, the hen never lays but two eggs before she sits.      She then sits
 eighteen days, or twentv-one days, from the laying of the first egg.
 Both the cock and the nen assist in the hatchmg : the hen usually
 sits from the afternoon till the following morning; the cock then
 takes her place, and sits while she goes out to feed and exercise herself,
 and generally keeps on the nest the greater part of the day.         The
 young ones are usually hatched during the day-time.
    When hatched, the young only require warmth for the first three
 days, a task which the female takes entirely upon herself; and she
 never leaves them, except for a few minutes at a time, to take a little
 food. After this, they are fed for about ten days with a milky secre
 tion prepared from the glandular coat of the crop, and regurgitated,
 and afterwards with what the old ones have picked up in the fields
 and kept treasured in their crops.
    This way of supplying the young with food from the crop, in birds
 of the pigeon kind, diners from all others. They have the largest
 crops for their size of any birds, and they have the power of distend
 ing the crop by use in such a manner, that, in one species in par
 ticular (see Cropper), the bird's breast appears larger than its body.
 The numerous glands, assisted by the air and the heat of the bird's
 body, are the necessary apparatus for secreting the milky fluid before
 mentioned, but as the food is macerated, that also swells and becomes
 considerably diluted.
    The dove-cote pigeons, like the rest of their genus, retire to their

 roost at a very early hour, but they leave it unusually late in the
 morning; and though they will perch on trees iu the day-time,
 nothing will induce them to rest there at night. They are greatly
 attached to the cot of their choice ; so much so, that they are scarcely
 to be driven from it but by fire-arms.
                             THE DOVE-COTE.
    This may be made of any size, and of various shapes. In ancient
 manorial houses, it used to be sometimes of almost gigantic dimen
                                     sions.   The old dove-cote of Lady
                „                    Place, Harley, in Berkshire, had
                                     twenty-four sides and six tiers of
                                     chambers, which gave room to 144
                                     pigeons.    It was raised on the top
                                     of a brick tower, and carried up
                                     by woodwork and masonry to the
                                     height of forty feet above the
                                     ground, and was a delightful or
                                     nament to the estate. Many other
                                     ancient halls had similar dove
                                     cotes, the right of erecting which
                                     belonged almost exclusively to the
                                     lord of the manor.
                                        In erecting a dove-cote, care

                                     quiet secure spot ; and a small one is
                                     very often formed from a wine-cask
which has holes cut in its sides, and a small platform being made of
woodwork before each in front, forms a resting-place for the birds to
alight upon.    The interior is apportioned into chambers by the car
                 penter, or any boy of common carpentering ingenuity
                 may readily do this.     The cask is then elevated on a
                 stout thick scaffolding pole, or what is better, the
                 trunk of a straight tree, and, being made perfectly
                 secure, is very eligible for the live stock to be therein
                 congregated.     In arranging the internal chambers
                 for the birds, these should be large enough for the
                 birds to turn round in with ease ; and if two holes
                 can be allowed for each compartment, for the egress
                 and ingress of the birds, it will be of great advan
                 tage and comfort to them.      The cote should be fixed
                 in a warmish spot, out of the
                                                     " blow " of cold east
                 and north-east or north-west winds, and the pole
                 upon which it is elevated should have a circular plate-
ring half-way up, to keep the cats and vermin from ascending.
The top of the cask ma.v be thatched or boarded, and should come
well over the holes and sides of the cote.

                REARING AND MANAGEMENT       OP PIGEONS.            261
   Should the young fancier not be ingenious enough to construct
such a dove-cote, which is one of the best we can reco-nmend, he may
content himself with one after the fol
lowing fashion, which, with its com
partments, may be fixed up against the
south or south-west side of a stable,
barn, or out-house.     Here the birds
generally do very well, but the outside
should be well secured and painted
several times over with black pamt, and
the foot, or alighting places, slightly
slanted, so that the water or rain may
not lodge in them, but run off to the ground outside.    This inclina
tion of the foothoards must, however, be very slight, or it will be
disagreeable to the birds.    The whole must be approached by a
ladder, which ought not to be permanently attached to the cote, or
it will be a means for the depredation of cats and vermin.
   It sometimes happens that a spare loft or room presents itself to
the youngpigeon-iancier, which may be made use of for a pigeon-
house.    When this is the case, it
can easily be filled up with lon|
pigeon-boxes, which mavbe arrange,
round the sides, white holes are
made on the outside of the building
for the pigeons to fly in and out
at. Perches may also be placed across the roof of the building, upon
which the birds may rest to preen themselves, as at A, A, A. The
boxes may be arranged at the
gable end and at the sides of
the building, at the height of
about eight teet from the ground,
h, b, b, and a short ladder should
 be kept/ in the building, for the
purpose of getting at them.   The
cells should be at least a foot
square.    In this arrangement,
water may be constantly Kept in
a large clean pan, which should
have some large stones put in   to prevent the birds from splashing
                                 it,
it   about.
     As to the compartments,   or nests, every one must be furnished
with   apan, box, or straw basket, of  a size adapted to the pigeons for
which they are intended;   a small tile or flat piece of wood should be
placed    front of the pan or basket, to assist the birds in getting out
           in
of their nests, and the pan should have     in   it  little clean straw or
                                                      a
hay  cut short within  it. Sand or  gravel  should  be  sprinkled over the
shelves and about the spot, as the small stones with which    it  abounds

  262                       EVERY BOY'S HOOK.
  are useful to the birds in helping them to digest their food.        Every
  thing about the birds should be Kept very clean, and once a year tic
  whole apparatus, of whatever kind it may be, should undergo n
  thorough purification, and the nest-pans or boxes should be well
  cleaned for every succeeding hatching.        Care should also be taken to
 prevent starlings and other birds from visiting their nests, as they
  will suck or destroy their eggs.
                                PIGEON-TRAPS.
     Pigeon-traps are necessary when persons are particularly solicitous
 regarding the admixture, and consequently the sporting of particular
                              breeds.     Stray birds will very frequentlv
                              visit pigeon houses, and by associating witli
                              the birds do them much injury.        To secure
                              such intruders, traps are necessary. One of
                              the simplest is merely a square box of lath,
                              the top part of which hangs nicely sus
 pended by a hinge at its side, from which is carried a projection called
 the lever, upon the end of which is fastened a piece of lead.            The
 bird alights on the dark spot, which part of the trap falls, and conveys
 him into the interior of the cage in which the bait is placed. The balance
 weight of the lever immediately shuts the cage, and the bird is secured.
     There is another contrivance of great use, which is employed for
 letting in those birds who may not happen to come home oefore the
                                      aeries are closed for the night.    The
                                      object of this door, which ought
                                      to be called the "late door," is to
                                      let the out birds in without letting
                                      the in birds out. It is made by
                                      placing before a square aperture cut
                                      m the pigeon-house a couple of wires
                                      about three inches apart from each
                                      other (as seen in the drawing) upon
                                       a piece of wood, having a swivel
                                      hinge (A) above, and letting their
lower ends come over the lower ledge or sill (B) on the inside of the
dove-house. By this arrangement, when the late bird presses against the
bars and tries to get in, the whole opens inward, and he easily enters;
but if a bird from within tries to get out, the wires press against the
side of the sill at the bottom, and effectually prevent his egress.
              I      t       j _             Within the pigeon-house should
                                           be placed also two or three boxes
                                           for the grain, pulse, and beans
                                           to feed the birds upon.      These
                                           should be made so that the birds
                                           may be able to pick the seeds
from them without scattering them about.             This is easily prevented

of which are about half-an-inch square.    The upper part (A) is a

 their food at one particular call, and the best      that of

great   advantage.
   Pigeons are, as we have said, great devourers of food, and will eat
any find of grain, such as wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, vetches,
tares, buckwheat,     hempseed.        Small b'eans, called pigeon's beans,
are the best general food for all pigeons, but this may oe varied occa

                             DISEASES         OF PIGEONS.
   The diseases of pigeons are many.    The principal, however, are the
meagrims,   the wet and dry roup, and the canker.     The meagrims                      is
a kind of nervous madness, in which the bird seems to have lost all
control over itself, and flutters about wildly, with its head turned
towards its back.    The wet roup      attended with
                                              is         discharge from

by rubbing the part affected with burnt alum and honey.
                                     VERMIN.
   Pigeons are often sadly annoyed by vermin, such as tick, lice, &c. ;
when once they get ahead, the whole brood will soon perish.         The
birds must frequently be looked at, and everything of the kind taken
from them.      If
                 they should be increasing, the best way is to fumigate
their feathers by puffing tobacco-smoke into them.     To prevent ver
min, the most scrupulous attention should be paid to cleanliness, both
in the birds themselves, and in every part of their houses, nests, and
places of resort.
                                     MATING.
    Sometimes there is a Lttle trouble attending the mating of pigeons,
and it is of as great importance that they should be comfortably
matched, as it is that men and women should be properly married.
To produce this desirable state of things, the coops should have only
a thm lattice-work partition between them, so that the birds may make
"
   acquaintance" with each other; they should also be allowed to feed
out of the same vessel, and in a short time the young observer will
find the birds selecting for themselves the bird of their choice, when
they may be placed together in one pen.          If
                                             they agree, of course they
will be continued together, but if they should disagree and fight, a
deed of separation must be drawn up.       When the " loving couple
                                                                      "
are properlv mated, they may be left at liberty to arrange their own
domestic affairs, and     to'
                           build their nests, which they will do very
readily.
                                    MOULTING.
   Sometimes the birds will suffer       agood deal in moulting, and when
they  do   not  throw   off  their feathers    freely at the proper time of
moulting,  it       sign that the birds are not in vigorous health.      Such
                is

their water.     Their tail feathers may be also gently removed, and any
other little office performed for them which the necessity of their case
seems to call for.
                           PURCHASING OP STOCK.
   The best times for stocking the pigeon-house are the months of
May and August, young pigeons being then plentiful. Spring pigeons
that have been kept up durmg the winter are much stronger, and soon
in condition to yield profit to the buyer. The number necessary to
  a
stock pigeon-house must be left to the convenience or ability of the
      a
young fancier but he must bear in mind that should his neighbour
                ;

 to his own judgment, but depend in the selection upon some faithful
 and experienced    person.
                        LAWS RELATING TO PIGEONS.
    The act 6 & 7 Geo. IV. c. 27 enacts, "that if any person shall un
 lawfully or wilfully kill, wound, or take any house-dove or pigeon,
 under circumstances not amounting to larceny, (in breaking into the
 pigeon-house,) he shall, upon conviction, forfeit over the value of the
 bird, forty shillings."    But the owner of land may kill pigeons dama
 ging his corn or garden fruits ; so while you keep pigeons for your
 own amusement, take care that they do not annoy others ; and keep
 in remembrance the fable of the boys pelting the frogs.
                     OF PIGEONS IN GENERAL.
                               WILD PIGEONS.
    THE pigeon family is one of the most numerous, the most widely
distributed, and in some respects the most interesting family of the
feathered race. They may be considered as the greatest consumers
of the fruits of the earth. They are all exclusively, or nearly so,
vegetable feeders ; all of them feed voraciously, and many of them
congregate in flocks, which are perfectly innumerable.       But notwith
standing their numbers, their general      distribution, and their beauty,
only one, out of a great number of species, has been brought into
subjection by man; — this one is the common pigeon, or house pigeon,
known as the rock pigeon when in the wild state, and in that state
abundant in several parts of the cliffy and caverned shores of the
British Islands. This one has broken down into a great number of

varieties, which are domesticated for fancy purposes, and of which it
will  be for us to give some interesting particulars.
   The principal of these varieties are the stockdove, the ringdove,
the turtledove, the carrier, the tumbler, the horseman, the runt, the
trumpeter, the iacobine, the turbit, the owl, the nun, the magpie, the
spot, the fantail, the shaker, the barb.
                      THE   STOCKDOVE,1       OR WOODPIGEON.
   This is commonly, but erroneously,             considered     as the   original wild
pigeon; and is called the stockdove in consequence of its being sup
posed to be the original stock from which the other varieties have
been taken. It is also called the woodpigeon, but, as we have observed,
the original stockpigeon is the wild pigeon of the rocks, which is to
be found upon the rocky shores of the west of Scotland, and the low
shores of the Western Isles.            The woodpigeou then, for that is the
proper appellation of the bird we are about to describe, is about four
teen inches in length, and twenty-six in the stretch of its wings.                    In
Britain it is rare, and almost confined to the midland counties.                   It is
found in secluded woods, and its broods are two in the year.                       It is
by no means easy of domestication, and in many of its characteristics
it seems to possess an intermediate place between the ring pigeon and
the rock pigeon.        It occasionally builds in the hollow of old trees ; its

voice is harsh, and has none of the soft expression of the rmgdove,
and consequently there is little encouragement to those who would
bring it into domestication.
                             THE RINGDOVE.
   This is one of the most abundant species in the groves and thickets
of the cultivated parts of Britain, and is one of the most interesting
birds to adorn groves ; beautiful in its plumage, and soft and melodious
in the tones of its cooing.   Every school-boy is acquainted with the
note of the cushat, and, if we except the cuckoo, there are few birds
that have so many imitators. Its note is very peculiar, and seems to
express the following words : "Take two cows, Taffy."
   The nest of the ringdove is to be found in short, bushy trees, in
the middle of shrubs, and consists of a few twigs, loosely put together,
and so open, that if it can be got sight of, the eggs may be seen by
an observer below.     They are often observed by toys, and, as the
kind of trees which the ringdove prefers can be easily climbed, they
are taken without mercy, and thus more of its eggs are plundered
than those of any other bird.     The eggs we always two in number,
rather lengthened in form, and both ends equally large.       When the
young birds break the shell, they are in a very callow nnmature state,
of a dark lead-colour, covered with a thin sprinkling of yellow down,
and quite blind.    While they are in this condition, the parent birds
do not feed them with food m its natural state, such as they them

 268                       EVERY   BOY'S  BOOK.
selves subsist    on; they give them a sort of milky pap from the
crop, which is the food of the parent birds reduced to chyme, so
 that "pigeon's milk" is no misnomer after all on the first of April.
    The ringdove is of a graceful form, and measures about a foot and
a half on the stretch of its wings ; the colours are very fine, and re
markably uniform in different birds.     The head and neck are of a very
peculiar grey colour, which reflects green in some lights and greenish
black in oth'ers ; and it is marked with bars of darker colour on the
head and neck.      The ring, from which the bird gets its name, is not
a complete collar surrounding the neck, but consists of two patches,
one ou each side, approaching each other in frout, and nearly meeting
behind.    The under parts are purple or red ; the upper parts are
grey ;   the  tail feathers are margined with bluish-grey ; the bill is
orange, but the cone, or naked skm, is covered with a mealy powder,
of a white colour ; the feet are pale red, and the claws black.
    The beauty of this bird has led to many attempts at its domestica
tion, but without effect. The eggs have been procured from the nest
and placed under tame pigeons, T>ut they have invariably "flown" as
soon as they were able; the young fancier has, therefore, only to
expect that he may be able to keep them in confinement in a cage.
He may feed them with peas, of which they will consume a prodigious
quantity ; he may also get them to breed, but from birds so undo-
mesticated he can expect but little amusement.
                        THE  COMMON   TURTLEDOVE.
    Considered as a British bird, the common turtledove is the smallest
of all our pigeons ; the male bird is but twelve inches long, and the
female is smaller.     The upper parts are brown ;. the top of the head
and the hind neck ashen-grey ; eacn side of the necK garnished with
a flat patch of small black feathers, with white tops; ends of the wings
brown, bordered with russet; quills blackish, with whitish borders;
tail feathers brown, with white tops ; throat, neck, and breast, tinged
with crimson red; rest of the under part white.           The malenas

generally a white patch on the forehead.       The naked skin round the
eye is red ; the bill bluish, and the feet  red.
   As a British bird, the turtledove comes late in the spring, that  is,
about May.      They occur in pairs, and soon betake themselves to the
thickest groves, m the closest shades of which they construct their
nests.   During this time, their plaintive and tender cooing may be
often heard in the neighbourhood of these thickets, where they nestle
but are seldom seen.         They are mild and gentle creatures, and
although,  like  the woodpigeon,  they cannot be domesticated, they very
soon become tame      in confinement.  If the pair caught, their attach

ment for each other continues       ; they caress the hand which feeds
them, and their whole manners are beautifully simple, and their atti
tudes remarkably graceful.
   To keep them they should have nice warm cage, with little rooms
                                        a
for them to retire to at night and thev may be fed with any kind of
                                ;
grain or pulse, as peas, beans, &c.        They are also fond of bread,
which should not be given them too new; but they require the greatest
attention, forif   one dies the other rarely survives its loss.
                        i'ANCY PIGEONS.
   THE common pigeon        well known as to the shape, but the colour
                           is
varies so much that   it  eludes the rules of classification.   Common
pigeons are, however,    generally blue or ash-coloured,   with red legs

270                      EVERY    BOY'S BOOK.
and white beaks.      They prefer a gregarious life, and abide, often to
the number of five or six thousand, in a cot purposely built for them
in the neighbourhood of a farm-yard, with proper holes to nestle in.
They require very little care, and are exceedingly prolific, breeding
seven or eight times a-year. The female pigeon lays two eggs, which
produce generally a male and a female.       It is pleasing to see how
eager the male is to sit upon the eggs, in order that his mate may
rest and feed herself.     The young ones, when hatched, require no
food for the first three days, warmth being their only nourishment ;
thej are then fed from the crop of their mother, who has the power
of forcing up the half-digested peas which she has swallowed, to give
them to her young.       The young ones, open-mouthed, receive this
tribute of affection, and are thus fed three times a-day. The varieties
of the domestic pigeon which follow have been produced by various
crossings, &c. with different and parent stocks, some of which we
shall now describe.
                            THE TUMBLEB.
   This pigeon derives its name from its habit of turning over, or
"
  tumblmg" in the air. They rise to an immense height m the air,
and generally, when commencing their upward flight, make a series
of summersaults in the air, like the clown in a pantomime.   When in
the blue empyrean, they will remain     on the wing for several hours
in succession ; and, when soaring in the air on a fine summer's day,
the flight, tumblings, and antics of a flock of these pigeons is very
amusing.
   The finest variety of this pigeon is the Bald-paled Tumbler, from its
having a snow-white head and pearl-like eyes ; another is called the
Ermine Tumbler, or almond tumbler, and is a very elegant and beau
tiful bird, and is distinguished by the colours and marking of its
feathers, in which it varies very considerably.    A third variety is the
Black-molt led Tumbler, which is generally all black, except about
a dozen white feathers on the shoulders.        A fourth is the Yellow-
nottled Tumbler, which has a body mottled with white on a yellow
ground, and with a yellow flight and tail ; and many other individual
varieties are constantly produced.
   Tumblers should be kept in a loft by themselves, and never suffered
to mix with any other sort of pigeon, as they soon lose their peculiar
habits of soaring and tumbling; they should be turned loose only
once a-day to take wing, and never on a very bright or clear day. A
grey, clear morning is the best time for them to exercise.          They
should never be let out on a foggy or misty morning, for they may in
such weather be irrecoverably lost ; nor should they be out m wmdy
weather.    When their hours of liberty are expired, they may be
enticed home by a little hempseed scattered round their usual places
of feeding.    A hen tumbler should never be let out to         flywhen
with egg.

                                  THB CARRIEB..1
    The carrier pigeon has been known from a very remote period, and
has been employed as a messenger from the earliest ages.                    It is a
larger bird than the common pigeon, measures about fifteen inches in
length, and weighs about a pound and a quarter.                  The neck is long,
and the pectoral muscles very large, denoting a power of vigorous
and long-continued flight. An appendage of naked skin hangs across
its bill, and continues down on each side of the lower mandible.
According to its size and shape, the amateurs of carrier pigeons
estimate the value of the bird. T'hey consider those pigeons me best
that have the appendage rising high on the head, and of considerable
width across the bill, and that are also distinguished by a wide circlet
round the eyes, destitute of feathers.               The sellers of these birds
sometimes employ artificial means to produce these appearances, and
torture the pigeons by introducing a small piece of cork, fastened by
a bit of wire beneath the skin, to enlarge its apparent width.
    The instinct which renders this bird so valuable is founded upon
 ,
    very high degree of the love of home which it possesses.                   The
mode of training them in Turkey, and which is the best mode to be
followed generally, is this. The person who has the charge of rearing
and trainmg them watches for the arrival of the young pigeons at the
 full strength of wing, and then takes them in a covered basket to a
 distance of abont half a mile from their home.                  They are then set
 at liberty, and if any of them fail in returning home from this short
 distance, they are considered stupid, and are rejected as valueless.
 Those that return home are then taken to greater distances, pro
 gressively increased from two to a thousand miles, and they will then
  return with certainty from the furthest part of the kingdom. In
 England, it is usual to keep these birds in a dark place for about six
  hours before they are used ; they are then sparingly fed, bnt have as
 much water given them as they will drink. The paper upon which
 the message is written should be carefully tied round the upper part
  of the bird's leg, but so as in no way to impede its flight. When
 loosed, the bird usually soars high in the air, and, after flying round
 in circles for a few times in succession, suddenly darts in the direction
  of " home."
     The nsnal speed of the carrier is about thirty miles an hour, or
  one thousand a-day.       They have been known, in wager matches, to
 have   flown  from  Antwerp to London in less than six hours, and nice
 versa : and from London to Paris in about the same time.
     There are two inferior varieties of the carrierpigeon that have
 been reared to a considerable extent in England. They are known by
  the names of the
                       "             " and " Horseman." One of the former
                         Dragoon
 flew from Bury St. Edmund's, to the Bull Tun, Bishopsgate-street, in
 two hours and a half, being a distance of seventy-two nules.

                                  THE POUTER.
    The pouter is a fine handsome bird, distinguished by the peculiar
 size and form of the crop, which the bird is able to distend by filling
 with air.   He measures, generally, about eighteen inches in length,
and ought to have a fine hollow back, sloping gradually to the shoul
 ders, to be prized.     When the back is straight, or bows out, the bird
is then said to be hog-backed.        It ought also to carry its wings close
to its body ; and its legs, from the toenail to the upper joint of the
thigh, should be at least seven inches in length, and well covered
with downy feathers.
    Pouters arc difficult birds to rear, and the bringing them up is
attended with considerable expense.          Being very voracious, like the
whole of the pigeon tribe, it requires great care to prevent their over
feeding.    Every single bird should be kept in a separate coop, lofty
and capacious ; and when the young ones are hatched, as the old
birds are apt to pay but little attention to them, they should be care
fully watched.      Some fanciers never suffer pouters to rear their own
young, but put their eggs under a hen dragoon.
    The pouters most esteemed arc the black-pied, the blue-pied, the
yellow-pied, and the red-pied; but the colours are not of so much
nnportance as the general shape of the bird, the hollow of its back,
the roundness of the crop, the length and feathers of its legs, the
mode of carrying its wings, &c.           The front of the crop, however,
should be wh'itc, surrounded with a shining green; and the head,
neck, back, and tail should be uniform in tint.            Sometimes a pouter
is unable to distend his rrop handsomely ; it is then called loose-
winded, and considered a defective bird.
                                   THE RUNT.
    This is a short, full-breasted bird, with tail turned up. It has rather
a  long thick neck in proportion to its other parts ; the beak is short,
               (1) See cut on p. 269. The Pouter it the centie bird.

and   it has a small wattle over the nostril.The plumage is generally
grizzled, and  ermine round the neck; but those most esteemed by
fanciers are black, white, red, or mottled.    The Leghorn variety is
the most valued, and is a hardy bird ; it breeds tolerably well, but is
a bad nurse ; hence their eggs are often shifted from the nest, and
pnt under the hen horseman to hatch and bring up.
   The Freisland Runt is larger than the common runt, and it has a
very odd appearance from its feathers sticking out the wrong way.
The Spanish Runt is a short, thick -legged, ugly-made bird, with 'a
very long body.    The Feather-footed or Smyrna Runt has feathers
growing   from  the outside of its feet.   The Roman Runt is large,
thick, and unwieldy ; and, upon the whole, none of these birds are
pleasing to the eye, either as regards shape or colour.
                              THE TRUMPETER
Is  so called from the sound it utters after playing, which is thought to
resemble the sound of a trumpet; which strange propensity m the
birds is increased by feeding them with hempseed and other stimu
lating food.     It is somethmg like the Leghorn runt in size and
appearance.    It has a tuft of feathers sprouting from the root of the
beak, and the larger this      is,
                                the greater to the fancier     the value of
                                                                    is
the bird. The legs and feet are feathered, and                is,

                                                                         it
have  a hood at  the back  of its neck.
                         THE PANTAIL,        OB SHAKER.1
   The fantail   is
                 a  beautiful variety of the pigeon tribe.   It has its
name from its spreading its tail in the shape of   fan, and bending
                                                           a                      it
over the back, so tlxat the tips of the feathers brush the hack part
of its head. There are two sub-varieties of this bird —the Broad-
tailed and the Narrow-tailed Shaker. The former ought to have tail            a

 of at least twenty-four feathers, a swan-like neck, a full breast, and
 a quivering motion of its tail, which gives it the second name of
 shaker.    The plumage of this bird is generally white, although some
are red, blue, or cream-colour.        The narrow-tailed shaker is pro
duced by pairing the broad-tailed shaker with the stock dove.        The
tail of this bird is not so wide    or spreading, as its name imports ;
while it is also a shorter, thicker, and less graceful bird. It is
usually white, but sometimes it is spotted or ermined, and occa
sionally displays a rich variety of colours.
                        THE JACOBIN,      OB JACK.
   This kind has a range of inverted feathers on the back part of the
head, which turns towards the neck, like the cap or cowl of a monk ;
thus having a fanciful resemblance to the religious of those orders
who wear cowls.
                                THE   NUN.1
   The head of this bird is almost covered with a veil of feathers,
whence    its name. Its body is chiefly white ; its head, tail, and the
six flight feathers of its wings should be entirely red, yellow, or
black ; and when its head is red, the tail and flight feathers should
be red; and when its head is yellow or black, the tail and flight
feathers should invariably correspond with it.
                              THE CROPPER.
   The body of this variety is thick, short, and clumsy ; as are also the
legs, which are feathered down to the feet. They have a large poach
                             (1) See next page.

they are loose breeched on their thighs.

    This bird is something like the jacobin, but it has many shades of
difference, and is a distinct variety.  The hood and span are larger,
but the feathers do not grow so near to the shoulders, and the hood

is not so distinct and compact.         It is rather a larger bird than the
jacobin.
                                 THE TURBIT.
   The turbit has a roundish head, and is chiefly remarkable for a tuft
of feathers on the breast, called the purl, which opens and spreads
like a shirt-frill ; and according to the fulness and beauty of this, the
bird is prized by fanciers.      It has a short beak, and a tuft behind its
head.    It  varies  greatly  in  colour, some being reddish, some dun,
while others     are blue  and  black.   The most valued have their body
plumage white, or of one entire colour.        The blue turbits have black
 bars across their wings.      They are called yellow-shouldered or blue-
 shouldered, according to the different tints of the shoulders or 'wings,
 The original blue turbit has always a blue tail, and the black turbit,
 a black tail ; which are essential accompaniments.

 turbit it has a purl on its breast.   It has a short t>eak and a pearly
eye.    In colour it varies considerably, being of various hues, red,
blue, yellow, black, and silver ; the yellow and red are however the
most prized, and specimens of these colours, when the birds are
otherwise handsomely formed, are rare and valuable.

 but it has no hood on the back part of its neck.         It derives its

    This is a clean handsome bird, and its singular mixture of colours

in the form of its markings, whence its name ; but its colours are
not only black and white,     lie those of the magpie, but often red,
yellow, or blue.

Or Barbary pigeon, was originally introduced from that part of the
African coast, — hence its name. It has usually a tuft      of feathers
sprouting from the back of the head. The plumage           is generally
dun, dusky, or black, darker on the wings. It has a         short thick
beak, to which a small wattle is attached. The insides      of its eyes
are pearl coloured, and there is a circle of incrustated flesh round
the eyes, of a red colour, and the larger and more brilliant this is the
more the bird is prized by the fancier.
                             THE MAWMET.
   The mawmet, or Mahomet, is supposed to be the kind of bird that
whispered in the ear of the false prophet. It is a beautiful bird, of
a cream colour, having bars of black across its wings.      The most
remarkable thing     connected with  this bird is,
                                                 that while the outer
face of its feathersis  of pure cream colour, the part next the body,
                         a
its flue feathers, and even the skin, are sooty ana black very much

   This variety was originally brought from Holland. It has a pouch

stands upright.

   THERE is nothing more delightful than the owe and charge of do
mestic poultry.    It is the most interesting of sights to behold a hen
with her chicks, and to mark her care and tenderness for them; while
the little chicks themselves are so pretty to look at, and have so
many engaging ways with them, as to claim our love and sympathy.
To see them pickmg and scratching about, basking in the sun, or
running hither and thither after their mother hen, or nestling under
her wings when a cloud comes over the face of the sky, or on the
approach of night, is a sight, to a person of right feeling, very
grateful and pleasant ; and to young persons, the care and manage
ment of poultry engender every hour happy occupation.         And it is
with no little pride that we speak         it,

 excellent example, and we shall feel, like her, much real enjoyment.
                       VARIOUS   KINDS  OF POULTRY.
    Domestic poultry may be divided into three kinds. First, the galli
 naceous kind, as the common and foreign fowl, peacock, &c. Second,
 the columbine, or pigeon group or family ; and thirdly, the aquatic
 family, such as the duck, goose, swan, &c.
                           GALLINACEOUS    FOWLS.
    The principal varieties of these are, the dunghill, the Dorking,
 Poland, game, Chittagong, bantam, shakebag, Spanish, Seabright,
 Persian, Cochm China, &c.
                            THE  COMMON    KIWL.
    We have no     history so ancient as the domestication of the cock
 and hen.    The   cock is supposed to be of Persian or Indian origin ;
 but the species,  in numerous varieties, has been introduced through
 out the whole    world. The common barndoor fowl, of which the
cock is so brilliant a specimen, is probably derived from some of the
wild or jungle fowls of India, and has been no doubt mixed with
more than one species. It is so well known that it needs no descrip
tion; it is of middling size, every variety of colour, and is to be
found in every part of the country

                           GAME VARIETY.
   Game   fowls are also too well known to need any description.
Their plumage, particularly the red, is most beautiful and rich, their
size somewhat below the common, and their symmetry and delicacy
of limbs to be compared with those of the racehorse and the deer.
They are, however, a most pugnacious family, and will fight till they
die; wicked men and boys taking advantage of this, have matched
cocks to fight under circumstances of great barbarity, but which can
now be put a stop to by the strong arm of the law.
                       THE DORKINO     VARIETY.
   This is so called from the town of Dorking in Surrey.         Their

  genuine colour is pure white, and their chief distinctive mark is five
  claws on each foot, the fifth claw being little more than an apology
 for a claw.   They are the largest of our fowls, well shaped, and good
 layers ; they also make the finest capons.
                         THE POLAND VASIETY.
     The Poland fowls, as they are generally called, were originally
 imported from Poland.      Their colour is shining black, with white
 tops on the head both of the cock and hen.       The head is flat, sur
 mounted by a fleshy protuberance, out of which springs the crown
 feathers or top, white or black, witn the fleshy head in the centre of
 the crown. The Polanders are not only kept as ornamental, but are one
 of the most useful varieties, and are sometimes called everlasting
 layers.
     The Poland fowls require more warmth, care, and attention than
the common breed, and they are more subject to disease. Their
topknots should likewise be occasionally clipped, or they grow into
the eyes of the birds and nearly blind them.
                             THE BANTAM.
    This well-known bird is small in size. It came originally from
India, and is valued chiefly for its grotesque figure, feathered feet,
and delicate flesh.   Sir John Seabright was a great amateur of this
bird, and obtained a beautiful variegated kmd, with smooth legs,
which go after his name. There is another variety imported from
Brazil, which are very beautiful — partridge spotted and streaked, the
eggs of which are coloured like those of the pheasant.

                         THE CHITTAGONG, OR MALAY.
    This is another Indian variety, and is probably the largest of the
gallinaceous      tribe. They are in colour streaked yellow and dark
brown, long-necked, serpent-headed, and high upon the leg.           They
are good layers, and, being well fed, produce the largest of hen's
Pgg9-
                                SPANISH  POWLS.
    These fowls are large size, and the hens lay enormous eggs, but do
not sit well. The plumage is black, the comb loose, and often pen
dulous, and the naked skin behind the ears white.             Two breeds,
remarkable      for  beauty of  plumage, are the gold-spaneled and silver-
spangled Polands, which are sometimes mixed with the Spanish.
Fine fowls of this breed are highly valued.
                                PERSIAN  BREED.
    From Persia we have the rumpless or tailless breed, in which not
only are the tail feathers wanting, but the tail itself. Fowls of this
breed lay well, but are not sightly in appearance.          The Frieslarid
breed is also another ugly sort, which has the feathers frizzled or
curled up the wrong way.
                            COCHIN-CHINA    FOWLS.
    The Cochin-China fowl was imported into England from Cochin-
China, hence its name. We believe that the first specimens intro
duced into England were imported in 1845, when a pair were pre
sented to her Majesty.         From their stupendous size and shape they
have attracted great attention ; the height of the male bird is from
twenty-two to twenty-five, and the female from eighteen to twenty-
two inches.       There are several varieties, the most favourite are the
buff and cinnamon-coloured ; and there is a white variety, for which
very large sums have been occasionally realized.
    From their general introduction into the country they have lately
much deteriorated in value.
                               CHOICE OP STOCK.
    It  should be a general rule to breed from young stock, a two-year
old   cock   or stag, and pullets in the second year. Hens are in their
prime    at  three years of age, and decline after five. Hens with a large
comb, or which crow like a cock, are of no use. Yellow-legged fowls
are of tender and delicate constitutions.        Healthy fowls are bright
and fresh in the eye, and their combs are of a florid red. The most
useful cock is a bold, fierce, active bird. The indications of old age
are, fulness of the comb and gills, dulness of colour, large scales on
the legs, and stiffness of the feathers.        The spring is the proper
time to commence laying your stock, and nine hens to one cock is
siifficient.

                                 FEEDING.
    In a fowl the digestion of food is not only a chemical, but a me
chanical process.     The food taken into the mouth of a fowl is not
chewed or masticated there, but is swallowed whole, and descends
into the crop, where it is for a while stored.     After passing the crop
it passes through the gullet into a small funnel-shaped stomach,
furnished plentifully with glands which secrete a digestive fluid
for moistening the food, which now passes into the gizzard or last
stomach.     The gizzard is a mill.      It  is lined with gristly mem
branes, which, with the addition of small stones which the bird picks
up, grind and bruise the food. The outlet of the gizzard discharges the
ground food in the form of a greyish paste into the chyle gut, being
 mixed with the bile from the liver it passes into the small mtestines,
on the inner surface of which there are numerous minnte veins,
which suck up the nutriment thus prepared.
                        DIFFERENT KINDS     OF FOOD.
    Fowls require both animal and vegetable food.        When allowed to
 range at large their great search is for worms and insects, but these
 they must obtain for themselves.      The young "poultryman" must
 get a supply of various grain or pulse for their use, such as barley, oats,
 tares, peas, beans, millet, &c., and they should also be well supplied
 with raw vegetables, grass, &c. Boiled rice, boiled potatoes, and
 other vegetables are also very serviceable to them, and a dough or
 paste may be made with pollard or middlings, mixed with pot liquor,
 which they will devour with avidity. The staple food should, how
 ever, be barley, which ought to be boiled occasionally, but not always;
 and this may be mixed with potatoes, or boiled carrots, cut up small.
 The quantify of barley for each fowl per diem is about two egg-cups
 full, beside the other food.   If fowls are pent up and have no run,
 worms, beetles, grubs, earwigs, ants' eggs, &c., should be searched
 for and given them in their nouses.      They should also always have
 a plentiful supply of pure and clean water.
                     TIMES AND PLACES     OF  FEEDING.
     All fowls dependent upon man for food should be fed regularly
 twice a day in the same place.     This place should neither be m the
 full glare of the hot sun, nor in any damp shady place. Young
 chickens cannot stand either of these extremes ; and as most fowls
 usually loiter about the feeding-place, it is of great importance to
 select such a place as will at all times be comfortable or healthful to
 them.     Therefore, an eastern or south-eastern aspect, if it can be
 obtained, is the best situated spot for feeding vour fowls.     The food
                                                        —
 should be given to them at nearly the same hour eight o'clock in
 the morning and four in the afternoon, never later, as in the spring
 and autumn birds retire early to roost, and it is very bad manage
 ment to call them from their perches for feeding.

                                PATTENINO.
    When fowls are to be fattened for the table, they are to be fed
oftener, and with different descriptions of food, than when they are
simply kept for rearing stock or laying eggs. In addition to barley,
rice is an excellent variety of food, and very good broken rice may be
bought nearly as cheap. Indian corn is also a capital fattener, and as
it is now cheap, may be sparingly used. Never give such fowls, or
even others, what is called
                               " tail-corn," but
                                                  always buy the best that
can be procured.     If sunflowers can be grown in sufficient quantity,
their seeds are excellent food. Gross food made up of impure fat,
grease, and flesh-food is very bad for fowls who are to make their
appearance at dinner.       The practice of shutting up fowls in a dark
coop to increase their obesity is also a very nnproper one, as it
tends to deteriorate the quality and flavour of the bird. When
feeding for the table, they should have their food three times a-day,
at morning, noon, and evening; be allowed a fair range for exercise,
but not be suffered to ramble about; and they should be kept warm
and comfortable during the night
                             FEEDING HOUSES.
    Feeding houses should be warm and dry, and have compact earthen
floors, well raised, and littered down with gravel, from which the large
stones have been taken and the small ones left. There should be a
 sufficient number of troughs both for water and food, and care
 should be taken by the feeder that each bird gets his proper share of
the food given, as the stronger and more fierce birds will frequently
 drive away the weaker, who may thus be half starved in the midst of
 plenty, while the others will be "gorged." Fowls generally require
more food in cold than in warm weather.
                                  PA] RING.
    The selection of cocks and hens for pairing is of the utmost
importance. The old writers very often are the best authorities for
modern practice, and according to Columella, who is so frequently
                                       " It is not
copied without acknowledgment,                     good to keep a cocke if
he be not stout, hot, and knaYeshe,        and  of  the same color as the
henzes are, with as many clowes.         His combe to be hye, and red as
blood; his eyes blacke or azure coloure; his beke short and crooked,
with a grey crest shining like red or white; and all his feathers from
the head to the breast to be of changeable coloure, varying like gold
or yellow. His breast large and bigge, his muscels on his wmgs
bigge, his tail fayre and long with two ranks of crooked and rising
feathers, and to be oft crowing is a sign of lasting courage.      The red
coloure is thought   to be the beat cock."      The   choice of a cock is a
very important thing. He should be of full size, but not over large ;
should carry his head high, have a bold animated look, have a strong

288                       EVERY    BOY'S BOOK.
and shrill voice, short belly, fine red comb, shining as if varnished,
wattles of a large size and the same colour as the comb, the plumage
red, the thighs and legs muscular, with strong spurs ; in snort, he
should be a fearless, noble, gallant, and attentive gentleman. But he
should never be kept longer than four or five years, and ill-natured,
spiteful, or lazy cocks should be quickly dispensed with.
                                  HENS.
   The qualities of hens are also of great nnportance.    Old Leonard
Mascall says, "The signes of a good henne are these: to be of a
tawnye color, or of a russet, which are counted the cheefest
coloures. Their heddes oughte not to be great, and their tails oughte
to be in a meane, and her breast large, and her body deepe and long,
for the greatest hennes of body are not the aptest hens to lay." Hens
should be sociable, good-tempered, and robust, have bright eyes,
pendant combs, bluish feet, be of a middle size, of a tawny or brown
colour, and have a matronly look about them, which a good hen always
has.   Some hens, as we have before hinted, make a noise something
like the crowing of a cock. It has been disputed whether such birds
ought to be "dished," but an old proverb        "A parson that dances,
                                                  is,
a  woman that talks Latin, and    aben tliat rrows, never come to any
good."
                                  LAYING.
   Hens begin to lay in the early sprmg, and go on doing so till the
middle of summer, when they cease for      few weeks, and then at its
                                              a
end commence again, again cease towards mid-winter, and commence
again.   When the period of laying approaches,         known
                                                         it      the
                                                                 is     by
brightening   ofthe red in the combs and wattles of the hen, in the
proud archness of her gait, the glistening of her eyes, and her fre
quent cackling. She then looks out for her nest, and after going in
and out of it tor some few days, pulling the straw about, and makmg
a kind of hollow in it,she lays; and having performed this wonderful
feat, generally proclaims the
                                " fait accompli" to the whole world
within hearing.
    In domestic birds, artificial nests must be made for the hen,            in
boxes which we shall describe presently, in which     chalk egg or two
                                                             a
should be put. The nests may be made of short straw. In some
instances,a  hen will make choice of      particular nest to lay in, and
                                          a
when, on desiring to lay, she finds this nest preoccupied by another
hen, she will wait till
                      it  is vacated.  With respect to fecundity, some
hens will lay one egg every day, and others one every other day.
   The eggs ought to be taken from the nest every afte'rnoon,
when no more may be expected to be laid, for             left in the nest, the

    To promote laying in a hen, the best corn and pure water is indis

pensable ; but mulled barley, that        barley wetted and kept                             in   a
warm place, has     good aeffect. Chalk  should" at all times be scattered
about the yard, but particularly    at  the   laying season, as         the            it   is
material with which the egg-shefls are manufactured, and unless the
fowls have      they will lay abundance of soft eggs. Cordial horse-
                    it
ball      is
       good  to  promote laying in the cold season, and toast and ale                             is
used by  country housewives for the same purpose, and will have the
best effect.     warm house also induces the birds to lay rather early,
                     A
as  acold house invariably keeps the laying behind the usual time.
                                              HATCHING.
    When the hen has laid her number of eggs, nature has provided
for their being hatched                      by
                                    giving the bird an instinct to sit or
incubate. This instinct          made known
                                        is                       by

its emergence into a world of life, it has strength given it to set itself
at liberty from its shelly confines.  It pecks at the inside of the shell
till it breaks, and then the impatient chick makes its entrance to the
world in which it is to live.    The length of time required for this
process varies from one hour to six.
    When chickens are thus hatching, it is best to leave them entirely
to themselves ; but sometimes it will happen that a chick has not
sufficient strength to break the egg-shell ; a small tap may in such a
case be given to  it, but never before you are certain that the little
inmate of the shell requires it.
   As soon as the hen becomes      a   mother,a  great change  isseen in
her character — all her former feelings and habits give way to maternal
solicitude. A   good hen attends to her brood with the most perse
vering fondness; she will attack the fiercest animal who dares to
molest her progeny.     The cock too enters into her feelings, and com
mences his work of scratching for the young ones. We had last year
a fine brood of chickens, but the parent hen was accidentally killed
by  the blowing to of the stable door.      The cock, however, took to
the chicks, nestled them, fed them, and brought them np with all
a mother's care.
                        REARING   OP CHICKENS.
   When the chickens are hatched, they require no food till the
following day, when they may be fed with crumbs of bread slightly
moistened, and egg boiled hard, cut up into small pieces.         For the
first few days, the quantity they require    isvery small.  Their    crop
will only contain their food, which wifl not take up more space than a
large pea.   At the end of few weeks, the crop
                            a                        isnot bigger when
distended with food than  a  cherry, but the food 1s soon absorbed, and
therefore they should be fed often —at least four times a-day. On the
day after they are hatched, they should be placed with the hen in         a
nice coop, constructed as shown    in the drawing, having  a little short
cut straw at the bottom.     In   couple of days, the coop and hen
                                  a
should be placed   in some nice spot m the lawn or garden, within
constant sight of the dwelling-house, and where no cats, rats, or
other vermin are likely to prowl about. It should be placed on   dry  a
and warm spot, and the roof of the coop, which has hinges        by
                                                               which
itcan be slightly opened, should be partially raised.  There should,

of course, be cross-bars within the roof to prevent the hen getting
out. A handful of crushed barley should be given to the hen while
the chicks are out in this situation, which she will readily prepare,
by further breaking for their use, while she will take some portions
for herself.  There should be a little pan of water set within reach of
the hen, near the bars of the coop, and stones should be placed in it
to prevent the young brood from drowning themselves, and this water
should be frequently changed.
   As young chickens are generally brought from the egg in March,
of course a great deal of rough weather may be expected oefore they
come to years of maturity. The changes of weather should therefore
be watched, and when it sets in wet or cold, the young brood should
be carefully protected against these dangers by the removal of the
coop into some warm sheltered place, such as a stable, coach-house,
or out-house, and so with care continue to be nursed, guarded,
watched, and attended to, till they are about seven weeks old, when
they will of themselves separate from their parent hen, take to the
roost, and act and do as independent creatures ought, get their own
living, and set up for themselves as free and enlightened chickens.
                            SECOND BROODS.
   Many hens, after having got rid of their first brood, will begin to
lay a second time, and be ready to sit again ; but second broods of
chickens are not like second thoughts, sometimes the best, but
invariably bad. We should by no means encourage our young
friends to attempt second broods, but rather to avoid them            "by
                                                                        all
possible means ; rather let them attend to their first brood, and see that
they have proper perches to roost upon, and be particular that they
 are not too thick for their claws to grasp, and not too thin for their
roosting with comfort. Neither should they be too round or too
sharp, but ought to resemble as much as possible the natural shape
of the branches of tree.

  Artificial hatching has been known from the earliest times, and
Egypt was the great artificial hen nest of former ages. We have
known old women to hatch hens' eggs              in
                                                  common fire oven, and

And consists of    a number of warm pipes about a quarter of an inch
in diameter, and about the same distance apart, resting on supports
about five inches from the floor.       Beneath these pipes is a sliding
board, which is always at such a height as to allow the backs of the
chickens to touch the pipes, and which is gradually lowered as they
increase in size.     Above the pipes (about an inchj is another board
similar to that below, from which descends a curtain in front of the
mother.     This board serves the double purpose of economising the
warmth and preventing the chickens from touching each other.
The pipes above described proceed from a small tank of warm water,
the heat being kept at about 109 degrees Fah.        The youug chickens
 are placed in it when hatched by the Hydro-Incubator.
                           THE HYDRO-INCUBATOB.
    The principle of this machine is that of a current of warm water
 flowing withm a water-proof cloth, upon which the eggs are placed,
 and by a spring movement are brought in contact with a sheet of glass
 above, by which the whole process of incubation can be seen, as if it
 were a transparent hen in the act of incubation.        In this, the eggs
 must be moved and turned three times a-day; and nature is imitated
 in other ways.      For instance, the natural hen leaves her nest nearly
 every day for a short time, to feed.       This it is found necessary to
 imitate also, as the temporary loss of heat has the effect of causing
 the air at the butt end of the egg to diminish in bulk, and the
 vacuum is filled by a fresh supply drawn in for the nourishment of
 the germ.                                    .
    We shall say no more on this interesting subject, except to observe
 that to us the greatest pleasure of fowl keeping consists in beholding
 the mother hen providing for her offspring and observing the affection
  of the little ones.

                                 DUCKS.
   THE duck (amnoii) belongs to a very extensive natural genus of
water birds, found in all parts of the world. They feed in great part
upon animal matter, such as insects and mollusca, as well as upon
vegetables and grain.     They are generally seen upon the lakes and
rivers  of the  interior of a country, although they are often found
upon the sea shore.       Their principal characteristics are, a body
adapted for swimming, feet having membranes or webs between the
toes, which they use to propel their bodies along, and bills with
rounded points, strong, flat and depressed, and commonly furnished
with a kind of nail at their extremity.
   The common wild duck, or mallard, is the original stock of the
domesticated   duck, and appears to have been reclaimed at a very early
period.    The  male of the species is a handsome bird, and the female,
though   inferior, is also very interesting; she makes her nest, lays
from ten to sixteen greenish- white eggs, and rears her young gene
rally in the most sequestered mosses or bogs, far from the haunts of
men, and hidden from his sight, among high grass, reeds, and bushes.
The mallards come from the north of Europe, at the end of autumn,
and, migrating southward, arrive at the beginning of winter, in large
flocks, and spread themselves over all the loughs and marshy waters
in the British Isles.

antic movements of the little brood under           the charge of      foster  a
mother, who with anxious fears paddles upon the brink and utters her
unavailing cries or calls, while the ducklings, regardless of her warn
ings, and rejoicing in the element so well adapted to their nature, arc
splashing over each other beneath the pendant foliage, and diving
their heads beneath the water.
     There are many varieties of the tame duck, and many foreign
varieties have been brought to this country.         That most
                                                                    is is in

 several other foreign species and varieties, which are sometimes kept
 rather for ornament than use.
     The tame duck will lay from eleven to fifteen eggs, and she sits for
  thirty days. They begin to lay in February, and when not watched
  will lav abroad, and conceal their eggs. Tney generally lay at night
  or early in the morning.     When she is about to lay, she looks very
  large behind, and should then be kept within the stable yard or duck

On hatching she should be taken with her brood and put under a
coop ; a shallow pan of water should be placed near her for her drink

 and for that of the young ones, but it should be very shallow. In
 about ten days she may be let loose, when, with her brood, she will
 immediately take to the water.
     Young ducks should be fed upon barleymeal or curds, and kept in
 a warm place at night time, and not let out early in the morning.
 They should, if possible, be kept from water to swim in, as it always
  does them harm.     When the ducks grow large they may be fed upon
  oats (never barley), which should be bruised; to which may be added
  peameal, some broth, chopped vegetables, such as carrots, turnips,
  potatoes, and particularly lettuce, of which they are very fond. They
  may be fattened on the same food, with the addition of barleymeal
  made into doughy lumps; but all offal and filth should be particu
  larly avoided.
                                 TIIE SWAN.
     The Mute or Tame Swan, a well-known ornament to our lakes and
  rivers, is not an inhabitant of England, but was introduced from
  Eastern Europe and Asia, several hundred years back.           All are
  familiar with the graceful deportment of this bird while sailing on
  the surface of the water.    Unfortunately its progress on land by no
  means corresponds     with its aquatic grace, bemg confined to an
  awkward waddle.
     The female Swan makes its nest of a great mass of dry reeds
  placed among osiers or rushes near the water, and lays six or eight

large   white eggs. During the time of incubation, and while the
young are still small, the parent birds defend them with great assi
duity and courage.
                       PEA AND GUINEA FOWLS.
     The peacock and hen are two of the most beautiful of our domesti
cated birds.    Though long naturalized in Europe, it is of Eastern
origin, occurring in the greatest profusion in the neighbourhood of the
 Ganges, aud in the extensive plains of India.       They were brought
 from India into Greece, about the time of Alexander.        They are too
well known to need description, but occasionally the peacocK has the
whole of the plumage of a green white colour, the eyes of the train
 not excepted.    There is also a variety or mixed breed between the
 common and the white variety, in which every different proportion of
 colour between the two is minutely observed.
     Peacocks are granivorous like other birds, and they may be fed in
 the same manner as common fowls.         Their age extends to twenty
 years, and at three the tail of the cock is quite complete.
                    THE PINTADO,    OR GUINEA    FOWL.
     This has been said to unite the character and properties of the
 pheasant and the turkey.      It is an active, restless and courageous
 bird, and will even attack the turkey, although so much above its
  size.  Guinea fowls assimilate perfectly with the common species in
  habits and in kind of food, but they have this peculiarity, that the

                              GUINEA FOWLS.                            297
cocks and hens are so nearly alike that it is difficult to distinguish
them.     They have also a peculiar gait and cry.    The head is covered
with a kind of casque with wattles        under  its bill, and the whole
 plumage is either black or dark grey sprinkled with regular and Uni
 term white spots.      The pintado is a native of Guinea and South
 America, and m the wild state makes its nest in the holes of the palm-
 tree.   It is gregarious, and is often found in large flocks.
    These birds lay abundance of eggs, rather smaller than those of the
 common hen, ana speckled.        They may be reared by placing the eggs
 under a hen, but the chicks are extremely tender, and very often a
 sudden change of the wind in March will sweep off a whole brood in
 a few hours.
                           GEESE AND TURKEYS.
     We purposely refrain from giving any direction concerning the
 rearing of these animals, as such is more the occupation of farmers'
 wives than of boys and girls, for whom our work is designed.
                             DISEASES  OP FOWLS.
     One of the first diseases of domestic fowls is what is called the Pip,
 a white scale or skin growing upon the tip of the tongue.         To cure

 An imposthume, or boil, on the rump, is called the Boup; this should
 be opened with a large needle, and the part afterwards washed with
 salt and water.       Another disease is the Flux, or looseness of the
 bowels, wliich is generally cured by good solid food and a few cori
 ander seeds.     Another disease is called the Chip, in which the poor
 little creatures, about six weeks after they are hatched, sit chirping
 and moping in corners.        It is a kind of consumption, and when so
 affected the chickens should be put into flannel, and placed in a basket
 near the fire, wliich will occasionally restore them.       The Gapes is
 another disease, or rather a similar disease with different symptoms.

The sun or fire warmth, generous diet, and a small quantity of black
pepper, are the best remedies.
   Sometimes it happens that a fowl will overfeed itself, and be unable
to dispose of the great quantity of grain lodged in the crop, which
will puff out almost as large as a cricket ball ; the bird then sickens,
and will speedily perish, unless some relief is afforded, and the only
remedy is to open the crop and take out the obstructing grain ; for
this purpose the sharp end of a small pair of scissors should be used
to pierce the crop a bttle on one side, and when an opening is thus
made, a slit should be cut in it about an inch long. The grain may
then be taken out, and the hole being sewn up with a fine needle and
thread, the bird will soon be well.     It should however be kept by
itself, and fed on soft food for a day or two.

                               RABBITS.
   Tire keeping of rabbits bv young persons is both a pleasant and
profitable amusement, and there are few " boys
                                                    " who are not
                                                                    very
fond of it.   Nor is it by any means an expensive pleasure, as many
amusements are ; while the little labour of love in the tender care for
the little creatures, the walks in the fields and hedges for the collec
tion of food, and the ingenuity necessary for the construction of
the hutches, troughs, and other useful matters, act beneficially, both
on the mind and mtellect of the young rabbit-fancier.
                       RABBITS   IN A WILD STATE.
   The rabbit belongs to the Leporine or Hare tribe, and is a native of
most of the temperate and warmer parts of the old continent, and is
said to have been introduced from Spain.        It has been known from
the earliest periods of history, and we are informed by Pliny that
Spain and Greece were the countries in which the rabbit was first
found.     Their fecundity is truly astonishing ; they will breed seven
times in a year, and perhaps bring forth eight each time ; and on
a supposition that this happens regularly for four years, a single pair
would multiply in that time to 1,274,840.      But although this is pos
sible, it is not very probable to occur.  The young are born blind, and
are suckled by the dam for about six weeks, and in sandy places,
covered with furze, they increase to a great degree, and from these

burrows make extensive depredations upon corn fields and planta
tions.  They generally retire to their burrows during the day, coming
abroad about twilight to feed.
   Rabbits are formed for burrowing in the earth, which they perform
not in a straight but in a zigzag line, and the doe, when about to
make her nest, enlarges the end of       it,
                                       and, pulling from her own body
a quantity of hair,  she  makes  a warm   and comfortable bed for her
young. She seldom     leaves her nest except to satisfy her hunger, and
when she does, she covers up the hole very carefully, scarcely leaving
the least mark of it.

they have also great varieties in the shape of their ears and other
parts of the body, which fanciers have denominated beauty, but which
present many features of ugliness they are however called

                           FANCY     RABBITS.
   The fancy rabbits bear various names, of which the most common
are, the smut, the double smut, the lop, the dew-lop, the oar-lop, the
horn-lop, and some others.    These occasionally fetch very high prices
among fanciers, and five-and-twenty guineas have been given for
a first-rate doe but we would warn our young friends against expen
               ;
sive habits of every kind, and especially against expensive rabbit
keeping.     Animals kept for amusement, and also for instruction — for
much is to be learned of the instinct and habits of animals from
familiar acquaintance with them — should be such as incur little ex
pense beyond what   a  lad can spare from his own pocket money, and
the habit of seeking assistance from parents for foolish fancies         is
pregnant with the greatest mischief.     We should, therefore, strenu
ously advise our young friends not to waste their time and money
upon those ugly overgrown creatures which fanciers choose to desig
nate as beautiful, but to confine their attention to the rearing of the

finest, most perfect, and purest stock of rabbits that can be produced,
and therewith to be content.
    According to fanciers, when one ear grows up straight and the
other lops over the shoulder, it is a great thing, and when the two
ears grow over the nose, so that the poor creature cannot see (as in
the1 horn-lop), or when both ears stick out of each side horizontally
 (as in the oar-lop), or when the hollows of the ears are turned out so
completely that the covered part appears in front (as in the perfect-
lop), these peculiarities are considered as marks of varied degrees of
perfection, but to unsophisticated minds they present nothmg but
monstrosities ; we can see no beauty in such enormities, and shall no
further describe or allude to them.
                          CHOICE OP STOCK.
   With regard to colour, rabbits nearest in colour to the wild ones
are in general the most hardy ; after the black or black and white,
then the white, then the sandy, and lastly the grey and white. The
young fancier may either purchase a doe with young, or he may
obtain four or five young ones.    If the former, he should be guided
in his selection by some experienced person ; if the latter, he should
take especial care that the young ones are in good health, and have
no signs of pot-belly, and that they are of full size, and of strong
build. The rule    is,to " take the largest of the rabbits where there
are the fewest in the litter."  He should take them when about six
weeks old, and when taken they should be placed in pairs,      in
                                                              separate
hutches, till they are about four months old, when each may have        a
separate hutch.
                  THE BABBIT-HOUSE,      HUTCHES,   ETC.
   The rabbit-house should stand upon dry foundation, and be well
                                         a
ventilated. Frequently   aspare loft, or some such place, will be very
                                                                    a
good place.   The huts, or hutches, should be placed on stands about
three feet high, around the sides of the rabbit-house.      Each hutch
intended for breeding should have two apartments,         bed-room and
                                                           a
a dining-room. The floor of the hutches should be planed smooth,
that the wet may run off, and common hoe, with short handle and
                               a                     a
a short broom, are convenient for cleaning the hutches. The breeding
hutches should be about two feet high, two feet six deep, and four
feet long; about one-third of this length should be separated from the
       by
other  a     panel and arched doorway, separating the dining from
the bed-room. Above this there should be sliding door, and which can
                                             a
at any time be put down, so as to shut the doe into either of the
compartments, as occasion may require.      The edges of the doorway
should be cased with tin, as should also the edges of the feeding
trough, and any other part that the rabbit can get at with its teeth.
The front of the hutch has two doors, one of which, belonging to the
inner apartment,  ismade of boards, and the other, belongmg to the

302                         EVERY   BOY'S   BOOK.
feeding room, is open, having wirework in front ; both these doors
are fastened by buttons in front, but open in a contrary direction.
The bottom of the hutch should have a long narrow piece of wood in
front, below the wires, at b, which should be movable, and this, upon
being removed, will permit an iron rod or scraper to be introduced
for cleansing the hutch from time to time of any loose matter collected
in it. In placing the hutch on the stand, it should be set a little
aslant backward, and there should be a few holes drilled at its back
partition, for the purpose of letting all liquid pass off as soon as it
is voided!
                            THE BUCK'S HUTCH.
  It  is the plan of some persons to make the buck's hutch different
in every way from that of the doe, and to place him in a small incon
venient place, with the back rounded off in the form of a dutch-oven,
in which he has little or no room for exercise.     This is bad in every
respect.   The  buck should have a  large roomy  hutch, with a partition,
and a back room into which he can retire wnen he pleases ; for it is
a great comfort to him to be able to hide himself, and to skip in and
out of his little chambers.   His hutch ought, also, to be higher than
that of the doe, and it should have a little trough for his dry victuals,
and a little iron-wire rack on one side for his green food,  ifyou wish
to make him very comfortable.      It is a bad plan to put hutches on
the top of each other, and "the buck's hutch should always be put out
of the sight of the doe.
                             FEEDING BABBITS.
  Babbits should    be fed three    times a-day ; and the principal thing
to be attended to   is,   always to givea good deal more dry than sue

                                RABBITS.                                 303
culent food.    All weeds and the refuse of vegetation should be
banished from their diet, except the roots and leaves of dan
delion, sow-thistle, and hog-weed.   The most nutritious food, are the
tops of carrots and parsnips, cabbages, parsley, fine grass, clover,
tares, colewprts, and the tops of the furze-plant, which should be cut
up with their dry food.    The grain proper for rabbits are oats, peas,
wheat, or buckwheat ; to these, as the best kind of dry food, may
be added bran, pollard, dry clover, pea and bean straw.    Rabbits, fufl
grown,   which  have  as much   corn as they  will eat, can never take
much harm from an abundant supply of vegetable food.        But young
rabbits ought to be very carefully attended to in this respect ; and a
very little vegetable food is the most proper, and that should be of
the best kino, or they will soon depart to that "bourne from which
no rabbit ere returns."
                                NEGLECT.
   One of the most common faults of young rabbit-fanciers     is,
                                                               first to
over-feed their pets, and afterwards to neglect and half-starve them.
Not only do thoughtless boys forget to feed the objects of their care,
but too frequently suffer them to oecome diseased, for want of atten
tion to cleanliness.  This is
                            a  very cruel and wicked thing. Rabbits
should have their hutches cleaned out every morning, and require
many little attentions to provide for their comfort and health     and
                                                                     ;
those who are not disposed to afford these, ought not to think of
rabbit-keeping.
                                BREEDING.
    The doe will breed at the age of six months, and goes thirty or
thirty-one days with young.      The best breeding rabbits are those
that kindle in March.      Some days before this great event takes
place, hay should be given to the doe, wherewith to make her bed.
This she speedily does, lining the nest prepared for her forthcoming
little ones with the flue, or down, from her own body.     It   isvery
                                                                     a
pretty sight to see the doe biting the hay into short lengths, and
laying  it down for her bed, and to observe her sitting upon her
haunches, tearing the down from her body, to keep her young ones
warm. The number       adoe produces  isgenerally from six to ten but;
when any exhibit symptoms of weakness, they should be destroved,
asit   is much better for the doe to bring up six fine, healthy ratbits
than ten sickly ones. After she has kindled, boys should on no
account touch the young rabbits, except for the purpose above
named; for she    isvery shy at such times, and,   if  much teased or
harassed, will be likely to destroy her young.      Should the doe be
weak after bringing forth, she will drink beer-caudle, or take   amalt-
mash, which will be very grateful to her.   At the time of kindling,      a
little cold water should be placed conveniently in the hutch, as the
animal appears wonderfully gratified   by   it.

                         FATTENING    BABBITS.
   Rabbits are in perfection for eating when about nine months old,
and should be put to fatten when they are about six.        It requires
about three months to make a rabbit thoroughly fat and ripe ; half
the time may make them eatable, but by no means equal in the
quality of their flesh. They should be kept in a single hutch, and fed
with oats, hay, cabbage, bran, and chicory. They may also be
treated to a little barley-meal and a few peas ; but they must be kept
very clean, and have plenty of air.
                        DISEASES OP BABBITS.
    No animal is less liable to disease than the rabbit, when carefully
 attended ; but neglect and want of cleanliness, or improper food, pro
 duce in them many complaints, among the foremost of which is what
is called " pot-belly," and which is very common to young ones. It
is generally occasioned by want of air and exercise, and the use of too
large a quantity of green food.     The remedy is dry food, and to let
the rabbits run about in an open dry space every day; but the best of
all remedies is a stroke behind the ears, as few pot-bellied rabbits
ever come to any good.
    Rabbits are subject to colds and hoarseness, as we are, and have
what is called " the snuffles." While this disease lasts, they should
be kept dry and warm, and be fed with barley-meal, made into a paste
with a little milk ; and no water or green food should be given them
till they recover. Rabbits are also afflicted with a compliant of the
liver, which generally arises from damp beds and foul hutches, want
of exercise, &c. The only remedy for this complaint is the blow
behind the ears; but it is easily prevented by nice dry hutches,
bedding, and good and wholesome food.
                           ANECDOTES,   ETC.
   The rabbit is a caressing animal, and equally fond with the cat of
the head being stroked, and is very much attached to its keeper. We
had one,
           " Blackamoor," a beautiful black buck rabbit, of whom our
                                   " Holiday Book." He was a most
young friends may read in the
sociable animal, and we admitted him into friendly communion at our
board.    He was a frequent intruder to the parlour, and, by his tre
           "
mendous      thump" with his hind feet, so intnnidated our "Tippoo,"
— a fine tom-cat, so called from his Bengal-tigerish appearance, that he
would chase him round the room, and leap over hnn, to our infinite
delight. He would come at our call, and we taught bun to sit on his
hind legs, and to beat a tambourine : we also taught him to play the
piano — that is,  to rattle with his fore-paws on the keys; and he
became  a   most prodigious pet, and was  a   favourite for many years;
and at last went, honoured and lamented, to the grave    ;   anda  head
and foot-stone mark the spot where he takes his everlasting rest.

                      LAWS RESPECTING     RABBITS.
   By   7 and 8 Geo.   IV., If any person   unlawfully and wilfully,     in
the   night-time, take any rabbit from    a warren,    breeding-place,   or
ground lawfully used for that purpose,    shall forfeit and pay the sum
of 51., upon conviction, before any of    his Majesty's justices of the
peace.    By the common law, if rabbits   come on a man's ground, and
eat his crops, he may kill them.
                             SQUIRRELS.
    THE squirrel is one of the prettiest and most engaging animals of
 all the pets. It is elegant in form and cheerful in disposition, and is
 completely formed for a "life among the trees." When on the
 ground, it moves by successive leaps, with the tail extended and
 undulating; when sitting, the tail is elevated over its back like a
 plume, in a most elegant manner.     The forest is its home, and here
 it displays the most wonderful agility in leaping from bough to
 bough.
    The squirrel lives upon nuts, acorns, beech-mast, the bark of trees,
 leaf-buds, and tender shoots.   Like the hare and rabbit, it generally
 aits upon its hind-legs; and it uses its fore-paws, which are like

 306                      EVERY BOY'S       BOOK.
 hands, to convey its food to its mouth. It is most provident in laying
 up its winter stores, not only in a place of safety, but in several holes
 of trees in the immediate neighbourhood of its own retreat.
    The squirrel's nest is constructed with great art in the hollow of
 some old tree, or in the bark ; and is composed of moss, twigs, and
 dry leaves. It breeds generally in May or June, and the young
 family consists of four or five.
    The squirrel never appears in the open fields, but keeps among the
tallest trees, and avoids as much as possible the habitations of man.
It is so extremely vigilant, that if the tree on which it resides be
only touched at the bottom, it instantly takes the alarm, quits its
nest, leaps to another and another tree, and then travels on till it
finds itself in perfect security.     They have been seen, when hard
pressed, and when the distance to the next tree has been beyond
their most extravagant leaps, to throw themselves off, spreading
abroad their limbs, so as to make their bodies as parachute-like as
possible, to break their fall; and, on reaching the ground without
harm, bound along for the few intervening paces, and ascend the tree
with a celerity almost too quick for the eye to follow.      Country lads
are very fond of hunting for squirrel nests ; and we remember on one
occasion, in our "palmy days," to have had our nose woefully
scratched by an old squirrel, who flew at us, very properly, in defence
of her young, and obliged us to beat a retreat before we lost our eye
sight, as we had already lost our humanity.
   In a domestic state, squirrels are kept in a cage — many persons
confine them to a miserably small one. What notions of things such
people must have ! Think of a free, liberty-loving creature to be
                        " Cabm'd, cribb'd, confined,"
in a small space of a square foot, in which every motion tends to the
brushing off or grinding down of the most beautiful tail in the whole
order of mammiferous creation! Oh, my good young friends, if you
do keep a squirrel, let him have elbow-room ! Teach aim as much as
possible to forget his native woods, by the freedom you give him in
his prison.   Let his cage be at least six feet long, and four high ; let
it have perches, like the branch of a tree ; let hnn have a sleeping

 box, opening with a door behind, for the purpose of cleaning it ; let
him have a food-box and water-pan, nicely adjusted, both of which
ought to be of glass; while the edges of his cage should all be
covered with tin, or else the love of liberty will soon give him means
to escape. The movable, or turn-about, cage is a most unnatural
affair ; it induces the animal to perpe
tual up-hill running, with the unpleasant
feeling of the hilT sliding under him,
which is neither good for his health or
recreation. It   is,  in fact,     species of
                                   a

   Squirrels may be fed on all kinds of fruits, particularly those of the
nut kind, such as filberts, woodnuts, walnuts, almonds, acorns, beech-
mast, and they are very fond of the cones of the fir-tree.           They

                               GUINEA-PIGS.
     THE animal which is so well known under the name of guinea-pig
  is the Cobaya, or Aiuema, a native of Brazil.        The name guinea-
  pig is a great absurdity; first, because the animal is not a native
  of Guinea, and secondly, because it is not a pig, nor like a pig, nor of
• the same
              genus, or even of the same order. It is one of the rodentia,
  or gnawing animals, to which rats, mice, and beavers belong.       It is
  much better known in the tame than in the wild state.             When
  domesticated it is so liable to diversity of colouring, that scarcely
  any two individuals agree in that respect.    Some are almost entirely
  white,   others  spotted with  black and fawn colour, yellow or tawny.
  It is less than the rabbit in size, and its neck and legs are so short
  that the latter are rarely seen, and the former seems stuck upon its
  shoulders.
     Among the most remarkable characteristics of this animal is its
  fertility.   The female goes only three weeks with young, and she
  breeds several times a year, having seven, eight, or even sometimes
  ten or eleven at a birth. Their life is almost an incessant round of
  eating and sleeping, and reproducing their kind.      They readily feed
  on all sorts   of herbs, but prefer parsley and the tops of carrots to
  bread and flour, and they are very fond of apples ana other fruits.
     Though naturally tame and gentle, guinea-pigs, as they must be
  called, are incapable of strong attachment.      They affect dark and
  intricate retreats, and seldom venture out of concealment when
  danger is at hand.       They are timid and watchful, and sleep like
  the hare, with their eyes half open. Though they have a disagreeable
  smell, they are in themselves very cleanly animals.
     Guinea-pigs     are easily provided for; they only require a little
  hutch with a little back bed-chamber and a front feeding room.
  They may be fed upon bread and milk, with a few chickens' grits or
  oatmeal, and the usual food of the rabbit, such as a dandelion, sow-
  thistle, plantain, &c. They are remarkably fond of tea-leaves, and it
  is said that they will pick out the real from the spurious leaves with
  great dexterity.
     The most valuable are the dark rich tortoise-shell ones ; and they
  may easily be procured from the bird and beast fanciers in the streets
  of the Seven Dials, for prices varying according to the colours of the
  beast, and the excessive greenness of the purchaser.

                           WHITE MICE.
   THE mouse is a lively little animal, and one of the most timid,
although he eats in the trap as soon as he is caught.       The brown
mouse can very rarely be tamed, but white mice are bred and brought
up in a state of domestication, and the young fancier can obtain a pair
for a shilling at any of the fanciers.  The female has frequently six
or eight broods in a year, but at these times she must be separated
from the buck, who very frequently destroys the young ones.
    Cages for white mice may be easily purchased by those who have
(he money — mark that — and you may indulge yourselves, my young
friends, to any tune, from the sweet jingle of sixpence to the respect
able clmk of a golden sovereign.     The best kind of cage is that like
a squirrel's, but on a small scale.
    Some boys who have ingenuity will construct pretty little houses
for their white mice.    We remember seeing one on which there was
a mill, by which the white mice very much like millers in their looks,
ground their own corn by means of a turnabout fixed on a post of the
dormitory, and it was very amusing to see the little creatures come
put of the chimney and look about as unlike chimney-sweeps as white
is to black.
   The principal food for white mice is bread and milk, oatmeal grits,
and any other common food, except cheese, which is bad for them.
They should be kept particularly clean, and their cages ought to be
arranged, and beds made up every day, or they will give out a most
disagreeable smell.

    Piebald mice are sometimes produced by a union of the common
field-mouse with a white mouse; there are also some expensive
varieties, such as the black mouse, and the black and white mouse,
which the young gentlemen who have more money than wit may pur
chase for a few shillings each — but we say sixpence — sixpence apiece
is enough for any pets of this kind.
                      THE DORMOUSE, OB SLEEPER.
    These animals in a state of nature build their nests in the hollow
parts of trees, or near the bottom of thick shrubs, and line them with
moss, soft lichens, and dead leaves, and instinctively conscious of the
length of time they have to pass in their solitary cells, they generally
lay up a store of food, consisting of nuts, beans, and acorns; and on
the approach of cold weather they roll themselves in balls, their tail
curled up over their head between the ears, and in this state in a kind
of lethargy they pass the winter.
    There are several varieties of the Dormouse. The common, the
garden, and the fat.     The first is a native of England, the second of
the temperate parts of Europe and Asia, and the third of France and
the south of Europe. They breed but once a-year, and generally have
only four or five at a litter.
    The male and female may be kept together in cages similar to those
for white mice, and they may be fed on all kinds of grain or shell-
fruit.   Their inner apartment should be stuffed with fine hay, and
their cages kept very clean.     When the female is about to breed, a
little soft cotton  should  be put into the cage, with which she will line
her nest.    During the winter they should be kept in a warm room,
for if through cold they are induced to sleep, they are said to bite off
their tails.
    They may be purchased by those who have money to spare for
about nalf-a-crown a pair. Those who have no money to spend often
find them in hedge-rows and bushes, and there secure them for the
 value of a footless stocking without a leg.

   THE bee has in all ages been the emblem, not only of industry but
of social government ; and it is celebrated for its wonderful polity,
and for its providence for the future.           It has Ijeen known from the
earliest ages  in  a  wild  state, and   the  honey of Hybla was celebrated
among the ancients.        The genus apis comprehends a great variety of
the hymenopterous insects; but the hive bee, or domestic bee (the
Apis mellifad), is the one with which our young friends will now have
to do. And we may just as well state, that the hive-bee is distin
guished from all others, by having the shanks of the hind legs fur
nished with a smooth and concave pollen-plate on the outer surface,
and destitute of shins on the extremity, — t>y the oblong shape of the
body, — by the feelers of the sheaths of the tongue being almost
obsolete, and formed of a single joint.

                         STRUCTURE     OF   THE BEB.
                              If  we examine the structure of the com
                           mon    bee, the first remarkable    fact that
                         presents    itself is the proboscis, an  instru
                         ment serving to extract honey from flowers.
                         It is not formed like that of other flies, in
                         the shape of a tube, by which the fluid is
                         to be sucked up, but rather by a kind of
                         tongue, to lap it up.        When thus lapped
                         out of the nectary, it is conveyed to the
                         crop, or honey-bag ; where it undergoes but
                         little alteration, and part of it is then dis
                        gorged into the honey-cells of the hive, and
                        the remainder retained for the bee's own
                        nourishment. Wax is a peculiar secretion
                         in little cells beneath the scales of the ab
                         domen.       It is from honey that the wax, by
                         some internal process, is elaborated.        It
                         oozes out beneath the rings of the belly,
                         and then being washed by the saliva of the
bee's mouth forms the wax of the comb.
                   For purposes of defence, the bee is furnished with
                a sting. This is composed of three parts, namely,
                the sheath and two extremely small and penetrating
                darts, each of which is furnished with several points,
                or barbs, which render the sting more painful.
                This instrument would, however, prove but a very
                poor weapon, if the bee did not poison the wound.
                The sharp-pointed sheath first enters the flesh, and
                then being followed by the barbed darts, the veno
                mous fluia is quickly injected.      Sometimes the sting
                of the bee is left behind, but then the death of the
                insect is sure to follow. Upon being stung, the best
                remedy      is,first to nip or press out any part of the
                sting left in the flesh, and immediately to rub the
                  wound with iodite of potassium, which     isa   certain
                 cure.
                    The Hive and its Inhabitant!.
                                   THE QUEEN.
  A  beehive contains three kinds of individuals — queen, drones,
                                                       a
and workers.  The queen       female, and not only the ruler, but in
                              is
                              a

                                   BEES.                            313
great part the mother, of the community.      The drones
are males, and the working bees neither males nor
females. The queen seems to be incessantly employed
in laving eggs. She is accompanied by a guard of twelve
workers ; and in whatever direction she turns, these
state-guards clear the way for her, and in other ways
pay her homage and attendance.            The queen-bee
is slow and majestic in her motions, and differs from
the workers in having a larger and longer body,
shorter wings, and a curved sting.
                              THE DRONES.
   The drones are all males ; they are less than
the queen, and larger than the working bees.
They live on the honey of flowers, but bring none
home; and are wholly useless, except being
the fathers of the numerous progeny.          When
this office is accomplished, the workers attack
them ; they grapple with each other in the air —
hug and scuffle tor a moment: the drones, having
no stings, soon get the worst of the combat ; for
the stings of the workers are plunged into their
sides, and, overpowered by the poison, they instantly die.
                          THE WORKING      BEES.
   The working bees are the smallest bees in the    hive, and by far the
most numerous ; and they do the entire work of        the
community — they build tfre cells, guard the hive   and
the queen, collect and store the honey, elaborate    the
wax,   feed the young, and kill the drones.         The
average   number    of these three  kinds  of bees in   a
hive is one, or at most two, queens, two thousand
drones, and twenty thousand workers.
                HOW THE QUEEN-BEE        LAYS HER EGGS.
    When the queen-bee has an inclination to deposit her eggs, she
goes forth, accompanied by her guard of honour, ten or twelve bees,
whose stomachs are filled with honey.       She then moves on from one
cell to another, depositing an egg in each. After she has deposited
eight or ten eggs, she appears exhausted; and then the attendant
bees feed her with honey. The operation of layingagain goes on, and
 the same process is repeated from time to time. When the operation
 of laving is completed, the queen retires to that part of the hive
 which is most filled with bees.
    For eleven months the queen lays only workers' eggs ; afterwards
 those which produce drones. As soon as this change takes place, the

 314                       EVERY BOt'S BOOK.
 workers begin to construct royal cells, in which, without discon
tinuing to lay the drone eggs, the queen deposits here and there,
generally about once in three days, an egg which is destined to pro
duce a queen.
                     HOW THE EGGS ABE HATCHED.
    The workers' eggs hatch in a few days, and produce little white
maggots, which immediately open their mouths to be fed ; these the
workers attend to with the greatest care. In six days, each maggot
fills up its cell ; it is then roofed in by the workers, spins a silken
cocoon and becomes a chrysalis, and on the twenty-first day it comes
forth a perfect bee. The drones emerge on the twenty-fifth day, and
the queens on the sixteenth.
                           THE HIVE IN WINTER
 Should be placed in some dark cold place, under cover, in the loft of
an outhouse.      Of course, it should contain a sufficient quantity of
honey for the use of the bees. (See article, Food.)      The hive in this
situation should be carefully guarded against damp, and be kept per
petually closed from November to March.
                   HOW THE BEES FORM THEIR CELTS.
    The combs of a beehive comprise a number of hexagonal cells,
built by the bees   as a receptacle for honey, and for the nurseries of
their young.     Each comb m a hive is composed of two ranges of
cells, lacked against each other. There is a continued series of these
                                 aoTAL CELL.
double cells in every well-filled hive, the spaces between them being
just sufficient to allow two bees, one on the surface of each comb, to
pass without touching.       Each cell is six-sided, the six sides bemg
perfectly equal.    This  is one of the geometrical figures that ensures
the greatest economy of material and the largest space.         The con
struction of several combs is usually going on at the same time, until
the hive is filled. The design of every comb is sketched out, and the

                                          BEES.                                          315
first foundation laid, by a single bee. The cells of the drones are
larger than those designed for the workers; and that cell de
signed for the queen bee is of the shape of an oblong spheroid,
tapering gradually downward.      The finest honey is stored in new
cells constructed for the purpose of receiving it.
                                        THE APIABY.
    The usual modes of establishing an apiary are, either by the pur
chase of stock or of swarms. In the purchase of stock, the following
essential points should be attended to, without a knowledge of
which, the young apiarian will find himself deceived at the very
moment when his expectations of ultimate success are raised to the
highest pitch. When intending to purchase stock, do not buy it
upon recommendation, but learn to judge for yourself. Repair to
tile garden in which it stands, about the middle of the day, and,
  lacing yourself before          it,
                              pay particular attention to the actions of
§le bees.    If you observe them crowding in and out of the hive, and
a  considerable number of them having little yellow pellets or balls on
their hinder legs,     avery favourable opinion may be formed of the
health and condition of the interior, and especially of the prolific
state of the queen.        If
                            the bees appear savage, and bold         their          in
attacks upon their enemies, particularly the wasp,             it

  have been hived only a few weeks.
                        SITUATION   OF  THE APIASY.
     The best situation for establishing an apiary is the vicinity of
  woods and commons, and of brooks rather than of large lakes and
  rivers. A dry air, and a light soil, productive of odoriferous shrub?,
  are also essential to the production of the best honey and the finest
  wax. The bee will travel six or seven miles in search of food, guided
  by its acute powers of smelling at a distance. Apiaries should always
  be placed in gardens where the hives and boxes may be shaded from
  the scorching rays of the sun, and yet open to air and warmth.        A
  south-west aspect is generally recommended.      The apiary should not
  be surrounded with tall trees or shrubs, but short ones are useful ;
  and it should be well protected from the natural enemies of the bee.
  The garden in which the apiary stands should be well furnished with
 flowers, and kept neat and clean, and all nuisances should be imme
 diately removed.
                            HIVES AND BOXES.
     Hives generally stand either in a bee-house box or shed, or under
 a thatched or other kind of roof. In the engraving, we give a sketch
 of one of the simplest kinds of apiary, or oee-box, which combines
 the glass-hive and all the comforts of a common apiary.       The glass-
 hive is by no means in accordance with the natural mstinct of the
bee, who works m darkness ; and therefore it
                                                       should always be
covered with a cap, which should be removed
                                                   only when the voumj
bee-keeper wishes to examine the working of his little colony
    The stand on which the hive is
                                     placed should always be kept verv
clean, and if occasionally it be
                                  sprinkled with a little salt it will be
very conducive to the health of the bees.
    Beehives have ever varied much, both in their
                                                    form and .the mate
rials ot which they have been
                                 constructed.   Hives have been made

straw hives may be had in any part of the country for two shillings
or half-a-crown ; and since the reduction of the duty on glass, hives
of this material are very cheap.
                                  POOD.
   Unless the bee has a good neighbourhood for food, the colony will
not do well. The country round should be a floral district; and
among the many kinds of flowers grateful to the bee, are all kinds of
fruit-tree blossoms, those of the yellow furze so abundant on heaths,
the blossom of vetches, beans, white clover, lucern, and sanfoin.  In
the garden in which the hives stand should be planted the sunflower,
hollyhock, and poppy ; borage, mignonette, verbenas, nasturtium ;
and, with a view of imparting a fragrancy of flavour to the honey,
the odoriferous shrubs, thyme, lavender, sweet marjoram, and their
like, with strawberries and raspberries, should be planted: and a
garden well supplied with these will keep the bees from wandering
far from their homes. Bees should also oe well supplied with pure
water, which should be placed in shallow pans about their dwellings ;
and pebbles should be placed in      it,
                                       upon which the bees may settle
when they drink.
                                SWARMING.
    We are now to suppose that the period of the year has arrived
when the queen insects, having undergone the change to the pupa
state, are nearly ready to burst forth to life.          It

queen-mother, losing all her parental feelings, becomes infuriated.
She rushes to the cells wherein are deposited the future queens, her
offspring, and instantly begins to tear them open. The guards which
surround the cells make way for her on her approach, and suffer her
to act as she pleases; whereupon she slaughters the inmates with
her sting, without remorse.    She now runs about in    wild delirium,
                                                                   a

 s minute she is followed by all the bees that are to compose the
 swarm. By degrees they fix themselves on a branch, and form a group
 there, by fixing one to another with their feet.       Although they are
 exposed, they remain quiet ; and often in less than a quarter of an
 hour, we see scarcely more bees hovering round the swarm than are
 to be seen around a hive in fine weather.
    If, in sallying forth, the swarm flies towards some large tree, there is
 reason to fear that the bees may wander beyond the limits of the hive ;
 they may easily be brought down by a handful of dust.            Although
 the swarm remain tranquil, it must not be left long in this position
 without offering it a lodging, especially if the sun be warm, because
 it would speedily go elsewhere m search of a new habitation.         Thus,
 therefore, m the swarming season, it is necessary to have hives quite
 ready to make use of as occasion requires.
                         HOW TO TAKE THE SWARM.
    A proper hive having been prepared, it should be well cleansed ;
 and, to render it agreeable to the bees, its sides should be rubbed
 with flowers of melissa, bean flowers, &c., of the scent of which they
 are fond. Some parts ot it may be also moistened with a slight layer
 of honey.     The hive should always, if possible, be put under the
 swarm, and the bees shaken or brushed mto it with a goose-wing or
 fan.    The hive is then to be covered with a sheet or table-cloth ; out
 in taking the swarm, the neck, hands, and face of the youngster
 should be covered, or in some way defended; for if the bees get
 enraged, ten thousand stings might be planted in him. Thus a fresh
 hive is established, chiefly consisting of insects lately hatched, which
 in the course of a very short time commence their usual labours.
After swarming, however, the bees should be fed for a few days.
    The swarm may divide itself into several clusters ; in which case
there are several queens. On being hived together, the bees will kill
the supernumerary queens ; but when an undivided swarm is hived,
and the bees are restless and discontented, it may be judged that
they have no queen, and one must be provided for them from the
parent stock.      Queens are discovered by being first surrounded by
small groups of bees.
                               SECOND SWA    II MS.
    We will now return to the old nest bereft of their queen.           The
bees that remain take particular care of the royal cells, and prevent
the young queens successively hatched from leaving them, except at
an interval of several days from each departure.         This results in a
considerable degree from the different periods at which the royal eggs
are deposited.     Thus several queens are successively produced, and
several swarms thrown off. As soon as a young queen is produced,
she proceeds instantly to attack the other royal cells : but here
there is a remarkable difference in the conduct of the workers ; for,

                                                                               319
 although they permitted their ancient queen to pursue her own
 instinct, they by no means extend the same courtesy to her suc
 cessor ; but the moment she attempts to approach a royal cell, the
guards surrounding it immediately attack, bite, and drive her off.
Irritated at this behaviour, the young queen stands upright, and
utters a shrill and clear sound ; and no sooner is it heard than the
bees appear to be paralysed — they remain without motion, and hang
down their heads. She then attacks the cells, but, in doing so, ceases
to pipe ; when the bees, recovered from their stupor, drive her away.
This is continued till the queen is irritated in such a degree that she
follows the steps of her predecessor, and quits the hive with a second
swarm.     In this manner, several swarms take place in the course of
the summer, between the months of April and August.
                                TAKING THE HONEY.
   Depriving, or gathering the harvest of honey from the hive, is
generally performed in August, after the swarming ; but portions
may be taken from the hive sometimes as early as the middle or latter
end of May.      When the whole honey is to be taken, the improved
hive   is proper to be used, and when the bees are at rest. The full
hive should be inverted on an empty one of precisely the same
diameter placed over it; and, to prevent the bees from escaping,
a large sheet or cloth should be tied round the place where the hives
join. Beat the sides of the full hive with the hand or a stick, and the
bees, alarmed, will all ascend into the new hive in a few minutes ;
when they are there, which will be known by their general humming,
 the new hive may be put in the place of the old one.
    The old hive must be now taken in-doors, and the honeycomb cut
 out, leaving the bees a proper quantity for their winter food, that               is,
 about eighteen or twenty pounds.     The hive should then be made
 perfectly clean; and the other hive containing the bees being re
 versed, the old one placed over     and being so left till morning, the
                                         it,
 bees will be then found in their own domicile.
            " He     that is robb'd, not wanting whatis stolen,
                 Let him not know it, and he's not robb'd at all." — SHAKSPEARE.
  It  used formerly to be the humane practice, (worthy of that paragon
of perfection — man) to steal the honey, and to burn the bee but this  ;
is  now prevented     by
                      the improved hive alluded to, which every young
bee-fancier ought to procure.      When, however, this cannot be done,
the honey may be taken       simply stupefying the bees without tilling
                                by
them.    The dried fungus, or puff-ball, torn up into small pieces, and
mixed with few leaves of tobacco, or any other dry substance that
           a a
will make     smoke, should be put into      tin box, and, being set on
                                                 a
fire below, will begin to smoulder.    The open part of the box should
now be placed over the hole of pair of bellows, and the smoke being

thrown through the nozzle which has been inserted into the door of
the hive among the bees : in a few seconds a buzz of alarm will be
heard : but three or four more puffs of smoke settle the bees quietly
to sleep, and they fall down in a heap on the floor of the hive, as if
dead, — a cloth being placed over the hive, to prevent the bees from
rolling about.   It is now removed, the honey taken, &c., and then
returned to its place above the bees, who will, in the morning, be
quite unconscious of the trick played upon them.
                     ARTIFICIAL FEEDING            OF BEES.
     Honey is the best food for bees     ;    but, as a substitute, boil a pound
of coarse sugar in three pints of ale : let it stand till cold, then pour
a portion of it into a plate, and, placing some straws over           it,
                                                                   deposit

will soon convey the whole of    into their respective hives.

salt mixed with the ale and sugar will greatly assist the health
of the bees.
                          DISEASES OF BEES, ETC.
   The chief diseases of bees generally arise from damp, cold, or
from want of food.     Sometimes, however, they cannot bear the ex
cessive heat of the sun.     The principal diseases to which they are
subject are, dysentery, torpor, falling m flight from vertigo or giddi
ness, lice. Care and good feeding seem to be the only remedies upon
which reliance can be placed.      Bees should also be protected from
their enemies and
               ;      a thick coating of Roman cement over the hive
will often keep out such intruders as rats, mice, birds, cats, &c.

             May thank the silkworm for his robe of .itate."— A KEN-SIDE.
   THE rearing and management of silkworms is an innocent and agree
able pastime Both to boys and girls, and it is very interesting in many
points of view. One fact     is,that while the caterpillars of all the other
tribes of moths and butterflies, when they have arrived at            certain
                                                                        a
state of maturity, show    a restless disposition, and wander about and
hide themselves in   a  variety of places in order to spin their cocoons,
the silkworm, on the contrary, is content to remain stationary in the
open tray or box in which       it may be placed.     After consuming its
immediate supply    of  mulberry   leaves   itwaits for   further quantity,
                                                           a
and when the period arrives for its spinning its cocoon, instead of
showing any nugratory disposition,       itseems to place itself with confi
dence under the care of man to provide        itwith suitable place for its
                                                       a
convenience and protection.
   The silkworm      is systematically known under the name of the
Sombyx Mori of Linnseus, or the Mulberry-tree Moth, which in the
winged state  is of cream colour, with several transparent bands of
                     a
a darker colour across the anterior wings, and              crescent-shaped
                                                              a
central  mark.   The   caterpillar when   full grown    nearly three inches
                                                         is
in length, and  is too well known to our young friends to need any
particular description. The eggs when good are of              pale slate or
                                                                  a
dark lilac colour; they may be purchased m Covent Garden market for

 322                        EVERY BOY'S
 about ten shillings per ounce, and care should be taken to obtain
them of a proper colour, because those that are of a pale yellow are
 imperfect.
    The silkworm when first hatched is black, and does not exceed in
 length one-fourth of an inch. The desire for food is the first symptom
 it exhibits of life, and at this period it is more active than any other.
 When about eight days have elapsed after its hatching, its head
 becomes considerably enlarged, and it turns sick, refuses food, and
 remains in a state of lethargy for about three days.         This sickness
 would appear to arise from the pressure of the animal's skin, which
 has become too tight for the increased bulk of its body.       Indeed the
 very great  difference  in  the  size of the worm from   the  beginning to
 the end of the caterpillar state is so great, that nature has furnished
 it with several skins, each of which it casts in succession.
    The body of the caterpillar is begirt by twelve rings, which
 approach to or recede from each other accordmg to its motion; there
 are nine breathing holes on each side of the body, (even eyes on each
 side of the head, and two small orifices below the jaws, through
 which the worm ejects its silken filament.
    The art of using this filamentous substance seems to have originated
 with the Chinese, and to have been discovered at a very early period,
 and the raw material was purchased by the Persians, Tyrians, Indians,
 and for a long tune before it was introduced to Europe.         For many
ages silk bore an enormous price at Rome, but about the middle of
the sixth century two monks arrived at Constantinople from India,
bringing with them the white mulberry and the eggs of the silkworm,
which have since been reared in Italy, Spain, France, and other parts
 of Europe.
                         POOD    OF  THE SILKWORM.
    The silkworm feeds, as every one knows, on the leaves of the white
mulberry ; or when these cannot be obtained upon those of the black
mulberry ; or in lieu of these upon the leaves of the common garden
lettuce.    The white mulberry is especially cultivated for the value of
its leaves, its fruit being insipid and very inferior to that of the
common species, the leaves of which are equally good in this country
for the food of the silkworm.        There has been a variety lately intro
duced from the Philippine Isles (Mom muliicaulis), which has larger
leaves, and which is easily propagated by cuttings put into a cucumber
frame in October, and transplanted in the following May ; yet still to
ensure success in the rearmg of silkworms, the young naturalist
should stick to the old black mulberry, as such trees are to be found
in various vicinities. To propagate this, a branch from another tree
may be set in the earth, which will frequently grow.          The amiable
Sir John Philipport of Hammersmith, so celebrated for his "Elysian
groves and fountains fair," and for his sterling English qualities, has
in his grounds a fine mulberry -tree, which he reared by placing a very

                               SILKWORMS.                            323
 loose branch in the ground in the autumn of 1850, which threw out
 roots, and started at once into a tree.   The story of a gate-post made
 of a mulberry trunk becoming, and now remaining, a fruitful tree, is
 well authenticated. The leaves to be used should be those of a large
 and well grown prolific tree, and they should be gathered with care,
 so that the young buds of future leaves should in no way be injured,
and a tree should never be stripped twice in a year.
                HATCHING,   FEEDING,   AND TEMPERATURE.
     Having procured the eggs, which should be obtained about the
latter end of April, —they are generally bought on slips of paper just
as they were laid by the moth, — they should be placed in trays made
of stout cartridge or thin pasteboard of the form seen in the cut, and
there should be provided to go over the case some thin gauze.         The
trays may be placed in a window facing the south, where they are
 fully exposed to the rays of the sun  ; there they should remain undis
 turbed till they begin to hatch, and as the young worms appear they
 should be removed into other trays, and fed with the mulberry leaves.
 The temperature should be kept at from sixty-six to seventy degrees,
 and the room should be well ventilated, and should be kept equally
 free from damp or too much dryness.       They should be kept particu
 larly clean, dead leaves and dung cleared carefully away, and in lifting
 them from one tray to another they should not be touched by the
  fingers, but removed by threads of cotton passed under their bodies,
  or with a camel's hair pencil.
                                 MOULTINGS.
     The caterpillar has four moultings, which may be all accomplished
 in the period of four days each, if the heat of the room be increased
 from nmety-five to one hundred degrees of Fahrenheit. When the heat
 is regulated to a lower standard, the first moulting takes place on the
 fourth or fifth day after hatching, the second in four days more, the
 third in five or six days more, and the last in about eight days. Ten
 days more are required after this moulting, so that in about thirty-two
                                   Y2

324                         EVERY BOY'S   BOOK.
days after hatching the caterpillar has attained its full size. During
all these changes of the worm they require the nicest attention.
                               TILE COCOON.
   At the end of the time mentioned above, the worms change to a
clear pink or flesh colour, and look semi-transparent ; they refuse their
                    food, become restless, and prepare to spin or form
                    their cocoon.     At this time care should be taken
                    to raise the walls of its tray habitation, or it will
                    climb Over them and be lost.      What is called his
                    cocoon nest should now be prepared by forming a
                    piece of writing-paper by twistmg its corner, and
                    raising its edges mto the form of the lower shell
                     of an oyster.    A number of these should be pre
                     pared  and  affixed  to a piece of tape with their
                     pointed  ends   downwards,    and into each one a
                     single worm should be placed when it quits its
                     food, and seems ready to spin ; it will then dispose
                     its web in such a manner as to leave a cavity
                      within.
   The cocoon consists of three distinct layers of silk ; the first is
loose and flossy, and is unserviceable for the silk manufacture ; the
second is closer, the silk crossing from side to side ; and the third is
still finer, and is glued strongly together so as to form a compact inner
coating.
                               THE ATTRELIA.
                                 When the cocoon is completed, the en
                              closed caterpillar again casts its skin with
                              the head and jaws attached to       it,
                                                                   when  it
                              appears under the form of      conical chry
                                                              a
                              salis of the ordinary shape.     At first tie
                              chrvsalis when opened exhibits only a
                              yellowish fluid, but  bydegrees the various
                              parts of the future moth appear, and in
                              about a  fortnight or three weeks     slight
                                                                     a
                              swelling of me chrysalis indicates the
                              approach of another change;         rupture
                              down its back succeeds, and         by a
                                                                  degrees
                              the moth bursts through its horny coating
                              into the hollow chamber of the cocoon, and
                              would soon eat its way out.
                            WINDING THE SILK.
   But the chrysalis must be prevented from doing this, and" previous
to the egress of the moth from its aurelian state, the silk must be
wound otf. When        by
                        taking up the cocoon         found that the
                                                    it   is

caterpillar has passed into the aurelia or grub state — which may easily
be known bv shaking       in it,
                           as then the aurelia, from its harder texture,
and being shrunken        size, will
be heard to rattle— this         theis
time to wind off the silk.      The
cocoon is  placed in cup of warm
                      a
water after the loose outward
silk has been removed, and then,
an end being taken, the whole
continuous filament maybe wound
off on a  piece of card.   The length of the thread of    acocoon varies
from 600 to 1,000 feet, yet the whole does not weigh more than three
grains and a-half. An ounce of eggs will produce aoout 40,000 cater
pillars, which will consume 1,073 Ib. of leaves, and produce from
about 80 to 100 Ib. of cocoon, or about eight pounds       raw silk.

                                         THE MOTH.
   When the silk  is   wound off, the aurelia presents itself, and being
put   in
       a    case by  itself,   remains motion
                                   it
less for about twenty days, when suddenly
it presents itself in the appearance of     pale a
yellow moth, with wings which seem scarcely
adapted for flight.     It crawls heavily about
the place where  it   has been hatched, having
a sh'ght tremor in its wings, and eats nothing:
the male speedily dies; the females hover
about awhile without flying, and lay their
eggs on the slips of paper presented to them
for that purpose, and then perish. The female moth generally pro
duces about 300 or 400 eggs.
                                   GENERAL    REMARKS.
   The place where silkworms are bred, should persons wish to pursue
their rearing upon larger scale, must be free from noisome smells,
                      a
cattle, and all noises.  Persons attending them must be scrupulously
clean in their persons, and wash themselves after every meal.    Great
attention  must  also be paid to the temperature   of the apartment in
which they are kept, which also must be free from all dust or smoke,
and the most thoughtful and tender care              is
                                                requisite     in
                                                            everything
connected with their treatment and management.

                     GOLD AND SILVER FISH.
   THESE are of the carp family, and have been known in this country
from the year 1691.      They abound in the fresh-water ponds, lakes,
and rivers of China; nor are they, indeed, at the present time, quite
uncommon in our own climate, beingnow naturalised in ponds, and
breeding freely in pure waters.      At Hampton Court are to be seen
some of the finest specimens of the family, originally placed there by
Mr. Jesse, to whom the frequenters of that place of public resort are
so much indebted.       They have increased to several hundreds, and
many of them are of prodigious size and very fat, being to fish what
royal porters are to men.
   The colours of gold-fish are liable to the greatest variation ; some
are nearly all gold, mingled with red ; some are marked with a fine
blue, brown, or bright silver hue ; but the usually predominant colour
is that of a brilliant gold.  As an article of food, they are not used ;
and are only valued for their beauty and gentleness.        It is a curious
fact in the history of the gold-fish, that it will bear without injury the
extremes of heat and cold ; as it will live equally well in a tank, in
a glass vase, and in a pond in the open air.         Instances have been
known of gold-fish having been frozen hard and stiff in the water, but
yet, upon being gradually thawed, become perfectly healthy and well.
   Although many preserves of gold and silver fish exist in this
 country, the supply is principally from Portugal, where they abound.
They are brought over m large numbers about spriug time ; and then
 numerous perambulatory gentlemen, having purchased a few small

                           GOLD AND SILVER      FISH.                   327
 glasses of the most inferior description, and fish at twopence each,
very moderately ask, and often receive, for a couple of fish, glass, and
 water, the sum of five shillings ; but our young friends must beware
 of such persons, for the fish they sell usually die in a few days
 or weeks.
     The silver-fish differs from the gold-fish only in colour, which is
 similar to silver tissue ; it generally has scarlet fins, and is curiously
  narked in different parts of the body. Both varieties are also subject
  ••o variations in the fins, which are occasionally doable ; and specimens
  Lave been seen with triple tails.
                                    GLASSES.
     The glasses, or globes, should be moderately large, with wide
 mouths, and three-fourths filled with water.        For two fish, the globe
 should be at least a foot in diameter ; and for three or four fish, six
 teen inches. They should be kept in a cool place, — never exposed to
 a burning sun, or the heat of a fire.       Too many fish should never be
 crowded into one glass. A few branches of box should be kept in
 the globe, for the fish to rub against, which should be changed once
 a-week.
                                    FEEDING.
      Some persons fancy that gold and silver fish need no food.        It is
 true that they will subsist a long time with nothing but water, when
 it is pure, and frequently changed. They are best pleased with such
jejune diet as bread or biscuit ; but these should be given sparingly,
lest, turning sour, they corrupt the water. They will also feed on the
 aquatic plant called lemna, or duck's-weed, and also on small fry.
 Hawkins, the editor of Walton, says that fine gravel should be
 strewed at the bottom of the vessel that contains the fish ; and he
 directs them to be fed on bread and gcntils, and to have their water
 frequently changed.
                                    DISEASES.
      You can easily tell when a fish is falling off in his health, by
 observing him frequently coming up to the surface of the water for
 air. This shows he has not sufficient power in his gills to extract the
 air from the water. He also looks dull, and his motions are languid ;
 a hazy or cobwebby appearance seems also to envelope his body, and
 perhaps some of the scales will drop off.       When a fish gets into this
 unhealthy state, he should be immediately removed from the others,
 who should have tresh water given them several days in succession.
 The best remedy for diseased fish is to put them into a pond for a few
 weeks ; and it is especially necessary for female fish, wnich, if not so
 treated, frequently die for want of spawning.         A fish is sometimes
 saved by bemg placed in a little artificial dam, made from some run
 ning stream, m a garden for two or three days ; but their diseases
 are at all times very difficult to remedy.         The best is to prevent
 them, by giving the fish plenty of room and pure water.

    As the principal object of this volume is to enable the young
reader to learn something in his sports, and to understand what he is
doing, we shall, before proceeding to the curious tricks and feats
connected with the science of numbers, present him with some arith
metical aphorisms, upon which most of the following examples are
founded.
                         APHORISMS  OT JTUMBER.
    1. If two even numbers be added together, or subtracted from each
other, their sum or difference will be an even number.
    2. If  two uneven numbers be added or subtracted, their sum or
difference will be an even number.
    3. The sum or difference of an even and an uneven number added
or subtracted, will be an uneven number.
    4. The product of two even numbers will be an even number, and
the product of two uneven numbers will be an uneven number.
    5. The product of an even and uneven number will be an even
number.
    6. If two  different numbers be divisible by any one number, their
sum and their difference will also be divisible by that number.

 332                       EVEBY BOY    S BOOK.
    7. If  several different numbers, divisible by 3, be added or multi
plied together, their sum and their product will also be divisible by 3.
    8. If  two numbers divisible by 9 be added together, the sum of
the figures in the amount will be either 9, or a number divisible
by 9.
    9. If  any number be multiplied by 9, or by any other number
divisible by 9, the amount of the figures of the product will be either
9, or a number divisible by 9.
    10. In every arithmetical progression, if the first and last term be
each multiplied by the number of terms, and the sum of the two pro
ducts be divided by 2, the quotient will be the sum of the series.
                    12345
    11. In every geometric progression, if any two terms be multiplied
together, their product will be equal to that term, which answers to
the sum of these two indices.      Thus, in the series, —
                    2        4        8       16       32
   If  the third and fourth terms 8 and 16 be multiplied together, the
product 128 will be the seventh term of the series.       In lite manner,
if the fifth term be multiplied into itself, the product will be the tenth
term, and if that sum be multiplied into itself, the product will be the
twentieth term.      Therefore, to find the last, or any pther term of a
geometric series, it is not necessary to continue the series beyond
a few of the first terms.
   Previous to the numerical recreations, we shall here describe
certain mechanical methods of performing arithmetical calculations,
such as are not only in themselves entertaining, but will be found
more or less useful to the young reader.
                               IB!   ABACUS.
                                     This instrument is used for teaching
                                  numeration and the first principles of
                                  Arithmetic.
                                     Upon a frame are placed wires,
                                  parallel to one another, and at equal
                                  distances.    Ten small balls are strung
                                  upon each wire. Being placed as in
                                  the margin, the right wire denotes
                                  units, the next tens, and so on, the 7th
                                  wire being the place of millions.      In
                                  using the abacus, all the balls are first
                                  ranged at one end, and a number of
                                  them are then moved to the other end
                                  of each wire, to correspond to the
                                  figures required.    The example given
                       a r        in the margin is 15,781, the height
                                  of Mont Blanc.

                          PALPABLE     ARITHMETIC.
    The blind mathematician, Dr. Saunderson, adopted a very ingenious
device for performing arithmetical operations by the sense of touch. .
    Small cubes of wood were provided, and in one face of each, 9 holes
were pierced, thus : —
                    123
                                              OOO

                                              O     O     O
These holes represented the 9 digits as in the figure, and to denote any
figure, a small peg was inserted into the hole corresponding to it.
If  the number consisted of several figures, more cubes were used,
one for each.    A cipher was represented by a peg of different shape
from that of the others, and inserted in the central hole.
   To perform any arithmetical process, a square board was provided,
divided by ridges into recesses of the same width as the cubes, and
by this the cubes were retained in the required horizontal and per
pendicular lines. Suppose it was necessary to add together the
numbers 763, 124, 859, the cubes and pegs would be arranged thus :

    The object of this contrivance is to render arithmetical multipli
cation more easy, and to secure its correctness; it was much used oy
astronomers before the invention of logarithms.
    To appreciate the merits of this invention, we must consider the
process of multiplication as usually performed.            Suppose we had to
multiply 8,679 by 8:—                          8,679
                                                     8
                                             69,432
 we first multiply 9 by 8=72, and putting down 2 as the first figure
 in the product, carry the 7 to add to the next product of 7 by 8 = 56 ;
 this gives us 63, the 3 being put down as the second figure ; 6 is
 carried to add to the product of G by 8, and so on.

  A blunder    may be made in each part of this process ; for 1st,
we might reckon 8 times 9 as some other number than 72; 3d,
                            after multiplying the 7 by the 8 we might
                            add to the resulting 56 some other figure
                            than the 7, which we carried ; 3d, we may
     1 8
                            add 56 to 7 inaccurately, making some
                            other sum of it than the right one, 63.
                            Errors in a long multiplication problem are
                            usually made m one of these three ways,
                            and to prevent such errors Lord Napier1
                            introduced this useful contrivance.      Thin
                            strips of card, wood, or bone, 9 times as
                            long as they are broad, are each divided
                            into 9 equal squares, a figure is printed or
                            written on the top square, and m each of
                            the squares underneath is the product of
     8 H%M^                 multiplying that figure by 2, 3, 4, &c. up
                            to 9.

                   &i/
                 J1LJ       strips, the top figures of which make the
                            number to be multiplied. For example : —
   To multiply 8,679 by 8, look to the eighth line of squares from the
top, and on that line will be found the product of each of the
integers 8,679 when multiplied by 8.       We have then to write down
the 2 as the first figure of the product, add 7 and 6 together = 13 ;
write 3 as the next figure, carry 1 to add to the sum of 8 and 5,
and so on.
   The reason for dividing the figures in each square by a diagonal
line, and for placing the left-hand figure higher than the right                     is,
that the eye may be thus assisted in adding the carried figure of
one slip to the unit of the next.
   To provide for the occurrence of more than one of the same figure
in the multiplicand, there should be several slips or rods for each of
the digits.
   In practice the rods are placed on flat piece of wood, with two
                                               a
ridges at right angles,         which they are preserved in
                               by                                  proper   a
position.
   This instrument can be made useful in " division,"       making byby
means of it  atable of the product of the divisor, multiplied    each           by
of the numbers    1to    9.

  can divine a number    thought of by another.   You throw forwards
 the number by means      of addition and multiplication, and then, by
 subtraction and division, you bring it back to the original starting

 superficial notice of the tyro.

            5. The sum  of the 1st and last                 20
    You must then add together the 1st, 3d and 5th sums, viz., 10 +
 24 + 20 = 54, and the 2d and 4th, 15 + 31 = 46; take one from the
 other, leaving 8. The half of this is the 1st number, 4; if you take
 this from the sum of the 1st and 2d you will have the 2d number, 6;
this taken from the sum of the 2d and 3d will give you the 3d, 9 ;

other, leaving 12; the 2d numbe- will be 6, the half of this; take
the 2d from the sum of the 1st and 2d and you will get the 1st; take

              HOW MANY   COUNTERS HAVE      I  IN MY HANDS?
    A  person having an equal number of counters in each hand, it is
required to find how many he has altogether.
    Suppose he has 16 counters, or 8 m each hand.         Desire him to
transfer from one hand to the other a certain number of them, and
to tell you the number so transferred.       Suppose it be 4, the hands
now contain 4 and 12. Ask him how many times the smaller number
is contained in the larger ; in this case it is 3 times. You must then
multiply the number transferred, 4, by the 3, making 12, and add the
4, makmg 16; then divide 16 by the 3 minus 1; this will bring 8, the
number in each hand.

   In most cases fractions will occur in the process: when 10
counters arc in each hand and if 4 be transferred, the hands will
contain 6 and 14.
   He will divide 14 by 6 and inform .you that the quotient is 2}
or 2£.
   Yon multiply 4 by " 1 which is 9^.
   Add 4 to this, making 13^ equal to V-
   Subtract 1 from 2^, leaving l£ or £.
  Divide      y
             by J, giving 10, the number in each hand.

                          WHO WEABS THE RING?
   This is an elegant application of the principles involved in dis
covering a number fixed upon.          The number of persons participating
in the game should not exceed 9. One of them puts a ring on one
of his lmgers, and it is your object to discover— 1st. The wearer of
the ring. 2d. The hand.         3d. The finger.        4th. The joint.
   The company being seated in order, the persons must be numbered
1, 2, 3, &c.; the thumb must be termed the 1st finger, the forefinger
 being the 2d ; the joint nearest the extremity must be called the 1st
joint ; the right hand is 1, and the left hand 2.
    These prelnninaries having beea arranged, leave the room in order
that the ring may be placed unobserved by you.                We will suppose
that the 3d person has the ring on the right hand, 3d finger, and
1st joint ; your object is to discover the figures 3131.

                      COMBINATIONS     AND PERMUTATIONS.
    " Combinations "      are the different ways in which a certain number
of things can     be selected   out of a larger number, when taken 1 at a
time, 2 at a time,     or any other number each time, but without regard
to the order in which the selected numbers can be arranged among
themselves.       The latter is the province of
                                                     " Permutations," which
refers to the different ways in which a number can be selected out of
one that is larger, and, in addition to this, to the different ways of
grouping these selected numbers.
    Thus 4 things can be taken 2 at a time in 6 different ways ; for
instance, the letters a, b, c, d, can be taken 2 at a tune, thus, a and b,
a and c, a and d, b and c, b and d, c and d ; if we regard the order of
the selected letters we shall find that these 4 letters are capable of 12
different permutations, as ab, ba, ac, ca, ad, da, be, cb, bd, db, cd, dc.
    If we selected 3 letters at a time we could make 4 different selec
tions, and 24 different changes of grouping.
    The rule to compute the number of these different ways is very
simple, but sometimes involves a multitude of figures.
                   THE VISITORS     TO THE CRYSTAL     PALACE.
    In  a family consisting    of 8  young people, it was agreed that 3 at a
time should visit the Crystal Palace, and that the visit should be re
peated each day as long as a different trio could be selected. In how
many days were the possible combinations of 3 out of 8 completed ?
    We must multiply 8x7x6, and also 3x2x1, and divide the pro
duct of the former, 336, by the product of the latter, 6; the result is
 56, the number of visits, a different three going each time. So much
gratified were they with the results of their agreement, that they
wished to be allowed another series of visits, to be continued as many
days as they could group 3 together in different order when starting.
If  Paterfamilias haa granted such permission he would have had to
                                                                      " new

                                   OUT OF 52?
    To discover this we must make a continued multiplication of
 52 x 51 x 50 x 49 x 48 x 47 x 46 x 45 x 44 x 43 x 42 x 41 x.40, being 13
 terms     for the 13 cards, also a continued multiplication              of
 13x12x11x10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1, and, having found
 the two products, we must divide one by the other, and the quotient
 is the number of different deals out of 52 cards.         This "sum," that

each time.

    This peculiar series of numbers is thus formed : — Write down the
 numbers 1, 2, 3, &c., as far as you please, in a vertical row.    On the
 right hand of 2 place 1,   add  them  together, and  place 3 under the 1 ;
                       =
 then 3 added to 3 6, which place under the 3; 4 and 6 are 10,
 which place under the 6, and so on as far as you wish. This is the
 second vertical row, and the third is formed from the second in a
  similar way.
     This triangle has the property of informing us, without the trouble
 of calculation, how many combinations can be made, taking any
 number at a time out of a larger number.
     Suppose the question were that just given ; how many selections
 can be made of 3 at a time out of 8 ? On the horizontal row com
 mencing with 8, look for the third number; this is 56, which is the
 answer.

 tributed between three persons, you are to tell which article or card
 each person has.
     Designate the three persons in your own mind, as 1st, 2d, and 3d,
 and the three articles, A, E, I. Provide 24 counters, and give 1 to
 the 1st person, 2 to the 2d, 3 to the 3d. Place the remainmg 18 on
 the table. Request that the three persons will distribute among
 themselves the three articles, and that, having done so, the person

  342                       EVERY    BOY'S  BOOK.
  who has the one which you have secretly denoted by A, will take as
 many counters as he may have already; the holder of r. must take
 twice as many as he may nave; and the holder of I mnst take four
 times as many.      Then leave the room, in order that the distribution
 of articles auil of counters may be made unobserved by you. We will
 suppose that the three articles are three cards, on which are the words
 Clara, Rosa, Emily, which you will yourself secretly denote by the
 letters A, B, I. Suppose also that in the division the 1st person haa
 Emily (i), the 2d has Clara (A), and the third has Rosa (E), then the
 1st will take four times as many counters as he has (1), and will there
 fore take 4; the 2d will take as many as he has (2), and will therefore
 take 2; the 3d will take' 6, being twice as many as he has (3).
 On the table will be left 6 counters.      The distribution having been
 made, you will return and observe the number of counters on the
 table, from which you can find who is the holder of each card by the
 following method.
    It is plain that if the cards held by the 1st and 2d can be told,
 that held by the 3d will be known. It will be found that only six
 numbers can remain, viz. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7; never 4, and never more
                 1234
 than 7. Now the six combinations of a, e, and i, here given, represent
                                                  16
 the articles held by the 1st and 2d persons.
                                                5               7
                ae      ea      ai    —        ei     ia        ie
    In the case supposed, 6 counters being on the table, the combina
 tion ia indicates that the 1st person has the card yon have called I
 (Emily), the 2d has A (Clara), so that the 3d has E (Rosa).
    In order to recollect the combinations of A, E, and I, it will be best
to keep in memory some 7 words which form a sentence, and which
                    234567
contain these vowels in the order just given.
    Our young friends can amuse themselves in forming a sentence for
themselves, but as examples we supply three.

                         THE TRIPARTITE     DIVISION.
    Three things having been divided between three persons, you are
to determine the holder of each.

                                    ARITHMETIC.                            343
    Call the persons in your own mind 1st, 2d, 3d.
    Give to the 1st a card on which you have written the number
 12; to the 2d the number 24; to the 3d, 36.
    The three things you must denote as A, E, I.
    To simplify it you may have three cards with a name upon each, of
 which the initial letters are A, E, I, as Anna, Emma, Isabel.
    Request your friends to divide between them the three articles, and
 then to add together certain parts of the numbers on their cards, as
 follows : —
    Whoever has A must supply one half of the number on his card.
            „       E         „         one third            „           „
            „       i         „         one  fourth          „           „
    This half, third, and fourth having been added together, the sum
 must be announced to you on your return ; and from this number you
 can tell who has A, who has E, and who has I.
    The sum which will be given to^ou can be one of six only. There
 are only six ways in which the articles can be divided, and there is a
definite number for each of them.
               If the No. is    the lit hat   the 2d has the 3d has
                     23               A            £           I

                      25              E            A           I
                     27               I            A           E
                     28               E            I           A
                     29               I            E           A
    The number 26 can never occur, and to recollect the six which do
occur, and which you perceive are consecutive, you need take note
only of what the 1st and 2d persons have.
              23        24        25       26       27    28       29

    If you make    up   a  line of  good (or bad) English, having the vowels
in   the order here given, you will find it will aid you in their recollec
tion.    We give one as a specimen          :
            ae         ai          ea         —      ia     ei        ie
           Brave dashing England, like a giant revives itself.
                                   THE TEN TENS.
     Take ten pieces of card, and upon each write any ten words ; there
is no restriction    as to the initial letter of nine of the words, but the
last word on each card must commence with certain letters which you
must in your own mind associate with the numbers 1 to 10, so that
by knowmg the initial letter of the last word on each card, you can
determine its number.
     Here are ten cards (call these the Selecting Cards) which we give
by way of example, though our readers will perhaps prefer having
words of their own selection.

    For the success of the game, the key words and the numbers denoted
by their letters must be carefully concealed.
    Take ten other cards, which call the
                                              " Grouped Cards," and
                                                                       upon
one write down the first word from each of the selecting cards, bemg
careful to write them in the same order.         Let another card contain
all the words which are     second   from   the top, and so on till all the
words have been grouped together. As an example, we give the 1st
and 4th grouped cards.

    The object of the game is to guess which of the words from any of
 the selecting cards any person may have fixed upon.
    Let any one choose a card out of the selecting cardt, and after he
 has fixed upon a word, give it back to you ; when receiving       care                        it,

                                                   ;
you then give him all the grouped cards, and request him to show you
the card which contains the word he fixed upon.
    You can then announce the word for the number of the word
                                                        ;

Selecting Card from which he made his choice.
    Suppose he made his choice from the card which has Theodore for
its last word, — this     No.
                          is     when he shows you the Grouped Card,
                                      4 ;
which he says contains the selected word, you will know that Ralph,

  A   sharp youth, fresh from school, having gone to visit           good-                 a

apples, was  about   to take the 15 oranges     but this monopoly ol the

the fruit in     circle, and to take every ninth. The clever fellow

   During the siege of Sevastopol, when the troops were on "short
allowance," a can of 8 pints of porter was ordered to be equally
divided between two messes ; but having only a 5-pint can and one
which held 3 pints, it was found impossible to make this division, till
one of the clever Sappers suggested the following method ; and, to
understand     we will put down the contents of each of the three cans

   A  certain hotel-keeper was dexterous in contrivances to produce a
large appearance with small means.             In the dining-room were three
tables, between which he could divide 21 bottles, of which 7 only
were full, 7 half full, and 7 apparently just emptied, and in such a
manner that each table had the same number of bottles, and the
same quantity of wine.          He did this in two ways : —

   Desire a person to think of one of the numbers, and to tell you
in which row it is. Suppose he ikes on 6 ; he will tell you that 'the
row A contains the number he thought of.
   Take up the row A, and arrange the numbers on each side of the
row B, as shown at C D, so that the first number of the row A may
be the first of the row 0, the second of A be the first of D, the
third of A be the second of C, and so on.
   Ask in which of the rows, C or D, is the number thought of : in
the case supposed it is in D.
   Take up the rows C D, and put one underneath the other, as at
M, taking care that the half-row in which is the number thought of,
shall be above the other.
   Divide it again into two rows, as at E F, on each side of B, in the
same way as before.      Ask again in which row it is : it is now in E.
   Place one row under the other, as at N, and divide again into two
rows, which will now be as G H.
   You will be informed that the number is in row H, and you may
then announce it to be the top number of that row.
   The number thought of wifl always be at the top of one of the rowt

   The name      Magic Square is given to    a square divided into several
smaller squares, in which numbers are placed in such a manner that
every column of numbers, whether vertical, horizontal, or from corner
to corner, shall amount to the same sum.
   They are divided into three principal classes : — 1st, Those which
have an odd number of squares m each band ; 2d, Those which have
an even number of squares in each band, this even number being
divisible eiactly by 4 ; 3d, Where the even number of squares in
""
      band cannot be divided by 4 without a fraction.

   Squares of this kind are formed thus. Imagine an exterior line of
squares   above the magic square you wish to form, and another ex
terior line on the right hand of it. These two imaginary lines are
shown in the figure.

   Then attend to the two following rules : —
   1st. In placing the numbers m the squares we must go in an
ascending oolique direction from left to right ; any number which,
by pursumg this direction, would fall into the exterior line, must be
carried along that line of squares, whether vertical or horizontal, to
the last square.      Thus, 1 having been placed in the centre of the
top line, 2 would fall into the exterior square above the fourth ver
tical line ; it must be therefore carried down to the lowest square of
that line; then, ascending obliquely, 3 falls into the square, but 4
falls out of  it,  to the end of   a  horizontal line, and itmust be carried
along that line to the extreme left, and there placed.         Resuming our
oblique ascension to the right, we place         5, where the reader sees             it,
and would place     G   in the middle of the top band, but finding     occu    it
pied  by 1,  we   look   for direction to the
   2d Rule, which prescribes that, when in ascending obliquely, we
come to  a   square already occupied, we must place the number, which
according   to  the first rule shouldgo into that occupied square, directly
under the last number placed. Thus,        in   ascending with       4,the5,   6,     6

350                      EVERY   BOY S BOOK.
must be placed directly under the 5, because the square next to 5 in
an oblique direction is
                        " engaged."
   Magic squares of this class, however large in the number of
compartments,    can be easily filled up by attending to these two
rules.

   There are various other kinds of magic squares   ; but explanations
of them would be too lengthy for our work.
   The invention of these contrivances has been traced back to the
early ages of science, and talismanic properties were attributed to
them.    Modern philosophers have amused themselves in bringing
them to perfection, and none has contributed so much as "the model
of practical wisdom," Dr. Franklin.
                       THE SQUARE      OF GOTHAM.
   The wise men of Gotham, famous for their eccentric blunders,
once undertook the management of a school ; they arranged their
establishment in the form of a square divided into 9 rooms.        The
playground occupied the centre, and 24 scholars the rooms around

      3             in
                 each.  In spite of the strictness of discipline, was                    it
 suspectea that the boys were in the habit of playing truant, and                              it
was determined to set      strict watch. To assure themselves that all
                                  a
the boys were on the premises, they visited the rooms, and found                                3
in each, or in each row. Four boys then went out, and the wise
                    9
men soon after visited the rooms, and finding           each row, thought
                                                                 9   in
all was right. The          boys then came back, accompanied
                                  4                                                       by   4
strangers; and the Gothamites, on their third round, finding still
9  in each row, entertained no suspicion of what had taken place.
Then      more "chums" were admitted; but the clever men, on
          4
examining the establishment       fourth time, still found
                                            a                 in each row,    9
and so came to an opinion that their previous suspicions had been
                                                      *
unfounded.     How was all this possible
   The following figures represent the contents of each room at the
four different visits the first, at the commencement of the watch the
                             :                                                           ;

                         4         the third, when these
                                            ;                 accompanied     4,
by another      had returned
                    4,          and the fourth, when
                                        ;                 more had joined 4
them.

  On each change the boys arranged themselves in the rooms in such
a manner that, when the corner rooms were counted as    part of two            a
rows, each entire row of three rooms contained the same number of
boys.  The illusion of the wise men was due to their mistake in
counting each corner room twice.
                             MULTIPLYING MONEY BY MONEY.
  Amongst the various questions that are given for the purpose of
puzzling the unwary arithmetician, the multiplication of money                                 by
money is one of the most curious take for mstance the following

To the uninitiated they usually appear easy of solution, but the
various modes of working them out, and the diiferent results obtained,
prove that there      something absurd and wrong in the questions
                             is
themselves.    Some reduce all to farthings, and after multiplying one
term      by
          the other, return the product into pounds, shillings, and
pence.   Others convert them into decimals; whilst some work the
problem     the style of duodecimals.

   Having sufficiently puzzled the tyros, the querist remarks :
                                                                  — " The
problem itself is absurd, it is incap'able of solution ; for what is the
nature of the product of pounds, shillings, and pence multiplied
by pounds, shillmgs, and pence ? We know that a yard multipliea by
a yard is a square yard, but who can tell what is a penny multipliea
by a penny, or a penny by a pound?"
   Now all this is quite correct, provided the question is limited, as
above, to the product of pounds, shillings, ana pence, into pounds,
shillings, and pence; but suppose the problem were put in this
form, — If  a capital of £1 produces by compound interest, in a certain
time, £99 19*. lljrf., how much would be produced by a capital of
£99 19*. llfrf.? It is evident that, to answer this, we must multiply
£99 19*. llfrf. by £99 19*. Hid. : these are in fact the second and
third terms of an ordinary "rule of three ;" and though one of the
terms is a
            " concrete " quantity of pounds,
                                "               shillings, and pence, the
other  must  be regarded  as an   abstract" mathematical   quantity, being
99 and a fraction, of which the number of farthings in a pound is the
denominator, 960, and the number of farthings in the thirtt term is the
numerator, 959 ; or, instead of this, the shillmgs and pence might be
converted into decimals of a pound, or into aliquot parts. The product
of multiplying £99 19*. lljrf. by 99|« is £9,999 15*. 10,^*. ;
the quickest way of doing this, is to multiply by 100, and to subtract
from the product the 960th part of the multiplicand.
   In the other question proposed, the product of £11 111. llrf. into
£11 11*. llrf., or 114IJ, is £134 9*.
                               A MILLION.
   Few persons think of the magnitude of this number.        To count
a million would take nearly a month. A million sovereigns laid down,
edge to edge, would extend to a distance of fourteen nules. A million
pounds per year is £2,739 14*. 6rf. per day, £114 3*. Irf. per hour,
and 74<£ for every second of time, night and day. Multiply a million
by 800, and we have the amount of the national debt.        This vast
sum would take a person fifty-one years to count    it,counting 3,600
                                                      if
per hour for twelve hours each day. Reckoning each sovereign to
be seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, the 800 millions,   hud edge
                                                             if
to edge, would reach 11,047 miles.     The penny-pieces forming this
sum would reach 4,545,454 miles, or 180 tunes round the world.

                       " Let young beginners come and try
                         Their hands at our geometry."
    THE word Geometry is derived from the Greek, and signifies the art
 of measuring land. The invention of it is ascribed by some to the
 Chaldeans and Babylonians, by others to the Egyptians, who were
 obliged to determine the boundaries of their fields after the inunda
 tion of the Nile, by geometrical measurements.             According to Cas-
 siodorus, the Egyptians either derived the art from the Babylonians,
 or invented it after it was known to them.          Thales, a Phoenician, who
 died 548 years B. c., and Pythagoras of Samos, who flourished about
 620 B.C., introduced it from Egypt into Greece.                 In elementary
 geometry, Euclid    of  Alexandria,    as  everybody   knows,   is particularly
 distinguished. Archimedes measured the sphere, and after him other
 philosophers prosecuted the science witb the utmost assiduity. In
 Italy, where the sciences first revived after the dark ages, several
 mathematicians were distinguished in the 16th century. The French,
 and after them the Germans, followed; while in England Hook,
 Newton, and others, carried tne science to the highest pitch of use
 fulness, and through its aid made the most prodigious discoveries.
 It is not, however, our province to enter into a long disquisition on
 the subject, but simply to set before the young reader some of the
 more curious properties of the science, that he may be excited to
 study it for himself; and we will promise him that should he devote
 his mind to its study, he will be amply repaid for any amount of
 labour he may bestow upon it.
                         GEOMETBJCAL       DEFINITIONS.
    In  geometry a point is said to have neither breadth, length, nor
 thickness.   A line is the distance between two points ; parallel lines
 always keep at the same distance from each other.             A right line is
 what is commonly called a straight line. A curve is a line which con
 tinually changes its direction. An angle is the inclination or opening
 of two lines meeting in a point. k. figure is a bounded space, and is
 either a superficies or a solid. A triangle is a figure with three, sides
 and three angles. A square has four equal sides, and four right
angles.    A circle is a plane figure bounded by a curved line runnmg
into itself. Its diameter is a straight line drawn from one extremity
of its circumference to the other, and its centre is equally distant
from every part of the circumference.          A solid is any body which has
length, breadth,    and  thickness ;  and   a sphere is a sofid, terminated by

Take a piece of pasteboard, an inch and a-hali in width, and five
inches in length, and divide it by inked lines into thirty squares, then
cut it from corner to corner, so as to form two triangles.           After this
cut off the top of these triangles at c and       D,1 and arrange the pieces in
this manner : —

                                A   carpenter having a piece of mahogany
                             of a triangular form, (see Fig.) wished to
                             know howlie could make it up to the best
                             advantage.  His first idea was to make an
                          oblong square table of            it,
                                                      but he found that
                           ifhe did so the waste of the wood would be
                          very great. After consideration he discovered
                          that the most economical method of using
                          the wood would be to form         into an oval.
                                                                    it

                     THE BRICKLAYER PUZZLED.
    A
    bricklayer had to construct   wall, whose length in the direction
                                     a
ABC was twenty-four feet. The one half of this wall, namely from
Bto    had to be built over
        c,                   piece of rising ground, so that the base
                                a
                             Ky.l.
of this part of the wall would necessarily be more than twelve feet.
In makmg out his account he charged more for this half of the wall
than for that which was built on level ground from A to B.                               A
geometrician assured him that the square contents of both portions
of the wall were exactly alike which may be proved
                                ;                    the following in

represent the two straight parts of the wall; lay the piece represent
ing the straight wall on the curved piece,
and it will be found that the angles which
project at A and B will exactly fill up the
spaces at E and p.    The piece of board
representing the straight wall may thus
be found to be exactly sufficient to form
a piece equal to that representing the
curved wall. You may then lay the curved piece upon the straight
one, and reversing the experiment prove that the curved piece is
capable of forming a rectangular piece equal to the other.

these triangles with the prismatic
colours, reo!, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, violet, and let the eighth
be white. To find how many chequers
or regular four-sided figures, differ
ent either in form or colour, may be
made out of these eight triangles    :
   First, by   combinmg two of these
triangles there may be formed, either
the triangular square A, or the in
clined square B, called        a Rhomb.
Secondly,     by combining four of the
triangles the large square      o may be
formed, or the long square D, called
a  parallelogram. Now the first two squares, consisting of two parts
out of eight, may each of them             by
                                          the eighth rank of the triangle

the last two squares, consisting of four parts, may each       Be  taken by
the same rank of the triangle seventy times, which makes 140.

there are many persons who fancy this can be accomplished, as there
are also many who believe that they can discover "perpetual motion."

effect this object.      The Cardinal de Cusa rolled           cylinder over a

                              by
it again     and then,
             ;                atrain of reasoning very unmathematieal, he
endeavoured to determine the length of the line thus described.
Oliver de Serras worked            circle, and also
                                       a                 triangle equal to an

equilateral triangle, inscribed withm the circle, and imagined that the
former was exactly equal to two of the latter, forgetting that the
double of this triangle          equal to the hexagon inscribed within the
                                  is
circle, and therefore smaller than the circle itself.               Frenchman

challenged the world, and deposited 10,000 livres as stake, that he      a
               could accomplish the feat. He reduced the problem to the
               mechanical process of dividing           circle into quadrants,

               to form     square, which he asserted to be equal to the
                              a
               circle this nowever was soon proved to be ridiculous.
                         :
    Some persons have taken          piece of pasteboard, and cutting        out        it
                                         by a

         a                          cutting that circular disc into pieces of
a  square form and definite dimensions, and fitting the same turned
pieces one into the other, have come near to              notion of the super

demonstration according to mathematics.             For     we take the pieces

them with        microscope, we shall soon find that none of them are

the conclusion arrived at           false one.

   The early mathematicians, in their attempts to solve this problem,
generally proceeded           on the following plfin.             If   we draw     a    square
exterior to circle, that
                 a                 is,
                          touching the square in four points, each
side of the square being equal to the diameter of the circle, we can
soon convince ourselves that the
                                   boundary of the square will be
                                                                                             i

greater than the circumference of the circle, and the area of the former
greater than that of the latter.      But if the square be drawn within
the circle, so that only the four corners touch           then  it,    equally
                                                                           it   is
evident that the circle     larger, both
                                      is  in  boundary   and   area,  than  the
square.   By  this proceeding,  we  arrive  at  the conclusion   that    circle  a
is smaller than    square external to
                       a                         it,
                                           and larger than one internal to
it. Let us next suppose that we draw regular pentagon, that
                                                                                          is,

figure of five equal sides, exterior to the circle, and touching             on       it
five points; then         evident that as the circle
                            it   is                        wholly
                                                                is   contained
withm the pentagon,        must be smaller than that which contains it.

   Now      geometry, my young readers must bear in mind, the exact
              in
periphery or circumference, and the exact area of any figure bounded
by straight lines, may be determined with rigorous accuracy; and                           if
we draw two polygons — say of one hundred sides, one within and
one without the circle — we can ascertain the exact area of those
polygons, and affirm that the area of       circlea  greater than
                                                           is           certain a
amount, and less than another certain amount.         These two amounts,
if the number of the sides of the polygon be so large as we here
suppose, may be so very nearly alike, that either one will give the
area of the circle with great closeness.
   By some such means as these Archimedes found that                 the             if
diameter of    circle be called
                   a               then the circumference will be nearly
                                            7,
22   ;and that     the square of the diameter be 14, then the area of
                       if
the circle will be equal to about 11         but this computation was
                                                       ;
slightly in error, and gave     to  the area  of the circle too great
               by
             about one three-thousandth part of the whole.         At                      a a
measure
later period, however,       European mathematician, named Metius,
                                      a
discovered   method which makes an extraordinary approach to accu
               is a
racy, and   at the same time easily remembered.  He found that                             if
the diameter be considered equal to 113, then   the circumference
would equal 355; or         we multiply the square of the radius
                                       if

360                        EVERY    BOY'S   BOOK.
by 355, and divide it by 113, the area will be given. Now this
method is so very nearly correct, that the area of a circle one foot in
diameter is given within the fifty-thousandth part of a square inch.
   Other mathematicians have carried the approximation still further.
Ludolph van Ceulen worked it out to 36 places of figures, showing
that if the diameter be 1, the circumference will be
          3.14,159,265,358,979,323,846,264,338,327,950,288,
or that if the last figure be 8, the result will be a little below the
truth, and if 9, a little above it.
   Since this, Mr. Sharp, an English mathematician, carried the ap
proximation to 72 places of figures ; Mr. John Machin to 100 figures,
and eclipsed all others.    M. de Lagny worked it out to 128 places of
figures, and of the degree of nearness to which this computation
brings the proportion, Montucla says,
                                             " If we suppose a circle, the
diameter of which is a thousand million times greater than the dis
tance between the sun and the earth, the error in the proportion of
the circumference would be a thousand million times less than the
thickness of a hair."
   But after all, none of these computations are quite correct; they all
deviate from the truth, and bring us to the conclusion that there are
no numbers or collection of numbers which will give the exact ratio
of the circumference, or of the area of a circle to its diameter.      We
offer this explanation on the subject to our young friends that they
may not be puzzled by the question ; and that should they be asked
to square the circle, or hear any one assert that he can d"o so, thev

                            CHEMISTRY.
  CHEMISTRY, of which     I propose  to give a very short account, is one
of the most comprehensive of all sciences, and at the same time
one which comes home to us in the most ordinary of our daily avo
cations. From the terrific phenomenon of the volcano or thunder
storm, to the making of a cup of tea, we find chemical action con-
rerned ; indeed, most of the arts of life are indebted to it for their
very existence, and nearly all have been, from time to time, improved
by the application of its principles.
   Chenustry   is,in fact, the science which treats of the composition
of  all material bodies,  of the laws  by  which they are governed, and
of the means of forming them into new combinations, and reducing
them to their ultimate elements, as they are termed, that       is,bodies
which no power can split up, as  it  were, or separate into other bodies.
To take common substance as an illustration water,
         a                                          ;          by a great
number of processes, can be separated into two other substances,
called oxygen and hydrogen, in the proportion       by weight of    8parts
of the first to  1  of the second but no power that we at present
                                  ;
possess can separate the oxygen and hydrogen into any other bodies      ;
they are therefore called ultnnate elements, or undecomposable bodies.
   Again, sulphate of magnesia (common Epsom salts) can be very

    easily separated into two other substances, — sulphuric acid and mag
    nesia ; and in this instance, both these substances can again be sub
    divided — the acid into sulphur and oxygen, and the magnesia into a
    metallic body called magnesium and oxygen; but sulphur, oxygen,
    and magnesium are incapable of further division, and are therefore
    called ultimate ekments.
       These ultimate elements amount to about 68 in number, according
   to the present state of our knowledge, and may be arranged in
   various ways ; the simplest plan, perhaps, is dividing them into Non-
   metallic and Metallic elements.
       The Non-metallic elements are: — 1. Oxygen.            2. Hydrogen.
   3. Nitrogen.     4. Carbon.     5. Boron.    6. Sulphur.     7. Selenium.
    8. Phosphorus.    9. Chlorine.    10. Bromine.   11. Iodine.   12. Fluo
   rine.
       The Metallic elements may be sub-divided into the metallic bases
   of the alkalies, the metallic bases of the earths, and the metals
   proper.
       1st. The metallic bases of the alkalies : — potassium, sodium,
   lithium, ammonium.
       2d. The metallic bases of the earths : — calcium, magnesium,
   barium, strontium, aluminum, thorinum, glucinum, yttrium, zirco
   nium, silicon.
       3d. The metals proper, the most important of which are : — pla
  tinum, gold, silver, mercury, copper, iron, tin, lead, nickel, zmc,
  bismuth, antimony, manganese, cooalt, arsenic.
      Now, from these elementary bodies, united together in various
  proportions, is formed the infinite variety of substances around us,
  whether animal, vegetable, or mineral ; in fact, a few only are gene
  rally employed; — in the case of animals and vegetables, oxygen,
  hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, with occasionally some sulphur, calcium,
  phosphorus, and silicon, suffice for building up the beautiful forms
  of animated nature ; while the fabric of our globe itself consists for
  the most part of the earths, — silex, i.e. flint or crystal ; lime, in the
  shape of chalk, marble, or limestone, such as our flagstones are com
  posed of; slate and granite, which are compounds of aluminum.
  silica, and small quantities of oxide of iron, and sometimes a little
  potash, &c. ; and through their masses are projected irregular streams,
  veins as they are termed, of the metals, either in a pure state, as
 is the case sometimes with gold, silver, platinum, mercury, and per
 haps one or two others; or combined with one of the non-metallic
 elements, or with one another.
      All these combinations are effected by certain powers, termed
forces; those which cause the union of the elements are called the
 forces of attraction ; those causing their separation, the forces of
 repulsion.
      The force of attraction when exerted between masses of matter,
 is termed gravitation; when it unites particles of matter of a similar

                                 CHEMISTRY.                             3G3
kind and produces masses, it is called the attraction of cohesion;
when the particles united are of a dissimilar character, it is then termed
chemical or elective affinity. For example, the crystals of Epsom salts
are formed from minute particles of the salt, united into a larger
or smaller mass by the attraction of cohesion, while the elements of
which each particle consists, namely, the sulphur, oxygen, and mag
nesium, are united by the attraction of chenucal affinity.
   Cohesion thus unites particles of a similar kind; chemical affinity, of
a dissimilar nature.       It is to cohesion that the existence of masses
of matter is owing, and its power increases as the squares of the
distances diminish, in an inverse ratio to the squares of the dis
tances of the particles on which it acts.
   The power exerted by cohesion may be exhibited in various ways.
This is one: Procure two discs of glass about three inches in diameter,
their surfaces being ground extremely smooth ; fix each into a square
piece of wood, takmg care that they are placed accurately in the
centre ; then put them together, by sliding their edges very carefully
over each other, so as to avoid any air getting between them, and
you will find a great force necessary to separate them.             A hook
should    be fixed  into  the  centre of each piece  of wood,  so that  they
may be suspended, and a weight hung to the lower one. It is almost
impossible for any one to separate them by merely pulling them with
both hands, a weight of many pounds is required for that purpose.
    Chemical affinity is sometimes called elective, or the effect of
choice, as if one substance exerted a kind of preference for another,
 and chose to be united to it rather than to thai with which it was
 previously combined; thus, if you pour some vinegar, which is a
 weak acetic acid, upon some pearlash, (a combination of potash and
 carbonic acid,) or some carbonate of soda, (a combination of the same
 acid with soda,) a violent effervescence will take place, occasioned by
 the escape of the carbonic acid, displaced in consequence of the
 potash or soda preferring the acetic acid, and forming a compound
 called an acetate.      Then, if some sulphuric acid be poured on this
 new compound, the acetic acid will in its turn be displaced by the
 greater attachment of either of the bases, as they are termed, for
 the sulphuric acid. Again, if into a solution of blue vitriol, (a com
 bination of sulphuric acid with oxide of copper,) the bright blade of
 a knife be introduced, the knife will speedily be covered with a coat
 of copper, deposited in consequence of the acid preferring the iron,
 of which the knife is made, a quantity of it being dissolved in exact
 proportion to the quantity of copper deposited.
    It is on the same principle that a very beautiful preparation, called
 a silver-tree, or a lead-tree, may be formed, thus : — Fill a wide bottle,
           of holding from half a pint to a pint, with a tolerably strong
 Xble  ion of nitrate of silver (lunar caustic), or acetate of lead, in pure
 distilled water; then attach a small piece of zinc by a string to the
 cork or stopper of the bottle, so that the zinc shall hang about the

middle of the bottle, and set it         by where it may be quite undis
turbed ; in a short time, brilliant     plates of silver or lead, as the case
may be, will be seen to collect         around the piece of zinc, assuming
                     more or less           of the crystalline form.   This is
                       a case of elective affinity; the acid with which
                       the silver or lead was united prefers the zinc to
                       either of those metals, and in consequence discards
                       them in order to attach the zinc to itself ; and this
                       process will continue until the whole of the zinc
                       is taken up, or the whole of the silver or lead
                       deposited.
                           Again, many animal and vegetable substances
                       consist for the most part of carbon or charcoal,
                       united with oxygen and hydrogen in the propor
                       tion which forms water.         Now oil of vitriol
                        (strong sulphuric acid) has so powerful an
                      affinity, or so great a thirst for water, that it
will abstract it from almost any body in which it exists ; if you then
pour some of this acid on a lump of sugar, or place a chip of wood
m     the sugar or wood will speedily become quite black, or be
      it,
charred, as       itcalled, in consequence of the oxygen and hydrogen

being removed           by
                     the sulphuric acid, and only the carbon, or charcoal,
left.
   When Cleopatra dissolved pearls of wondrous value in vinegar, she
was exhibiting unwittingly an instance of chemical elective affinity        ;
the pearl being simply carbonate of lime, which was decomposed
 by the greater affinity or fondness of lime for its new acquaintance,
(the acetic acid of the vinegar,) than for the carbonic acid, with which
it had been united all its life, — an example of inconstancy in strong
contrast with the conduct of its owner, who chose death rather than
become the mistress of her lover's conqueror.
                             HEAT,   OB CALORIC.
   The chief agent in causing the repulsion or separation of the par
ticles of bodies from each other       isheat, or more correctly caloric,   by
which      understood the unknown cause of the effect called heat.
            is
Philosophers are not agreed upon the nature of this wonderful agent.
It pervades all nature,      is  the cause of nearly all the changes that
take place both in organic and inorganic matter, and has great in
fluence      the meteorological phenomena which we observe in the
             in
atmosphere that surrounds our planet.           It appears to be intimately
connected with light, electricity, and magnetism, subjects which the
genius of Faraday and others      is investigating, and    tlieir discoveries
                                                           by
bringing us nearer to the knowledge of the real nature of these most
wonderful forces.
   Caloric, then, exists in all bodies, and has       constant tendency to
                                                      a

                                CHEMISTRY.                                365
perature, is concerned; for if a hot body be brought near colder ones,
it will give up heat to them, until by its loss and their gain they all
become of the same temperature ; and this proceeds more or less
rapidly, according as the original difference of temperature was
greater or less. Some other circumstances also influence this equali
zation. The converse will take place on introducing a cold Dody
among warmer ones, when heat will be abstracted from all the bodies
within reach of its influence, until it has absorbed sufficient caloric
to bring its own temperature to an equality with theirs.            This is
the true explanation of the apparent production of cold. When, for
instance, an iceberg comes across a ship's course, it appears to give
out cold, whereas, it has abstracted the heat from the air and sea in
its neighbourhood, and they in turn act upon the ship and everything
in it,  until one common temperature         is produced m all the neigh
bouring bodies.
    It does not follow that the bodies thus equalized       in temperature
contain   equal  quantities of caloric   far
                                         ;   from  it. Bach  body requires
a particular quantity of caloric to raise its temperature through
 a certain number of degrees and such quantity
                                ;                     is called its specific
caloric.  A    pound of water, for instance, will take just twice as
 much caloric as   apound of olive oil, to raise its temperature through
the same number of degrees the specific caloric of water
                                ;                                    there
                                                                     is
fore double that of oil. Mix any quantity of oil at 60° of tempera
 ture with an equal weight of water at 90°, and you will find the
 temperature of the mixture to be nearly 80°, instead of only 74° or
 75°, showing that while the water has lost only 10° of caloric, the
 mixture has risen 20°.    If   the oil be at 90°, and the water at 60°,
 the resulting temperat'ire will be only 70°, or thereabouts, instead of
 75°, the mean thus, here the hot oil has lost 20", while the mixture
               ;
 has risen only 10°; the water, then, contains at the same temperature
 twice as much caloric as the oil its specific caloric
                                     ;                     isdouble that of
 the oil. This mean temperature does result when equal weights of
 the same body at different temperatures are mixed together.
    The sensations called heat and cold are by no means accurate
measures of the real temperature of any substances, for many causes
influence these sensations, some belonging to the substances them
selves, others to the state of our organs at the time.      Every one has
remarked that metals in warm room feel warmer, and in cold room
                          a                                      a
 colder than wooden articles, and these again than woollen or cotton
 articles of dress or furniture ;  this arises from metals being what      is
termed better conductors of heat than wood, and this better than
wool, &c., that    is,
                     they give out or absorb caloric more rapidly than
these last.    Some philosophers, wishing to ascertain how much heat
the human body could endure, had.        a room heated with stoves, every
crevice being carefully stopped, until the temperature rose so high
that a    beefsteak placed on the table was sufficiently cooked to be
eaten.     They were dressed    inflannel, and could with impunity touch

 366                        EVERY    BOY'S  BOOK.
 the carpets, curtains, &c., in the room ; but the iron handles, fire-irons,
 and all metallic substances, burnt their fingers ; and one who wore
 silver spectacles was obliged to remove them to save his nose.         The
 fallacy of our sensations may be easily shown by taking two basins,
placing in one some water at 100°, in another some water at
 as low a temperature as can easily be procured — hold the right hand
in one, the left in the other, for a few minutes, and then nux them,
and place both hands in the mixture ; it will feel quite cold to the
hand that had been in the hotter water, and hot to the other.
    In order to arrive at a correct estimate of the temperature of
bodies, instruments are made use of called thermometers, or measurers
of heat, which show increase or diminution of temperature by the
rising or falling of a column of some fluid in a tube of glass, one end
of which is expanded into a bulb, and the other hermetically sealed.
This effect is produced by the expansion or swelling of the fluid
as caloric is added to, and its contraction when caloric is abstracted
from it. Coloured spirits of wine, or quicksilver, are the most
usual thermometric fluids, and the tube containing them is fixed
to a wooden or metallic frame, on which certain divisions are marked,
called degrees.
    That in general use in England is called Fahrenheit's, from the
name of the person who first introduced that particular scale.            In
this thermometer, the point at which the mercury in the tube stands
when plunged into melting ice, is marked 32°, and the distance
between that point, and the point to which the mercury rises in
boiling water, is divided into 180 equal parts, called degrees ; so that
water is said to boil at 212° =180" + 32°. There are two other
scales of temperature used in different parts of the world, but it is not
worth while to notice them here.
    Not only do different bodies at the same degree of temperature
contain very different quantities of caloric, but this also is the case
with the same body in different forms. lee, water, and steam, are
three forms of the same body, but ice at 32° contains much less
caloric than water at the same temperature, and water at 212° con
tains much less caloric than steam (or water in a state of vapour) at
that temperature.
    Place m a jar any given quantity of snow, or small pieces of ice, at
32°, and in another the same weight of water at 32°, pour on each an
equal weight of water at 172°, and you will find that m the first case
the ice will be melted, but the temperature will remain at 32° or
thereabouts, while the temperature of the water in the other vessel
will have risen to 100° or thereabouts, being as near as possible the
half of the excess of the temperature of the hot water, 140° over that
of the cold, namely 70° added to 32°, the original temperature. Now,
what has become of the heat which was added to the ice, and is
apparently lost ? — it is absorbed by the ice in its passage to the fluid
state; so that water may be said to be a compound of ice and caloric.

                                       .   CHEMISTRY.                                       367
            take 10 ounces of water at about 50°, and add 1 oz. of
water at 212°, and the temperature of the mixture will be about 66° ;
then condense some steam at 212°, into another 10 oz. of water until
it has become 11 oz., and you will find the temperature will be nearly
212°. Why does the ounce of steam at 212° raise the temperature
of the water so much higher than the ounce of water at the same
temperature? Obviously because it contains hidden in its substance
a vast quantity of caloric, not to be detected by the thermometer ; in
fact, that steam is a compound of water and caloric, as water is a com
pound of ice and caloric ; and this caloric which exists, more or less,
m all bodies without producing any obvious effect, is called latent
caloric, from the Latin verb laieo, to lie hid. The quantity of caloric
thus absorbed as it were by various bodies, differs for each body, and
for the same body in different forms, as mentioned above.
                                           EXPANSION.
   As a general rule, all bodies, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous, are
expanded by caloric.      This may be shown by experiments in each
form of matter.
   Have a small iron rod made, which when cold just passes through
a hole in a plate of metal ; heat      and    will no longer pass after
                                              it,       it                          ;         a
time the rod will return to its former temperature, and then will go
through the hole as before.     The rod increases in length as well as
width  ;   you

                           a   divided  into -^ of an inch, and place the
rod in  itwhen cold, noting its position, on heating      will extend to

greater length in the gauge, returning to its former place when cool.
   The effect of caloric in causing fluids to expand    actually employed
                                                                    is
as a measure of quantity in the thermometer, the rise of the fluid in
the tube when heated depending on the increased bulk of the fluid
occasioned        by
                the addition of caloric. The same fact       to be noticed    is
every day when the cook fills the kettle, and places       on the fire. As

 expansion appears to have no limit ; boilers made of iron plates an inch
 or even more in thickness, aud the buildings or ships containing
 them, having been torn to pieces and scattered in all directions bv
 the expansive power of steam.       Take a bladder, and fill it about
 half full of air, and tie the neck securely; upon holding it to the
fire it will swell out, and become quite tense from the expansion of
the contained air.
    The principal source of caloric is the sun, whose beams, diffused
through all nature by the refractive property of the atmosphere, are
the source of vitality both to vegetables and animals, and when concen
trated by a large convex lens, produce the most intense heat, sufficient
to light a piece of diamond, and melt platinum. Caloric is also pro
duced or evolved by combustion, by friction, percussion, chemical
combination, electricity, and galvanism.
    The evolution of heat by friction may be witnessed daily in a thou
sand instances.    Lucifer matches are lighted by rubbing the highly
inflammable substances with which they are tipped against a piece of
sand-paper.    Nearly all savage people procure fire by rubbing
a piece of hard wood violently against a softer piece.    The axle-trees
of steam-engmes, and even of carriages, have been known to be so
heated by friction as to endanger burning the carriage; and it is very
usual to 1>e obliged to pour a quantity of cold water on the iron axle
of the carriages of an express train after an hour of constant and
rapid work.      Ifyou merely rub the blade of a knife rapidly on a
piece of wood, it will become hot enough to burn your hand.
   Percussion is merely a more energetic kind of motion, and is often
resorted to by the blacksmith to light his furnace.     He places a nail
or other piece of soft iron on his anvil, and beats it rapidly with the
hammer, when it becomes actually red hot. The production of sparks

other, are familiar instances of heat produced by percussion.
   One of the most powerful means of producmg heat is the process
of combustion.
   Combustion, as the word imports, is the burning toqether of two or
more substances, a chemical union of oxygen generally with carbon
and hydrogen in some shape or other.       In our ordinary fires we burn
coal, a hydro-carbon as it   is called ; and  the gas which is now so
universally used for the purpose of illumination, is a compound of the
same bodies — so wax, tallow, oil of various kinds, both of animal and
vegetable origin, are all hydro-carbons.
   On the application of a sufficient heat, and a free access of atmo
spheric air, or of some other gas containing oxygen in a certain state
of combination, these bodies take fire, and continue to burn either
with flame, or a red or even white heat without flame, until they are
consumed; that       until they have entered into new combinations
                      is,
with the oxygen, and are converted into carbonic acid and water, the
carbon forming the first product, the hydrogen the other.

  Into an ordinary wine bottle put some pieces of granulated zinc,
and pour on them a mixture of sulphuric acid and water, in the pro
portion of about one part of acia to four of water, then close the
bottle with a cork haymg a hole bored through the middle, in which
a piece of glass tube is mserted ; wait some minutes that the atmo
spheric air m the bottle may be expelled by the hydrogen gas set free
by the decomposition of the water, then apply a lighted taper to the
end of the tube, when the gas will inflame, giving out so little light
as to be barely visible by daylight, but producing so intense a heat
that a piece of platinum wire instantly becomes white hot when held
in the name.         If
                  you hold a glass tumbler inverted over the flame, it
becomes covered with minute drops of water, the result of the union
of the hydrogen with the oxygen of the air, and in this case water is
 the only product.
   If  a piece of charcoal, which is pure carbon or nearly so, be ignited,
 and introduced into a jar containing oxygen or common atmospheric
 tar, the product will be carbonic acid gas only, of which we shall
 speak presently. As most combustible bodies contain both carbon
 and hydrogen, the result of their combination is carbonic acid and
 water. This is the case with the gas used for illumination ; and in
 order to prevent the water so produced from spoiling goods in shops,
 various plans have been devised for carrying off the water when in
the state of steam. This is generally accomplished by suspending
 over the burners glass bells, communicating with tubes openmg into
the chimney, or passing outside the house.
    To show that oxygen, or some equivalent, is necessary for the sup
 port of combustion, fix two or three pieces of wax-taper on flat pieces
 of cork, and set them floating on water in a soup-plate, light them,
 and invert over them a glass jar ; as they burn, the heat produced may
perhaps at first expand the air so as to force a small quantity out of
the jar, but the water will soon rise in the jar, and continue to do so
until the tapers expire, when you will find that a considerable portion
of the air has disappeared, and what remains will no longer support
flame ; that   is,the oxygen has been converted partly into water, and
partly into carbonic acid gas,     by
                                   uniting with the carbon and hydrogen,
of which the taper consists, and the remaining air principally nitro

gen, with some carbonic acid: the presence of the latter may be
proved   by  decanting some of the remaming air into      bottle, and then

and form chalk, rendering the water quite turbid.

 of nitrate of copper, spread them over a piece of tin-foil, sprinkle them
 with a little water ; then fold up the foil tightly as rapidly as possible,
 and in a minute or two it will become red hot, the tin apparentlybunting
 away.    This heat is produced by the energetic action of the tin on
 the nitrate of copper, taking away its oxygen in order to unite with
 the nitric acid, for which, as well as for the oxygen, the tin has
 a much greater affinity than the copper has.
    Combustion without flame may De shown in a very elegant and
 agreeable manner, by making a coil of platinum wire by twisting it
round the stem of a tobacco-pipe, or any cylindrical body, for a
 dozen times or so, leaving about an inch straight, which should be
inserted into the wick of a spiritJamp ; light the lamp, and after
it has burnt for a minute or two extmguish the
flame quickly;     the wire wiU soon become red
hot, and, if kept from draughts of air, will con
tinue to burn until all the spirit is consumed.
Spongy platinum, as it is called, answers rather
better than wire, and has been employed in the
formation of fumigators for the drawing-room, in
which, instead of pure spirit, some perfume, such
as lavender water, is used ; by its combustion an
agreeable odour is diffused through the apartment.              These little
lamps    were  much  in vogue   a few years    ago, but are  now  nearly out
of fashion.
    Experiments on combustion might be multiplied almost to any
amount, but the above will be sufficient for the present.         When we
come to treat of the properties of the gases and some other sub
stances, we shall have occasion to recur to this subject.
    The production of caloric by chemical combination may be exhi
bited by mixing carefully one part of oil of vitriol with two of water,
 when sufficient heat will be produced to boil some water in a thin
and narrow tube, which may be used as a rod to stir the mixture.
    The production of heat by electric and galvanic agency belongs to
another subject.      I will content myself with saying here, that these
forces afford the most powerful aid in decomposmg and uniting
various bodies, and that it was by the immense power of a battery of
2,000 pairs of plates, belonging to the Royal Institution in London,
that Sir H. Davy discovered the metallic oases of the alkalies and
earths.

    Having said a few words on the forces acting upon matter, let us
examine the properties of matter itself.
    Matter exists m three forms: the solid, the liquid, and the gaseous;
and in many cases they may be converted one into the other
by the effects of caloric and of pressure. Water affords a good
example of the effect of caloric, being either solid, as ice ; fluid, as
                                    BB2

 water; or gaseous, as steam, or the vapour of water, according to the
 degree of heat to which it is exposed ; but its chemical composition
 remains unchanged in either case ; it is still a compound of 2 parts of
 hydrogen to 1 of oxygen by measure, or 1 of hydrogen to 8 of
 oxygen by weight.
    Carbonic acid gas may, by the joint effect of pressure and cold, be
 reduced to the state of a liquid, and if the pressure be suddenly re
 moved from this liquid, it returns to its gaseous state so rapidly,
 and absorbs so great an amount of caloric in so doing, that it actually
freezes, if  I   may use the expression, a portion of the acid, which
 appears like flakes of snow, and may, like snow, be made up into
 a bul.    This ball very soon becomes converted into gas, but      I have
 kept  some   for        a
                  nearly quarter    of  an hour.   This process should  not
 be attempted by any but experienced persons, for not only is an
 expensive apparatus required, but there is danger of an explosion
 unless great care is taken.       Camphor is generally known as a solid
 body,  but  a  comparatively  slight elevation of temperature raises it in
     Ether, again, is a liquid substance under ordinary circumstances,
 but a very slight degree of heat raises it in vapour; indeed, it
 assumes the state of vapour at the ordinary temperature, as may be
 shown by putting a little into a phial, and after it has been tnere
 a few minutes, alighted taper applied to the mouth of the phial will
 cause a flame to appear, which is the vapour of the ether uniting
 by combustion with the oxygen of the air.
    Again, Sir James Hall, many years ago, succeeded in melting even
 limestone by the application of intense heat, combined with strong
 pressure.     Thus, the farm in which matter is found is not essential,
 but depends upon the surrounding circumstances.
                                    OASES.
    The simple, or undeeompounded gases, are, oxygen, chlorine, called
 sometimes supporters of combustion ; hydrogen and nitrogen, which
 are said to be combustible.
    The compound gases are very numerous, some being combustible,
 and others supporters of combustion.
    Gases are for the most part transparent and colourless, with a few-
 exceptions, and of course, like the air of the atmosphere, invisible.
 They are not affected by the attraction of cohesion, but on the con
 trary, the particles composing them have a constant tendency to
 separate from each other, so that their force of expansion is only
 limited by the pressure under which they may be kept, and the tem
perature they may be exposed to. They have a tendency to jmietratr
 each other, as it were ; for instance, if you take a jar of a heavy gas,
 such as carbonic gas, set it with its mouth upwards, then invert over
it another jar containing hydrogen, a gas nearly twenty times lightc'- ;
in a very short time the two gases will have become thoroughlv

nuxed, the heavy carbonic acid having risen, and the light hydrogen
fallen, until the gases are thoroughly mixed, each jar containing an
equal quantity of each gas.
                                     OXYGEN GAS.
    This gas, so named from two Greek words signifving the maker of
acid, was discovered by Dr. Priestly in 1774.                 He obtained it by
heating     the    red oxide    of  mercury    in  a glass retort,    when the gas
escaped      in   considerable     quantities.    In  the  ensuing year Scheele
obtamed it by a variety of methods, and a few years afterwards,
Lavoisier discovered that it was contained in atmospheric air, where
it exists in the proportion of about one-fifth, the remaining four-fifths
being almost entirely nitrogen.
    Oxygen gas may be obtained for the purposes of experiment, by
heating to redness the black oxide of manganese in an iron bottle, to
the month of which a flexible tube is attached to convey away the
gas as fast as it is liberated from the manganese.              The first portions
should be      allowed    to escape, being mixed      with  the   air in the tubes
and bottle, and the remainder may be collected in a gasometer, or in
glass jars inverted over water.
    Another method to obtain the gas, is to mix in a retort some of
this same oxide of manganese, with about half its weight of strong
sulphuric acid, and apply heat to the retort, when the gas will come
over in considerable quantities; the first portions must be allowed to
escape as before.1          If the gas is required very pure, a small quantity
of the salt called chlorate of potassa may be heated in a retort, and
oxygen gas will be evolved, and may be collected as before.                     If you
have an iron bottle, the first mode is by far the cheapest and most
convenient, as the heat of a bright fire is sufficient for the operation,
and a very large quantity of gas is obtained in a short time from
a very inexpensive material.
    Oxygen is largely distributed over our globe, both m its uncom-
bined state, and m union with other substances.                   Besides forming
one-fifth of the atmosphere, it forms seven-eighths of all the water in
the ocean, rivers, and springs on the face of the whole earth. It also,
in combination with various metals, and with what are called the
simple combustibles, forms the various earths and minerals of which
the crust of the earth consists, so that it is perhaps the most
abundant and widely distributed substance in nature.
    In its uneombined state it is a colourless gas, somewhat heavier
than atmospheric air, without taste or smell.              It is a powerful sup
porter of combustion, as has already been shown under the head
" combustion," and is
                               absolutely necessary for the support of animal
  (1) Some boiling water should be added to the mass left in the retort directly the
gas has ceased to come away, or it will adhere to the glass so -1 inly , that the retort
will certainly be spoilt.

  life, which cannot exist for any time without a free supply of this
 gas, which is constantly consumed in the act of breathmg, and is
  replaced by a nearly equivalent portion of carbonic acid gas.        The
 want of oxygen is partly the cause of the oppression felt in crowded
 rooms, where the air cannot be renewed so fast as is required for the
 number of persons who are constantly consuming the oxygen ; and
 if an animal be confined under a glass jar inverted over water, it
 will presently die, just for the same reason that the tapers went out,
  as shown in a former experiment.
     If a jet of this gas be thrown upon a piece of charcoal, sulphur, or
 almost any combustible body in a state of ignition, it will make it
 burn with great vividness and rapidity.
                                  CHLORINE.
     The other simple gas called a supporter of combustion is named
 chlorine, from a Greek word signifymg yellowish green. •
     This gas was formerly called " oxymnriatic acid," being supposed
 to be a compound of oxygen and muriatic acid gases, until Sir II.
 Davy, in a series of masterly experiments carried on during the years
 1808-9-10 and 11, proved that it contained no oxygen or muriatic
 acid, and that it was in fact a simple or undecompounded       substance,
 and changed its name to chlorine, which name was, after some discus
 sion, accepted by the scientific world, and is still in use.
     This gas may be obtained for experiment, by gently heating in a
 retort a mixture of muriatic or hydrochloric acid, as it is now called,
with some black oxide of manganese : the muriatic acid, a compound
of chlorine and hydrogen, is decomposed, and so is the oxide of man
ganese, giving out some of its oxygen, which takes the hydrogen from
the muriatic acid to -form water, while the chlorine gas, with which
the hydrogen had been united, is set at liberty, and may be collected
in jars over water.
     Chlorine gas is transparent, of a greenish yellow colour, has a pecu

tities, occasions a sensation of suffocation, of tightness in the chest,
and violent coughing, attended with great prostration.       Ihave been
compelled to retire to bed from having upset a bottle containing some
of this gas. It destroys most vegetable colours when moist, and is
in fact the agent now universally employed for bleaching purposes.
    It has also the power of combining with and destroying all noxious
smells, and is invaluable as a purifier of foul rooms, and destroyer of
infection. For these latter purposes it is used in combination with
lime, either in substance or solution, under the name of
                                                           " Chloride of
Lime."
  Sir W. Bnrnett has lately discovered         that the chloride of zinc
answers the same purposes as the chloride of lime, and has the advan
tage of being itself destitute of smell, and his fluid is frequently sub
stituted for the other.
   Chlorine gas is a powerful supporter of combustion, many of the
metals taking fire spontaneously when introduced in a fine state of
division into the gas.
                             EXPERIMENTS.
   1. Into a jar of chlorine gas introduce a few sheets of copper leaf,
sold under the name of Dutch foil, when it will burn with a dull red
light.
   2. If some metallic antimony in a state of powder be poured into a
jar of this gas, it will take fire as it falls, and burn with a bright
white light.
   3. A small piece of the metal potassium may be introduced, and
will also take fire.
   4. A piece of phosphorus will also generally take fire spontaneously
when introduced into this gas. In afl these cases direct compounds
of the substances with chlorine are produced, called chlorides.
   5.   If
         a lighted taper be plunged quickly into the gas, it will con
tinue to burn with a dull light, givmg off a very large quantity of
smoke, being in fact the carbon of the wax taper, with which the
chlorine does not unite; while the other constituent of the taper, the
hydrogen, forms muriatic acid by union with the chlorine.
   6. This substance has the property of destroying most vegetable
colours, and is used in large quantities for bleaching calico, linen, and
the rags of which paper is made.       It is a curious fact that it shows
this property only when water is present, for if a piece of coloured
cloth is mtroduced dry into a jar of the gas, also dry, no effect will
be produced — wet the cloth, and re-introduce      it, and ina  very short
time its colour will be discharged.
   7. Introduce   a quantity of the infusion of the common red cabbage,
which     of beautiful blue colour, into
         is   a                            a   jar of this gas, andit  will
instantly become nearly as pale as water, retaining      a  slight tinge of
yellow.

   This gas is heavier than air, and supports combustion nearly as
energetically as oxygen, as may be shown by introducing a piece of
ignited phosphorus into a jar of this gas. It will not, however, sup
port the life of small animals, such as mice, introduced into it ; they
die almost instantly.
   The next compound of nitrogen with oxygen, when one proportion
of nitrogen unites with two of oxygen, is termed nitnc oxide gas. It
may be easily procured by heating in a retort some copper turnings
in dilute nitric acid. It is colourless and transparent, and has the
property of combining with oxygen to form the nitrous acid gas.

                                EXPERIMENT.
   Into a jar of this gas standmg over water pass some oxygen gas.
The jar will be filled with red fumes (nitrous acid), which will be
absorbed by the water as fast as formed.         If atmospheric air be used
instead of oxygen, there will remain in the jar the nitrogen of the air,
amounting to four-fifths of the air employed.
   This gas is destructive to animal life, in consequence of its property
of uniting with the oxygen in the lungs, and producing the highly
corrosive nitrous acid gas.      It will, however, support the combustion
of a few substances, phosphorus for instance.
   We pass over the third and fourth compounds of nitrogen with
oxygen, the nitrous and nitric acids, in whicn nitrogen unites respec
tively with four and five proportions of oxygen, as they are not cal
culated for amusing experiments.
   Nitrogen combines with chlorine and iodine, forming detonating
compounds, that with chlorine being so extremely dangerous that it
will be better to pass it by.
   The compound w^th iodine, called iodide of nitrogen, may very
easily be made by pouring strong solution of ammonia (a compound
of nitrogen and hydrogen) upon some iodine in a saucer, stirring them
well together, and"^ after letting them stand for a few minutes, pouring
off the fluid ; the black powder remaining in the saucer is the explosive
compound, the iodide of nitrogen.           When dry, it is very apt to
detonate spontaneously; it should therefore be taken out of the saucer
while wet, and spread in small quantities on separate pieces of paper,

which should be kept apart from each other.      When thoroughly dry,
the slightest touch with the point of a feather, shaking the paper on
which it rests, or even opening too rapidly the door of a closet where
it has been put to dry, will cause it to explode, producing a quantity
of violet-coloured fumes.    The explosion is not violent, producing a
sharp cracking noise; and should the explosion take place in the hand,
it causes merely a stinging sensation, lasting for only a minute or
two.
                                     ATMOSPHERIC    AIR.
   As has been already mentioned, nitrogen is the principal constituent
of the air of the atmosphere which surrounds our globe, extending to
a height of about forty-five miles above                   it,
                                                    and plaving        most

important part   in the  economy  of nature,  inorganic as well  as organic.
   This atmospheric air consists of nearly four-fifths of nitrogen, and
rather more than one-fifth of oxygen, about seventy-nine of the former
to twenty-one of the latter, and generally contains also      variable pro
                                                                     a

composition of air taken from all parts of the world, and from different
heights, np to the highest point which has to this time been attained.
   This atmosphere presses on the surface of the globe and every
being on       it,
              with    force of about fifteen pounds to every square inch
of surface, but as       it a
                       presses equally in all directions, upwards as well
as downwards, its weight cannot be perceived unless the pressure be
removed from one surface              by
                                 some artificial means.
                               EXPERIMENTS.

                                     it
interior of the cylinder, and at each stroke of the pump you will feel
your hand pressed tighter and tighter on the cylinder, until you will
not be able to remove         as soon as the air

hand again be at liberty.
  2.   Tie piece of moistened bladder very firmly over one end of a
           a
similar glass cylinder, and place the open end on the plate of the
pump. As soon as you begm to exhaust the air from the interior,
the bladder, which was previously quite horizontal, will begin to bulge
inwards, the concavity increasing as the exhaustion proceeds, until
the bladder, no longer able to bear the weight of the superincumbent
air, breaks with     loud report.

a very  small quantity of air, its mouth bemg closely tied.     As you
exhaust the air from the receiver, that portion contained in the
bladder being no longer pressed upon oy the atmosphere, will
gradually expand, distending the bladder until it appears nearly full;
on readmittmg the a,ir into the receiver, the bladder will at once
shrink to its former dimensions.
    A shrivelled apple placed under the same conditions, will appear
plump when the air is removed from the receiver, and resume its
former appearance on the readmission of the air.
    4. There is a very pretty apparatus made for the purpose of show
ing the pressure of the atmosphere, consisting of a hollow globe of
brass, about three inches in diameter, divided into two equal parts,
which fit very accurately together ; it is furnished with two handles,
one of them screwed into a hollow stem, communicating with the
interior of the globe, and fitting on to the air-pump ; the other is
attached to a short stem on the opposite side of the globe.      In the
natural state, the globe may easily be separated into its two hemi
spheres by one person pulling the handles, but after the air has been
exhausted from the interior, it requires two very strong men to sepa
rate the parts, and they will often fail.    By turning the stopcock,
and readmitting the air into the interior of the globe, it will come
asunder as easily as at first.
    We are indebted to the weight of the atmosphere for the power we
 possess of raising water by the common pump, for the piston of the
 pump withdrawing the air from the interior of the pipe, which ter
 minates in water, the pressure of the atmosphere forces the water up
 the pipe to supply the place of the air withdrawn.        It was soon
 found, however, that when the column of water in the pipe was more
 than thirty feet high, the pump became useless,
 for the water refused to rise higher. Why?
 It  was found that a column of water about                   \30.incki
 thirtv feet high, exerted a pressure equal to the
 weight of the atmosphere, thus establishing an
 equilibrium between the water in the pipe and
 the atmospheric pressure.
    This is the principle on which the barometer,
 or measurer of weight, as its name imports, is
 constructed.     The metal Mercury is about
 twelve times heavier than water, consequently,
 if a column of water thirty feet high balances
 the pressure of the atmosphere, a column of
 mercury thirty inches high ought to do so also,
 and this is in fact the case. If yon take a glass
 tube nearly three feet long, and closed at one
 end, fill it with mercury, then placing your
 finger on the open end, mvert the tube into a basin or saucer con-

 380                        EVERY      BOY'S    BOOK.
taining some of the same metal; upon removing your finger (which
must be done carefully, while the mouth of the tube is completely
covered by the mercury), it will be seen that the fluid will fall a few
inches, leaving the upper part of the tube empty.    Such a tube with
a graduated scale attached, is in truth a barometer, and as the weight
of the atmosphere increases or decreases, so the mercury rises or
falls in the tube.    This instrument is of the greatest value to the
seaman, for a sudden fall of the barometer will often give notice
of an impending storm, when all is fine and calm, and thus enable
the mariner to make the preparations necessary to meet the danger.
   This instrument was discovered by an Italian philosopher, named
Torricelli, and from him the vacuum formed in the upper end of the
tube above the surface of the mercury, has been called the Torricellian
vacuum.     It is by far the most perfect vacuum that can be obtained,
containing necessarily nothing bat a minute quantity of the vapour
of mercury.
                              EXPERIMENT.
   Pass a little ether through the mercury in the tube, and as soon as
it reaches the empty space it will boil violently, depressing the mer
cury, until the pressure of its own vapour is sufficient to prevent its
ebullition.   If you now cool the upper part of the tube, so as to con
dense the vapour, the pressure being thus removed, the ether will
again begin to boil, and so alternately, as often as you please.     In
order to show this fact with effect, the bore of the tube should not be
less than half an inch in diameter.
   Atmospheric air contains, besides the oxygen and nitrogen, its
principal constituents, a small proportion of carbonic acid gas, as has
been mentioned, and this may be shown by filling a tube about half
full of lime-water, and shaking it with the air contained in the other
half, when it will become slightly turbid from the insoluble carbonate
of lime formed.
   When we consider that every living animal is constantly consuming
oxygen, and replacing it by carbonic acid gas, and that all burning
bodies, fires in our dwellings, furnaces, artificial lights of all kinds, act
in the same way in abstracting the oxygen from the air, and replacing
it by immense quantities of carbonic acid gas, which is a poison to all
animuls who breathe, or attempt to breathe          it,
                                                     we must wonder what
becomes of    this irrespirable gas, as  it    found
                                               is      to exist in the air in
quantities so minute, and    by what means the oxygen     is   restored, and
the air again made fit for respiration. This       effected
                                                    is      by  one of those
laws which the wisdom of the Creator has impressed upon matter, by

poisonous to animal life,   is the food of the vegetable world, plants

refuse is the food of vegetables, and is used under the name of
manures.
   The atmosphere contains also a variable quantity of vapour of
water, invisible as long as it is in the state of vapour, but it may be
rendered obvious by bringing any verv cold body mto warm air, when
the vapour will condense on the cold body in the form of small drops
of water.    A tumbler of fresh-pumped water brought into a crowded
room, is almost immediately covered with moisture, and it may also
be seen on bottles of wine which have been put into ice before coming
to table.   Fogs are occasioned by the condensation of vapour, pro
duced by mixmg a current of warm air with a colder air. The banks
of Newfoundland are notorious for dense fogs, occasioned by the
warm air brought from the south by the great gulf stream, mixing
with the cold air from the Arctic regions, and thus precipitating the
vapour in a visible form, rendering everything but itself umsible.
The famous London fogs depend upon the same precipitation of the
vapour of water, with the addition of the smoke from the numerous
sea-coal fires, which give it that interesting yellow tinge for which it
is so remarkable.
   Aqueous vapour being lighter and more transparent than air,
pernuts objects to be seen more distinctly in proportion to its quan
tity ; hence, when distant hills appear nearer, and objects upon them
more distinct than usual, rain may be expected, the air being fully
charged with vapour ready to be deposited on the slightest cause.
                                   HYDROGEN.
    Hydrogen gas is the lightest substance known, being fifteen times
lighter than atmospheric air. It is colourless and transparent, inca
pable of supporting combustion or respiration, but is itself com
bustible. Hydrogen, as its name implies (being derived from two Greek
words, signifying the generator of water), is a constituent of water in
the proportion of one-ninth by weight, and is always obtained by de
composmg that fluid, by presenting to it some body to take up its
other ingredient, oxygen, and so set the hydrogen at liberty. If the
steam of water be passed through a red-hot gun
barrel, containing iron filings, the water is decom
posed, the iron taking the oxvgen, and the hydro
gen comes over in torrents ; but as every one has
not a gun barrel and furnace to heat     it, the usual
mode is to employ dilute sulphuric acid, and iron
filings, or zinc, m small pieces, as described in
                                                    in by
page 369, and      may be collected over water

    Attach a tobacco-pipe to a bladder filled with this gas, and blow
some soap-bubbles with it ; they will rise very rapidly, aud if a lighted
taper be applied to them, they burn.
    If you mn in the bladder one-third of oxygen with two-thirds of
hydrogen, and blow the bubbles with the nuxture, they will explode
with a sharp report when touched with a lighted taper.         Great care
must be taken not to apply the light until the bubble has entirely left
the pipe, or the whole of the gi!s m the bladder will explode, as   I have
witnessed more than once.

    If a jet of this gas be held with its mouth downwardt, and a lighted
taper passed    up well into the jar, the taper will be extinguished, and
the gas take    fire, and burn quietly at the mouth of the jar ; if mixed
with oxygen     or atmospheric air, it will explode.
    Hold over   the jet of hydrogen issuing from a small tube, hollow
 cylinders of glass or eartnenware, Florence flasks, or hollow glass
 balls, and musical sounds will be produced, which were supposed to
 depend on some peculiar property of hydrogen gas, until Mr. Faraday
 tried flame from coal gas, olefiant gas, and even the vapour of ether,
 when the sounds were still produced, and he attributed them to a con
 tinuous explosion, or series of explosions, produced by the union of
 oxygen with the hydrogen of the flames.-

       Hydrogen has the power of abstracting oxygen from some of the
    metallic oxides.     If you moisten a piece of paper with a solution of
    nitrate of silver, which is colourless, and hold it over a jet of hydrogen
   gas, the paper will soon appear covered with silver, in consequence of
   the decomposition of the salt by the gas.
                                       WATER.
       With oxygen, hydrogen unites to form the important compound
   water, which exists not only in the obvious form of oceans, rivers,
   lakes, rains, dew, &c. &c., but is found intimately combined with
   many substances, giving them some of their peculiar properties.
   Many crystals have a definite proportion of water combined with
   them, and on losing this water they lose their crystalline form. Many
   acids also cannot exist as acids, without water.        The slaking of lime
   depends upon       the  union  of  water  with the   lime,  the dry powder
  resulting from the process being a hydrate       of  lime, the water naving
  become solidified, and in passing from the fluid to the solid state gives
  out its latent caloric, producing the heat observed during the process.
  When a large quantity of lime, a barge-load for instance, has got
  wetted by accident, the heat evolved has been sufficient to set fire to
  the barge.
      Below the temperature of 32° of Fahrenheit's thermometer, water
  loses its fluid form, and becomes ice.       As it solidifies, it starts into
  beautiful crystals, which unite and cross each other at determinate
  angles, and these crystals, leaving of course small spaces between
  them to be filled up by air, render the ice much lighter than the water
  on which it floats, forming a protection to the water beneath, and
  preventing it from being frozen so rapidly; else, if the ice were
  heavier than water, and consequently sank as soon as formed, each
  portion of water would be frozen m its turn, until rivers became
 solid throughout, and every living creature in them must be destroyed.
 Now, the temperature of the water under the ice is seldom much
 below 40°, and if care be taken to break holes at intervals to allow
 access to the air, the fish and other aquatic animals seldom suffer
 even in our coldest winters.
      Although it is impossible to raise ice even one degree above 32°
 •without thawing, it is not difficult to reduce water many degrees
 below that point without freezing it.
      In order to obtain     both the constituents of water in a separate
 state, it must be decomposed by galvanism, each pole of a battery ter
minating in a separate tube contaming water, when the result will be
that at the positive pole oxygen gas will be evolved, and hydrogen at
the negative, the latter being double the quantity of the former. Now,
if   you mix the gases thus obtained, introduce them into a vessel called
a "Eudiometer," and pass an electric spark through them from a

                                  into water. If you have a mercurial

jumps up   at once to 32°, where    remains until the whole

is, that the water in passing from the solid to the fluid form absorbs,
and   in passing from the fluid to the solid form gives out caloric, so
maintaining the temperature at 32°, the point at which the change of
form takes place, until            it
                               completed. is

    With chlorine, hydrogen forms a compound called muriatic, or
hydrochloric acid gas. It cannot easily be formed hy the direct
 union of its elements, but is procured from some compound in which
it exists ready formed.         Common salt (muriate of soda) is generally
 emploved; and when acted on by strong sulphuric acid (or oil of
 vitriol), the gas is disengaged in abundance.         It must be collected

carbon.
   The purest form of carbon       the precious stone called diamond,

chemist, Lavoisier, was the first who proved the combustibility of

would continue to burn in oxygen gas, or atmospheric air, and that
the product of the combustion was carbonic acid gas, exactly equal
in quantity to the gas produced by burning an equal weight of pure
charcoal, the most common form of carbon.
                  " blacklead," as it is very improperly called, is also
   Plumbago, or
nearly pure carbon, a very small quantity of iron being united
with it.
   By far the greater part of all vegetable, and a very large portion
of animal bodies consists of carbon ; and in the state of carbonic acid
in combination with lime and some other earths, it forms nearly the
half of all the chalk, marble, and limestone of our hills ; so that it
in one shape or other, one of the most widely diffused bodies                                     in is,
nature.
   Carbon forms two gaseous compounds with oxygen the first, called         ;
carbonic oxide,      difficult to procure, and possesses no interesting
                       is is

                                             ;
this rule.
   Carbonic acid gas may be obtained with the greatest facility                                   by
pouring some sulphuric acid, dilated with about six parts of water,
upon some pieces of marble or limestone in             bottle witha  tube                   a
attached, when the gas comes over in torrents.        It may be collected
over water.

 lighted taper at the  bottom   of   tall glass jar, then take
                                                  a            jar full of        a
 carbonic acid gas, and pour       as you would pour water into the jar

    4. Shake up some water with some of this gas in a bottle ; the
greater part of the gas will be absorbed by the water, which acquires
a sparklmg appearance and a pleasant sharp taste ; with the addition
of a little soda tliis becomes the well-known beverage called soda
water, so famous for removing the morning headaches caused by
 " that talmon " having
                          disagreed at yesterdairs dinner !
    It  is the presence of this gas which renders it so dangerous to
descend into deep wells, for by its great weight it collects at the
bottom, and instantly suffocates any unfortunate person who incau
tiously subjects himself to it. Hence it is prudent always to let
down a lighted candle before any one descends into a well, or other
deep excavation, and if the candle is extinguished, it is necessary to
throw down several pails of water, lime-water if possible, and again
to try the candle, which must burn freely before it is safe for any one
to descend.
    It is this same gas under the name of " choke-damp," which proves
so dangerous to mmers, particularly after an explosion of
                                                             "
                                                               fire-damp,"
for it is the principal product of the explosion, and by its weight
settles at the bottom of the mine, whence it is by no means an easy
matter to dislodge it.
    Carbonic acid gas has been condensed into the fluid form by
causing it to be disengaged under great pressure ; the fluid acid has
the appearance of water.        When the pressure is removed, as by
allowmg some of the fluid acid to escape from the vessel in which
it has Been condensed, it instantly reassumes the gaseous form, and
in so doing absorbs so much latent caloric that a portion of the acid
is actually solidified, and appears in the shape of snow, which may he
collected and preserved for a short time.        After a lecture by Mr.
Addams before the Ashmolean Society of Oxford,        I carried a kmd of
mowball of carbonic acid for a distance of 500 or 600 vards, and
placed it in a saucer in a room.     It evaporated very rapidly, and left
no residue, not even a mark where it had lain.        It was too cold to
be touched by the naked hand without pain.
    Carbonic acid and lime are mutually tests for each other.       If ajar
containing a little lime-water be put into ajar of this gas, it speeculv
becomes turbid, the gas uniting with the tme, and producing chalk
(the carbonate of lime), which is insoluble in water.
    This gas is produced in large quantities by the respiration of
animals, as may be proved by respiring through a tube immersed in
lime-water, when the water will oe instantly rendered turbid from
the formation of chalk.
                         CARBON AND HYDROGEN.
    To the combination of these elements in various proportions, and
with the occasional addition of other substances, we are indebted for
all, or nearly all, our means of obtaining light and heat. Coal, wood,
spirit, oil, and all the varieties of fats, are composed principally of

  carbon and hydrogen, and may easily be converted into the gas with
 which our houses and streets are lighted, which is nearly pure carbu-
  retted hydrogen.
     There are but two definite gaseous compounds of these two ele
 ments, the carburetted hydrogen, and bi-carburetted or olefiant gas.
 The first is easily procured by stirring the bottom of stagnant water
 in a hot summer's day, and collecting the buobles m a bottle
 filled with water and inverted over the place where the bubbles rise.
 This gas burns with a yellowish flame, and when mixed with a certain
 proportion of air, or oxygen gas, explodes with great violence on the
 application of a flame. It is the much dreaded fire-damp generated '
 so profusely in some coal-mines, and causing such fearful destruction
 to life and property when accidentally inflamed.     It is this gas also,
 in a state of low combustion, which produces the lambent flame fre
 quently seen in the evenings hovering over marshes, and called the
 " Will o' the wisp." This appearance is still
                                                   regarded with super
 stitious horror by the uneducated countryman.
     The other compound, the bi-carburetted hydrogen, forms by far
 the principal part of the gas used for illumination; and, in fact,
 whatever substance is employed for artificial light, whether oil, tallow,
 wax, &c. &c., it is converted into this gas by heat, and then furnishes
 the light by its own combustion.
     This gas has some very curious properties, and may be obtained
 nearly pure by mixing in a retort, toy carefully, one part of spirits
 of wme and four of sulphuric acid. Should the heat produced by
 the mixture be insufficient to decompose the spirit, a lamp must be
 placed under the retort, when the gas will speedily be disengaged,
 and will come over in great abundance ; it may be collected over
 water.
     This gas is transparent, colourless, will not support combustion,
 but is itself inflammable, burning with a brilliant white light, and
 being converted into carbonic acid and water.      If  mixed with three
 or four times its bulk of oxygen, or with common atmospheric air in
 much larger proportions, it explodes with
 great violence.
     This gas is sometimes called "olefiant
 gas," from the property it has of forming an
 oily substance when nuxed with chlorine.
                  EXPERIMENT.
     Into a jar standing over water half full
of this gas.pass    an equal quantity of chlo
rine gas. The gases will speedily "unite and
form an oily looking liquid, which may be
collected from the sides of the jar as it
trickles down. By continually supplying
the jar with the two gases as they combine, a considerable       quantity

390                      EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
of this substance may be collected.   Care should be taken that the
olefiant gas is rather in excess.
   The substance produced is insoluble in water, with which it should
be washed by shaking them together in a tube, and has a pleasant
sweetish taste and aromatic smell, somewhat resembling ether.
                                   COAL GAS.
   The gas so universally employed for the purposes of illumination
is a nuxture of the carburetted and the bi-carburetted hydrogen,
with minute portions of other gases scarcely worth mentioning. It
is procured by submitting coals to a red heat in iron retorts, having
a tube passing from one end, along which passes all the fluid and
gaseous matter separated from the coal, namely, gas tar, ammoniacal
liquor, and various gases, carburetted hydrogen, carbonic acid, sul
phuretted hydrogen, sulphurous acid, &c. &c.      The tar and ammo
niacal liquor remain in the vessel in which the tubes from the retorts
terminate, and the gaseous productions are conveyed through water
and lime to separate the impurities ; the remaining gas, now fit for
use, passes into large iron vessels, called gasometers, inverted over
water (like the jars in a pneumatic trough), whence it is sent through
pipes and distributed where required. What remains in the retorts
is called coke. It consists principally of charcoal, mixed with the
earthy and metallic particles contained in the coal.
                               EXPERIMENT.
  If  you possess an iron bottle, fill it with powdered opal, and attach
a flexible tube to it,
                     and put   itin the fire as soon as
                                               :               becomes red

hot, large quantities of smoke will escape from the end of the tube,
being the gas mixed with all its impurities. By passing             through
                                                                      it
water  (if mixed with lime    will be better), the gas may be collected
                              it
in jars standing over water, and submitted to experiment.              If
                                                                      you do

forms explosive mixtures with atmospheric air, the mines where
abounds could not be worked except at the greatest risk until about
the beginning of the present century, when Sir H. Davy, while prose
cuting some researches on the nature of flame, found that flame would
not pass through metallic tubes, and he gradually reduced the length
of tne tubes, until he found fine iron wire gauze formed an effectual
barrier against the passage of flame.    He then thought that      the       if
light in lantern were surrounded with this gauze,
        a                                              might safely be

 instantly cause an explosion.     Upon submitting the lamp to experi
 ment, he found that by passing coal gas by degrees into a vessel
 in which one of his lamps was suspended, the flame first became
 much larger, and then was extinguished, the cylinder of gauze being
 filled with a pale flame, and though the gauze sometimes became red-
 hot, it did not ignite the gas outside.   As the supply of coal gas was
 diminished,   the wick of the lamp was  rekindled, and all went on as at
first. A coil of platinum wire was afterwards suspended in the
lamps, which becomes intensely heated by the burning gas, and gives
out sufficient light to enable the miner to see to work. As long as
the gauze is perfect it is impossible for the external air to be kindled
by the wick of the lamp, but the miners are so careless that they will
often remove the gauze to get a better light, to look for a tool, or
some cause equally trivial, and many lives have been lost in conse
quence of such carelessness.
     The effect of fine wi^e gauze in preventing the passage of flame
may be shown by bringing a piece of the gauze gradually over the
 liruiic of a spirit-lamp, until it nearly touches the wick, when the
flame will be nearly extinguished, but the vapour of the spirit passes
through, and may be lighted on the upper side of the gauze, which
will thus have a flame on either side, though totally unconnected
with each other. The flame from a gas-burner will answer as well as
the spirit-lamp.
     Nearly all the fluids, and solids also, used for procuring artificial
light, such as naphtha, various oils, tallow, wax, spermaceti, spirits
of wine, ether, &c. &c., are compounds of carbon and hydrogen in
different proportions, with the occasional addition of some other
elements, especially oxygen and hydrogen, in the proportions to form
water ; as a general rule, those bodies containing the greatest pro
portion of carbon give the most light, though not necessarily the most
heat.
                               PHOSPHORUS.
   The next body we have to notice is phosphorus, a most remarkable
substance, procured from the earthy part of bones by a process not
worth detailing here. It should be always kept under water, and the
naked fingers should not be allowed even to touch         it,for the smallest
piece getting   under  the nail will inflame  the first time the hand comes
near the fire, and produce    a  sore verv painful and difficult to heal.
It should be cut under water      by
                                  a    knife or scissors, and removed with
a pair of forceps.    Its combustible properties have been frequently
mentioned.     It has also the property of shining in the dark, so that
if  you write on   a  wall with   a   solution of phosphorus in oil, the
letters will appear luminous in the dark — there     is   no danger, except

   Of the compounds of phosphorus with oxygen we have nothing to

   It may be procured in either of two ways, according to the purpose
for which it is wanted.     The simplest way is to put a lump or two of
phosphuret of lime into a saucer, about two inches in depth, con-
tainine some very diluted hydrochloric acid; bubbles of gas will
speedily arise, and bursting on the surface of the fluid will burn with
a slight explosion, and a circular wreath of smoke will rise into the
atmosphere, enlarging as it rises, and wreathing itself round and
round in the most elegant forms. Care must be token that the phos
phuret is fresh, and has been kept in a well-closed bottle, or the ex
periment will fail. The apartment must be free from draughts.                  If
you desire to collect the gas, another method must be employed.
   Fill a small retort quite full, neck and all, of a solution of caustic
potash, drop five or six pieces of phosphorus into            it,
                                                          place the finger
 on the end of the retort, and immerse        itin basin also containing hot

 solution of potash, remove the finger, and on applying the heat of lamp a
 to the retort, the gas will soon be disengaged rapidly, and drive out the
 fluid    inthe retort
                     ;   itthen escapes into the air, when inflames with the

jars   filled  with  the  potash solution, and   held  over the mouth of the
retort. The object in using         hot  solution of potash in the basin is,
that when the gas ceases to be given off, and the heat of the lamp is
withdrawn, the hot fluid may gradually fill the vacuum which will
form in the retort, and so prevent its being broken.
    This gas   is  transparent and invisible, like most other gases.       It is
very poisonous      if  inhaled.If   kept for any time,    itloses its property
of spontaneous inflammation, and must therefore be made at the time
it   isrequired.

porcelain — very few of the metals are capable of resisting its action,
lead being nearly the only common metal possessed of this power.

 the manner of engraving on copper, by coatmg it with a thin covering
 of wax, placing a paper over the wax, and then drawing any design
with a sharp-pointed instrument, when, on removing the paper, the
wax-coating will be found to be removed wherever the mstrument
has passed over it.       Now invert this glass over the fumes of the acid
for half an hour or so, and then heat the glass so as to soften the

   We have    a few words to say about class of bodies called metals,
                                                  a
which are of the utmost importance to mankind, and indeed without
some of them, especially iron, few of the arts of civilized life could
 exist.
    About fifty-eight or fifty-nine substances are now'included in the
list of metals some of them, however, are only supposed to exist,
                  ;
such as ammonium, the supposed base of ammonia; and very many are

able properties of which others might be destitute.
    Several metals have been known from the earliest period of which
we have any record such were iron, gold, silver, copper, lead, tin,
                            ;
mercury, and probably zinc, or at least its ores; for brass, which        an      is
alloy  of copper  and  zmc,     frequently
                                 is         mentioned  in  the early part of
the Old Testament.        In the 16th century others were discovered,
such as antimony and bismuth.         In the last century, cobalt, arsenic,
platinum,   nickel, manganese,    and chromium,   together with several un
important metals, were discovered            by
                                           various philosophers     while in  ;
the present century, Dr. Wollaston discovered rhodium, the hardest
and nearly the most indestructible of all the metals        and   few years
                                                                    ;        a

later, Sir Humphrey Davy found that the alkalies, potash and soda,
with many of the earths as they were called, had each a metal for its
base, to which he gave the Latm name of the alkali or earth, with the
termination um, as potassium the base of potassa, soduon of soda, cal-
wim of cak (lime), &c.
    Until Sir H. Davy's discovery of the metals of the alkalies, great
specific gravity was regarded as one of the most striking character
istics of a metal, the lightest of them being much heavier than the
heaviest earth; but potassium is very much lighter than water, and
not much heavier than spirits of wine. The other metals vary from
a specific gravity of nearly twenty-one— or twenty-one tunes heavier
than an equal bulk of water — that of platinum, to somewhat less than
seven, which is the specific gravity of antimony.
    When pure, they all have a lustre, differing indeed among them
selves, but so peculiar that it is called the metallic lustre; for
instance, gold and copper are yellow and red— nearly all the others
white, but of a different shade ; Mill there is no mistaking their
metallic character, no other substances at all equalling them in this
respect. They are also all perfectly opaque. They are all good con
ductors of heat and electricity, though some possess that property to
a greater extent than others.
    Many of them are what is called malleable, that        is, may be ex
tended or spread out      by rolling, or beating them with a hammer; and
 ductile, or have the property of being drawn out into wire. Gold,
 silver, copper, and iron, are the most remarkable in this respect.
    All the metals are fusible, but require very different degrees of
 heat to render them fluid, — -platinum requiring the heat of the oxy-
 hydrogen blowpipe, while tm melts in the flame of         a    candle, and
 mercury  is  fluid at all temperatures in this climate, but becomes solid
 at 40° rahr. below  0,   — temperature occasionally experienced in the
                           a
 Arctic regions, where the mercurial thermometer      is  useless, the mer-
 curv  becoming    solid.
     They are  all excellent conductors of heat and electricity, and have
 the property of reflecting light and forming mirrors      ;   for looking-
 glasses owe their power of reflecting objects principally to what is
                                is,
 called the "silvering;" that   a        mixture of mercury and tin spread
 over the back of the glass, which being transparent, allows the nnage
 formed on the metal to pass through it.
                               POTASSIUM.
   Potassium was discovered     by  Sir H. Davy  in  the beginning of the
present century,  while  acting upon potash      with   the enormous gal
vanic battery of the Royal     Institution,  consisting of 2,000 pairs of
4-inch plates.  It   is  brilliant white metal, so soft as to be easily
                          a
cut with a  penknife, and so light as to swim upon water, on which      it
acts with great energy, uniting with the oxygen, and liberating the
hydrogen, which takes fire as   it  escapes.

                              EXPERIMENT.
   Trace some continuous lines on paper with a camel's-hair brash
dipped in water, and place a piece of potassium about the size of a
pea on one of the lines, and it will follow the course of the pencil,
taking fire as it runs, and burning with a purplish light. The paper
will be found covered with a solution of ordinary potash.   If Turmeric
paper    be used,  the course  of the potassium   wfll be marked    with
a deep brown colour.— Corollary.       Hence, if you touch potassium
with wet fingers you will burn them !
   If   a small piece of the metal be placed on a piece of ice, it will
instantly take fire, and form a deep hole, which will be found to con
tain a solution of potash.
   In consequence of its great affinity for oxygen, potassium must be
kept in some fluid destitute of that element, such as naphtha.
   Saltpetre, or nitre, is a compound of this metal (or rather its
oxide) with nitric acid.    It is one of the ingredients of gunpowder,
and has the property of quickening the combustion of all combustible
bodies.
                              EXPERIMENT.
   Rub together in a warm mortar three parts of powdered nitre, two
of dry carbonate of potash, and one of flowers of brimstone ; place
a small quantity of the mixture in an iron ladle, and heat it over
the fire, when it will speedily melt, and then explode with a very
loud noise ; and if held under a foul chimney, will save the expense
of a chimney-sweep — but avoid cooking time.
   Another salt of potash remarkable for the same property,      in even
a greater degree, is the chlorate of potash.
                              EXPERIMENTS.
   1. Triturate together in a dry mortar a few grains of flowers of
sulphur with a small quantity of the chlorate of potash, and a suc
cession of sharp explosions like the crack of a whip will be pro
duced.
   2. Substitute half a grain of phosphorus for the sulphur, and the
action will be much more violent. The hand should be defended by
a thick glove, and the eyes carefully guarded, in making this experi
ment.
   3. Mix very carefully a little of this salt reduced to powder \rith
a little lump sugar also powdered, and drop on the mixture a little
strong sulphuric acid, and it will instantly burst into flame.      This
expernnent also requires caution.
   Want of space precludes us from considering the individual metals
and their compounds in detail ; it must suffice to describe some ex
periments showing some of their properties.

    The different affinities of the metals for oxygen may be exhibited
in various ways.     The silver or zinc tree has already been described,
page 363.
                              EXPERIMENTS.
    1. Into a solution of nitrate of silver in distilled water immerse a
clean plate or slip of copper.      The solution which was colourless
will soon begin to assume a greenish tint, and the piece of copper
will be covered with a coating of a light grey colour, which is the
silver formcrlv united to the nitric acid, which has been displaced by
the greater affinity or liking of the oxygen and acid for the copper.
    2. When the copper is no longer coated, but remains clean and
bright when immersed in the fluid, all the silver has been deposited,
and the glass now contains a solution of copper.
    Place a piece of clean iron in the solution, and it will almost
instantly be coated with a film of copper, and this will continue until
the whole of that metal is removed, and its place filled by an equiva
lent quantity of iron, so that nitrate of iron is found in the liquid.
The oxygen and nitric acid remain unaltered in quantity or quality
during these changes, being merely transferred from one metal to
another.
    A piece of zinc will displace the iron in like manner, leaving
a solution of nitrate of zinc.
    Nearly all the colours used in the arts are produced by metals and
their combinations; indeed, one is named chromium, from a Greek
word signifying colour, on account of the beautiful tints obtained
from its various combinations with oxygen and the other metals. All
 the various tints of green, orange, yellow, and red, are obtained from
 this metal.
    Solutions of most of the metallic salts give precipitates with solu
 tions of alkalies and their salts, as well as with many other sub
 stances, such as what are usually called prussiate of potash, hydro-
 sulphnret of ammonia, &c. ; and the colours differ according to the
 metal employed, and so small a quantity is required to produce the
 colour, that the solutions before mixing may be nearly colourless.
                               EXPERIMENTS.
    1. To a solution of sulphate of iron add a drop or two of a solu

    2. Substitute sulphate of copper for iron, and the colour will be
a rich brown.
    3. Another blue, of quite a different tint, may be produced by
letting a few drops of a solution of ammonia fall into one of sulphate
of copper — a precipitate of a light blue falls down, which is dissolved
by an additional quantity of the ammonia, and forms a transparent
solution of the most splendid rich blue colour.

infusion of galls, and the colour will become a bluish-black — in fact,
ink. A little tea will answer as well as the infusion of galls. This
is the reason why certain stuffs formerly in general use for dressing
gowns for gentlemen were so objectionable ; for as they were indebted
to a salt of iron for their colour, buff as it was           a drop of tea

   5. Put into a largish test tube two or three small pieces of grarfolated
zinc, fill it about one-third full of water, put in a few grains of iodine
and boil the water, which will at first acquire a dark purple colour,
gradually fading as the iodine combines with the zinc. Add a little
more iodine from time to time, until the zinc is nearly all dissolved.
If  a few drops of this solution be added to an equally colourless
solution of corrosive sublimate (a salt of mercury), a precipitate will
take place of a splendid scarlet colour, brighter if possible than ver
milion, which is also a preparation of mercury.

   Some of the metals assume certain definite forms in returning
from the fluid to the solid state. Bismuth shows this property more
readily than most others.

become solid break a hole in     and pour out the still fluid metal

    The greater number of salts have a tendency to assume regular
forms, or become crystallized, when passing from the fluid to the solid
state ; and the size and regularity of the crystals depends in a great
measure on the slow or rapid escape of the fluid in which they were
dissolved. Sugar is a capital example of this property ; the ordinary
loaf-sugar being rapidly boiled down, as it is called : while to make
sugar-candy, which is nothing but sugar in a crystallized form, the
solution is allowed to evaporate slowly, and as it cools it forms into
those beautiful crystals termed sugar-candy.     The threads found in
the centre of some of the crystals   are merely placed for the purpose
of hastening the formation of the crystals.

 vitriol, and place in them rough and irregular pieces of clinker from
 stoves, or wire baskets, and set them by m a cool place, where they
 will be free from dust, and in a few days crystals of the several salts
 will deposit themselves on the baskets, &c. ; they should then be
 taken out of the solutions, and dried in an oven not too hot, when
 they form very pretty ornaments for a room.

cause the crystallization to take place before the proper time.

 solution of carbonate of potash, or soda, and the red colour will
 gradually give way to the original blue ; continue adding the alkaline
 solution, and the fluid will assume a bright green colour. .Now
 resume the acid, and as it is dropped in, the colour will again change
 from green to blue, and from blue to red.        Now this simple experi
 ment illustrates three points ; first, that acids change the colour of
 most vegetable blues and greens to red ; second, that alkalies change
 most blues and reds to green ; and third, that when the acid and
 alkali are united together, they both lose their property of changing
 colour, and become what is called a neutral salt, i. «. a compound
 possessing the properties of neither of its constituents.
     TO  CONVERT WATER      INTO A SOLID BY PASSING GAS INTO IT.
    Prepare a Florence flask by fitting a cork into the neck, through
                            which passes a glass tube, bent twice at right
                            angles, and put into it a mixture of one part
                            of powdered glass or flint, and two parts of
                            fluor-spar ; pour on it some strong sulphuric
                            acid.   Upon the application of heat, a gas
                            will be given off which will pass along the
                            tube into a tall glass jar nearly full of water ;
                             the bottom of the jar should contain mercury
                            for an inch or two, that the gas may escape
                            from the tube before it reaches the water, or
                            the tube would be speedily choked up by the
                            silica. As the gas reaches the water it is
                            decomposed, and deposits a gelatinous sub
                            stance, which absorbs as it were the water,
                            and at length becomes solid.        Great care
                            must be taken that the tube does not dip too
                            deeply beneath the mercury, or the gas will
                            not be able to escape ; and as soon as the ex
periment is over, the flask must be placed under a chimney or in the
open air, the pungency of the fumes being almost unbearable.
                                EXPERIMENT.
    To show that the heat abstracted     by the boiling of one liquid will
freeze another, fill a tall narrow glass about half full of cold water
(the colder the better), and place in it a thin glass tube containing
some ether.     Put them under the receiver of an air-pump. As you
exhaust the air, the ether will begin to boil, until at length, by con
tinuing the exhaustion, the water immediately surrounding the tube
of ether will freeze, and a tolerably large piece of ice may thus be
obtained.
   Ether evaporates so rapidly even under the pressure of the atmo
sphere, that a small animal such as a mouse may be actually frozen
to death by constantly dropping ether upon it.       If poured on the hand

it  produces a degree of cold that soon becomes, to say the least, un
pleasant.
                                EXPERIMENT.
    Place a flat saucer, containing about a pound of oil of vitriol, under
the receiver of the air-pump, and set in it a watch-glass, containing a
little water, supported on a stand with glasi legs. Exhaust the re
ceiver, when the water will evaporate, but without boiling, and the
vapour being absorbed as it forms by the oil of vitriol, the vacuum is
preserved, and the evaporation continues, until the vapour has ab
stracted so much caloric from the remainder of the water that it is all
at once converted into ice.

    Two or three retort-stands, with metal rings of various sizes to fit
on them.

     Wax taper and iron wire to fasten it to when making experiments
 in combustion, &c.
     A very fair air-pump may now be purchased for a few guineas, and
 will be a great acquisition to the young chemist; the receivers for the
 air-pump must be accurately ground at the bottom, that they may
 adhere closely to the metal plate of the pump, and should be greased
 with some simple cerate each time they are used.

                              ELECTRICITY.
   No branch of science is more capable of affording amusement, com
bined with instruction, than electricity, and there are few sciences in
which the experiments are more easily performed.        We would there
fore especially recommend it to our young friends.
   The term electricity is derived from the Greek word, electrou, sig
nifying amber, because electrical attraction was first discovered from
its being noticed that when amber was rubbed into a certain degree of
warmth, it had the power of attracting small bodies to itself.
   Electricity therefore primarily treats of the phenomena and effects
produced by the friction or rubbing together of certain bodies called
electrics.    These consist of glass, amber, resinous matters, silks,
hair, wool,   feathers,  various vegetable substances, and atmospheric
air.
               SIMPLE   MEANS OP PRODUCING     ELECTRICITY.
   To show the nature of electrical action, rub a piece of sealing-wax
or amber upon the coat-sleeve, and it will be found that while warm
by the friction it attracts light bodies, such as straws or small pieces
of paper.     If a clean glass tube be rubbed several times through a
silken or leather cloth, and presented to any small substances, it will
immediately attract or repel them : and if a poker suspended by a dry

                                ELECTRICITY.                         *05
silk string be presented to its upper end, then the lower end of the
poker will exhibit the same phenomena as the
tube   itself, which shows     that the   electrical
fluid passes through the metal.       But if for a
metalEe body a stick of glass or sealing-wax
be substituted, these phenomena will not occur,
which proves that the electrical fluid does not
pass through these substances.
    By this it will be perceived that besides
the class of bodies called electrics, there is
another which we call conductors.            These
bodies cannot    be   excited themselves, but  have
the power of transmitting the electric fluid
through them.        These bodies comprise all the
metals, some metal and metallic ores ; the
fluids of animal bodies, water, and other fluids, except oil, ice, snow ,
earthy substances, smoke, steam ; and even a vacuum.
    When any electrified conductor is wholly
 surrounded by non-conductors, so that the
 electric fluid cannot pass from the con
 ductor along conductors to the earth, it is
 said to be insulated : thus the human body
is a conductor of electricity — but if a
 person standing on a glass stool (as repre
 sented in the drawing) be charged with
 electricity, the electric fluid cannot pass
 from him to the earth, and he is said to be
 positively electrified, because he has more
 than his natural share ; he is also insulated,
 and if he be touched by another person
 standing on the ground, sparks will be exhibited at the point of
 contact, where also the person touching will feel a pricking sensation.
                 ATTRACTION     AND REPULSION     EXHIBITED.
    In  order to illustrate certain remarkable facts in
 this science of an amusing character, attention
 must be directed to the figure A B, which is a metal        A1
 stand; c is a small piece of cork or pith, which
 is suspended from the hook by a dry silken thread.
 Having rubbed an electron, as a dry rod of glass,
  and presented it to c, the ball will be instantane-                  *C
  ously attracted to the glass, and will adhere to it.
  After they remain in contact for a few seconds, if
 the glass be withdrawn without being touched by              B
 the fingers, and again presented to the ball, the ^g§
 latter will be repelled instead of attracted, as in

deprived of its electricity, and if after this has been done we present
a piece of sealing-wax in place of the glass formerly employed, the very
same phenomena will take place.              On the first application the ball
will be attracted, and on the second repelled.1
   Before the young reader can perform any very important experi
ments with electricity, he must become possessed^ of an ELECTRICAL
MACHINE, which is an instrument contrived for the purpose of rubbing
together the surfaces of electrics and non-electrics.               They generally
consist of a cylinder, or plate of glass, and a piece of silk for it to rub
against, covered with an amalgam, the method of preparing which we
shall hereafter describe.
                  HOW TO HAKE AN ELECTRICAL MACHINE.
   It is very easy to make a glass machine of the cylindrical form, if
the maker cannot afford to buy one.               First procure a common wine
bottle of good dimensions, and thickish glass.               Drill a hole through
its bottom, by igniting a piece of worsted tied round it dipped in tur
pentine, which will do this.         Through this hole and the mouth pass a
spindle   as represented     iu the cut. The end of B should be squared to
fix a handle on, and the spindle should be fixed firmly in the bottle.
The bottle is then to be fixed in a frame in the following manner:
the end of the spindle c passes through a hole at B ; and the other
end at c has the handle for turning the machine.
   Next make a cushion of wash-leather stuffed with wool, and fas
tened to the top of a frame of the following figure.              This frame is to
be of such a height that the cushion shall press against the sides of
the bottle, and a piece of black silk is sewn on to the top of the
cushion, and hangs over the bottle D.                   The cushion should be

smeared      with an amalgam, formed by melting to
gether in the bowl of a tobacco-pipe, one part of
tin with two of zinc; to which, while fluid, should
be added six parts of mercury.          These should be
stirred about till quite cold, and then reduced to a
fine powder in a mortar, and mixed with a sufficient
quantity of lard to form a thickish paste. When all
is done, the machine is complete.                              CUSHIOS.
                               THE CONDUCTOR.
    The electricity being generated by the friction produced between
the rubber and the bottle from the motion imparted by the handle, it
is necessary to draw it off for use. This is performed by what is
called a conductor. This is made in the followmg manner.           At right
angles    to one end of a cylinder   of  wood  about  two inches and a-half
in diameter, and six inches long, fix a small wooden cylinder about
thre-equarters of an inch in diameter, and three inches long, rounded
at both ends — the other end of the larger cylinder is also to be rounded.
Cover the whole with tinfoil, and mount it on a stand on a glass rod.
When used, it is to be placed with the even piece in a line even with,
and about half an inch from, the bottle, and it should be of such a
height as to come just below the silk apron.         When it is wished to
charge     a Leyden jar, it is to be placed at  the round end of the con
 ductor. By these simple means a great variety of pleasing experi
ments may De performed ; but to show the various phenomena conr
nected with this interesting study, we shall now describe an electrical
machine of the newest construction, and perform our experiments
with it.
        THE PLATE ELECTRICAL MACHINE.
    formerly the electrical machine was
made in the form of a cylinder, but now it
 consists of a plate A, as seen in the en
 graving.      The plate is turned by the
handle v through the rubber B B, which
 diffuses the excitement over the glass. The
points or balls at each side of the plate
 carry off a constant stream of positive
 electricity to the prime conductor c. Nega
 tive electricity is generated by insulatmg
 the conductor to which the cushion is
 attached, and continuing the prime con
 ductor with the ground, so as to carry off
 the fluid collected from the plate.
           HOW TO DRAW SPARKS PROM THE TIP OF THE NOSE.
     If  the person who works the machine be supported on a stool
 having glass legs, and connected with the conductor by means of a

glass rod, the electricity will pass from the conductor to him, and as
it cannot get away, owmg to the glass on which he stands being a
non-conductor, any person on touching him can draw the electricity
from him, which will exhibit itself in small sparks as it passes to the
person who touches him.        If touched on the nose, sparks of fire will
issue from it.
              HOW TO GET A JAB, TOLL OF ELECTRICITY.
   A  most useful piece of electrical apparatus is called the Leyden
                          jar, here represented.         It is employed for the
                           purpose of obtaining a quantity of electricity,
                           which may be applied to any substance.               It
                           consists  of  a  glass jar,  coated  both   inside and
                           without, four-fifths of the way up, with tinfoil.
                           A knob rises through a wooden top commu
                           nicating with the inside of the jar. When
                           it is wished to charge the jar, this knob is
                           applied to the prime conductor of the elec
                           trical machine when in action, and a quantity
                           of electricity being given off, the jar will re
                           main charged with it till a connexion is made,
                           by some good conductor of electricity, be
                           tween the knob and the outside tinfoil.               A
piece of brass chain must hang from the stem that carries the knob,
and connect it "with the interior of the jar.
                      THE ELECTRICAL BATTERY.
   If several of these jars be united, an enormous quantity of elec
                                       tricity can be collected ; but in
                                       arranging them, all the interior coat
                                       ings must be made to communi
                                       cate by metallic rods, and a similar
                                        union must be effected among the
                                       exterior coatings.       '\Yhen thus ar
                                       ranged,    the    whole   series may be
                                       charged as      if they formed but one
                                       jar.
                                           For the purpose of making a
                                       direct communication between the
                                       inner or outer coatings of a jar
                                        or battery, by which a discharge is
                                       effected, an instrument called a dis
                                       charging rod is employed.           It con
                                        sists of two bent metallic rods,
                                       terminating at one end by brass
                                       balls, and connected       at another    by
                                       a   joint which is fixed to the         end

                                               a
of the balls being separated at certain distances.    When opened to
the proper degree, one of the balls is made to touch the exterior
coatmg, and the other ball is then brought into contact with the
knob of the jar, when a discharge is effected ; while the glass handle
secures the person holding it from the effects of the shock.
                    DANCING      BALLS AND DOLLS.
   Get two round pieces of wood, AB,
and   coat them with tin foil; or two
pieces of metal plate; attach one of
them to the prime conductor by a chain,
and let it hang about two or three
inches from the knob.   Place some pith-
balls upon the bottom piece of wood
B, and bring it under the other.      Im
mediately  this is done,  and   the upper
piece is charged by electricity from the
machine, the pith-balls will jump up and
down, and from one to the other with
great rapidity. If some of the pith be
formed mto little figures, they will also
dance and leap about in the most grotes
que manner.    The same may be made to
dance by merely holding the inside of a
dry glass tumbler to the prime conductor
for a few minutes, while the machine is
in action, and then whelm it over them,
when they will jump about to the no
small astonishment of the spectators,
as the cause of their motions is not
quite so apparent.
                       THE ELECTRICAL KISS.
  This amusing experiment is performed by means of the electrical
stool.  Let any lady challenge a gentleman not acquainted with the
experiment to favour her with a salute.  The lady thereupon mounts
the glass stool, and takes    hold of a chain connected with the prime
conductor. The machine        being then put in motion the gentleman
approaches the lady, and       immediately he attempts to imprint the
seal of soft affection upon   her coral lips, a spark willfly   in
                                                               his face,
which generally deters nim    from his rash and wicked intention.

  Bells may be made to ring       electricity in the following manner.

                  WORKING     POWER OP ELECTRICITY.
   This may  be shown    in a variety of ways.         The subjoined machine
will exhibit the principle upon which many ingenious                toys may be
                                         made by the young philosopher.

and to the instrument at B, the electricity passes over the pillar B,

to be turned round on an inclined plane till it reaches the top.

 rights, B B ; c c are two small pulleys, over which a silken cord can
 puull easily; E is another silken line stretched across from one upright
 to another; on these silken cords two pieces of thin cardboard
 covered with tinfoil, and cut so as to represent clouds, are to be
 fixed horizontally, and made to communicate by means of thin wires,
£&n&.g, one with the inside, and the other with tue outside of a charged
 iar, D. Now, by pulling the loop of the silk line, D, the clouds will
 be brought near the cloud 2 ; continue this slowly, until the clouds
 (which are farnished with two small brass balls) are within an inch of
 each other, when a beautiful flash strongly resembling lightning in
 miniature, will pass from one cloud to the other, restoring electrical
 equilibrium.

     If the jar D be put behind the stand, and the cloud 2 removed, a
 vessel communicating by means of a wire with the outside of the jar,
  may be swum in water under the remaining cloud ; the mast being
 made of separate pieces, and but slightly joined together.        When
 the cloud is passed over the vessel, the mast will be struck and shat

   This apparatus is capable of affording- much amusement: A is
a stand of wood, B is a common Leyden jar, out of which proceed
the wires H H, one terminating in ball r, the other in the ball D, to
which are attached a number of pith birds by silken strings ; E is a

                                  " To  play with fire
                  They say is dangerous ; what is it then

                  With thunder! "      TYLER.
GAIVAKISH    is now identified with electricity, and may be considered
as a branch    of that science. It owes its name and origin to the
experiments    on  animal irritability made in 1790 by M. Galvani,
a professor  of anatomy at Bologna.         These experiments were sug
gested by the following circumstance :
                                            —
                         ORIGIN   OP GALVANISM.
   It  happened that the wife of Galvani, who was consumptive,
was advised to take as an article of food some soup made of the
flesh of frogs.   Several of these creatures were killed and skinned,
and were lymg on the table in the laboratory close to an electrical
machine, with which a pnpil of the professor was making experi
ments.    While the machme was in action , he chanced to tonch the
bare nerve of the leg of one of the frogs with the blade of a knife
that he had in his hand, when suddenly the whole limb was thrown
into violent convulsions. Galvani was not present when this occurred,
 but being informed of it he immediately set himself to investigate

the cause.   He found that it was only when a spark was drawn from
the prime conductor, and when the knife or any other good conductor
was in contact with the nerve, that the contracting took place, and
after a time he discovered that the effect was independent of the
electrical machine, and might be equally well produced by making
a metallic communication between the outside muscle and the crural
            SIMPLE   EXPERIMENT      TO   EXCITE GALVANIC ACTION.
   If the young experimenter will obtain a piece of zinc of the size
of half a crown and place it on the top of his tongue,' and place
a half-crown underneath        it,
                             and bring the edges of the half-crown
and zinc in contact in front of his tongue, he will receive    slight     a
shock, and    peculiar taste will be imparted to his mouth at the
              a
moment of contact.
                      WITH METAL PLATES IN WATER.
  If   we   take two plates of different kinds of metal, platuia or
copper,   and  zinc, for example, and immerse them in pure water,
                              having wires attached to them above,
                              then     the wire of each
                                      if                     brought into
                                                                     is
                              contact in another vessel of water,     gal     a
                              vanic circle will be formed, the water will
                              be slowly decomposed, its oxygen will be
                              fixed on the zinc wire, and at the same
                              time current of electricity will be trans
                                      a
                              mitted through the liquid to the platina or
                              copper wire, on the end of which the other
                             ]-_
                              element of water, namely, the hydrogen,
                              will make its appearance in the form of
                              minute gas bubbles.     The electrical cur
rent passes back again into the zinc at the points    of its contact with
the platina, and thus   a continued current     kept up, and hence
                                                     is                        it   is
called a  galvanic circle. The moment the circuit          brokenis    se     by
parating   the  wires, the  current  ceases,  but     againis renewed               by
making them touch either in or out of the water.                If
                                                           small quantity
                                                                     a
of sulphuric acid be added to the water, the phenomenon will be more
apparent.    The end of the wire attached to the piece of platinum or
copper is  called the positive pole of the battery, and that of the wire
attached to the zinc the negative pole.
  The current of electricity here generated will be extremely feeble,
but this can be easily increased          by
                                    multiplying the glasses and the

number of the pieces of metal.          If we take six such glasses instead
of one, partially fill them with dilute sulphuric acid, and put a piece
of zinc and copper into each, connecting them by means of copper
wire from glass to glass through the whole series, a stronger current
of electricity w" ! be the result. The experimenter must be careful
not to let the wire and zinc touch each other at the bottom of the
tumblers, and must also remember that the copper of glass 1 is con
nected with the zinc of glass 2, and so on.
                    TO  MAKE A MAGNET BY GALVANISM.
     To effect this, make a connexion between the poles of the above
 or any excited battery with the two ends of a wire formed into
 a spiral coil, by bending common bonnet wire closely round a cylin
 der, or tube, of about an inch in diameter ; into this coil introduce
 a needle, or piece of steel wire, laying it lengthways down the circles
 of the coil. In a few minutes after the electric fluid has passed
 through the spiral wire, and consequently round the needle or wire,
 the latter will be found to be strongly magnetized and to possess all
 the properties of a magnet.
                   EFFECTS    OP GALVANISM    ON  A MAGNET.
     If  a galvanic current, or any electric current, be made to pass
 along a wire, under which and in a line with it a compass is placed, it
 will be found that the needle will no longer point north and south,
 but will take a direction nearly across the current, and point almost
  east and west.
                     CHANGE OP COLOUR BY GALVANISM.
     Put   a tea-spoonful   of sulphate of soda into a cup, and dissolve it
  in hot water ; pour     a little cabbage blue into the solution, and put a
  portion into two glasses, connecting them by a piece of linen or cotton
  cloth previously moistened in the same solution. On putting one of
  the wires of the galvanic pole into each glass, the acid accumulates in
  the one, turning the blue to a red, and the alkali in the other, ren
  dering it green.     If  the wires be now reversed, the acid accumulates
  eventually in the glass where the alkali appeared, while the alkali
  passes to the glass where the acid was.
                              THE GALVANIC    SHOCK.
      If  the ends of the wires of a galvanic battery be placed in sepa
  rate basins of water, then, on dipping the fingers of each hand in
  the basin, a smart shock will be felt, with a particular aching accom
  panied with trembling. With a strong battery this effect is felt as
   high as the shoulders.       The shock will also be felt by simply holding
   the galvanic wires, one in each hand, provided the hands be moistened
   with salt and water. Several persons may receive the shock together

                              THE ELECTROTYPE.
     The electro-galvanic current has in no case been more interestingly
 employed than in the process of electrotyping, and which consists of
 a mode of obtainmg the copy of coins, medals, engraved plates, and
 other objects, which may be easily illustrated.
              HOW TO MAKE       AN ELECTROTYPE        APPARATUS.
     Take an earthen jar and a porous tube, fill the tube with ten parts
                           of water and one of sulphuric acid ; put it into
                           the jar, into which pour as much of a solution
                           of sulphate of copper (blue vitriol) as will fill
                           three parts of it.     Place in the tube a piece
                           of zinc, to which a copper wire is soldered
                           and bent round, so that one end be immersed
                           in the sulphate of copper, and a deposit of the
                           copper will be immediately formed upon the
                           wire.    If  there be plenty of acid and water,
                           so as to allow of the action enduring for a
                           long time, this process will go on till it has
                           deposited all the copper. This is the principle
 upon which electrotyping proceeds, a principle referable to chenucal
 attraction.
    The diagram consists of an outer vessel of wood, glass, or earthen
 ware, capable of holding a pint of liquid, within which there is sus
pended a short lamp-glass A, the one end being open, and the other, B,
 closed with a diaphragm of plaster of Paris,            c is a small bag of
crystals  of  sulphate  ol  copper,  to  keep up   the  strength of the solu
tion ; z is the zinc, and M the metal.
              TO OBTAIN    THE   COPY    OP A COIN OR MEDAL.
    Cover the medal with a coat of wax on that side on which the
deposited copper is not required to attach itself.           The medal thus
coated is to be placed in a frame of wire, or if it has no figure on the
reverse side a wire may be soldered to it.          To the wire and medal
thus arranged, a piece of sheet or cast zinc must be soldered, and we
are at once furnished with the materials for the battery, as the object
to be copied supplies the place of the copper.              The medal must
always be placed horizontally.          Now  let the   apparatus be charged
with the solution, by pouring into the outer vessel a portion of the
coppery solution, so that it will stand about an inch above the medal,
then pour in the glass the dilute acid to the same height as the
former; now introduce the zinc into the acid, and the object to be
copied into the solution of copper, which will immediately be deposited
on the medal, and when of a sufficient thickness may be taken off.
An intaglio being thus obtained, the same process is applied to this
c att, and a fac-simile of the original is obtained.

                             MAGNETISM.
   THE attractive power of the loadstone has been known from a very
remote period.     The natural magnet appears native in a grey iron
ore in octahedral crystals, composed of from 73 to 85 of iron, and
from 15 to 25 oxygen.      Its properties seem to have been studied in
Europe during    the  dark   ages, and a directive power is alluded to
by Cardinal James de     Vitri,  who flourished about the year 1200, who
observed, that it was indispensable to those who travel much by sea.
   In modern times, the history as well as the nature of the magnet
has engaged remarkable attention ; and it has been determined beyond
all dispute that the magnet was used by the Chinese under the name
of the tche-chy (directmg-stone) about 2604 years before Christ. It
passed from them to the Arabs, and was first used in Europe after
the Crusades; and Ludi Vestomanus asserts, that about the year
1500 he saw a pilot in the East Indies direct his course by a mag
netic needle like those now in use.
            IDENTITY     OP MAGNETISM      WITH ELECTRICITY.
   The most absurd theories have been invented to account for the
phenomena of magnetism.          Halley imagined magnetic globes to be
moving to    and  fro in  the   interior  of the earth , and 13rewster has
                                      E E

 418                      EVERY    BOY'S   BOOK.
 added something about poles of maximum cold, which no one could
 understand.     Barlow's theory, which refers the whole to electrical
 currents, is the most rational. Dr. Faraday, for whose kindness to us
in early days we always feel grateful, in a series of very curious
experiments, has succeeded in identifying magnetism with galvanism,
by directing galvanic currents at right angles to the direction of
powerful magnets.        And its connexion with this and the common
species  of  electricity has deprived it of all its conjuring powers, and
reduced it to the well-defined action of electrical bodies.
   It is not for us to write either a history of this interesting subject,
or to treat it as a science to be acquired ; but as it embodies a great
number of most instructive and amusing experiments, we think it
right that the young reader should be acquainted with the nature of
the subject, and of the reasons for what he does ; and we should
advise him to think at every step of his progress.
                   TO   MAKE ARTIFICIAL     MAGNETS.
   This may be done by stroking a piece of hard steel with a natural
or artificial magnet.  Take a common sewing needle and pass the
north pole of a magnet from the eye to the point, pressing it gently
in so doing. After reaching the end of the needle the magnet must
not be passed back again towards the eye, but must be lifted up and
applied again to that end, the friction being always in the same
direction. After repeating this for a few times the needle will become
magnetised, and attract iron filings, &c.
                   HOW TO MAGNETISE        A POKER.
  Hold it in the left hand in a position slightly inclined from the
perpendicular, the lower end pointing to the north, and then strike
it smartly several times with a large iron hammer, and it will be
found to possess the powers of a magnet although but slightly.
        TO SHOW    MAGNETIC    REPULSION    AND ATTRACTION.
  Suspend two short pieces of iron wire, N s, N s, so that they will
                        hang in contact in a vertical position.   Ifthe
                        north pole of a magnet N be now brought to
                       a moderate distance between the wires, they
                       will recede from each other as in figure 1.
                          The ends s s being made south poles by in
                       duction from the north pole N, will repel each
                       other, and so will the north poles N u.    This
                       separation  of  the wires  will increase as  the
                       magnet approaches them, but there will be
                       a particular distance at which the attractive
                       force of N overcomes the repulsive force of the
  Ky.2         £i      poles s s, and causes the wires to converge as
               A       m figure     the north poles N still exhibiting
                                  -2;                  N

                         THE WATCH MAGNETISED.
   Borrow a watch from the company, and inquire if it will go when
laid on the table. Then place it just over the point at which a magnet
is fixed underneath the top of the table, and the magnet will attract the
balance-wheel of the watch, and cause it to stop.
              SOHTH    AND SOUTH POLES OF THE MAGNET.
   Each magnet has its poles, north and south — the
north or south poles of one magnet, repel the north and
south pole of another.        If
                              a magnet, as in the fol
lowing figure, be dipped  in some iron filings, they will
be immediately attracted to one end. Supposing this
to be the north pole, each of the ends of the filings,
not in contact with the magnet, will become north
poles, while the ends in contact will by induction be
come south poles.     Both will have a tendency to
repel each other, and the filings will stand on the
magnet as    in the figure.
                        POLARITY       Or THE MAGNET.
   The best method of proving this is to take a magnet or a piece of
ateel rendered magnetic, and to place it on a piece of cork by laying
it in a groove cut to receive it.       If
                                         the
cork be placed in the centre of a basin
of water, and allowed to swim freely
on its surface, so that it is not attracted
by the sides of the basin, it will be
fonnd to turn its north pole to the
north, and its south pole to the south,
the same as the marmer's compass.            If
you fix two magnets in two pieces of
cork, and place them also in a basin of water, and they are in a parallel
position with the same poles together, that                 is,
                                                   north to north, and
south to south, they will mutually repel each other but         the con
                                                                  ;   if
trary poles point to one another, as north to south, they will be
attracted.
             THE MAGNETIC      FISH.
  Fish are to be purchased    at the toy

may perform this expernnent; they are
made hollow, and will float on the water.
In the mouth of each should be inserted           a
piece of magnetic wire. The angling rod

taken without any of the baits mentioned in the former part of this
work.
                             THE MAGNETIC   SWAN.
   The figure of a swan should be cut in cork, and within its beak a
small strongly magnetised piece of steel should be placed. The swan
should then be covered with a coating of white wax, and fashioned
further into the shape of a swan, and glass beads may be placed in its
head for eyes.   T)iis should be placed in a small tub or large basin of
water, and to make it swim about, you should place in a white stick
about nine inches long a magnetic bar, on which the north and south
poles are marked.       Ifyou wish to bring the swan towards yon,
present to him the north pole of the wand, if you wish it to retire,
present the south pole, and thus you may direct the swan to any part
you desire.
           TO SUSPEND   A NEEDLE IN THE AIR BY MAGNETISM.
   Place a magnet on a stand to raise it a little above the table ; then
bring a small sewing-needle containing a thread, within a little of the
magnet, keeping hold of the thread to prevent the needle from
attaching itself to the magnet. The needle in endeavouring to       flyto
the magnet, and being prevented by   the thread, will remain curiously
suspended in the air like Mahomed's coffin.

    south pole.     This is the method recom
    mended by Mr. Caxton, in his process,
    which he regarded superior to those in former
    use, and of which a more detailed account
    will be found in his interesting volume.
                      HOHSE-SHOE MAGNETS.
        The form of a horse -shoe is generally
    given to magnetised bars, when both poles are
    wanted to act together, which frequently
    happens in various experiments, such as for
*
    lifting weights by the force of magnetic attrac
    tion, and Tor magnetising steel bars by the
    process of double touch, for which they are
    exceedingly convenient.       The following is
    the method of making a powerful magnetic battery of the horse
    shoe form. Twelve bars or plates of steel are to be taken, and having
    been previously bent to the required form, that                  is,
    the horse-shoe shape, they are then bound toge
    ther      by
              means of rivets at their ends     before bemg
                                                       ;
    finally fastened   they are each separately magnetised,
     and afterwards finally united.
        Horse-shoe magnets should have          short bar of
                                                       a
     soft iron adapted to connect the two poles, and
     should never be laid           by
                                without such    piece of iron
                                                       a
     adhering to them. Bar magnets should be kept in
     pairs with their poles turned in contrary directions,
     and they should be kept from rust. Both kinds of magnets have their
     power not only preserved but increased,         keeping them surrounded
                                                            by
     with     mass of dry filings
              a                     of soft iron, each particle of which will
     re-act   it by
                 its induced magnetism upon the pomt of the magnet to
     which      adheres, and mamtain in that point its primitive magnetic
     state.
     EXPERIMENT               TO   SHOW    THAT SOFT IRON POSSESSES     MAGNETIC
        PROPERTIES            WHILE IT    REMAINS IN THE VICINITY OP A MAGNET.
        Let M be    magnet and K
                          a           key, held horizontally near one of its
                                            a
     poles, or near  its lower edge.  Then     another piece of iron, such as
                                                       if
    a  small nail, be applied to the other end of the key, the nail will hang
     from the key, and will continue to do so while the magnet          slowly is
     withdrawn but when
                      ;         has been removed beyond
                                    it                       certain distance,
                                                                     a
     the nail will drop from the key, because the magnetism induced in

                                         the key becomes at that distance too
                                         weak to support the weight of the
                                         nail.  That this is the real cause of
                                         its falling off may be proved by
                                         taking a still lighter fragment of iron,
                                         such as a piece of very slender wire,
                                         and applymg it to the key. The
                                         magnetism of the key will still be
                                         sufficiently strong to support the
                                         wire, though it cannot the nail, and
                                         it will continue to support it even
                                         when the magnet is yet further re
moved   ;   at length, however,     it drops off.
                             ELECTRO-MAGNETISM.
   The identity of magnetism with electricity alluded to in a former
paragraph, has led to the formation of a new science under the above
name, and to some of the interesting experiments connected with                   it,
we shall briefly allude for the amusement of the young reader.

                                     COMPASS.
   The mariner's compass        an artificial magnet fitted in
                               is                                proper  a
box, and consists of three parts — the box1,        the card or
                                                        ;   2,       and   fly;
3, the needle.   The box       suspended in
                              is                square wooden case,

means of two concentric brass circles called gimbals, so fixed   brazen  by
axes to the two boxes, that the inner one, or compass-box, retains                a
horizontal position in all motions of the ship.   The card      circular
                                                                  is   a
piece of paper which     fastened upon the needle, and moves with it.

 The outer edge of the card is divided into thirty-two points, as shown
in the engraving, called points of the compass.          The needle is a
slender bar of hardened steel, having a hollow agate cup in the centre,
which moves upon the point of a pivot made of brass.
                      VARIAT10H    OP THE NEEDLE.
   The magnetic needle does not point exactly north and south, but
the north pole of the needle takes a direction considerably to the west
of the true north. It is constantly changing, and varies at different
parts of the earth, and at different times of the day.
                          DIP  OP  THE NEEDLE.
   Another remarkable and evident manifestation of the influence of
the magnetism of the earth upon the needle is the inclination or dip
of the latter, which is a deviation from its horizontal place in a down
ward direction in northern regions of its north, and in southern
regions of its south pole.    The causes of the dipping of the needle
are yet unexplained. In balancing the needle on the card, on account
of this dipping, a small weight or movable piece of brass is placed on
one end of the needle, by the shifting of which either nearer to or
further from the centre, the needle will always be balanced.
          USEFUL AMUSEMENT        WITH THE POCKET      COMPASS.
   Pocket compasses are to be bought for five or six shillings, and may
be used in many ways.      In travelling over mountains or a wide ex
tended moor, they are indispensably necessarv ; and no one should go
a tour into Wales, Scotland, or the lakes without such a companion,
and it will be a very useful and amusing exercise for any young per
son to take the bearings of his own or some particular locality, and
make out what may be called a bearing card.        This he may easily do
in the following manner.      Supposing he  wishes, for instance, to take
the bearings of his own house, he has nothing to do but to set his
pocket compass upon a map of the district, — a county map will do very

424                        EVERY    BOY'S BOOK.
well, unless his house stands on the verge of a county, then two
county maps will be necessary. He must make the nortn of the map
exactly comcide with the north, as indicated by his compass, ana
having fixed his map in this situation, he should take a ruler and
piece of paper, and dot down the exact bearings of each important
town, or place, or village, around him.    Let him suppose himself, for
instance, m the town of Cambridge, and laving down his map as indi
cated by the compass, north to north and south to south, he will

find the following places due north, Wilbcrton, Wentworth ; Little
Wilbraham, Teversham, due east ; Duxford and Chesterfield, south ;
 Coton and St. Neote in Huntingdonshire, west.        The other points of
the compass may be filled up in the same manner.          Should therefore
our young friend be upon any elevated situation near his own dwell
ing, or upon any other elevated spot from which the bearings have
been taken, he will be able to inform his young friends that such and
such a place lies in such a direction, that this place lies due north, the
other north-west, a third south-east, the fourth south-west, &c. &c. ;
and the information so obtained will be serviceable to himself in many
important matters.
        INTERESTING PARTICULARS        CONCERNING    THE MAGNET.
   Fire-irons which have rested in one position in a room during the
 summer months are often highly magnetic.
    Iron bars standing erect, such as the gratings of a prison cell, or
 the iron railings before houses, are often magnetic.
    The uppermost of the iron tier round a carriage wheel attracts the
 north end of a magnet, and has hence south polarity, while the lower
 end attracting the south end of the same, has north polarity.

   Magnetism may be made to pass through a deal board ; to exhibit
which, lay a needle on the smooth part above, and run a magnet along
the under side, and the needle win be found to follow the course of
the magnet.    A magnet dipped into boiling water loses part of its
magnetism, which however returns upon its cooling.
   A sudden blow given to a magnet often destroys its magnetic
power.

             "Come like shadows, but not so depart."— SHIKSPEAKE.
   THIS term signifies, " written by light," and leads us to a class of very
 interesting facts connected with the art of drawing. It is a mode by
 which natural objects are made to delineate themselves without the
 aid of the artist's pencil, and the beautiful miniature landscape which
 the camera obscura presents is also made to paint itself upon paper,
 and that with a fideEty and minuteness so exact that a distant t>uild
 ing represented in one of these landscapes is often depicted even to
 the number of bricks in the facade, and a pane of one of the win
 dows being broken and mended with paper, is faithfully represented
 and detected by the microscope.
    The discovery is due to Mr. Daguerre or to Henry Fox Talbot, but
 to which seems uncertain; the strength of the testimony, however,

 seems to point to the latter gentleman, and the word Talbotype is
now generally used to designate drawings so made. From the latter
gentleman's detailed accounts we gather the following : —
    There is a class of salts known to the chemist by the term salts of
silver, some of which undergo decomposition by exposure to the sun's
rays, and become variously coloured.          Silver dissolved in nitric
acid forms a nitrate of the oxide of silver, which is soluble in water.
If  a sheet of paper be washed with this solution, and then set in the
sunbeams, it becomes blackened ; but if some object be placed before
it, which casts    well-defined shadow, the light acting on the rest of

over the paper on one surface only and dried at the fire. The solution
should not be saturated, but six or eight times diluted with water.
When dry the paper         fitted for use. This paper
                              is                               useful for allis

will best be ascertained            by

other method is to immerse the picture in a strong solution of com
mon salt, or the hyposulphate of soda, to wipe off the superfluous
moisture and then to dry it. Pictures preserved by iodine are of a
pale primrose colour, which possesses the remarkable property of
turning to a full gaudy colour when exposed to the heat of a 'fire,
and recovering the former colour when cold.       Those formed of the
hyposulphite of soda are of much better character.    These should be
brushed over on both sides, first on the face of the picture and then
on the back.

     HOW TO TAKE DAGUERREOTYPE                PORTRAITS,      LANDSCAPES,     ETC.

   Instead of the paper before described,    platea   made of pure silver

plated upon copper, which      rendered sensitive to the action of light
                                   is

camera    obscure made to receive it as seen in the cut B ; and im
mediately that the cover of the lens at x is removed, to let in the
light reflected from the person, picture, landscape or sculpture, the
image is formed.    The plate is now removed from the camera, but the
appearance of the figure, &c., is not yet visible until it has been put,
without exposure to the light, into a box D, in the bottom of which is
an iron cup containing quicksilver, E, the vapour from which, driven
off by a spirit lamp, F, is attracted by those parts of the plate which
have been affected oy the light, and by mixing with the decomposed
matter, forms a new crystalline compound, which causes the picture to
 appear on the surface of the plate.
    After the plate has been thus submitted to the action of mercury
 until the design has become perfect, it is immersed in a solution of
 soda, which immediately dissolves and washes away the iodine and
 other chemical substances from the surface of the picture.      Gold is
 afterwards precipitated upon the design, which fixes it and renders
 it impervious to the light. Apparatus enabling any one to make
 similar portraits and pictures may be obtained of Mr. Clark, optician,
 Strand, to the completeness of which we can bear testimony.

                PNEUMATICS AND AEROSTATICS.
                   "  There It a tricksy spirit in the air
                     That plays tad gambols." — BEN JONSON.
    THE branch of the physical sciences which relates to the air and
 its various phenomena is called Pneumatics. By it we learn many
 curious particulars.    By it we find that the air has weight and
 pressure, colour, density, elasticity, compressibility, and some other
 properties with which we shall endeavour to make the young reader
 acquainted by many pleasing experiments, earnestly impressing upon
him to lose no opportunity of making physical science his study.
    To show that the air has weight and pressure, the common leather
sucker by which boys raise stones will show the pressure of the
atmosphere.     It consists of a piece of soft but firm leather, having
a piece of string drawn through its centre. The leather is made quite
wet and pliable, and then its under part is placed on the stone and
stamped down by the foot. This pressing of the leather excludes the
air from between the leather and the stone, and by pulling the string
a vacuum is left underneath its centre ; consequently the weight of
the air about the edges of the leather, not being counterbalanced by
any air between it and the stone, enables the boy to lift it.

we shall find that a very great force, even some hundreds of pounds,
is necessary for separatmg the boards.     They are kept together by
the weight of the heavy  air which surrounds them in the same manner
as if they were surrounded by water-

   Place a card on a wine-glass filled with water, then invert the glass,
the water will not escape, the pressure of the atmosphere on the out
side of the card being sufficient to support the water.

                       ELASTICITY         OF   THE AIR.
  This can be shown
                            by
                            beautiful philosophical toy which may

them hollow within, and having each a minute opening at the heel, by
which water may pass in and out. Place them m the jar, as seen in
the figure, and adjust them by the quantity of water admitted to
them, so that in specific gravity they differ a little from each other.
The mouth of the jar should now be covered
with a piece of skin or india-rubber, and then, if
the hand be pressed upon the top or mouth of
the jar, the figures will be seen to rise or
descend as the pressure is gentle or heavy,
rising and falling, or standing still, according to
the pressure made.
                BEASON FOB THIS.
    The reason of this   is,
                           that the pressure on
the top of the jar condenses the air between
the cover and the water surface     this conden

much more water into them as to render them
heavier than water, and therefore heavy enough to sink.
                               THE ALB-PUMP.
   The time was, and that not very long ago, when the air pump was
only obtainable by the philosophical professor, or            by
                                                           persons of en
larged   means.   But   now,  owing    to  our
" eneap way of doing things,"       small air-
                                    a
pump may be         obtained   for   about       a
guinea, and we would strongly advise our
young friend to procure one, as            will

bea   source of endless amusement to him         ;
and, supposing that he takes our advice,
we give him the following experiments.

rods of which are moved        awheel handle
backwards and forwards, and thus pump the air out of the receiver.
When the air    is thus taken out,     stop-cock

   Under the receiver of an air-pump, when the air has been thoroughly
exhausted, light and heavy bodies fall with the same swiftness.      Ani
mals quickly die for want of air, combustion ceases, gunpowder will
not explode,   a bell sounds faint, magnets are powerless, and waters
and other fluids turn to vapour.

  Place a bladder, out of which all the air has apparently been

                        the top at the outside through    ahole, so that
                       they may be opened          by

   If  a glass vessel, containing water, in which a couple of fish are
put be placed under the receiver, upon exhausting the air, the fish
will be unable to keep at the bottom of the glasj, owing to the
expansion of the air within their bodies, contained in the air bladder.
They will consequently rise and float, belly upwards, upon the surface
of the water.
                            TEE DIVING BELL.

can descend    to great depths in the sea, and recover from it valu
                                  able portions of wrecks and other
                                  matters.     Its principle may be well
                                  illustrated by the following experi
                                  ment.     Take a glass tumbler, and
                                  plunge    it into the water with the
                                  mouth downwards, and it will be found
                                  that the water will not rise much
                                  more than half way in the tumbler.
                                  This may be made very evident if a
                                  piece of cork be suffered to float
inside of the glass on the surface of the water. The air within the
                                   tumbler does not entirely exclude
                                  the water, because air is elastic,
                                   and consequently compressible, and
                                  hence the air in the tumbler is what

   The art of sailing or navigating a body through the air is called
aeronautics.    In remote ages, Icarus is said to have risen so high
in the air that the sun melted his wings, and he fell into the jEgean
sea, and was drowned; and there is icason to believe, from some
figures that have recently been discovered on Egyptian and Assyrian
monuments, that the ancients possessed means of rising in the air
with which we are not now acquainted.

balloon. Balloons of this kind cannot be made smaller than six feet
in diameter, of oiled silk, as the weight of the material is too great
for the air to buoy it up.   They may be made smaller of thin slips
of bladder, or other membrane glued together, or of thin gutta-
percha cloth, which is now extensively used for this purpose ; with
this they may be made a foot in diameter, and will rise beautifully.
                          HOW     TO    PILL A BALLOON.
   Procure a large stone bottle which will hold a gallon of water, into
this put a pound of iron filings, or granulated zinc, with two quarts of
water, and add to this by degrees one pint of sulphuric acid. Then take
a tube, either of glass or metal, and introduce one end of it through a
cork, which place in the bottle, then put the other end into the neck
of the balloon, and the gas will rise into the body of it. When quite
full withdraw the tube, and tie the neck of the balloon with strong
cord very tightly.    If freed it will now rise in the air.

   Cut the gores, according to the forms already given, from well-
woven tissue paper, paste the gores nicely together, and look well
                     over the surface of the paper for any small hole
                     or slit, over which paste a piece of paper, and

                     let it dry. Pass a wire round the neck of the
                     balloon, and have two cross pieces at its diameter
                     a little bent, so that a piece of soft cotton dipped
                     in spirits of wine may be laid on them.           When

of a stick, while you dip the cotton in spirits of wine till it is

             OPTICS AND OPTICAL AMUSEMENTS.
             " ' Seeing is believing,' so the sages say,
                 To prove this false, hear me, my friends, I pray,
                 And very soon you all will be agreeing,
                 That nought is so deceptive as our teeing."— MIHTIN.
    OPTICS is the science of light and vision.           Concerning the nature
 of light, two theories are at present very ably maintained by their
 respective advocates.       One is termed the Newtonian theory, and the
 other the Huygenean. The Newtonian theory considers light to con
 sist of inconceivably small bodies emanating from the sun, or any
 other luminous body.        The Huygencan conceives it to consist in the
undulations of a highly elastic and subtle fluid, propagated round
luminous centres in spnerical waves, like those arising in a placid
lake when a stone is dropped into the water.
                             LIGHT     AS AN EFFECT.
    Light follows the same laws         as gravity, and its intensity or degree
decreases   as the square of the distance from the lummous body
increases.    Thus, at the distance of two yards from a candle we shall

from    and so on in the same proportion.

                                    REFRACTION.
  Bodies which suffer the rays of light to pass through them, such as
water or glass, are called refracting media. When rays of light enter
                             these, they do not proceed in straight lines,

                               THE PRISM.
    The prism is a triangular solid of glass, and by it the young optician
may decompose a ray of light into its primitive and supplementary
colours, for a ray of light is of a com
pound nature. By the prism the ray
A is divided into its three primitive
colours, blue, red, and yellow; and
their four supplementary ones, violet,
indigo, green, and orange.     The best
way to perform this experiment is to
cut a small slit in a wmdow-shutter,
on which the sun shines at some period
of the day, and directly opposite the
hole place a prism P; a beam of
light m passing through it will then be decomposed, and if let fall
upon a sheet of white paper, or against a white wall, the seven colours
of the rainbow will be observed.
                         COMPOSITION    OF  LIGHT.
    The beam of light passing through the prism is decomposed, and
the spaces occupied by the colours are in the following proportions : —

thin the outer coat of it behind: take care not to cut          it,for     if
this  should   be done the vitreous humour will escape, and the ex
periment cannot be performed. Haying so prepared the eye,             the

pupil of    itbe directed to any bright objects, they will appear
distinctly delineated on the back part precisely as objects appear in
the instrument we are about to describe.   The effect wifl be heightened
if the eye    viewed in dark room with
             is        a                   asmall hole   in the shutter,
but   inevery case the appearance will be very striking.

                                   inches wide, and eight high.     In one
                                   end of this a  tube must be fitted con

degrees.   At  the  top of the box isa   square of unpolished glass, upon
which from beneath the picture     will  be thrown, and may be seen        by
raising the lid A. To use the camera place the tube with the lens on
it opposite to the object, and having adjusted the focus, the image

   The form of a camera obscura used in a public exhibition is as fol
lows : — D D is a large wooden box stained black in tbe inside, and
capable of containing from one to eight persons.                    A B is a sliding
piece, having a sloping mirror c, and a double convex lens F, which
may with the mirror c be slid up or down so as to accommodate                       the
lens to near and distant objects.                 When
the rays proceeding from an object with
out fall upon the mirror, they are re
flected upon the lens p, and brought to
fall on the bottom of the box, or upon
a table placed horizontally to receive them,
which may be seen by the spectator whose
eye is at E.
             THE CAMERA LUCIDA.
    This instrument consists of a glass prism,
c,  D, D, E, having four sides covered.              The
sides c, B, being exposed to the object to be
delineated, rays pass through the glass and fall
on the sloping side D, E ; from this they are
reflected to the top, and finally pass" out
of the prism to the eye;1 now from the
direction at which the rays enter the eye,
it receives them as if commg from an image
at A, B, and if a sheet of paper be placed
below the instrument, a perfect delineation
 of the object may be traced with a pencil.
This is a very useful instrument to young
 draughtsmen.

                          THE MAGIC LANTHORN.
   This is one of the most pleasing of all optical instruments, and it
is used to produce enlarged pictures of objects, which being painted
on a glass m various colours are thrown upon a screen or white sheet
placed against the wall of a large room.          It consists of a sort of
tin-box, within which is a lamp, the light of which (strongly reflected
by the reflector T,) passes through a great plano-convex lens E fixed in
the front. This strongly illuminates the objects which are painted on
the slides or slips of glass, and placed before the lens in an inverted
position, and the rays passing through them and the lens i , fall on
a sheet, or other white surface, placed to receive the image.          The
glasses on which the figures are drawn are inverted, in order that the
nnages   of them may be erect.
                          PAINTING THE SLIDES.
   The slides containing the objects usually shown in a magic Ian-
thorn, are to be bought at opticians with the lanthorn, and can be
procured cheaper and better in this way than by any attempt at
manufacturing them.       Should, however, the young optician wish to
make a few slides    of objects of particular interest to himself, he may
proceed as follows :
                      —
Draw first on paper the figures you wish to paint, lay it on the table, and
cover it over with a piece of glass of the above shape ; now draw the
outlines with a fine camel's hair pencil in black paint mixed with varnish,
and when this is dry, fill up the other parts with the proper colours,
shading with bistre ajso nuxed with varnish. The transparent colours
are alone to be used in this kind of painting.

                       TO   EXHIBIT    THE MAGIC LANTHORN.
   The room for the exhibition ought to be large, and of an oblong
shape.    At one end of it suspend a large sheet so as to cover the
whole of the wall. The company being all seated, darken the room,
and placing the lanthorn with its tube in the direction of the sheet,
introduce one of the slides into the slit, taking care to invert the
figures ; then adjust the focus of the glasses in the tube by drawing
it in or out as required, and a perfect representation of the object will
appear.
                       EFFECTS    OF   THE MAGIC LANTHOBN.
  Most extraordinary effects may be produced by means of the magic
lanthorn      ; one   of the most effective     01   which is a
                                  TEMPEST      AT SEA.
This is effected by having two slides painted, one with the tempest as
approaching on one side, and continuing in intensity till it reaches
the other.   Another slide has ships painted on                 it,
                                                     and while the lan-
thorn    in use, that containing the ships
         is                                   dexterously drawn before
                                                       is
the other, and represents ships in the storm.
  The effects of sunrise, moonlight, starlight, &c., may be imitated, also
by  means of double sliders, and figures may
be introduced sometimes of fearful pro
portions.
   Heads may be made to nod, faces to laugh                 ;
eyes may be made to roll, teeth to gjiash;
crocodiles may be made to swallow tigers                    ;
combats may be represented       but one of the

on the sun, and the various motions of
the planetary bodies, and their satellites.

                           THE PHANTASMAGORIA.
      Between the phantasmagoria and the magic lanthorn there is this
   difference; in common magic lanthprns the figures are painted on
  transparent glass, consequently the image on the screen is a circle of
  light naving figures upon it ; but in the phantasmagoria all the glass
  is made opaque, except the figures, which, being painted in transparent
  colours, the light shmes through them, and no light can come upon
  the screen except that which passes through the figure, as is here
  represented.
  There is no sheet to receive the picture, but the representation is
  thrown on a thin screen of silk or muslin placed between the spec-
  tators and the lanthorn. The images are made to appear approaching
  and receding by removing the lanthorn further from the screen, or
  bringing it nearer to it. This is a great advantage over the arrange
 ments of the magic lanthorn, and by it the most astonishing effects
  are often produced.
                            DISSOLVING  VIEWS.
     The dissolving views, by which one landscape or scene appears to
 pass into the other while the scene is changing, are produced by using
 two magic lanthorns placed side by side, and that can be a little
 inclined towards each other when necessary, so as to mix the rajs of
 light proceeding from the lenses of each together, which produces that
 confusion of images, in which one view melts as it were into the other,
 which gradually T>ecomes clear and distinct.
                         HOW TO BAISB A GHOST.
     The magic lanthorn, or phantasmagoria, may be used in a number
of marvellous ways, but m none more strikmg than in raising an
apparent spectre.     Let an open box A B, about three feet long, a
foot and half broad, and two feet high, be prepared. At one end of
this place a small swin;* dressing glass, and at the other let a magic
lanthorn be fixed with its lenses in a direction towards the glass.   A
glass should now be made to slide up and down in the groove c D, to
which a cord and pulley should be attached, the end of the cord
coming to the part of the box marked \. On this glass the most

hideous   spectre that can be imagined may be painted, but in a squat
or contracted position, and when all is done, the lid of the box must
be prepared by raising a kind of gable at the end of the box B, and in
its lower part at E an oval hole should be cut sufficiently large to
 suffer the rays of light reflected from the glass to pass through them.
 On the top of the box at r place a chafing dish, upon which put some
 burning charcoal.     Now light the lamp G in the lanthorn, sprinkle
 some powdered camphor or white incense on the charcoal, adjust the
 slide on which the spectre is painted, and the image will be thrown
 upon the smoke. In performing this feat the room must be darkened,
 and the box should be placed on a high table, that the hole through
 which the light comes may not be noticed.
                            THE THAUMATHOPE.
    This word is derived from two Greek words, one of which signifies
 vender, and the other to turn.     It is a very pretty philosophical toy,
 and is founded upon the principle in optics, that an impression made
 upon the retina of the eye lasts for a short interval after the object
 wlhich produced it has been withdrawn.       The impression which the
 mind receives lasts for about the eighth part of a second, as may be
 easily shown by whirling round a lighted stick, which if made to com
plete the circle within that period, will exhibit not a fiery point, but
a fiery circle in the air.
                         THE BIRD IN THE CAGE.
    Cut a piece of cardboard of the size of a penny piece, and paint on
one side a bird, and on the other a cage; fasten two pieces of thread
one on each side at opposite points of the card, so that the card can
be made to revolve by twirling the threads with the finger and thumb :
 while the toy is in its revolution, the bird will be seen within the
 cage.    A bat may in the same manner be painted on one side of the

card, and a cricketer      upon the other, which will exhibit the same
phenomenon,      arising from the same principle.
                 CONSTRUCTION         0? THE PHANTASMASCOPE.
    The above-named figure is a Thaumatrope, as much as the one we
are about to describe, although the term Phantasmascope is generally
applied to the latter instrument; which consists of a disc of darkened
tm-plate, with a slit or narrow opening in                  it,
                                                      about two inches in
length.    It    fixed upon
                is                astand, and the slit placed upwards, so
that  it may easily be looked through.        Another disc of pasteboard,
about  a   foot in  diameter,     isnow   prepared and fixed on   a  similar
stand, but with this difference, that           made to revolve round an
                                                it   is

ber of frogs in relative and progressive positions of leaping make ;
between each figure     a  slit of about quarter of an inch deep and
                                                a                      :
when this second disc        ismade to revolve at      foot distance oehind

the first, and the eye  is placed near the slit, the whole of the figures,
instead of appearing to revolve with the disc, will all appear m the
attitudes of leaping up and down, increasing in agility as the velocity
of the motion    isincreased.    It necessary, when trying the effect of
                                       is
this instrument, to stand before         looking-glass, and to present the
                                            a
painted face of the machine towards the glass.
  A   very great number of figures may be prepared to produce similar
effects — horses with riders in various attitudes of leaping, toads
crawling, snakes twisting and writhing, faces laughing and crying,
men dancing, jugglers throwing up balls, &c.; all of which,            bythe
peculiar arrangement above detailed, will seem to be in motion.             A
little ingenuity displayed in the construction and painting of the
figures upon the pasteboard disc will afford          great fund of amuse

ment.
                       CUB.IOUS       OPTICAL       ILLUSIONS.
   One of the most curious facts relating to the science of vision          is
the absolute insensibility of     certain portion of the retina to the
                                      a
impression of light, so that the image of any object falling on that
pomt would be invisible.      When we look with the right eye, this
point will be about fifteen degrees to the right of the object observed,
or to the right of the axis ot the eye, or me point of most distinct
vision. When looking with the left eye, the point will be as far to

                     OPTICS,  AND OPTICAL AMUSEMENTS.                  447
  the left.    The point in question is the basis of the optic nerve, and
  its insensibility to light was first observed by the French philosopher,
  Mariotte.      This remarkable phenomenon may be experimentally
  proved   in  the following manner : —
     Place on a sheet of writing-paper, at the distance of about three
  inches apart, two coloured wafers ; then, on looking at the left-hand
  wafer with the right eye, at the distance of about a foot, keeping the
  eye straight above the wafer, and both eyes parallel with the line
 which forms the wafers, the left eye being closed, the right-hand
 wafer will become invisible ; and a similar effect will take place if
 we close the right eye, and look with the left.
                                   ANOTHER.
     Cut a circular piece of white paper, about two inches in diameter,
 which affix to a dark wall. At the distance of two feet on each side,
 but a little lower, make two marks; then place yourself directly
 opposite the paper, and hold the end of your finger before your face,
 so that when the right eye is open it shall conceal the mark on your
 left, and when the left eye is open the mark on your right.        If you
 then look with both eyes at the end of your finger, the paper disc
 will be invisible.
                                   ANOTHER.
     Fix a similar disc of paper, two inches in diameter, at the height
 of your eye on a dark wall ; a little lower than this, at the distance
 of two feet on the right hand, fix another of about three inches in
 diameter    ;  now place yourself opposite the first sheet of paper, and,
 shutting the left eye, keep the right eye still fixed on the first object,
 and when at the distance of about ten feet, the second piece of paper
 will be invisible.
                           THE PICTURE IN THE AIR.
     One of the numerous optical illusions which have from time to
 time been evolved by scientific minds, is that of making an image or
 picture appear in the air. This is produced by means of a mirror,
 and an object in relief, upon which a strong light is thrown, — the
mirror being set at such an angle as to throw up the reflection of the
image to a certain point in the view of the spectator.       This illusion
is produced as follows : Let a screen be constructed in which is an
arclied aperture, the centre of which may be five feet from the
floor : behmd the screen is placed a large nurror of an elliptical form.
An object is now placed behind the screen, upon which the light
of a strong lamp is thrown from a point above the mirror, ana is
received by the mirror and reflected to the centre of the arched cavity
in the screen, where it will appear to the spectator. Care should be
taken to place the image in an inverted position, and the light should
be so placed that none of it may reach the opening : the fight must
also be very powerful.

                       BREATHING LIGHT AND DARKNESS.
    The following experiment, if performed with care, is exceedingly
 striking.     Let s oe a candle, whose light falls at an angle of 56° 45'
 upon two plate glasses, A B, placed close to each other ; and let the
 reflected rays, A c, B D, fall at the same angle upon two similar plates,
                                             c D, but so placed that the plane
                                            of reflection from the latter is at
                                            right angles to the plane of reflec
                                            tion from the former. An eye placed
                                            at E, and looking at the same tnne on
                                            the two plates, c and D, will see verv
                                            faint images of the candle, s; which
 by a slight adjustment of the plates, may be made to disappear almost
 wholly, allowmg the plate c to remain where it is. Change the position
 of D, till its inclination to the ray, B D, is diminished about 3°, or made
 nearly 53° 11'. The distance may be easily found by a little practice.
 When this is done, the image that had disappeared on looking into D
 will be restored, so that the spectator at E, upon looking into the two
 mirrors, c D, will see no light in c, because the candle has nearly dis
 appeared, while the candle is distinctly seen in D.                     If, while, the
 spectator    is   looking    into   these     two   mirrors,  either   he   or another
 person breathes upon them gently and quickly, the breath will revive
 the extinguished image in c, and will extinguish the visible image
in   D.1
       TO SHOT THAT BAYS          OF  LIGHT     DO NOT OBSTBUCT EACH OTHEB.
    Make     a small hole in a sheet of pasteboard, A, and placing it
                                              upright before three candles, B,
                                              placed closely together, it will be
                                              found that the images of all the
                                              candle flames will be formed sepa
                                              rately on a piece of paper, c, laid on
                                              the table to receive them.            This
                                              proves that the rays of light do not
                                            E obstruct each other in their progress,
                                          c although ;i LI cross in passing through
 the hole.
   (1)  Explanation.— The light    A, c, B, B is polarized by reflection from the plates
 A B, because   it is incident at the polarizing angle 56" 45' for glass.       AVben we
breathe upon the plates c D, we form upon their surface a thin film of water, whose
polarizing angle is 53° 11', so that if the polarized rays A, c, B, D fall upon the plates
c, D, at an angle of .'>:>•'11', the candle from which they proceeded would not be
visible, or they would not suffer reflection from the plates c D. At all the other

board must be cut, so as to fit over the glass end of the tube ; and
in this, on the outer side, a piece of ground glass must be fastened,

before putting it on, obtain some small pieces of broken glass of
various colours, beads, little strips of wire, or any other object, and

                  " These are machinations comical."— FORD.
   THERE is no subject of such importance as Mechanics, as its prin
ciples are founded upon the properties of matter and the laws of
motion; and in knowing somethmg of these, the tyro will lay the
foundation of all substantial knowledge.
   The properties of matter are the following : Solidity (or Impene
trability), Divisibility, Mobility, Elasticity, Brittleness, Malleability,
Ductility, and Tenacity.
   The laws of motion are as follow : —
   1. Every body continues in a state of rest or of uniform rectilineal
motion, unless affected by some extraneous force.
   2. The change of motion is always proportionate to the impelling
force.
   3. Action and reaction are always equal and contrary.

it moves forward exactly in the same line of direction ; but if struck
sideways, it will move m an oblique direction, and its course will be
in a line situated between the direction of its former motion and that
of the force impressed.     This is called the resolution of forces.

                                BALANCING.
   The centre of gravity in a body is thatpart about which all the
other parts equally balance each other.       In balancing a stick upon
the finger, or upon the chin, it is necessary only to keep the chin or
finger exactly under the point which is called the centre of gravity.
                          THE PRANCING     HORSE.
    Oat out the figure of rf horse, and hav
ing fixed a curved iron wire to the under
part of its body, place a small ball of lead
upon it. Place the hind legs of the horse
on the table, and it will rock to and fro.
If  the ball be removed, the horse would
immediately tumble, because unsupported,
the centre of gravity being in the front of
the prop; but upon the ball being re
placed, the centre of gravity immediately
changes its position, and is brought under
the prop, and the horse is again in equi-
librio.
 TO CONSTRUCT A FIGURE, WHICH, BEING PLACED UPON A CURVED
       SURFACE, AND INCLINED IN ANY POSITION, SHALL, WHEN LEFT
       TO ITSELF, RETURN TO ITS FORMER POSITION.
    The feet of the figure rest on a curved pivot, which is sustained
 by two loaded balls oelow ; for the weight of these balls being much
 greater than that of the figure, their effect is to bring the centre of
 gravity of the whole beneath the point on which it rests; conse
 quently the equilibrium will resist any slight force to disturb it.
          TO MAKE A CARRIAGE      RUN IN AN INVERTED POSITION
                            WITHOUT FALLING.
    It  is pretty well known to most boys, that  if a tumbler of water be
placed within a broad wooden hoop, the
 whole may be whirled round without
 faffing, owing to the centrifugal force.
On the same principle, if a small car
riage be placed on an iron band or rail,
it will ascend the curve, become in
verted, and descend again, without fall
ing.
  TO CAUSE      A CYLINDER    TO  ROLL BY ITS   OWN    WEIGHT UP-HILL.
    Procure a coffee-canister, and loading it at F with a piece of lead,
which may be fixed in with solder, the position of the centre of
 gravity is thus altered.   If a cylinder so constructed be placed on an

assistance.
                        THE BALANCED            STICK.
   Procure a piece of wood, about nine inches in length and about
half an inch in thickness, and thrust into its upper end the blades of
two penknives, on either side one. Place the other end upon the tip
of the fore-finger, and it will keep its place without falling.

   Construct out of the pith of the elder a little mandarin ; then pro
vide a base for it to sit in, like a kettle-drum.   Into this put some
heavy substance, such as half     a leaden bullet ; fasten the figure to
this, and in whatever position it may be placed, it will, when left to
itself, immediately return to its upright position.

                          HYDRAULICS.
   THE science of Hydraulics comprehends the laws which regulate
non-elastic fluids in motion, and especially water, &c.
   Water can only be set in motion by two causes — the pressure of
the atmosphere, or its own gravity.     The principal law concerning
fluids is,
         that they always preserve their own level. Hence water can

be distributed over a town from any reservoir that is higher than the
houses to be supplied ; and the same principle will enable us to form
fountains in a garden, or other place.       Should any of our young
friends wish to form a fountain, or jet-d'-eau, they may, by brmging
a pipe from T, a water-tank, which should be at the upper part of
the house, convey the water down to the garden.      Then by leading it
through the earth, underneath the path or grass-plot, and turning it
to a perpendicular position, the water will spring out, and rise nearly
as high as the level of that in the tank.     The part of the pipe at B
should have a turnkey, so that the water may be let on or shut off at
pleasure.
                               THE SYPHON.
    The syphon is a bent tube, having one leg shorter than the other
It acts by the pressure of the atmo
sphere bemg removed from the surface
of a fluid, which makes it to rise above
its common level at B. In order to
make a syphon act, it is necessary first
to fill both legs quite full of the fluid ;
and then the shorter leg must be
placed in the vessel to be emptied.
Immediately upon withdrawing           the
finger from the longer leg, the liquor
will flow. Any young person may
form a syphon by a small piece of leaden pipe, bent into the form
above.
                                THE   PTTHP.
   The action of the common pump is as follows : When the handle A
is raised, .the piston-rod B descends, and brings the piston-valve,
called the sucker, or bucket, to another valve, c, which is fixed, and

460                     EVERY        BOY S BOOK.
opens inwards towards the piston. When the handle is drawn down,
the piston is raised, and, as it is air-tight, a vacuum is produced
between the two valves ; the air in the barrel of the pump, betwixt
the lower valve and the water, then forces open the lower valve, and
rushes through to fill up this vacuum; and the air in the pump being
less dense than the external atmosphere, the water is forced a short
                  way up the barrel.      When the piston again de
                  scends to the lower valve, the air between them
                  is again forced out by forcing open the upper
                  valve ; and when the piston is raised, a vacuum is
                  again produced, and the air below the lower valve
                  rushes up, and the water in consequence is agam
                  raised a little further.  This operation continues
                  until the water rises above the lower valve; at
                  every stroke afterwards, the water passes through
                  the valve of the descendmg piston, and is raised by
                  it,on its ascent, until  issues out of the spout.

 twist it round a pole, as in the following figure, A ; place a handle at
 its upper end, B, and let its lower end rest in the water. Between the
last turn of the pipe and the orifice place a paddle-wheel, c. Now,
 should the water be that of a running stream, the force of the stream
will turn the pipe, and the water will rise in it till it empties itself
into the trough at D. Should the water have no motion, the turning of
the handle at B will elevate the water from the lower to the higher
level.
                               ACOUSTICS.
    Acoustics is the science relating to sound and hearing. Sound is
heard when any shock or impulse is given to the air, or to any other
body which is m contact directly or indirectly with the ear.
               DIFFERENCE BETWEEN       SOTTND AND    NOISE.
    Noises are made by the cracks of whips, the beating of hammers,
the creak of a file or saw, or the hubbub of a multitude.      But when
a bell is struck, the bow of a violin drawn across the strings, or the
wetted finger turned round a musical glass, we have what are pro
perly called sounds.
                       SOUNDS,    HOW PROPAGATED.
    Sounds are propagated on all bodies much after the manner that
waves are in water, with a velocity of 1,142 feet in a second. Sounds
in liquids and in solids are more rapid than in air. Two stones rubbed

 together may bet heard in water at half a mile ; solid bodies convey
 sounds to great distances, and pipes may be made to convey the voice
 over every part of the house.
            TO SHOW HOW SOUND TRAVELS               THROUGH     A SOLID.
     Take a long piece of wood, such as the handle of a hair broom, and
 placing a watch at one end, apply your ear to the other, and the tick
 mgs will be distinctly heard.
               TO SHOW THAT SOUND DEPENDS              ON   VIBRATION.
    Touch    a bell when it is sounding, and the noise ceases ; the same
 may    be  done   to a musical string with the same results.               Hold a
musical pitchfork       to  the  lips, when it is  made  to  sound,  and  a quiver
ing motion will be felt fi-om its vibrations.          These experiments show
that sound is produced by the quick motions and vibrations of dif
ferent bodies.
                 MUSICAL     FIGURES RESULTING FROM SOUND.
    Cover the mouth of a wine glass, having a foot-stalk, with a thin
sheet    of membrane, over which scatter a layer of fine sand. The
vibrations excited in the air by the sound of a musical instrument,
held within a few inches of the membrane, will cause the sand on
its surface to form regular lines and figures with astonishing celerity,
which vary with the sound produced.
                           TO  HAKE AN .SOLIAN HARP.
    This instrument consists of a long narrow box of very thin deal,
about six inches deep, with a circle in the middle of the upper side,
of an inch and half in diameter, in which are to be drilled small holes.
On this side seven, ten, or more strings of very fine catgut are stretched
over bridges at each end Eke the bridges of a fiddle, and screwed up
or relaxed with screw pins. The strings must all be tuned to one and
the same note,1 and the instrument should be placed in a window
partly open, in which the width is exactly equal to the length of the
harp, with the sash just raised to give the air admission.               When the
air blows upon       these    strings  with different   degrees   of  force it will
excite different tones of sound.          Sometimes     the blast brings out all
the tones     in full concert, and sometimes it sinks them to the softest
murmurs.
    A colossal imitation of the instrument just described was invented
at Milan in 1786, by the Abbate Gattoni. He stretched seven strong
iron wires, tuned to the notes of the gamut, from the top of a tower
sixty feet high, to the house of a Signor Moscate, who was interested
in the success of the experiment, and this apparatus, called the " giant's
   (1) D is a good note for it. The upper string may be tuned to the upper D, and
the two lower to the lower D, and D 1). The " harmonics," are the sounds produced.

                           THE ISYISIKLE GIILL.
    The facility with which the voice circulates through tubes was
known to the ancients, and no doubt has afforded the priests of all
religions means of deception to the ignorant and credulous. But of
late days the light of science dispels all such wicked deceptions.       A
very clever machine was produced at Paris several years ago, and
afterwards exhibited in London under the name of the "Invisible Girl,"
since the apparatus was so constructed that the voice of a female at
a distance was heard as if it originated from a hollow globe, not more
than a foot in diameter.      It consisted of a wooden frame something
like a tent bedstead, formed by four pillars aaaa, connected by upper
cross    rails b b, and similar rails below, while it terminated above in
four bent wires e e, proceeding at right angles of the frame, and
meeting in a central point. The hollow copper ball d, with four
trumpets, 1 1, crossing from it at right angles, hung in the centre of
the frame, being connected with the wires alone by four narrow
ribbons r r. The questions were proposed close to the open mouth
 of one of these trumpets, and the reply was returned from the same
 orifice. The means used in the deception were as follow : a pipe or
tube was attached to one of the hollow pillars, and carried into
 another apartment, in which a female was placed; and this tube
having been carried up the leg or pillar of the instrument to the
 cross-rails, had an aperture exactly opposite two of the trumpet
 mouths ; so that what was spoken was immediately answered through
 a very simple mode of communication.

    This is an art by no means very difficult of acquirement, if the
 young reader will take the pains.        It is produced by a reflection of
 sound within the mouth, the voice being brought to the lowest pos

 sible place in the larynx.     When the art is acquired by practice,
the voice may be made to appear as if coming from any part of
a room, from up a chimney, or from the depths of a cellar.             The
celebrated Dr. Woleott, better known as Peter Pindar, used to
amuse his friends in a remarkable manner with this art.          He would
represent   his landlady  as demanding payment     of her  rent, and hold a
colloquy   with  her, which  would at last rise to terms   of reproach and
fury, and end by a noise as if the landlady had been kicked down
stairs.   The marvellous powers of Matthews,         Le Lagg, Alexander,
and, lastly, Mr. Love, are familiar to most persons.      To learn the art,
the young practitioner must have the power of enunciating well, and
that without motion of the lips, — of disguising the voice, so as to
imitate other sounds, — and of adapting the degree to the apparent
source of the sound.     By practice this art is attamable by any person
whose organs of speech are completely and fully developed.

                  THE GAME OF CHESS.
   IT  is the principal aim of this little treatise to assist the young
player in his examination of the theory of the openings in the game
of chess — a branch of study that to the beginner generally appears to
be of a most dull and uninviting character, but which, nevertheless,
is of the highest importance to all those who are ambitious of attain
ing to any degree of proficiency in the game.
   Before proceeding further, we would presume that the young
player possesses at least an elementary knowledge of the game, such
as the moves and value of the various pieces, the laws of checking,
&c. Should he not be thus fortunate, we would strongly advise him
to have recourse to the assistance of some chess-friend for an explana
tion of the elementary principles ; for, thanks to the almost daily
increasing knowledge of the game, there are few localities so remote
that cannot produce a brother of the free-masonry of chess. Though, in
compliance with the time-honoured custom of all writers on chess, we

subjoin a brief description of the various pieces and their moves, yet
it is our firm conviction that no beginner nas ever succeeded in mas
                                "            "
tering by the assistance of the books alone, the mere elementary
principles of the game.
   In the following pages we have endeavoured to give a brief synopsis
of the most important of the openings, collected from the most
approved authorities, and at the same tune to present to the tyro as
it were a passing glimpse of the chief modern discoveries.
   If  we have occasionally strayed from the beaten path, or insensibly
diverged into any of the as yet unexplored regions of chess, we would
fain crave the reader's kind indulgence for any of those errors which
almost invariably find their way into variations that have not under
             " limse labor," or the test of actual
gone the                                             play. Finally, should
we have had the good fortune by the followmg pages to assist a
single beginner in mastering any of the elementary difficulties which
beset the rough road that only leads to proficiency in chess— should
there, through our means, have been added but a single recruit to the
ranks of Caissa, well will our labour have been repaid !
                          THE LAWS   OP THE GAME.
    I. — The  chess-board must be so placed that each player has a white
corner square nearest his right-hand.          If the board have been im
properly placed, it must be adjusted, provided four moves on each
side have not been played, but not afterwards.
          If
    II. — a Piece or Pawn be misplaced at the beginning of the game,
either player may insist upon the mistake being rectified, if he dis
cover it before playing his fourth move, but not afterwards.
    III. — Should a player, at the commencement of the game, omit to
place all his men on the board, he may correct the omission before
plaving his fourth move, but not afterwards.
           If
    IV. — a player, undertaking to give the odds of a Piece or Pawn,
neglect to remove it from the board, his adversary, after four moves
have been played on each side, has the choice of proceeding with or
recommencmg the game.
    V. — When no odds are given, the players must take the first move
of each game alternately, drawing lots to determine who shall begin
the first game.      If a game be drawn, the player who began it has the
first move of the following one.
    VI. — The player who gives the odds has the right of moving first
in each game, unless otherwise agreed. Whenever a Pawn is given,
it is understood to be always the King's Bishop's Pawn.
    VII. — A Piece or Pawn touched must be played, unless at the
moment of touching it the player say
                                            " J'adouue" or words to that
effect ; but   if a Piece or Paton be displaced or overturned by accident,
it may be restored to its place.
    VIII.  — While a player holds the Piece or Pawn he has tonched, he

                                                            CHESS.                                  409

quitted              it,
           he cannot recall the move.
   IX. — Should player take one of his adversary's Pieces or Pawns,
                                    a
without saying " aduube" or words to that effect, his adversary may
                                 J
compel him to take it; but           cannot be legally taken, he may

that he cannot be legally moved, no penalty can be inflicted.
   X. — Should     player move one of his adversary's men, his anta
                                 a
gonist has the option of compelling him — 1st, to replace the Piece or
Pawn and move his King 2d, to replace the Piece or Pawn and

                it

   XI. —             If

                           a

                                              it
has the option of compelling him to take with                        it a    aPiece or Pawn that
can legally take     or to move his own Piece

touched.
   XTT. — Should    player take one of his own men with another, his
                                     a
adversary has the option of obliging him to move either.

 "Check," his adversary is not obliged to attend to it; but if the
 former, in playing his next move, were to say

 must retract his last move, and he that is under check must
 obviate          it.
     XIX. — If  the King has been in check for several moves, and it
 cannot be ascertained     how it occurred, the player whose King is in
 check must retract his last move and free his King from the check ;
 but if the moves made subsequent to the check be known, they must
 be retracted.

to interpose, he may retract such move, provided his adversary have
not completed his last move.
   XXI. — Every Pawn which has reached the eighth or last square
of the chess-board, must be immediately exchanged for             Queen or          a
any  other  Piece  the  player may   think fit, even though  all the  Pieces
remain on the board.       It follows, therefore, that he may have two or
more Queens, three or more Rooks, Bishops, or Knights.

each side at most, or the game will be considered as drawn the fifty                ;
moves commence from the time the adversary gives notice that he
will count them. The law holds good for afl other checkmates of
Pieces only, such as Queen, or Rook only, Queen against               Rook,             a

                                 2.

Q. to  K. B's 3d; B. to Q's 3d; P. to Q's 4th; and P. to K. B's 4th.
Of these the first three are utterly untenable, and the last two are
highly dangerous.        Should he play 2. P. to"K. B's 3d, you reply with
3. Kt. takes K's       P.,  checking with Q. at K. B's 5th, if the Kt. be
taken. Should he play 2. Q. to K. B's 3d,-or B. to Q's 3d, yon
equally reply with B. to Q. B's 4th, with the advantage.                           If he
adopt    2. P.  to Q's   4th,   you  play 3.   P.   takes  P.,  following   it  up  with
Q's Kt. to B's 3d, if he retake with Queen. If he play 2. P. to K. B's
4th, you reply 3. Kt. takes K's P., or B. to Q. B's 4th, and obtain the
better game shortly.          Having disposed of these unsafe defences, we
will now return to the examination of the three satisfactory replies : —
P. to Q's 3d; K's Kt. to B's 3d; Q's Kt. to B's 3d. For the last two,

This is your best reply       ;  if instead  you play, —

                       Variation   A. on Whites 5tk Move.
     White has another move at this point, which seems at least as good
 as 5. P. to Q's 4th ; viz, Q's Kt. to B's 3d.

       2. K's Kt. to B's 3d.                 2. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
     This is recommended by nearly all authors, as Black's best reply.
 Of late, however, there has been an opinion prevalent among many
 of our best players, that it is inferior to K's Kt. to B's 3d, or even
 P. to Q's 3d. For our own part, we incline to the old move of
 Q's Kt. to B's 3d, but doubt whether there is any defence by which
 Black can acquire & perfectly men game.

             to B's 3d.
    These are the moves         given in the Handbook, and the game is
 dismissed    as equal.   In  actual play, however, we should take Black's
game for choice.

    White's 6th move is recommended by the German masters, and
in our opinion is preferable to P. to K's 5th ; Black's best reply is to
check, —

                    GAME    IV. — THE  EVANS' GAMBIT.
    It v, unlit be impossible, in the narrow limits assigned to our
treatise, to enter into the merits of this opening; we shall there
fore give one or two of the leading variations, and refer learners,
who may be desirous of a more comprehensive             analysis, to Mr.
Walker's excellent articles on this popular opening, in Vol. ix. of the
"Chess Player's Chronicle," the "Handbook/' and Mr.Boden's useful
little work, entitled " A Popular Introduction to Chess."
                 WHITE.                            BLACK.
      1. P. to K's 4th.                 1. P. to K's 4th.

      9. B. to Q. Kt's 2d.              9. K's Kt. to B's 3d.
    Instead of 9. B. to Q. Kt.'s 2d, you may adopt several other modes
of play; viz., 9. B.to Q. R's 3d; 9. R. to K's sq.; 9. P. to K. It's
3d; 9. Q's Kt. to B's 3d. To the two first of these, Black equally
replies with Q's B. to K. Kt.'s 5th, with the better game.            (For
9. P. to K. R's 3d, and 9. Q's Kt. to B's 3d, see Variations A.

      9. P. to K. R's   3d.             9. Kt. to Q. R's 4th.
    This is the move usually recommended        for the defence.    Black
may however adopt, 9.      P. to K. R's 3d, apparently with little  disad
vantage.
    10.  B. to Q's 3d.                 10. K's Kt. to K's 2d.

                         The game is about equal.

     9.  Q's  Kt. to B's      3d.
   We have long suspected that the force of this form of the attack
has been vastly underrated. The following variations are taken from
an able analysis by Mr. G. B. Fraser, o? Dundee, who has kindly
presented the result of his labours              in the investigation of this attack
at our disposal: —
                                                   9. B. to K. Kt.'s 5th.
   This move is considered by all the modern writers                        on Chess to
be Black's best reply.
   10. Q. to Q.       R's 4th.                    10. B. takes Kt.
   In   reply to White's last move, Black may play either 10. Q. to
Q's 2d, or 10. B. to Q's 2d, instead of the move m the text.                      If he
adopt 10. Q. to Q's 2d, White replies with B. to Q, Kt.'s 5th,
apparently winning a piece.              It has been suggested to us that per
haps Black's best move is 10. K. to B's sq., to which White nught
reply with K. Kt. to his 5th ; and on Black s moving K. Kt. to R's
3d, advance the P. to Q's 5th.              (For B. to Q's 2d, see Variation A.)
   11.   P. to Q's 5th.                          11.  B. to K. Kt.'s 5th. (best.)
   12.   P. takes Q's Kt.                        12.  P. takes P.
   Black might play also Q's R. to Q. Kt.'s sq., whereupon follows, —
             13. P. takes  P. (dis. ch.)                15. B. to Q's   2d.
             14. Q. to  a  Kt.'s 3d, and   v. ins.
   13.   P. to K's 5th.
   White might also with advantage take the Q. B's P. checking,
although the move in the text seems stronger.
                                                 13. B. to K's 3d.
   If  he play, —

    This is Black's best reply. If he retire the Kt. to his square, or
to K's square, or K. Kt.'s 5th, White will obtain a winning game, by
16. Q. to K. B's 4th. (ch.)
    16. Q. to   K. B's 4th.                 16.  P. to K. Kt.'s 4th. (best.)
    17. Q. to   Q's 2d.
   This seems White's most promising move. He may also play
17. Q. takes Kt., upon which Black exchanges Queens with the better
game.
                                            17. Kt. to K. It's 2d.
   18. P.   to  Q's  5th.                   18. B. to K. B's 4th.
   Black might also take Pawn with Pawn, and the game would pro
bably be continued thus : —
                                                   is. P. ttk«> P.
             19. Kt. takes P. (ch.)                19. K. to Kt.'s 2d.
             20. B. to Q. Kt.'s 2d.                20. Kt. to K. B's 3d.
             21. K. to R's sq.                     21. B. to K's sq.
             22. P. to K. B's 4th, and will win.
   19.  P. to K's 6th. (ch.)                19.  K.  to K's   2d.
   20.  Kt. to Q's 4th.                     20.  B. to K. Kt.'s 3d.
   21.  P. to K. B's 4th, with       a fine attack.
   Instead of retiring his Bishop to Q. B's 4th, as in Game IV. Black
may, though apparently less advantageously, play him to Q. R's 4th.
                   WHITE.                                BLACK.

     2. K's Kt. to B's     3d.               8. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
     3. B. to Q. B's 4th.                    3. B. to Q. B's 4th.
     4. P. to Q. Kt.'s 4th.                  4. B. takes P.
     5. P. to Q. B's 3d.                     5. B. to Q. R's 4th.
     6. P. to Q's 4th. (best.)                6. P. takes P.
     7. Castles.                             7. P. to Q's 3d.
     8. Q. to Q. Kt.'s 3d.                    8. Q. to K. B's 3d. (best.)
     8. P. takes P., with a very fine game.
   N.B.— Should Black at his 7th move, instead of 7. P. to Q's 3d,
play P. to Q. B's P., or K's Kt. to B's 3d, you, in reply, advance
P. to K's 5th, with a powerful attack.
                           THE GAMBIT DECLINED.
   We now come to consider the consequences                      of Black's not
accepting the gambit pawn at move 4.
                   WHITE.                               BLACK.
     1. P. to K's 4th.                       1. P. to K's 4th.

                          We prefer White's game.

 476                        EVERY     BOY'S BOOK.
    There is also another method of declining the Gambit, which,
 although hitherto unanalysed, seems to present some interesting
 features.
                  WHITE.                                 BLACK.

   5. P. takes Q's P.                       5. Kt. takes Q. Kt.'s P.
   6.  P. to Q. B's 3d.                     6.  Kt. takes Q's P.

   9.  Q. takes Q.                          9. Q. takes Q.
 10.   Kt.  takes  K's P.                          Even Game.
    It is very possible some of White's moves may be improved upon ;
 but the foregoing variation seems satisfactorily to demonstrate that
 Black can gam no advantage.
    Before taking our leave of this beautiful opening, we would again
 remind the young player, that it is perfectly immaterial, whether
 Black at move 5 captures the gambit pawn with B. or Kt., if with
the latter White equally replies with P. to Q. B's 3d; and on Black's
retiriug the Kt. to Q. B's 3d (best), the position becomes the same
 as given in a previous variation.
                  GAME   V. — RUY LOPEZ KNIGHT'S GAME.
    We will now proceed to examine this, perhaps, the strongest and
most     embarrassing attack the board affords.        It is through fear of
this variation, that many of our best players have abandoned the usual
defence of 2. Q's Kt. to B's 3d, and turned to the King's Knight's
defence, or the old move of P. to Q's 3d.
                  WHITE.                                BLACK.
      1.  P. to K's 4th.                   1. P. to K's 4th.
      2.  K's Kt. to B's  3d.              2. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
      3.  B. to Q. Kt.'s 5th.              3. K's Kt. to B's 3d.
    By playing your Bishop thus, you again threaten to win his K's P.
The move in the text, commonly known as the Berlin defence, is
perhaps as good a reply as the position admits.             He has, however,
three other plausible     moves;    viz., B.  to Q. B's 4th; B. to K's 2d;
P. to Q's 3d, which will be touched upon hereafter.
      4.  P. to Q's 4th.                   4.  P. takes P.
    This move (or perhaps still better, 4. Castles) appears to yield a
far stronger attack than the old move of Q. K's 3d. Black, instead of
P. takes P., might either reply with 4. K's Kt. takes K's P., or 4.
Q's Kt. takes Q s P.      If  the former, perhaps castling at once is your

 best reply   ;  if the latter, yon take Kt. with    K's Kt, and then play
 P. to K's    5th, as in the present variation.

     8.  Q. takes     Kt.                  8.  P. to K. B's 4th.
     9. P. takes     P. en passant.        9.  Kt. takes P.

                          While has a very fine game.
   We will now turn our attention to the other modes of play Black
may adopt at his 3d move, instead of K's Kt. to B's 3d ; viz., B. to
Q. B's 4th; P. to Q's 3d; B. to K's 2d. (see Variations B. C.)

     8. P. to Q's 5th.                     8. Q's Kt. to his sq.
        White may also play 8. Q's      Kt  to B's 3d with advantage.
     9. P. to Q's 6th.                     9.  P. takes P.
   10. Q. takes P.                       10.   B. to Q. B's 2d.

   12. K's R. to Q's sq.                  12.  B. to Q's 3d.
   The move 12. K. R. to Q's sq. is recommended in the Handbook
as giving White an advantage of position.            The reply, however, in
the text, which occurred to the writer in actual play, seems calculated
to free Black from his embarrassment.
                       Variation C. on Black's Zd Move.

considerably embarrassed Mr. Cochrane, who considered there was no
satisfactory defence to it.     Major Jaenisch, however, with charac
teristic patience and analysis, has proved the contrary.

   If he  play 4. Kt. takes P., you reply with either Kt. takes        Kt., or
Kt.   takes K's P., and obtain the better position.
     4. B. to Q. B's 4th.                4. B. to Q. B's 4th.
   This is now acknowledged to be Black's best move          ; for 4. B. to Q.
Kt.'s 5th. (ch.) see Variation A.
     5. P. to Q. B's 3d.                 5.   K's Kt. to B's   3d. (best.)
    And the position is the same as given in the leading variation of the
Giuoco Piano, see page 472.        Should Black instead play : P. takes
Q. B's P., you take his K. B's P. with your B. (ch.); and if he takes
the Bishop with King, play Q. to Q's 5th (ch.), and then take his
Bishop.
                     Variation A. on Slaelfs 4M Move.
                   WHITE.                             BLACK.

      6. Castles.                        6.    P. to Q. B's 7th.
    Instead of 6. Castles, you might adopt       Mr. Cochrane's method of
 continuing the attack, by 6. P. takes P.
    N.B. — It would    be very bad play  of Black to take the Q. Kt.'s P.,
 instead of the move in the text.
      7. Q. takes  P.                    7.    P. to Q's 3d.
      8. P. to Q.  R's 4th.              8.    B. to Q. R's 4th.
      9. P. to Q.  Kt.'s 4th.            9.    B. to Kt.'s 3d.
    10. Q. to Q. Kt.'s 3d, with   a fine game.
    There is another not uninteresting method of attack, which White
 might adopt at his fifth move, instead of 5. P. to Q. B's 3d; viz., K's
 Kt. to his 5th.
      5. K's Kt. to his 5th.                5.  K's Kt. to R's 3d. (best.)

      8. Q. to R's 5th.                    8.   P. to K. Kt.'s 3d.

                                     CHESS.                             479
    Black's 9th move was first suggested in an able analysis on this
 variation by Messrs. Jaenisch and Schummoff, in the " Chess Player's
 Chronicle      for July, 1850. It is far superior to the old move of P. to
 Q's 3d, and without great care on your part will give him an irre
 sistible attack.
    10. Castles.                            10.  P. takes P.
    This is your strongest move, and appears to have been overlooked
 by the talented authors of the article in question: —
    10.   P. to Q. B's   3d. (best.)        10. R. to K's  sq.
    If   Black play 10. P. to Q's 6th, you reply with Q. to Q. B's 4th
 (ch.), winning the King's Pawn.
    11. B. to K. Kt.'s 5th.              11. Q. to Q's 3d.
    12. Q. takes Q.                      12. P. takes Q.
    13. P. takes P.                      13. Kt. takes P.
    14. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
  And Black will have great difficulty in avoiding the loss of a Pawn.
    There is another variation of this opening hitherto, we believe,
unanalysed, which, although it presents many points of interest, seems
altogether unknown to the majority of amateurs.
                    WHITE.                           BLACK.

      3. P. to Q's 4th.                    3. P. takes P.

     7. P. to K. B's 4th.                 7.  P. to Q's 6th. (dis. ch.)
    If   he play 7.  B. to K. Kt.'s 5th, your best reply     seems to be Q.
to K's sq., although you might obtain a strong but hazardous attack
by playing Q. to her 3d, and afterwards, on his attacking her. with
($s Kt. to Q. Kt.'s 3d.
     8. K. to R's sq.                     8.  P. takes P.
     9. Q. takes P.                       9.  Q's Kt. to Q's 5th.
   10. Q. to Q. B's 3d.
   And although minus a Pawn, you have a fine game.           If he now play
P. to K. B's      3d, you reply with B. to K's 3d.

   By this move you attack his weakest point, viz. the K. B's P.
Most of the classical writers on Chess concur in recommending the
same move as Black's best reply.       Major Jaenisch and the German
authors unanimously recommend 2 K's Kt. to B's 3d in preference,
the move generally adopted in actual play.       (See Game ILL)
   White has now several methods of continuing the attack. He
may play the move recommended by Philidor, viz. P. to Q. B's 3d,
to which Black may reply with either K's Kt. to B's 3d, or Q. to
K. Kt.'s 4th, or P. to Q's 4th, in every case with at least an equal
game.
   You may also play K's Kt. to B's 3d, and upon Black's bringing
out his Q's   Kt., the position is resolved into the Giuoco Piano.
   If you play Q. to K. It's 5th, (a move frequently adopted by
young players,) Black will reply with Q. to K. B's 3d, or to K's iJd,
with no inferiority of position.    Besides these moves you have two
others at command, viz. Q, to K's 2d, and P. to Q. Kt.'s 4th, which
we will proceed to examine.

    3.  Q. to K's 2d.                   3. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
  By playing thus you threaten at once to take his K. B's P. (ch.),
and  if K. takes B , to win his Bishop in return by the check of the
Q. The move in the text is Black's best reply, any other move
would leave you with at least an even position.

   Your third move is probably the best on the board; 3. P. to
Q's 4th, and 3. P. to 0,'s 3d, seem much inferior, as Black imme
diately gains the attack.

was first analysed by Mr. Boden, in his "Popular Introduction,"
where Black's reply, of 4. K's Kt. to B's 3d, is recommended as his
best; we believe, however, he can at least as advantageously play

                                  THE KING'S GAMBIT.
                                        GAME I.
   This beautiful and brilliant debut, which, as Mr. Stannton observes,
gives birth to the most intricate and beautiful combinations the
chess-men are susceptible of, has been a universal favourite with every
class of players from the earliest stages of European Chess up to
the present day. In order to facilitate the analysis of this opening,
as far as our narrow limits will permit, we shall divide it mto its
three principal heads; viz., The Kmg's Knight's Gambit, The Allgaier
Gambit, and the King's Bishop's Gambit, and afterwards devote a
few words to the Gunbit Declined.
              WHITE.                                                 BLACK.
       1. P. to K's 4th,                            1.   P. to K's   4th,
       8. P. to K. B's 4th.                         2.   P. takes P.
       3. K's Kt. to B's 3d.                        3.   P. to K. Kt.'s 4th.
   This is Black's best move, indeed the only one to retain the
gambit pawn. He, however, may obtain a nearly equal game by
3. P. to Q's 4th.  If he play 3. B. to K's 2d, commonly known as
the Cunningham Gambit, White replies with B. to Q. B's 4th, and
on Black's checking with B. at B s 5th, plays K. to B's sq., with
a much better game.
       4.    B..   to   Q.   B's 4th.               4.   B. to K. Kt.'s 2d (best), or
                                                             Var. A.
       5.   P. to       Q    B's 3d.                5.   P. toK   K's 3d. (best.)

   Should Black play the obvious-looking move of 4. P. to Q's 3d,
White gains a striking advantage                   by the following mode of
play:   —
              6. Q. to «. Kt.'B 3d.                   6. Q. to K's 2d.
              7. Q. to Q. Kt.'s 5th. (ch.)            1. B. on P. interposes.
              8. a  take! K. Kt.'s F., So.
     6. P. to Q's 4th.                         6.   P. to Q's 3d.
     7. Castles.                               7.   Q's Kt. to Q's     3d.
   This is usually considered his best move, though Q's Kt. to B's
3d, or    K's Kt. to K's 3d, are perhaps equally good.
      8. P. to K. Kt's 3d.                     8. P. to K. Kt.'s 5th.
   If he takes P. with P.,        you get a fine attack by B. takes         K. B's P.
      9. Kt. to K. R's 4th, (or to K's 9.          Kt. to Q. Kt.'s 3d.
   10. B. to Q. Kt.'s 3d.               [sq.) 10.   P. to K. B's 6th.
                 He has a Pawn more, and a strong position.
    N.B.— Instead of 5. P. to Q. B's 3d, you may also play                 5. P. to K.
R's 4th, with a good attack.

                            And Black has      a fine Game.
     You seem to have no better move than 9. B. takes K's Kt.; if you
 play Kt to Q's 3d, he replies with K. Kt.'s P. takes P., and your
 game is gone.

   Some authors recommend Q's Kt. to B's 3d as more attacking than
the move in the text. It has however been proved untenable m the
"Handbook"                (page 281.)

  Mr. Staunton recommends 12. R. to K. B's 2d, instead of retiring
the King to R's sq. We have tried this move     actual play, follow  in
ing    up with Q's R. to K. B's sq., which seems to give White an
      it
overwhelming attack.

   The moves up to this point, both for attack and defence, are given
by  Jaenisch and the "Handbook" as the best the board affords; with
the best play, probably the game ought to be drawn.
   We much regret that our space will not allow of more elaborate          a
analysis of this oeautiful gambit; we trust, however, that the above
variations will show the young player the difficulty and resource of
this opening.
   We cannot quit the subject without alluding to defence lately            a
introduced      Messrs. Kenig and Horwitz, which consists in Black's
                     by
playing       to K's 2d at his 5th move, instead of taking the Kt.
                Q.
With all deference and respect for the wonderful and almost inex
haustible power of analysis displayed                     by
                                           these two eminent players,
we must confess that we have our doubts as to the soundness of the
move in question.     The young plavers, however, will find      fully            it
analysed in Kling and Horwitz'     "Chess Studies," one of the most
                                             s
valuable and interesting works on Chess of modern days, which needs
not our recommendation to find its way to the book'-shelf of every
lover of Chess.

                    GAME  I. — THE   ALLGAIEB GAMBIT.
   This opening, the invention of which is erroneously ascribed to All-
gaier, has of late years become a favourite with all classes of players ;
though we agree with Mr. Boden in considering that its resources
have been considerably       overrated,  although not perhaps     from the
same reason as adduced     in his " Popular Introduction."

   You may here play your Kt. to K's 5th, or to K. Kt.'s 5th.
Modern authorities agree in recommending the former, as giving a
more lasting attack. As, however, some very embarrassing positions
may arise from playing the Kt. to his 5th, we will examine the con
sequences resulting from it at present, leaving the move of 5. Kt. to
K's 5th for after examination, (Game II.).
    5.  Kt. to Kt.'s 5th.                 5.  P. to K. It's 3d. (best.)

    7.  B. to Q. B's 4th. (ch.)           7. P. to Q's 4th.
   Your 7th move gives a far more embarrassing attack than the old
move of Q. takes K. Kt.'s P., to which Black replies, K's Kt. to B's 3d.
with a winning position.
   In the present game Black's reply of P. to Q's 4th is his only
move.    If he retire K. to Kt.'s  sq., you must gain some advantage by
Q. takes   K. Kt.'s P, &c.
    8.  B. takes P. (ch.)                8.  K. to K's  sq.
   In our  opinion the move of K. to K's sq. is preferable to K. to
Kt.'s  2d.  At all events the defence seems much simpler, and at least
as satisfactory.

486                         -EVERY    BOY'S   BOOK.
    Black's 5th move      has been recommended by almost all the autho
rities as the correct     reply; although the moves 5. P. to Q's 3d;
5. B. to K's 2d; or       5. K's Kt. to B's 3d, seem, to say the least,
equally advantageous       for the second player.
      6.  B. to  a B's 4th.                6.  Kt. to K. It's 3d.
      7.  P. to Q's 4th.                   7.  P. to K. B's 6th.
      8.  P. takes P. (best.)              8.  P. to Q's 3d.
      9.   Kt. to Q's 3d.                  9.  B. to K's 2d.
    10.   B. to K's 3d.
    This is the move given by the " books ;" B. to K. B's 4th, however,
appears at least as good.
                                         10.   B. takes K. R's P. (ch.)

    13. Q. to K. B's 4th.                13.   Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
    One of the advantages of the move 10. B. to K. B's 4th, as sug
gested above, seems to be that the White Q. could not be played to
K's 3d, instead of the more assailable part of K. B's 4th.
    14. Q's    Kt. to B's  3d.
    And the game, in spite of the formidable appearance of the adverse
Bishops, seems in White's favour, from the disposition of his forces,
so well calculated for a vigorous assault.
    N.B. — It would be      very unadvisable for Black to reply to   White's

    Major Jaenisch, to whom we owe almost all our knowledge of this

 in favour of the move in the text.

    We would recommend this defence to the young player, (especially
when receiving the odds of a piece,) as it leads at once to at least an
even game, and avoids an intricate and difficult series of moves, the
least error in which would be fatal.

played without danger.

  488                         EVERY   BOY'S BOOK.
     Instead of Black's 8th move of P. takes P., Mr. Stannton suggests
  the highly ingenious move of castling; and the game would probably
  be continued thus: —
                                            8. Castles.
       9.  Kt. to K's  2d. (best.)          9. K to   K's sq.
     This is your best reply, if you capture either B. or      P. you lose in
  a few moves. (See the " Handbook/' p. 335.)
     10.   Q's Kt. to B's 3d.            10.   B. to K. B's 3d.
                 We do not see that Black has anything better.
     11.   Q's Kt. to K's 4th.
     And White has some little advantage.         It is worth while remark
 ing, that    if Black now adopt the temptmg move of B. to K. Kt.'s 5th,
 White will win at least a pawn. We leave the " modus operandi "
 for the investigation of the young player.
     We cannot take our leave of this inexhaustible opening, without
 once more recommending the amateur who is ambitious of becoming
 initiated into the mysteries of the Bishop's         Gambit, to study the
 admirable articles on this d6but, published by       Major Jaenisch, m the
 late volumes of the "Chess-Player's Chronicle,"     which exhibit, perhaps,
 the most patient and profound analysis the          annals   of Chess have
 ever produced.
                           THE GAMBIT REFUSED.
    The refusal of the gambit, though it may be done with perfect
safety, generally leads to a dull and uninteresting game; we would
therefore advise the young player to accept the proffered pawn, more
especially when receiving the odds of a piece, as he will gain more
knowledge of the game by observing the manner in which a fine
player pursues his attack, than can be obtained from all the works
that have ever been written on the subject.

     2.   P. to K. B's 4th.               2. B. to Q. Bs 4th.
    This has usually been received as tne best method of declining the
gambit, though a preference has sprung up lately in favour of P. to.
Q's 4th (See Game II.). Major Jaenisch recommends K's Kt. to
B's 3d, to which you reply with P. takes P.; and upon his taking
K's P. with Kt., you play K's Kt. to B's 3d.

gives birth to many beautiful and critical positions, and unless pro
perly opposed, is very embarrassing.

                                                         correct  one, whereby
               (See Game II.) Black's reply
unanalysed.                                       is the
he reduces the game to a position similar to one          in  the  K. Kt.'s de
fence to the King's Bishop's game.        (For B. to Q. Kt.'s 5th. (ch.) see

    Perhaps your soundest move at this point is 6. Q. to Q. Kt.'s 3d,

   And though minus a pawn, you have an ample equivalent in the
attack.     It  is highly probable that many moves, both of attack and
defence, in this somewhat novel variation may be improved upon.        I
                     I
only regret that am precluded, both by want of time and space, from
going further into the variations.

   It is  considered more advisable to decline the gambit. (See Game

slight inferiority of position.

   Your move of P. to K's 3d, appears somewhat preferable to P. to
K's 4th,     as recommended by the "classical" writers on Chess, to
which Black would equally reply with P. to K's 4th, with an even
game.     It is worth while remarking, that if he attempt to sustain the
gambit pawn by P. to Q. Kt.'s 4th, you gain the advantage. (See

             WHITE.                                 BLACK.
      1.  P. to Q's 4th.                   1.  P. to Q's 4th.
      1.  P. to Q. B's 4th.                2.  P. to K's 3d.
 This is now acknowledged to be his best method of declining the
                                   gambit.
      3. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.                 3. K's Kt. to B's 3d.
      4. P. to K's 3d.                      4. P. to Q. B's 4th.
    Your 4th move is the one given by all "the books."               In the
 late match between Messrs. Lbwenthal and Harrwitz, the latter
 several times adopted the move of 4. Q's B. to K. B's 4th, at this
juncture, with advantage, a sortie hitherto denounced by most of the
 modern writers on Chess.
      5. K's Kt. to B's 3d.                5.  Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
      6. P. to Q. R's 3d.                  6.  P. to Q. R's 3d.
                   There is no advantage on either side.
    We will now briefly examine those other methods of opening
a game, which either player may adopt in lieu of 1. P. to K's 4th,
or 1. P. to Q's 4th.
    The most important of these the second player has at his command
to reply to 1. P. to K's 4th, are, 1. P. to Q. B's 4th, and 1. P. to K's 3d.
It   is true there are other moves, such as 1. P. to Q's 4th ; 1. P. to
K. Kt.'s 3d.; 1. P. to Q. Kt.'s 3d.; 1. P. to Q's 3d.; but they are of so
rare occurrence in actual play, we shall hardly be justified in our
narrow limits for entering into an analysis of them.
                      THE SICILIAN DEFENCE.
                                 GAME     I.
                   WHITE.                            BLACK.
      1. P. to K's 4th.                    1.  P. to Q. B's  4th.
    This move, in the opinion of Mr. Staunton, Major Jaenisch, and the
authors of the German " Handbuch," is the best Black has on the
board.     We have always considered, and we support our opinion on
the authority of many eminent players, that the merits of the move
in question have been somewhat overrated ; or at least, that they can
only be thoroughly appreciated by a first-rate player. We would
earnestly dissuade the young player from gettmg into a habit of
adopting these defences in ordinary games, as he will insensibly fall
into a dull uninteresting style of play, and hence render many good
players unwilling to encounter him.
    You have several replies to his move of P. to Q. B's 4th; viz,
1. P. to Q's 4th; 1. B. to Q. B's 4th; 1. P. to Q. B's 4th; 1. P. to

                                 CHESS.                              493
K. B's 4th; 1. K's Kt. to B's 3d; and 1. P. to Q. Kt.'s 4th. Of these
we will only examine the two first, as all the others appear, with the
best play on both sides, to leave you with a slightly inferior game.
    2  P. to Q's 4th.                 2    P. takes  P.
   (Tor 2. B. to Q. B's 4th, see Game II.)       If Black, instead of the
move in the text, play P. to K's 3d, you acquire the better game by
P. to Q's 5th, &c.
    3.  K's Kt. to B's 3d.            3. Q's    Kt.  to B's 3d.
   Your third move seems preferable to 3. Q. takes P., as in that case
Black could gain a move by 3. Q. Kt. to B's 3d. Black plays here the
correct move. If he attempt to sustain his pawn by P. to K's 4th, you
reply with B. to Q. B's 4th, and get a strong attack on his K. B's P.
    4.  Kt. takes Q's P.              4.    P. to K's 3d. (best.)
   You might also play   4. B. to Q. B's 4th, or to Q. Kt.'s 5th.
    5.  Kt. takes Kt.                   5.  Q.  Kt.'s P. takes  Kt.
   Your 5th move, though, perhaps, not theoretically sound, as it
unites Black's pawns in the centre, is perhaps, as good as any on the
board.    You may also play Q's Kt. to B's 3d, or K's Kt. to B's 3d,
or K's Kt. to Q. Kt.'s 3d, without danger.
    6.  B. to Q's 3d.                  6. B. to Q. B's 4th.
    7. Q's  Kt. to B's 3d, with a well-opened game.

   If  you play 3. P. to K's 5th, on Philidor's principle of pawn-play,
Black will speedily gain the advantage ; see Variation A.
     4. B. to Q's 3d.                     4.  B. to Q's 3d.

     7. Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
                           The game is quite even.
   N.B. — You may also play 7. P. to Q. B's 3d; though bringing out
the Q's KL is now considered stronger.
                     Variation A. on   Whilst    3rf Move.
                    WHITE.                            BLACK.

     2.  P. to Q's 4th.                   2.  P. to Q's  4th.
     3.  P. to K's 5th.                   3.  P. to Q. B's 4th.
     4.  B. to Q. Kt.'s  5th. (eh.)       4.  Q's Kt. to B's 3d.
   It   is difficult to say what is your best move here;         if you play
4.  P. to Q. B's 3d, he replies 4..Q. to Q. Kt.'s 3d. &c.
     5.   B. takes Kt. (ch.)              5.  P. takes B.
     6. P. to Q. B's 3d.                  6.  Q. to Q. Kt.'s 3d.
     7. K's Kt. to B's 3d.                7. Q's B. to Q. Rs 3d.
     8.   Q's Kt. to Q's  2d.             8. P. takes Q's P.
     9.  P. takes P.                      9. P. to Q. B's 4th,
Black has the advantage, owing to your weak move of 3. P. to K's 5th.
   Before taking leave of the Opening, it would, perhaps, be as well
to examine the other methods of commencing a game at your com
mand, besides the usual moves of 1. P. to iC's 4th, or 1. P. to Q's
4th. The principal of these are 1. P. to K. B's 4th, and 1. P to Q.
B's 4th.

     5.   B. to K's 2d.                   5.  P. to Q. Kt.'s 3d.
    5. B. to Q's 3d, though a somewhat poor-looking move, will, we
 believe, be found in actual play at least as good as 5. B. to K's 2d;

as you will then be enabled to bring your Q's Kt. round by K's 2dto

               •WHITE.                                BLACK.
     1. P. to Q. B's 4th.               1.  P. to K's  4th.
   The author of the Handbook objects to Black's reply, on the
ground that White obtains the position of the Sicilian game, with
 the advantage of the move. With all deference for so high an autho
      I
rity, believe that in actual play the move in question can be adopted
•without disadvantage.       Black may also play 1. P. to Q. B's 4th,
 with an even game.
     2. Q's Kt. to B's   3d.             2.  K's Kt. to B's 3d.
   The Handbook gives 2. P. to K. B's 4th for Black, which seems
somewhat inferior to the move in the text.
     3. P. to K's  3d.                   3.  P. to Q's 4th.
   He may also play B. to Q. Kt.'s 5th,     or Q's Kt. to B's 3d. without
danger.
     4. P. takes P.                      4.  Kt. takes P.
     5. B. to Q. B's 4th.
   Black may now retire his Kt. to K. B's 3d, or take Kt. with Kt.,
or play B. to K's 3d, apparently without any disadvantage.

   (1) From this point, with anything like care on Black's part, the game is easily
drawn.
   (2) The defence to the Ruy Lopez Kt.'s game is the great chess problem of the day.
We believe that either the move in the text, or 3. P. to Q's 3d, though involving a
somewhat cramped position, may he ventured on without danger. We have always
considered the move of K's Kt. to B's 3d to have been overrated, owing to the violent
attack obtainable by the first player by castling, or advancing the Q's P. two squaret.
Indeed, the old moves of 3. B. to Q. B's 4th, or Q's Kt. to Q's 5th, seem to us pre
ferable to bringing out the K's Kt.

                              White mates in two moves.
    (1) White having to far committed himself, he must proceed with the attack, cost
what it may.
   (2) A weak move, losing valuable time.
   (3) A singular coup.      It is obvious the Rook cannot be taken.
   (4)  His best move   at this  point.  If he play P. to Q's 3d the game would probably
be continued thus : —
              6. Q. to Q. Kt.'s 3d.                           5. P. to Q's 3d.

               8. Q. takes K. Kt.'s P. &c.                    7. B. to Q's 2d.
   (5) The move recommended by the early writers on this opening.               It Is far
inferior to Q's Kt. to Q's 2d., or Q's Kt. to B's 3d., or K's Kt. to K's 2d.

he taken the Rook with his Queen, would have lost her by the check of tlie Bishop.

           "White to black and black to white.
             Now give the challenge— wage the fight."— CLAHKSON.
   DRAUGHTS is a modern invention, and is a good preliminarv to
chess.    It is not so intricate a game, for the pieces are of equal
 value till they become lungs, and can only move one way ; but like
chess, success depends entirely npon skill, and one false move fre
quently occasions the loss of the game.             Draughts seems to have
come   into vogue  in Europe    about the   middle of the fourteenth century,
and for a long time there were two
 methods    of playing it; the one
commonly used in England being
the French game, which is played
                                                  a a            CD
upon a chess-board, and the other
the Polish game, which requires a
board with ten squares or chequers
in each row, and twenty men. The
men in the Polish game can only
move forwards as they do in the                              H B
French game, but they have the
privilege of taking backwards and
forwards, and the ting, when made,
if not opposed by two men close to
gether, can move from one corner of the board to the other
                                      L  i.

514                             EVERY   BOY'S     BOOK.
The Polish game admits of most variety, and is in our opinion
infinitely the best, but it is little played in this country, except by
foreigners, many of whom during the Great Exhibition year proved
themselves      adepts at the game.
                          HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.
   The draughthoard consists of sixty-four squares, black and white,
and there are twelve men, or pieces, of a white colour, and twelve of
a black colour to be used.     The board should be placed with an
upper  white corner towards the right hand.   The players select each
twelve men of the colour they prefer. The pieces, or men, are to be
thus placed on the board : the black pieces on the first twelve white
squares, and the white on the last twelve white squares.        When
they are thus placed the game begins.
                                   THE MOVES.
   The pieces move forward diagonally, and it is the object of
the players to take all each other's men ; the player who has the
A/."-/ pieces taking the white, and the player who has the white
men taking the black. The first player — say Black — moves his piece
angularly to the first white square, and then, if nothing intervenes
between his piece and that of his opponent, and there is a vacant
square in his line left behind him, the white can pass his piece over
hnn to the space so unoccupied, and take his man, which is with
drawn from the board.      The same may be repeated by the adversarv ;
and thus the players go on taking each other's pieces till one or the
other cannot move, or all the pieces are taken.   When a piece, how
ever, arrives at the last row of the enemy's ground, it becomes what
is called a king, and is crowned by another piece being placed on it.
It may then be moved backwards and forwards at pleasure, and can
take both ways. When a player neglects to take a piece, he is what
is called huffed, that    is,
                          he loses the piece that ought to have been
moved.
                                LAWS OF THE GAME.
          The moves are alternate, the first move being determined     lot. by
  2. 1.   The choice of men to be also decided            by
                                                      lot, but they should
be changed every three games.
     Whichever piece    touched must be played.
  4. 3.
                           is
     No player can remain more than five minutes without playing.
He may be warned at the end of five minutes.
  5. Neither player must leave the room without permission of his
adversary.
  6.  In case of huff, the opponent,     lieu of taking
                                             in                a   piece   for the
omission, can insist on his being taken.
  7.  Each party must sit free so as not to obstruct           a    view of the
board, and no pointing at pieces     allowed.

   8.  When a false move is made, the piece must be moved to what
ever square the opponent dictates.
   9. All disputes between players to be referred to a third party.

   Playing draughts is a game which is best learned by experience
and repeated defeats.      It requires circumspection and caution, and
especially demands calculation of the effects of the different moves upon
the fortune of the game. The moves should be calculated mentally.
The men should be kept as much in the centre of the board as pos
sible ; and the gentlemanly player will consider all drawn games as
won by his opponent, and never triumph over the vanquished. The
followmg games will give the young player a good general idea of
draughts, but his success as a player will depend entirely upon his
own application and habit of thought      : —

                MERELLES, OR NINE MEN'S MORRIS.
    THIS is an ancient English game, and ought not to be laid aside ;
 so we resuscitate it for the benefit of young England.      It used to be
played in England     on  the ground with stones,
but may be played best on a table in-doors.
The form of the merelle-table, and the lines upon
it,  as
      it    appeared in the fourteenth century,
are here represented.      These lines are still the
same.     The black spots at every angle and in
tersection of the lines are the places for the
men to be laid upon.      The men are different in
form and colour, for distinction sake.          The
manner of playing    is briefly thus Two persons, having each of them
                                    :
•nine,
       pieces, or men, lay them down alternately, one     byone, upon the
spots and the business of either party
      ;                                      is to prevent his antagonist
from placing three of his pieces so as to form row of three without
                                                      a
the intervention of an opposing piece.       If   arow be formed, he that
made  it    at liberty to take up one of his competitor's pieces from
           is
any part he thinks most to his advantage; excepting he has made
a row, which must not be touched        he have another piece upon the

                is   component part
                     a               of that row. When all the pieces
are laid down, they are played oackwards and forwards in any direc
tion that the lines run, out can only move from one spot to another
at one time.    He that takes all his antagonist's pieces,    the con
                                                               is
queror.
                           FOX AND GEESE.
   THIS   is game somewhat resembling that of merelles, in the man
               a
ner in which the pieces are moved, but in other respects, as well as
in the form of the table,   differs materially
                               it                the mtersections and
                                                  ;
angles  are more numerous, and   the dots of  course increased, which
adds to the number of the moves.
   To play this game, there are seventeen pieces called geese, which
are placed as we see them in the engraving, and the fox stands in the
middle, distinguished either by his size or difference of colour. The
business of the game      to shut the fox up so that he cannot move.
                          is
All the pieces  have the  power to move from one spot to another, in
the direction of the right lines, but cannot pass over two spots at

 one step.  The fox tries to take the geese, which he does by hopping
 over them, just as if he were a king at draughts.
   There is another method of playing fox and geese on a chess
board, namely, with four white men, representing the geese, and one
black one, representing the fox.
   The geese are ranged on the four white squares nearest one player,
and the fox may be placed where his owner pleases.     The best place
for him is that marked in the diagram, as he can manoeuvre in a very
puzzling way.
   The geese can only move forward, and the fox moves either way,
The object of the geese is to pen up the fox so that he cannot move,
and the fox has to oreak through.
   If the game is properly played, the geese must win, the secret
being to keep them all m a line as much as possible. The fox tries to
prevent this plan from being followed up ; and if he can succeed in
doubling the geese, or getting one to stand before another, he is
nearly sure to pass through them.

                  THE YOUNG CONJUROR.
  INCLUDING SLEIGHT OF HAND WITH OBJECTS OR CARDS, WITH
                     AND WITHOUT APPARATUS.
   THAT there has been "Jugglery" in all ages of the world, the
pages of history abundantly prove.       The ancient religions of the
heathen were mixed up with an extensive system of Legerdemain,
and were more or less tissues of trickery.    Sleight of hand, tricks of
the tongue by which the word was kept to the ear, but broken to the
hope, and various miraculous deceptions, were the means by which
the priests of Egypt, Greece, and Rome used to subjugate mankind.
Happy ought we to be, in living in an age when humbug of every
kind is sure to meet exposure by the daylight beams of truth.
   The eastern nations, from the earliest times, possessed, beside these
religious jugglers, others who made a livelihood by going from place
to place, and performing various tricks and feats ty which the judg
ment was bewildered and the reason bamboozled, and even now the
performers of the East infinitely exceed those of the west. In the
Norman times the juggler was termed jongleur, or joculator, and
united in one the minstrel, astrologer and merry-andrew. In the
fourteenth century, he seems to have become more entirely a per
former of tricks and feats, and bore the name of Tregetour.         The

                           EYERT    BOY'S BOOK.
tregetours were adepts at every kind of sleight of hand, and, by the
assistance of machinery of various kinds, deceived the eyes of the
spectators, and produced such illusions as were usually supposed to
be the effect of enchantment, for which reason they were frequently
ranked with sorcerers, magicians, and witches. Chaucer, who no
doubt had frequently an opportunityof seeing the tricks exhibited by
the tregetours of his time, says, "There         I  sawe playenge jogelours,
magyciens, trageteours, phetonysses, charmeresses, old witches, and
sorceresses;" and the old poet goes on to say of them, " Sometimes
they will bring on the similitude of a grim lion, or make flowers
sprmg up as in a meadow; sometimes they cause a vine to flourish,
bearing white and red grapes, or show a castle built with stone, and
when they please, they cause the whole to disappear :" and in another
part of his works, he says: —
                   " Then aaw I Coll Tregetour,
                     Upon a table of sycamour,
                     Play an uncouthe thynge to tell ;
                     I nawe hym cary a wyndemell,
                     Under a walnot shale." — ffouic of Fame, book iii.
   Our learned monarch James I. was perfectly convinced that these
and other inferior feats exhibited by the tregetours of his day could
only be performed by the agency of the
                                                 " old gentleman," wnom it
is not polite to name.     The profession had already fallen very low,
and at the close of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the performers were
ranked by the moral writers of that time not only with ruffians,
blasphemers, thieves, and vagabonds, but also with Jews, Turks,
heretics, pagans, and sorcerers ; and in more modern times, by way
of derision, the juggler was called a mocus-pocus, or hokus-pokus,
a term applicable to a pick-pocket or a common cheat.
   The following pages are not intended to make the young reader
either a cheat or a trickster ; there is nothing perhaps so utterly
contemptible in every-day life as trickery and deception, and we
would caution our young master not to obtain by these amusements
a love of deception, which is only allowable in such feats of amuse
ment, and which is in no way culpable when every one knows he is
deceived.    But we would advise hnn strongly to cultivate in his own
mind the virtues of sincerity, straightforwardness, candour, openness,
and truth: to shun subterfuge and deception as he would a veno
mous reptile; and to hate a lie as he would hate that same old gentle
man whom we were too polite to name, and who is the father of it.
   With this sage advice we shall present a collection of amusing
conjuring tricks, premising that a considerable number of tricks
usually embodied m this division will be found in that part of our
work under the head of Scientific Experiments and Amusements, as
they more properly belong to
                                   " Natural Magic," and are to be re
ferred to the various operations of nature in the several departments
of art, science, and philosophy.

                              SLEIGHT    OP HAND.
   It  is my intention in the following pages to lay more stress upon
those tricks which require no apparatus, than upon those for which
special apparatus or the assistance of a confederate is required.        No
one is nearly so well pleased by a trick whose essence evidently lies
in the machinery, while every one feels pleasure at seeing a sleight of
hand trick neatly executed.          For my own part,     I  despise all the
numerous boxes, bottles, variegated covers, and other gimcracks
which are generally seen on a conjuror's table ; and      I have never been
so pleased with any performer as with one who did not even require a
table, but pressed into his service articles borrowed from his audience, as
he stood before them or walked among them.            The spectators should
never be able    to       " Ah    the  trick lies in the box ; he dares not
                     say,       !
show it to us !
                  "
   The following tricks have almost all been successfully performed by
myself, and have caused me some reputation in the magic art. Some
are my own invention.
                          1.  TIIE FLYMG SHILLING.
   This trick must be frequently practised before it is produced in
public.
   Borrow two coloured silk handkerchiefs from the company, and have
three shillings in your hand, but only show two, keeping the other one
firmly fixed against the first joint of the second and third fingers.
You must also have a fine needle and thread stuck inside the cuff of
your coat.       Then take one of the handkerchiefs, and put in both
shillings,   but   pretend that only one is in the handkerchief; then
put the handkerchief into a hat, leaving one corner hanging out.
Now hold up the third shilling (which the spectators imagme is the
tecond), and ask one of the company to lay the second handkerchief
over it. You then ask him to hold the shilling tight between his
finger and thumb, while you twist up the handkerchief. While doing
so, with both hands concealed under the handkerchief, you pass a few
stitches under the shilling, and replace the needle. This being done,
spread one corner of the handkerchief over the hand of the person
who is still holding the shilling, and, taking hold of another corner,
tell him to drop the shilling when you have counted three. At the
word
        " three " he lets
                           go the shilling, and you whisk the handkerchief
into the air, when the shilling appears to have vanished, but is
really held in the handkerchief. You then tell the astonished indi
vidual to draw the other handkerchief out of the hat by the corner
that is hanging out. The two shillings are heard to fall mto the hat,
and every one is persuaded that you have conjured one of the
shillings out of a person's hand, and sent it into the hat.

                               2. ANOTKEB METHOD.
   Perhaps the spectators may ask to see it again, or demand to mark
the shillmg.    In this case, vary it as follows. Ask some one (always
choose the most incredulous of the party) to mark a shilling of his
own and give it you.     Take the same handkerchief and give him the
shilling to hold that is already enclosed in         as in the last trick,
                                                            it,
droppmg the marked shilling into the palm of your hand.           Twist      it
up as before, and then leave       entirely in his hands.    Direct him to
place it  on table, and cover
            a                       it it
                                   with a basin or saucer. Ask him to
give you cup or tumbler, and hold
            a                                under the table, beneath the
                                                it
place where the saucer is.    Then tell him to knock three tunes on the
saucer, and at the third knock let the marked shilling fall into the
tumbler. Hand hi™ the tumbler, and while he                 examining the
                                                                  is
shilling  to see    if
                     it   the
                          is   same   one  that he  marked,   take up the
saucer,  and  shake out the handkerchief that         lying under
                                                            is         it,
                                                                      as in
the last trick.    You must then return the handkerchief, and while
you pretend to be searching for the marks, draw out the thread that
held the shilling and drop the coin into the palm of your hand, taking
care to rub between your finger and thumb the spot where the threads
had been, in order to eradicate the marks. This variation seldom fails
to confuse the company.
   You must remember to keep talking the whole time, and always
try to make     a joke, or otherwise to distract the attention of the
audience, while yon are executing the necessary changes.
                         3.    THE BEADS AND STRINGS.
    Ask some lady to lend you the beads off her bracelet, or have            by
you five or six beads, which you may hand round for examination.
                                 Then get some one to cut two pieces of
                                thin string of equal length, and twist
                                them about your fingers, appearing to lay
                                them side        side, but in reality placing
                                                  by
                                them as in the figure, and then,             by
                                twisting them together with apparent
                                carelessness, the manner in which they
are arranged will not be seen, particularly          you keep the point of
                                                       if
                                 finger, or    throwing the shade of your
                                                 by
                               by
junction hidden either         a
hand upon it.
   When the beads are returned, thread them all, taking care to pass
the centre bead over the point of juncture. You then bring the ends
of the string   1and     together and tie them so, doing the same with
                         2
3  and 4.   Now give the tied ends to two persons, directing them to
hold them tight.     You need not fear that the beads will come off,
even  if  they  pull  hard.    Then grasp the beads with both hands,
directing  the holders  to  slacken   the strings.   You then, under cover
of the left hand, which       placed above the beads, slip the centre bead
                              is

                                    CONJURING.                           523
to one side, and draw out the two loops which have been hidden in
it.  The beads will then easily come off into your right hand. Tell
the holders to pull hard, which they will do, and the same moment
remove your hands, showing the empty strings and all the beads in
your right hand.   Then hand roundthe beads and strings as before,
ilemember to rub out the marks in the strings caused by the loops
before you remove your hands.
                 4. TO GET A RING OUT Of A HANDKERCHIEF.
    Bend a piece of gold wire into the form of a ring, having pre
 viously sharpened both ends. You have a real ring made of the same
 piece of wire, and concealing the false ring in the palm of your hand,
 offer the real one to be inspected.       When it is returned, borrow a
 handkerchief, and, while taking it from the lender, slip the real ring
 into your left hand, and take the false one at its point of junction.
 Throw the handkerchief over the ring, and give it to some one to hold
 between his finger and thumb. Let the handkerchief fall over        it, and
 give   apiece  of string  to   second
                                a       spectator,  directing  him  to tie it
round the handkerchief, about two mches below the ring, so as to
 enclose    in bag, and tell him to do so as tightly as he can. While
            it    a
he    isdoing this, take up your conjuring wand,     a   rod of some hard
wood, about eighteen inches long, and when the knot           is  tied, step
forward, passing the rod into your left hand, taking care to slip over
it  the real ring, which has lain concealed there.      Slip your left hand
to the centre of the rod, and direct each of the two persons to hold
one end of      in his right hand.
                 it                   Then tell the one who has the ring
and handkerchief, to lay them on your left hand, which you imme
diately coyer with your right. Then tell them to spread another
handkerchief over your hands, and to say after you any nonsense that
you like to invent.
    While they are so doing, unbend the false ring, and draw through
                                                                it
the handkerchief       by
                        one of its points, carefully rubbing between the
thumb and finger the place where        came through. Hang the empty
handkerchief over the ring which        is it
                                         on the rod, and take away your
hands, which you exhibit empty, as you have stuck the false ring
inside your cuff.    Take away the upper handkerchief, and let       a third
person come to examine,      when  he will find the  ring gone out of the
handkerchief, and hung upon the rod.
5.    TO TIE A KNOT IN HANDKEBCHIEF
                            A
      WHICH CANNOT BE DBAWN TIGHT.
   Cast an ordinary knot on handker
                                a
chief, and give the end out of your
right hand to some spectator, and tell
him to pull hard and sharp when you
count three.   Just as he pulls, slip

524                        EVERY         BOY'S          BOOK.
your left thumb under the handkerchief, as drawn in the cut, and
it will be pulled out quite straight without any knot at all. You
must let go the end that hangs over the left liand, and grasp the
handkerchief between the thumb and forefinger.
                           6. THE THREE CUPS.
     This is an admirable delusion, but requires very careful manage
 ment, and should be practised repeatedly before if is exhibited pub-
                                     licly.   You get three tin cups, of the
                                     shape   shown  in the cut. They should
                                     have two or three ridges running round
                                     them at the mouth, m order to give a
                                     better hold. Four balls should now be
     _          _                    made of cork, and carefully blackened.
                                     One of the balls is held concealed be
 tween the roots  of  the third and fourth fingers, while ihe other three are
 handed round for examination, together with the cups.             When they
 are returned, the young conjuror begins by placing each ball under a
 cup, or, if he chooses, asks one of the spectators to do so for him.
  mule this is being done, he slips the fourth ball to the tips of the
 second and third fingers. He then lifts up cup No. 1, replacing it on
 the table a few inches from its first position, and at the same time
 slips the fourth ball under it. He takes up ball No. 1, and pretends
 to throw it away, but in reality he slips it into the place which the
fourth ball had occupied. He does the same with the three cups, and
then commences a sham search after the lost balls, in which he acci
dentally    (!)knocks over one of the cups, and, to his pretended
astonishment, finds    a  ball under it. He then knocks over both the
other cups, and finds     in them the two missing balls.
    He again places the balls under the cups, taking care to slip the
fourth ball under cup No.     3.     He then takes up cup No. and pre    1
tends to throw the ball into No.            but hides
                                             3,         as before.
                                                                it   As there
are already two balls in No.       3, the spectators imagine that he really
has thrown the ball into it.      He replaces cup No.        over both balls,
                                                                     3
and slips among them ball No.           1.  He then takes up cup No.      and2,
goes through    the  same   process,   and  on knocking  over cup   No.    all3,
three balls are found together under              it,
                                               and while the spectators are
being astonished, ball No.   2    can be quickly got rid .of.
  A    rather startling termination to this trick can be managed                   by
taking up one of the cups with its mouth upwards, holding the finger
and thumb close to its mouth.          Then         by
                                                 throwing another cup into
it, letting go the first and catching the second, you appear to have
thrown the second cup through the first.
 7.   TO   TIEHANDKERCHIEF ROUND YOTTB LEO, AND GET IT Oft
                  A.
                  WITHOUT UNTYING THE KNOT.
  Hold the handkerchief    both ends, lay the centre of the hand
                             by
kerchief on your knee, ana pass the two ends below, appearing to

 cross them, but in reality hitching them within each other, as repre
 sented in the engraving, which shows the manner in which this is
 managed. Draw this loop tight, and bring
 back the ends to the same side on which
 they were originally, and tie them above.
 If   the loop is properly made, it will stand
 a good pull. Then, after showing the spec
 tators how firmly it is tied, put your hand
 under the knot, and by giving it a sharp
 pull, it will come off.
   ' The engraving
                     represents the manner in
 which the loop is made, but it must be made considerably smaller
 than it is shown, or it will be seen. In fact, it ought not to be
 a loop at all, as it should be almost concealed under the fold of the
 handkerchief. Do not show this in public until you can tie it with
 rapidity and precision.
                            8. THE MAGIC BOND.
     Take a piece of string, and tie the two ends
together with a weaver's knot, as that holds the
best, and arrange it over the fingers as repre
sented in the engraving. Having done so, let
the long loop hang loose, lift both loops off the
thumb, draw them forward until the string is
 quite tight, and then put them behind the
hand, by passing them between the second and
third fingers.     Then pull the part of the string
that is across the roots of the fingers, and the
whole affair will come off.
                    9. THE OLD MAN AND HIS CHAIR.
     Take the same piece of string as in the last trick, hold your left
hand with the palm uppermost, and hang the string over the palm.
Spread all the fingers, and with the right hand
bring forward the loop that hangs behind, by
passmg it over the second and third fingers.
Loose the loop, take hold of the part of the
string that crosses the hand, and pull it for
wards.      When tight, pass it to the back of the
hand, the reversafof the movement that brought
it forwards. Loose the loop, insert the fore-finger
and little finger of the right hand under the
string that encircles the left fore-finger and little-
finger, and pass the two loops to the back of
the hand, as shown in the cut, Fig. 1. Tuck
both loops under the cross-string at the back, and your prelimi
naries are completed.       Then begin your story : " There was once

                        are." You then hold your left hand as at the
                        commencement, hook the right fore-finger under
                        the cross-piece at the back, and draw it downward

                        then hang the long loop over your thumb, " and
                        sat down in his high-backed cnair, which you see
                        here."      You then hitch the right fore-finger
                        and middle finger under the two loops that will
                        be found hanging behind the left hand, bring
                        them to the front, raise them perpendicularly,

                        scissors."    While you are saying this, you slip

                               RIGHT HAND APPROACH IT.
   Take a piece of thick pliant string by each end, and with a quick
jerk of the right hand cast a loop on it as in Fig. 1. The jerk
                                Fij.1
must be given upwards and towards the left hand, and its impetus
will cause the loop to run up the string until it falls over the left
wrist, as in Fig. 1. The moment that the forward jerk is given the
right hand should be drawn hack, so that the loop is drawn tight
directly it has settled on the wrist.     Both ends should be let fall
when the knot is firm. This is a very nice little sleight of hand to
practice in the intervals between more showy tricks, and, although
rather difficult to learn, is soon acquired.
                                     11. THE HANDCUFFS.
  Let two    persons, A and B, have their 1 ' anils tied together with
string, so that the strings cross, as represented in the engraving. The
                                                     ityl,   '
object     is,   to free themselves from each other without untying the
knot.      It    is executed in the following manner.

528                              EVERY     BOY'S     BOOK.
   Let B gather up the string that joins his hands, pass the loop under
the string that binds either of A'S wrists, slip it over A'S hand, and
both will oe free. By a reversal of the same process, the string may
be replaced.
           12. TO PULL     A.    STRING   THROUGH        YOUR BUTTON-HOLE.
   Take a piece of string about two feet in length, and tie the ends
together. Pass it through a button-hole of your coat ; hitch one
                                  thumb at each end, hook the little
                                  fingers into the upper strings of the
                                  opposite hand.    Then draw the hands
                                  well outward, and the string will look
                                  verv complicated, as in the engraving.
                                      To get out the string, loose the
                                  hold of the right thumb and left
                                  little finger, and separate the hands
                                  smartly, when the string will appear
                                  to have been pulled out through the
                                  substance of your coat.
                                      It is an improvement of the trick,
                                       immediately on loosing the hold
                                          if,
                                  of the right thumb, you change the
siring from the right little finger on to the thumb.
                        13. THE CUT STRING             RESTORED.
  Tie together the ends of    piece of string, pass one hand through
                                      a
each end, twist    once round, and put both ends into the left hand.
                     it
Draw the right hand rapidly along the double strings until you come
to the place where the strings have crossed each other, as seen in the
engravmg.    Conceal the junction with the thumb and finger of the
right hand hold the strings in
              ;                    similar manner with the left hand,
                                           a
and tell some one to cut the string between them.      You show that

the string  has been divided into two pieces, and say that you will
join them with your teeth.     Put all four ends into your mouth, and
remove with your tongue the little loop that has been cut off. When
you take the string out of your mouth, the spectators will not notice
the absence of so small     portion of its length, and will fancy that
                                  a
you really have joined them.

                              CONJURING.                             A29
                       14. THE GOBDIAN         KKOT.
    Take a silk handkerchief, and lay it on a table. Take each of the
 corners, and lay them across each other in the middle of the hand
 kerchief, which will then be square, as in
 the cut, Fig. 1.   Do the same with the new
 corners, and go on until the handkerchief
 is reduced to the size of your hand.      Then
 with your left finger and thumb take hold of
 the centre, taking care to grasp all the four
 corners that lie there, and with the right
 finger and thumb take hold of the outer layer
 of silk, and pull it towards you as far as it
 will come. Then turn it a little on ypnr left
 hand, and repeat the operation until it is all
 screwed up into a tight ball, as is represented
in the engraving, Fig. 2. No ends will be
then perceptible, and a person who is unac
quainted with the mode will never be able to               . !
untie it. Of course you must prepare it previously.            When the
person to whom you give it has fafled to untie         it,
                                                    you take the ball in
your hand, and Holding   it behind your back, you reverse the method
by   which   it was  tied, and  when     it   loose
                                              is       good shake will
                                                             a
release it.
                      15. THE KNOT LOOSENED.
   Thisis
       a      very amusing deception. You ask any one for handkera
chief, and tie the ends firmly together in    adouble knot, allowing him
to feelit,  or pull the ends as tight as
he pleases.    You then throw the centre
of the handkerchief over the knot, and
ask the person to hold it    tight between
his finger and thumb.       You ask him  if
the knot is  still there, to which he will
answer in the affirmative.       You then
take hold of any part of the handkerchief, and direct the holder to
                                       " three." You count, " one, two,
drop the handkerchief at the word
three," at which word he looses his hold of the handkerchief, and there
is no vestige left of the knot.
   The method of managing this trick     isas follows — Take the hand
                                                             :
kerchief and tie the ends in simple knot, keeping one end tight, and
                              a
the other end loose.    We will call the tight end A, and the loose one
B. Keep A always in the right hand, and on the stretch horizontally,
and the handkerchief will look as in the cut. Do this when you tie    it
the second time, and draw n tight, which will then form          double
                                                                 a
tie round A, but will not hold    itfirm. When you throw the hand
kerchief over the knot, you draw out A with the finger and thumb of
                                   M M

530                               EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
the left hand, and the knot will apparently remain firm, although in
reality it is nothing but a double twist of silk, which of course falls
loose when the handkerchief is dropped.
                       16.   TO    PUT NUTS INTO YOUB EAR.
   Take three nuts in the left hand, show them, and take out one of
them between your right finger and thumb, and another between the
first and third finger. This latter is not seen by the company.    You
then put one of them in your mouth and retain it there, unknown
to the spectators, while you exhibit the second as the one that you
put into your mouth. This second one you carry to your ear, as if
you meant to insert it there, and on replacing it m your left hand,
only two nuts will be left instead of three, the third of which appears
to have gone into your ear.
                 17.   TO    CRACK WALNUTS      IN YOUR ELBOW.
    Conceal a very strong walnut in your right hand, and take ftro
other walnuts out of the dish.        Place one of them on the joint of
your  arm,  and  say that you  are  going; to break it by the power of youi
muscles. You     will now   have one   walnut in your arm and two in youi
right hand. Close your left arm, and strike it an apparently violent
blow with the right hand, at the same time clenching the right hand
violently, which will smash the second walnut in             it,
                                                         and the spectators
hearing   the crash  will be sure  to fancy  that  it  caused
                                                        is              by
                                                                 the demo
lition of the walnut in your arm. Then open you arm very gently (for
fear of dropping any of the fragments, you must say), and, when pre
tending to take out the walnut which you had placed there, you sub
stitute for it the broken one from your right hand.
    18. TO TABLE FEATHERS OUT OF AN EMPTY HANDKERCHIEF.
   Procure at the military clothier's four or five large plumes, such as
are worn    byofficers.     Take off your coat, and lay the plumes along
your arms, the stem being toward your hand. Now put on your coat
again, and the feathers will lie quite smoothly and unsuspected.
Borrow handkerchief from'one of the spectators, and wave about to
        a                                                                it
show that   it   is
                 empty.       Throw    over your left hand, and with the
                                       it
right draw out one of the plumes from up the coat-sleeve, at the same
time giving  it   aflourish in the air, which will loosen all the fibres of
the feather, and make          appear much too large to have been con
                              it
cealed about the person.         Wave the handkerchief again, and repeat
the operation   until   all  the plumes are gone.  You can carry enough
plumes under the sleeve to cover table with, and
                                            a              you prepare
                                                                   if         a
board or an ornamental vase full of holes, you can place the plumes
upright as you take them out.
        TRICKS REQUIRING SPECIAL APPARATUS.
I    admit no tricks that are wholly managed             by
                                                 the apparatus, as            I
think that they are unworthy of notice.      Therefore, every trick

mentioned in the following pages must be carefully practised in
private before it is produced in public.     The apparatus, of course,
cannot be inspected by the audience, and for that reason it is better
to mix them with those tricks which have been already mentioned,
in order that suspicious persons may be quieted by au occasional
permission to inspect the objects used in the performances.
   The young conjuror should always vary the mode of performance
in the non-essentials, and should study combinations of one trick with
another, by which means he will produce more astonishing results
than if he restricted himself to the methods mentioned in this work,
He should also invariably make a little speech, acknowledging that he
is only deceiving the eye and not the mind, and should therefore
request the company not to ask any questions, or to demand inspec
tion of any of his apparatus.
                           19. THE  DM TRICK.
   Get a wooden die about two inches and a half square (1), and
a hollow tin die exactly the size of the wooden one, but without one of
the sides (2). Then pamt them both exactly alike, as in the engraving.
It will be better to let an accidental flaw appear on the same side
of each. Then get a tin cover (4) that exactly fits the dies. Now
for the trick itself.
   Borrow two hats, and \vhile you turn your back upon the audience
as you go to your table, slip into one of them the false die.      Place
both hats on the table, and send round
the real die and cover for inspection.
When they are returned, say, " Now,
ladies and gentlemen, it is my inten
tion to place these hats one above
another, thus." You then place the two
hats as in No. 3, the hollow die being
                       I
in the bottom hat. " shall then cover
the die thus," which you do, "and
after  I have knocked on the cover,
I  shall take it off, and you will find
that the die is not under the cover, as it is now," taking it off,
 " but inside the hat, like this." You then put the real die mto the
hat. " You do not believe me, ladies and gentlemen, but      I will soon
convince you."      You then take out the false die, and replacing the
upper hat, put the die on the upper hat (of course, with the open
side downward) and place the cover over it. Pick up your conjuring
wand, give it a few nourishes, and bring it down on the cover. Grasp
the cover tightly near the bottom, when both cover and false die will
come up together ; put the end of your wand into them, and give
them a gooa rattle. Then knock off the upper hat with a blow of the
wand, and push the lower one off the table, so that the die tumbles
out of it. Always use plenty of gesture about your tricks.

                           20.   THE PENETRATIVE PENCE.
    Get a brazier to cut out all the interior of five pence, only leaving
 the runs. He must then bore out nearly all the interior of a sixth
                                  penny, merely leaving a shell of copper
                                  at the top.         A long rivet must then be
                                  let into the rim as shown in Fig. 1, No. 2,
                                  and a hole must be drilled in each of the
                                  five rings, as in No. 3.           The rivet is to
                                  be passed through the holes in the rings,
                                  and fastened below, so that all the rings
                                  can play easily upon it.          Fig. 1, No. 1, is
                                  a section of the entire apparatus, the
                                  dotted lines representing the rivet. They
                                  can then be placed as shown in Fig. 2,
                                  No. 1, and no one will imagine that they
                                  are only shams, as you can rattle them or
                                  move them about upon each other. A
                                  leathern cover, Fig. 2, No. 2, is then made,
which passes easily over the heap of pence, but being pliable, is capable
of pickmg up the nollow pence with            it, when   it   isheld firmly. To the
under surface of the table you fasten a little shelf, Fig.                 2, No.   3,
which moves on         a hinge,  and      let
                                         is     fall    byplacing   the  foot on the
pedal, Fig.   2,No.     4,which draws the catch.
   To perform the trick, place six real pence on the little shelf, and
have the sham pence on the table.           Take them up and rattle them,
and put them down as in Fig.            No.
                                        2,     1.   Keep     asixpence in the palm
of your hand, pick up the sham pence, and as you put them down,
slip the sixpence under them, as you do the ball m trick              6.   Take the
cover,  and   put  it   over  the  sham    pence,      make      short
                                                                 a      speech, and
knock the cover with your wand, at the same time pressing the
pedal with your foot, which will cause all the six real pence to tumble
down with    a  great crash.      Take up the cover and false pence to
gether, put   the  end    of  your wand mto them and hold them up tri
umphantly, showing the spectators that the six pence have oeen
replaced by   a  silver sixpence.      While you are pickmg up the pence,
slip the sham ones out of the cover into your left hand, and take some
opportunity .of letting the empty cover roll towards the audience, one
of whom you ask to pick            itup and bring       it  you. This manoeuvre
generally disarms all suspicion, for the picker-up               sure to examine
                                                                 is                 it
very closely.
I    have only given mere outlines of this really excellent trick, which
may be varied m        ahundred ways, and       is   capable of combination with
other tricks to    a large  extent.    It  will   add   to its complicity, if   aset
of six half-pence      is also made like the pence.             For the pedal may
be substituted     alever running immediately under the surface of the
table,if  the performer prefers to have             a short cloth on it. There

should be always two cloths on the table, — the lower one thick and
soft, to prevent jingling of objects, and the upper one white, as it
displays everything better than a coloured one. The ingenuity of the
young conjuror wul easily find methods of varying this trick.
                          21. TUB DOLL TRICK.
   Get a comical looking doll, and cut off his head diagonally, taking
care to do it very neatly. Drive a peg into the neck, and bore a hole
in the body, into which the peg fits, as in the
cut. Paint his body and head carefully, and
if you put a gold cham or two round his neck,
it will conceal the line of junction. Make '
also a coat of silk, and sew a pocket inside the
edge of the skirt.
   Take up the doll, and say, "Now, ladies
and gentlemen, here is a verv learned man.
Observe the development of his forehead,
the sagacity of his nose, the eloquence of his
lips, the dignity of his spectacles, and the
philosophy of his pigtail.       He is professor
of astronomy at Timbuctoo, and here is his
gown of ofifce.      See how handsome he looks
m it. He is going to Amsterdam to see the eclipse of the last
new comet.       He has the honour to wish you all farewell before
starting on his journey.       Now, professor, we are waiting to sec
you  go.    Oh  ! you want funds,   do you ?      I
                                                  beg your pardon ; here
is a shilling for you."      So saying, you take your right hand from
under the gown, taking with it the body, and put the body into
your pocket, while you jingle some silver. The head is now sup
ported by your left hand.        Pretend to give him some money, and
then say, ""What ! you won't go unless vou have more ! Get along !"
Hit the head a hard rap with your right hand, which drives it into tho
pocket, which you hold open for it with your left thumb and little
finger.
          " Oh dear ! the doctor is dead, and cannot be found."
                                                                  Saying
this, you grasp the gown by the place where the head     is, and shakeit
about to show that  it   is empty.     Ifyou like, you can make another
oration and hold  a    dialogue, making the doctor resuscitate himself,
which  is   of course done    by
                               taking the head out of the pocket with the

   Take two sovereigns, or rather brass imitations, and grind them
down until they are reduced to half their thickness. Do the same
with two shillings, and fasten them accurately together, so that you
will have two coins, each having one silver face, and one brass face.
Take one of them in each hand, showing the silver side of one and
the brass side of another, and offer to change them without moving

your arms.   Shut your hands, and the coins will turn over. Then,
on opening them again, they will appear to have changed from one
hand into the other.
                              23. THE VANISHED GROAT.
  Put a little wax on the nail of the middle finger of the right hand,
and take a fourpenny piece into the palm of tne same hand.       Close
the hand, pressmg the wax on the coin. Then rapidly open           and          it,
the silver piece will adhere to the wax, and be quite concealed behind
the finger when you hold your hand up.
                             24. THE RESTORED         DOCUMENT.
     Make     a   memorandum  book, and line the cover with paper which
has been previously rubbed with mixture of lamp-black and oil. The
                                              a
paper must be loosely affixed, so that        can be raised up, and
                                                      it                leaf    a
from the memorandum book placed under it. You must also make                          a
flat box, having double opening.
                       a a
   You now take leaf out of the memorandum book, and ask some
one to write     sentence, at the same time offering him the book to
                   a
write upon. The pencil with which you furnish hnn          very hard, and
                                                                     is

ened paper to the white leaf that has been placed under              and of
                                                                          it,
course makes an exact copy of the writing.         You then give the man
his document, put the memorandum book m your pocket, and go out
of the room to fetch your box, which you ka\e forgot ten. While you
are out of the room, you take out the leaf from under the black
paper, and put        into one side of the flat box, and shut down the
                       it
cover that nides it. You bring in the box, apologising for your
absence, and give the box, open at the other side, into the writer's
hands.    Tell mm to burn his writing in         candle, and to place the
                                                           a
ashes in the box. He does so, and closing the box, returns         to you.it
You then flourish about little with the box, wave
                                  a                       in the air, bring

opening     as at first, you produce the duplicate leaf, which the writer
            it
acknowledges to be his own hand-writing.                       If
                                                    the lamp-black should
have come off and smeared the paper, you can account for                        it    by
observing that         it very difficult to get rid of all traces of the
                             is
burning.
                                  25. THE MAGIC        RINGS.
   Get    blacksmith to make
          a                        number of rings, about six or seven
                                          a
inches in diameter, as in the cut.        made with

a rather large blacklcad pemcil.

   Lay the rings on one another, and they will all appear to be separate
 and distinct ; D n should be the uppermost rings, then B, then A, and
 then c. Hand round D for inspection, and if any more are desired,
 hand round the other D.     When returned,
 you hang   them  over your left arm, or grasp
them in your hand, and tell the company
 that you are going to weave all the rings
 together.    You clash them together, and
 after going through some complicated move
ments, brmg out B, which the spectators
will think you have just fastened together.
 Hand them round. When they are re
turned, miT them all up, and brmg out c.
Then take A in your hand, and passing one of
the outer rings of c through the opening,
you have four rings together. Then add
i> and yon have five.    Take off D and sub
stitute B, which will give you six. So you go on, weaving them into
all kinds of fantastic shapes.    You must always conceal the joint in
A with your thumb, and contrive as often as you can to have one
at least of the rings D at liberty.    This is a capital trick, and may
be diversified to any extent, especially if the number of rings is in
creased.
                        26. THE FISH AND        INK TRICK.
    This is really a first-rate delusion. You bring before the spectators
a glass vase, full of ink.      You dip a ladle into       it,
                                                           and pour out some
of the ink upon     a   plate, in order to convince the audience that the
substance in the vase         really ink.
                             is               You then throw     handkerchief
                                                                     a
over the vase and instantly withdraw           it,
                                                when the vase     found to be

filled with pure water, in which          couple of gold fish are swimming.

                                                     is
kerchief during the performance of the trick. The ladle has            hollow a
handle with an openmg into the bowl.            In the handle        is
                                                                     spoonful

   The performer of this trick borrows    number of hats, and places
                                                a

   Get a tinman to make a flat tin tube, which will just allow a shilling
to pass through it. Wind a quantity of worstea round            so as to              it,
make   it into  oall.

lying, drop the shilling into the tube, and withdraw the tube, leaving
the shilling in the bail.     good squeeze or two will hold

take the end of the worsted, and give     to some one to unwind. This
                                                        it
being done, the shilling will be found in the very centre of the ball,
with the end of the worsted wrapped tightly round it.
                             29.   THE EGG AND BAG TBJCK.
  Get   a  chintz or cloth bag made double, and between the two bags
make    six or seven pockets, each of which will hold an egg, and
having an opening into the bag. Fill the pockets with eggs, and you
are ready for the performance.
   Hold the bag         by
                       the place where the eggs ore, shake     turn inside     it,          it
out and show that there              is
                                  nothing      it. Then tell the spectators
                                                         in
that you are sure that there          hen in the bag. Put your head near
                                          is  a
the mouth     of the bag,  and  make    clucking like
                                                  a     hen. You then sa\,
                                                                      a
"I   knew   I was right, and she has laid an egg."      So saying, you put
your hand into the bag and take out one of the eggs, taking care to
pretend to grope         one of the corners for it.
                         in
   This     is
             repeated    until all he eggs but one are gone. You then,
                                          '
after taking out the last egg, say that some people think that the
eggs are not real, but you will convince them                             by
                                                          ocular inspection.
Saying this, you break the egg in saucer with your right hand, and
                                                   a
while the people are occupied with                     it,
                                            you drop the bag behind your
table, or hang       on a hook out of sight, and take up another exactly
                    it
like  it,into which you have put       hen.
                                               " These are real

then say,     and     any one doubts their reality, they cannot doubt that

 this is a real hen."     You then turn the bag upside clown, and shake
 out the hen.       If  any one wishes to inspect that bag, he can do so
 without being much wiser for it.
                            30. THE DANCING    EGG.
    Send for some eggs, and take care to place among them one which
 has been emptied of its contents, and to which is fastened a long
 hair, at the other end of which is tied a crooked pin. Borrow a small
 stick from one of the spectators, and as you go behind your table
 contrive to hook the bent pin into your coat, passmg it over the stick.
Then place the egg on an inverted hat, and ask for some music, and
 directly it begins to sound, a slight and imperceptible depression or
elevation of the stick will cause the egig to twist and roll about upon it
 as if it had life.    You must be careful to turn gently round now and
then, so as apparently to vary the distance of the egg from the body.
                             31. BELL AND SHOT.
    Get a wooden bell made, so thick that there is a considerable space
between the outer and inner surfaces, especially on the upper part of
the bell.    A hollow must be cut in this,
and the handle so made, that when it is
at rest, it is forced upwards by a spring,
and draws up the round piece of wood
to which the clapper chain is attached, and
closes the aperture, as shown in the en
graving.
    You have a cardboard measure, which
is of precisely the same capacity as the
cavity in the bell, and just wide enough
to hold a farthing.       Into this you pri
vately put   a farthmg, and then fill up the
measure with shot, heaping it a little, to
compensate for the farthing.       You make
u 11 a tale about a man going out shooting,
and ringing the bell of the gunmaker's shop.         (You then ring your
wooden bell.) How the man bought a measure full of shot for a far
thing, (you pour the shot into the bell and back again two or three
times,) out was so long haggling over three shots, that the gunmaker
took away the shot, (here you again pour the shot into the bell, and
by pressing on the handle, allow them all to run into the hollow,) and
kept the farthing for his trouble. The man went out of the shop, but
soon came in again, and rang furiously. (Here you again ring the bell,
which is now apparently empty, and invert the measure on the table.
The farthing not being held by the finger and thumb will now fall on the
tablecloth.)      Then finish the story with an account of the manner in
which the man got back his farthing. When you have finished, invert
the bell over the empty measure, and on pressmg the handle, the ehots

  538                          EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
  will refill it.   Do not touch it until you have done another trick or
  two, and then, when you put the bell aside, ring it again, and remark
  that the purchaser was a silly fellow after all, for here are his shots
  in his measure.
                 32. THE STONED HANDKERCHIEF          RESTORED.
     Get a tinman to make a double canister, such as is shown in the
  cut, with an opening at each end. This must so slide within a tin
  tube, that either end can be concealed within it alternately, as seen in
                       the engraving, where the end A is shown, and u is
                       concealed.    In this position it looks like an ordi-
                       nary canister.    The interior is divided into two
                        parts.   Into B put a piece of cambric made to
                       look like a handkerchief.
                          Borrow a cambric handkerchief, and say, " Now,
                       ladies and gentlemen,     I shall burn this handker
                       chief to ashes, place them in this canister" (so
                       saying, you put it into A), "and when          I have
                       uttered a spell, it will be restored perfectly whole.
                       Will the owner say what mark it has ? " While
                       the audience are looking towards the owner, you
                       turn the canister over, and push up the canister
 until the shoulder of B is on a level with the top of the tube. When
 the mark has been declared, you open B, take out the cambric, and
 pretend to verify the mark,       tou then put it into a candle flame, and
 when it has burnt entirely to ashes, put the ashes into B, shut it up,
 and rapidly reverse it as you turn round to your audience, so thai A is
 uppermost again.      Then, utter any nonsense you like, open A and
 take out the handkerchief uninjured.         It rather adds to the trick if
you drop a little eau de cologne into A before commencing.
                            33. THE FIRE-EATER.
    If the young conjuror is desirous of appearing in the character of
a fire-eater, it is very easily managed.       He must prepare a piece of
thick string, by soakmg it m a solution of nitre, and then drying it.
He cuts offa piece about an inch in lenjgth, lights one end, and wraps
it up in a piece of tow which he holds in his left hand. The trifling
smoke will be concealed by a huge bundle of loose tow also carried in
the left hand.
    He takes a handful of tow in his right hand, puts it into his mouth,
chews it up, and appears to swallow it.            He then takes another
handful, and with it the piece in which is the string. As he puts tins
into his mouth, he takes out the piece which he has already chewed.
By taking breath through the nostrils, and breathing it out through
the mouth, smoke begins to issue forth, and the whole interior of the
mouth is soon lighted up with a glow. When the mouth is shut,
and the tow pressed together, the fire goes out, except the piece of

prepared string. More tow is then taken into the mouth, and treated
m the same manner.
                                                  I
   In this short account of conjuring, have purposely avoided such
tricks as require expensive apparatus.     Such apparatus is either
entirely beyond a boy's reach, or at all events he ought not to be
encouraged in the notion of spending much money on objects of no
real use. A boy of any ingenuity wfll make the greater part of the
apparatus himself, or at least he can do the painting and polishing
of his machinery.         I
                     have mentioned no machinery that need cost more
than two or three shillings at the outside, and not that, if a boy is
acquainted with the use of tools.
                              TRICKS WITH CARDS.
    In accordance with my rule,         I shall lay the
                                                     principal sfress on card
tricks that require no apparatus,        and may be performed with ordinary
cards.
                               1. TO MAKE THE PASS.
             it                                               "            "
    This     a necessary beginning for card tricks.    Making the pass
is the technical term for shifting either the top or the bottom card to
any place in the pack that you like.       It is almost impossible to de
scribe     it,
            and   can only say tbat
                      I               will be learnt better in five minutes
                                        it
from     afriend, than     as many hours from
                              in                     book. As, however,
                                                          a
a  friend      not always to be found who can perform the pass,
                 is                                                    will
                                                                       I
endeavour to describe it.
    The cards are held in both hands, right hand underneath and left
above, as in the engraving, where, as the bottom card    to be raised
                                                                  is
to the top, the little finger seen between that card and those above
                                   is
it.      By quick movement of the right hand, the bottom card
              a                                                            is
slipped away towards the left, and    placed upon the top card, under
                                             is

540                                  EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
shadow of the left hand, which is raised for the moment to allow of
its passage.
  This movement must be assiduously practised before it is exhibited
in jmblic, as nothing looks more awkward than to see it clumsily
performed, in which case two or three cards generally tumble on the
floor.
                           2. TO TELL A CABD BY ITS BACK.
    While shuffling the pack, cast a glance at the bottom card, make
the pass, and bring it to the top.   Continue to shuffle, and lay upon
it by degrees as many cards as you like, say six. Then lay the pack
on the table, face downwards, and divide it into seven "heaps, be
ginning at the bottom, and leave the seventh heap larger than any
of the others.
    When you have done this, take one card from the top of the
seventh heap, appear to calculate, and lay             it,
                                                  face upwards, on one
of the other heaps.     Do so with five more cards, thus leaving your
slipped card at the top of the seventh heap.    You then announce that
 by the aid of the six cards you will name the seventh.     You name                 it
accordingly, after carefully studying the other cards, and on asking
a  spectator to take   up,    will be seen that you are right.
                                it    it
      If
      you place five cards above the slipped card, you will lay out six
heaps, and     eight cards, there will of course be nine heaps.
                 if
                     3.   THE CARD NAMED WITHOUT BEING SEEN.
  As in the last trick, cast    glance at the bottom card, say the ace
                                        a
of spades. Lay out the pack in as many heaps as you like, noting
where that one       laid which contains that bottom card.
                           is                                 Ask any
one to take up the top card of any heap, look at                   it,
                                                      and replace it.
You then gather up the heaps apparently                  by
                                               chance, but you take
care to put the heap containing the bottom card upon the card which
has been chosen.    You then give any one the cards to cut, and on
counting   them over,  the cam that immediately follows the ace of
spades is the card chosen.
      If   by
          any accident the two cards should be separated when cut,
the upper card of the pack     the chosen one, and can be picked out
                                           is
with seeming care.
                     4. THE CARD TOLD BY THE OPEBA                GLASS.
   Make out table, such as given on the next page, Fig.
                     a                  is                     and place   1,
it in an opera-glass, so that the figures will be visible when you look
through it. For convenience,      have made mine as seen in Fig.
                                           I                         the        2,

                                                   a
a circular piece of cardboard, which must then be soaked in oil, so as
to make     semi-transparent. The light will then easily pierce through
            it
it,and the figures wifl be better visible than      were opaque.

  It will be seen that Fig. 2 contains as much matter as Kg. 1, and
that two-thirds of the figures are saved by it.

   These preliminaries being arranged, tell any one to take any twenty
seven cards out of a pack, and to think of any one of them.        Deal
them into three heaps, and ask him in which heap it           is,
                                                              and what
number from the top he would like          to come after the third deal.
                                             it

542                         EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
Suppose he chooses it to be the twenty-sixth card, you take up your
opera-glass, and look for the number 26.     This you will find last but
one, arranged thus, — 26. 213. The meaning             is,
                                                    that     the chosen
                                                                 if
card  isto be the twenty-sixth, the heap in which      was found must
                                                            it
be for the first time placed second, the second time first, and the last
time third.    So you pick up the cards, taking care to keep that heap
number two. You again deal them in three heaps, and this time you
place the heap in which      the chosen card at the top, being number
                                is
one.   Deal them     third time, and on gathering up the heaps, place
                       a
it at the bottom.
   Then, on counting from the top, the chosen card will be found to
be the twenty-sixth.
                              THE FOUR KINGS.
                                5.
   Take the four kings out of       pack of cards, and also two other
                                       a
court cards, which are not to be shown.    Spread out the kings before
the spectators, but conceal the two court cards between the third and
fourth kings. Lay the cards face downwards on the table. Take off
the bottom card, which       of course one of the kings show
                                is                               ;  asit   if
 by accident, and place    on the top. Take the next card, (which
                           it                                              is
one of the court cards,) and place that in the middle of the pack.
Take the third card, (i.e. the second court card,) and place that also
near the middle of the pack. There will then be one Icing at the top and
three at the bottom. Ask any one to cut the cards, and to examine them,
when he will find all four kmgs together in the middle of the pack.
   It better to use court cards to place between the third and
       is
fourth kings, because    the cards should slip aside, they would not be
                           if
so readily distinguished as common cards.
                                     AUDACITY.
  Several tricks may be successfully played            by
                                                sheer audacity.            I
once astonished   whole party
                      a           holdmgby  pack of cards over my
                                                   a
head, and naming each.   The fact was, that was standing exactly
                                                   I
opposite large mirror, in which the cards were reflected, while the
            a
spectators,     having their backs to the mirror, suspected nothing.
I     will give one or two tricks that depend on audacity for success.
                6.   THE CARD FOUND AT THE SECOND GUESS.
    Offer the cards to any one, and let him draw one. You then hold
the cards behind your back, and tell him to place his card on the
top. Pretend to make        agreat shuffling, but only turn that card with
its  back  to  the others,  still keeping      at the top.
                                              it             Then hold up
the cards with their faces towards the spectator, and ask him          the
                                                                      if
bottom card      ishis.  While doing so, you inspect his card at your
leisure. He of course denies            it,
                                          and you begin shuffling again
furiously.
              " Let me do that," he will
                                              probably say so, as you are
                                                             ;
perfectly acquainted    with  his card,  you let him shuffle as much as he
likes, and then, when you get the cards back again, shuffle until his

card is at the bottom.    Then pass them behind yonr back, make a
ruffling noise with them, and show him his own card at the bottom.
                  7. THE CABJJ rOTTND   UNDEB THE HAT.
   Have a needle stuck just inside your sleeve.   Hand the cards, &c.
just as in the preceding trick, and tell the taker to put the card on
the top. Take out the needle, and prick a hole nearly through the
top ^?-hand corner. Replace the needle, shuffle the cards, or let
any one shuffle them.    Place the pack on the table, cover them with
a hat, and the marked card will be known by a little raised knob on
the rw^-hand top corner. Draw ont card t>y card, saying. whether
it is that card or not, until you come to the marked one, which you
throw on the table carelessly, and when you are about taking out
another card, stop suddenly, and pretend to find, by some magic
process, that it is the chosen card.
             8.     TO   CALL THE CARDS OUT   OP   THE PACK.
   Tell the spectators that you will call six cards out of the pack.
Secure a card, — say the ace of spades, — in the palm of your hand.
Throw the pack on the table, face downwards, spread out the cards,
give one of the spectators your conjuring wand, and tell him, when
you name a card, to touch one, which you will take up.
   First name the ace of spades. He touches a card, which you take
tip without showing the face of it. This card may be, say the eight
of diamonds.    Put it into your left hand, and place it npon the ace
of spades which is already there, so that the two look like one card.
Then call for the eight of diamonds.     Another card is touched, say
the queen of clubs. This you put with the others, and, after pre
tending to calculate, call for the queen of clubs.
   Proceed in this manner until six cards have been drawn. Then
substitute the last card drawn (which is of course a wrong one) for
the ace of spades, and conceal it in the palm of your hand.         Then
strew the others on the table, and while the eyes of the spectators
are fixed npon them, get rid of the card in your left hand.
   It is a good plan to ask some one to write down the names of the
cards as they are called, and then to have the list called over, in order
that every one may see that there has been no mistake.
                            9. HEADS AKD TAILS.
  While you are shuffling the cards, contrive to arrange quietly all
their heads one way, or as many as possible, rejecting all the diamonds
except the king, queen, knave, and seven, and passing them to the
bottom. Put the pack upon the table, take off a number of the upper
cards, and offer them for some one to choose a card from. While he
is looking at it,turn the cards round, and offer them to him, in order
that he may replace it.   Shuffle the cards, and on looking them ovor,
the chosen card will be standing with its head one way, while the
others are reversed.

                              10. THE SURPRISE.
   When you have discovered a card, the following plan will make
a striking termination to the trick.   Get the card to the bottom of
the pack, and tell one of the spectators to hold the cards by one
corner as tightly as he can. Give them a sharp rap with your finger,
—not with your hand, — and all the cards will be struck out of his
hold, and fall on the floor, except the bottom card, which will remain
between his finger and thumb.         It
                                     has a rather more dashing effect,
if yon put the chosen card at the top, and strike them upwards, when
the whole pack will     fly
                         about the room, like      flock of butterflies,
                                                         a
only leaving the top card in the person's grasp.
                          11. THE REVOLUTION.
   Another neat way of finishing      trick
                                      a        as follows.
                                                 is           Get the card
to the top of the pack and takmg care that all the cards are even,
                        ;
drop the pack on the floor, taking care just as you let go, to slip the
top card  a little off the rest of the pack. In 'falling, the resistance
of the air will turn the card over, and   will rest with its face upwards
                                            it
on the top of the pack.
                        12. THE SLIPPED          CARD.
   Ascertain the bottom card of the pack hold the cards in your left
                                                 ;
hand, with their faces downwards. Place your right hand upon them,
and with your right fore-finger slide them slowly over each other,
asking some one to stop any card he chooses,             by
                                                   putting his finger
upon it. When he has done so, open the pack at that card, but while
opening   it,
            make the pass, and brmg the bottom card under the one
touched.    Hold up the cards, and ask the chooser to be sure of his
card hand all the cards to him, and let him shuffle as much as he
      ;
chooses.   Afterwards discover the card in any manner that you prefer.
The following   is
                 a   good plan.
                        13.    THE KALLED        CARD.
   Take   a flat-headed nail, and file itdown until its point isas sharp
asa   needle, and the head quite flat.    The nail should be about half
an inch long, or even shorter    if anything. Pass the nail through the
centre of any card,   —  say the ace of spades,
                                                — and conceal it in your
left hand.
   Take another pack of cards, get the ace of spades to the bottom,
and perform the preceding trick.         When the cards are returned,
shuffle them about, and exchange the pierced card for the other. Put
the pierced card at the bottom of the pack, and throw the cards
violently againsta    door, when the nail wfll be driven in   by
                                                               the pres
sure of the other cards against its head, and the chosen card wfll be
seen nailed to the door.     The nail should be put through he face of
                                                              (
card, so that when the others fall on the floor,      remams facing the
                                                         it
spectators.

    14. TO ASCERTAIN           THE NUMBER           OF POINTS ON             THREE UNSEEN
                                         CARDS.
   In this amusement the ace counts eleven, the court cards ten each,
and the others according to the number of their spots.
   Ask any one to choose any three cards, and lay them on the table,
with their faces downwards. On each of these he must place as
many as with the number of the card will make fifteen. He gives
you the remaining cards, and when you have them in your hand, you
count them over on the pretence of shuffling them, and by addmg
sixteen, you will have the number of points on the three cards.
   For example, the spectator chooses a four, an eight, and a king.
On the four he places eleven cards, on the eight seven, and on the
king five. There will be then six cards left. Add to these six sixteen,
and the result will be twenty-two, which is the number of points on
the three cards, the king counting ten, added to the eight and the
four.
         15. TO TELL THE NUMBERS                       ON     TWO UNSEEN         CARDS.
   As in the preceding trick, the ace counts eleven, and the court
cards ten each. Let the person who chooses the two cards lay them
on the table with their faces downward, and place on each as many as
will make their number twenty-five.
   Take the remaining cards and count them, when they will be found
to be just as many as the points in the two cards. For example, take
an ace and a queen,     e. eleven and ten, and lay them on the table.
                         «'.
On the ace you must put fourteen cards, and on the queen fifteen.
There will be then fifteen cards in one heap and sixteen m the other:
these added together make thirty-one cards         these subtracted from
                                                                   :
the number of cards in the pack,     e. fifty-two, leave twenty-one, the
                                               i.
joint number of the ace ana the queen.
                          16. THE PAIRS                RE-PAIRED.
   Tell out twenty cards in pairs, and ask ten people to take pair                        a
each, and remember them.    Take up the pairs in their order, and lay
them on the table in order, according to the accompanying table,

     Arranging these words in your mind on the table, take the first
 card of the first pair, lay it on u in Mutus, and the second on the M
 in Nomen. The next pair goes entirely in Mutus, being two u"s. The
 first card of the second pair goes on T in Mutus, and the second on         I
 in Dedit ; and so on until all the cards are laid in their places.
    Ask each person in succession in which rows his cards are, and you
 can immediately point them out.          For example, if he says the second
 and third row, you point out the second aud fourth cards in those
 rows, because they both represent the letter E.          If  another says the
 first and last rows, you point out the last card in each, because the
 cards represent s in Mutus and s in Cocis.           It will be seen that the
 whole table consists of ten letters, each repeated.
                17. THE QjDEEN        DIGGING   FOR DIAMONDS.
    Select from a pack the aces, kings, queens, and knaves, together
 with four common cards of each suit. Lay down the four queens in
 a row, and say,
                     " Here are four queens going to dig for diamonds.
 (Lay a common diamond over each queen.)              They each took a spade
 with them (place a common spade on each diamond) and dug until
 they were nearly tired.        Their four kings, thinking that they might
 be attacked by    robbers,   sent  four soldiers to keep guard. (Lay an act
 on each ipade.) Evening came, and the queens had not returned, so
the kings, fearing that they might have come to harm, became uneasy
and set off themselves.        (Place a king on each ace.) They were only
just   in time,  for   as they came along, they met their queens being
carried   off by  four  villains (lay a knave on each Icing), wno, although
only armed with clubs (place a common club on each knave), had over
powered the guards and driven them off. But the four kmgs, being
possessed of bold hearts (lay a common heart over each king), soon
vanquished the villains, and bound them." Gather up the cards, place
the heaps upon each other and direct some one to cut them.              Have
them cut four or five times, and continue to do so until a common
heart appears at the bottom. Then continue the tale, and say,
                                                                        " The
party then returned home in the following order. First the queen
(lay down the top card) with the diamonds which she had found (lay
down the second card, which will be a diamond ) in one hand, and her
spade (the third card will be a spade) in the other, &c. &c."             You
continue dealing out the cards in that manner, and it will be found that
they will be in precisely the same order as when they were taken up.
                             18. THE TRIPLE     DEA1.
    Take any twenty-one cards, and ask some to choose one from them.
Lay them out in three heaps, and ask the person who took the card
in which heap it is. You may turn your back while he searches.
Gather them up and put that heap between the other two.               Do this
twice more, and the chosen card will always be the eleventh from the
top.

    This is a variation of the preceding. Take twenty-four cards, and
lay them in four heaps. Act as in No. 18, putting the heap in which
is the chosen card second. The tenth card will be the one thought of.
   TRICKS WITH CARDS, THAT REQUIRE APPARATUS.
    I shall only give   one or two of these tricks, because, ingeneral, the
apparatus    required   for cards is exceedingly expensive.    Those that  I
shall give require but little apparatus, and any boy with the use of
his hands can make it.
                        20. THE CARDS      IN THE VASE.
    Make a vase with five divisions, two of which hold an entire pack
of cards, and the remaining three are only large enough just to admit
one card each, as in the figure. A strong silk thread is fastened at A,
passes over the three little compartments, through the bottom of the
vase, and running over two pulleys, terminates in the weight at B.
    Take three cards, say the ace of spades, the ten of diamonds, and
the king of hearts, out of a pack of cards, and put one into each of
the little divisions, pressing the thread down into the bottom of each
division.    If the cards are left, the weight will descend, and the
string being tightened, will push the cards upwards.            So a kind of
trigger shelf is made, on which the weight rests. The remainder of
the pack you put into division 2.
    When you show the trick, you take another pack of cards exactly
like that which is already in the vase, and handing it to three persons
successively, compel them to choose the ace of spades, the ten of
diamonds, and the king of hearts.1           Let some one shuffle the cards,
and when this is done, put the pack into division 1. Tell the spec
tators that when you have struck three times on the table, the cards
                    (1)  This may be done hy making the pass.

 will come out of the vase.    At  the third stroke, loosen the catch on
which the weight stands, by means of a string that communicates with
your table, and the three cards will rise slowly up. In order to show
that the cards have really vanished from the pack, take the pack out
of division 2 and let any one examine it.
   If  you prefer, you can draw the thread yourself, by having a kind
of pedal under your table, to which the other end of the string is
attached, instead of being fastened to the weight B.       If you prefer
the weight, you must have a small shelf for the weight to rest upon,
when it has descended sufficiently low, or the cards will be forced
entirely out by the thread,      c is a representation of one of the
divisions, showmg the semi-circular cut that is made in them for tie
convenience of taking out the cards.
                       21. THE METAMORPHOSIS.
   In this most excellent trick you choose from the pack the four
eights and the two of diamonds ; you put the four eights in the left
hand and the two on the table ; you take in the two, placing an eight
on the table, and they are all two's.     You exchange the two for the
eight,  and they all become  black cards ; you again exchange the eight
for the two, and they all turn red ; and after again exchanging, you
have, as before, the four eights and the two of diamonds.
   The method of accomplishing this trick is as follows : Get three
plain white cards, exactly like playing cards, and paint them as in the
engraving. Mix them with an ordinary pack, and when you are
                  V
                  *
searching for the four eights, with which you say yon are going to
perform a trick, take them from the pack, and with them an ordinary
eight of clubs and a two of diamonds.
   Show the cards as in Fig. 2, making the spectators observe that
there are the four eights. Put the two of diamonds behind the eight
of clubs, and lay the eight on the table.    The two must be inserted
before the eight is removed, or the mystery of the marking will be
apparent.    Close the cards, turn them over, and spread them out,

•when  they will appear as in Fig. 3. Take in the eight and lay the two
on the table ; close the cards, and while shuffling them, turn card
No. 2 the other way upwards. The cards will then all appear black, as
                                                        •My 3
 in Fig. 4.   Take in the two and remove the eight, turn them over,
 and spread    them out, when they will appear all red, as in Fig. 5.
                fig. i                               Jiy.S
 Finally, take in the eight, replacing the two on the table, reverse
 No. 2, and you will have the four eights and the two of diamonds
 just as they were at first. You must invent plenty of talk during
 your changes.     If  the spectators say that the cards are double, spread
 them out, and hold them up to the light, (for the light cannot pene
 trate through the places where the cards are placed over each other,)
 and if they are still sceptical, hand them the two of diamonds to look
 at, and in a moment or two hand them the eight of clubs, asking
 them whether they would like to examine a black card also. This wifl
 effectually disarm suspicion.
             22.   TO ciiANtiE    A       IN A   VKKSO.N'S  HAND.
    Cut very neatly the spots from a three of spades. Lay the pierced
 card on an ace of diamonds, and rub pomatum on the ace of diamonds
 through the places which the spades occupied. Remove the pierced
  card, and sprinkle the ace of diamonds with jet powder, which ad
  hering to the pomatum, will transform the card into a three of spades.
    Place the transformed card at the bottom of the pack, and show a

person what card it is. Muke him declare it that every one may
hear, then place it on the table, face downwards, and push it over the
cloth to the spectator, which action will rub off all the jet powder.
Tell him to place his hand on the card. Let a three of spades be at
the top of the pack, and an ace of diamonds the second from the
bottom. Show another person the ace of diamonds, and ask him to
tell the name of the card openly. Put the pack down, face downwards,
and in so doing, make the pass, and bring the three of spades to the
bottom.
   Tap the hand of the person who is guarding the card, and then
tell him to take up the card and show it to the spectators, when it
will be seen to be the ace of diamonds. Simultaneously, you take up
the pack, and show the three of spades at the bottom.

   Take a piece of writing paper about three times as long as it is
broad, say six inches long and two wide. Fold the upper corner
down, as shown in Fig. 1; then fold the other npper corner over the
first, and it will appear as in Fig. 2 ; you next fold the paper in half
lengthwise, and it will appear as in Fig. 3. Then the last fold is
made lengthwise also, in the middle of the paper, and it will exhibit
the form of    Fig. 4, which, when cut through with the scissors in the
direction of the dotted line, will give all the forms mentioned.

centre.   Then cut the whole into four parts, by means of two lines
drawn at right angles to each other, then cut along the inner circle,
and put the pieces together as in the above diagram.
           15. ANSWJER   TO THE STRING      AND BALLS   PUZZLE.
   Draw the loop well down, slipping either ball through it. Push i
through the hole at the extrenuties, pass it over the knot, and draw
it through again. The same process must be repeated with the other
ball ; the loop can then be drawn through the hole in the centre, and
the ball will slide along the .cord until it reaches the other side. The
string is then replaced, having both balls on the same side.
   This plan of passing the loop over the knot is a key to all the
puzzles of this nature.
   There is another and perhaps a neater way of performing this
trick. Draw the loop through the central hole, and bring it through
far enough to pass one of the balls through. Having done this, draw
the string back, and both balls will be found on the same side.
             16. ANSWER    TO  THE DOUBLE-HEADED       PUZZLE.
   Arrange them side by side in the short arms of the cross, draw out
the centre piece, and the rest will follow easily.    The reversal of the
same process will put them back again.

                         CHARADE ACTING.
    As my young friends will probably like to amuse themselves and
others by a little acting, I give them a specimen of a charade.   I wish
it to be particularly understood, that it is not incumbent on them to
adhere strictly to the language or even to the ideas.      It is a mere
skeleton, which may be filled out and clothed as the fancy leads.
    In charade acting, characters should always be burlesqued, and
everything should be in extremes, especially the
                                                   " getting up " of the
characters.    An officer, for example, should have a preposterously
large cocked hat, made of a newspaper, and the plumes should also
be of the same substance.       His eyebrows should be exaggerated by
means of a burnt cork, which implement will also furnish him witn
a pair of moustaches and an imperial.        The place of epaulettes is
filled by a couple of hair brushes, while a walking-stick answers for
the sword, and a scarlet handkerchief for the sash.     There should be
no medium between absurdity and splendour. Unless the characters
cau be dressed with real magnificence, let them be dressed in a
burlesque of magnificence.
    One word of advice.     Avoid moral charades as you would moral
pocket handkerchiefs.

    [Enter a little woman, who walks slowly round the room, inspecting
       the chairs, the fallen carpet-bag, andfinally examines the Travellers
       knees, at which he starts up ; then she slowly grows taller, in
       specting the furniture as before, till she attains the height of about
       eight feet. (This is managed by having a pole, on which is tied a
       bundle of rags to make a head, a mask, and a pair of spectacles;
       then a large bonnet and veil, then a very large full cloak. This is
       carried by a boy, who is dressed in another cloak to correspond.
       He stoops as low as possible, and holds the stick so that the head
       shall just come over his own, and the cloak fall around him; he
       then gradually raises himself till he stands upright; he next raises
       the stick up as high as the length of the cloak will permit. The stick
       should be a very stout one.) Re-enter Valet, with Landlord, Land
       lady, Waiter, and Chambermaid; the men in front, the women
       behind, screaming.       At the sight of the Landlord and Valet, who
       are armed with fire-irons, the woman gradually subsides to her
       original stature, and walks out of the room. At that moment, in
       come the Landlady and Chambermaid.

MISCELLANEOUS.

                           CARPENTERING.
                    " All  made out of my own head,
                       And  wood enough left for another."
    NOTHING is more useful to a youth than to be able to do a little
carpentering. To be handy with a chisel and saw, a nail and a
hammer, saves many a pound in the course of the year.              If you call
in a carpenter for a little work he is sure to spin out a "regular job."
I  remember once buying some oak saplings, which cost me eightpence
a stick ; and wanting to build a summer-house,             I required eight of
them to be sawn through, so      I  applied to a carpenter, and the sticks
were cut, but to my astonishment, sixteen shillings was charged for
this little "job," although the wood cost me only five shillings and
fourpence.    I found out afterwards that the proper price for sawing
would have amounted to about four shillings, so that twelve shillings
profit was clapped on for the benefit of my experience.                I  just
mention this to show my young friends, that if they wish to make
summer-houses for their gardens, cages for their birds, fowl-houses,
rabbit-hutehes, or boxes for their books, they must learn to make
them for themselves.
 "
                         I shall therefore offer them a little advice upon
   carpentering."
                          THE SHOP AND BENCH.
    Endeavour to procure some small outhouse, m which you may
erect what is called a carpenter's or joiner's bench.          These may very

566                        EVERY   BOY'S BOOK.
often be bought "second-hand, or if not, can easily be procured at
a reasonable rate.     I am very particular in recommending a bench,
as without it you will find many obstacles to your work.         You must
                                            —
also provide yourself with a set of tools, gimlets, hammers, planes,
saws, gouges, files, nails, screws, and such articles of use.
The bench is composed of a platform or top, supported by four stout
legs; A is what is called the bench hook ; this ought to be fitted in tight,
so as to move up and down with a hammer only. The use of it is to
keep any wood steady you may have to plane : B is the bench screw,
used for keeping any wood firm and steady you may have to saw,
which is to be put m the grip and screwed tight.           Sometimes the
edges of wood require to be planed, and then the wood is put in
the grip or cheeks of the bench and held tight while you plane it.
The noles in the side of the bench, c c, are for the insertion of a
movable pin to support the end of the board you have to plane or
saw, which is not in the screw.     The height of your bench should be
about 2 feet 8 inches.     The common length is from 10 to 12 feet,
and the breadth about 3 feet 6 inches.
                                OF PLANES.
   c is what is called the jack plane, which is the first to be used.
It  is about 17 inches in length, and is used to take the rough parts
from a piece of wood. It should be held steadily by fixing the right
hand at the handle (//), and the left over the top and side at (t), and
 pushed   forward on the wood, when the knife (i) will take off a
 shaving which runs through the hole (o), and falls on the side.          In
 using the plane the endeavour should be to take off a clean shaving,

which is done by using the instrument uniformly and steadily over
every surface to be planed.
   D is another kind of plane, called the trying plane, having a double
top or handle. It is used to regulate and smooth, to a higher degree,
the surface of the wood that had previously been smoothed from the
rough by the jack plane.      Its length is about 22 inches, and it is
broader than the jack plane.                                called the long
                                 There is another plane calle
plane, which is used for facing a piece of stuff, which it does with
the greatest exactness ; its length is about 2 feet 4 inches. There is
also the joiner's plane, which is the longest of all the planes, being
30 inches long. But the most handy of the planes to the boy car
penter is the smoothing plane, E. It is the last plane used in joming,
and gives the utmost degree of smoothness to the surface of a piece
of finished work ; it is about 7 inches  in length, the sides of the stock
are curved, and resemble    in figure a coffin; it is used in a similar
way to the other.
                                   SAWS.
   There are maiiy kinds of saws, but the most useful one is what is
called the "hand saw." It has a blade or plate about 28 inches long;
the teeth of which are so formed as to allow vou to cut the wood
crossways as well as lengthways. The handle of the saw is made so

568                        EVERY    BOY S BOOK.
as to allow a full yet free grasp of the hand, either for a pull or a
thrust.
   The panel saw. This saw has a plate nearly of the same size as
a hand saw, and is used for cutting very thin boards, which the rough
teeth of the hand saw would not cut through without breaking them.
   The tenon sate is of a different shape to the others, and is made to
cut across the grain of the wood so as to leave the ends nicely even,
that it may fit to the piece it is joined to, which is called a shoulder,
being that part which comes in contact with the fibre of the wood thus :
To do this it requires that the teeth should be much smaller, and they
are therefore placed so close as eight or ten to the inch, according to
the length of the blade.
   The dovetail saw. There is another most useful saw it would be
of advantage for the young carpenter to have, namely, the dovetail
saw._
        It is about 9 inches long, and contains at least fifteen teeth in
the inch. It is used for cutting the dovetails of boxes.      Its plate is
very thin, and it requires some care in using. It has a back for the
purpose of strength, formed of a thin piece of brass or iron, let in so
as to give the blade the requisite firmness necessary in using it.
   The eompaii taw. The plate of this kind of saw is very narrow,
and not more than one inch wide at the broadest part, gradually

                to about a quarter of an inch at the lower
 end.    It is about 15 inches iu length, and is used for
 cutting a piece of wood into a circular form, and the
 plate being narrow allows it to follow the foot of the
 compass to a very small diameter.
    The keyholt saw. The keyhole saw is much smaller than the above.
 It is used for cutting short curves, small holes, &c., such as a keyhole.
 The handle is the same form as that of the chisel, a small slit being
 cut through from end to end.        It has a screw on one side, in order
 that the blade may be set to any length, according to the circum
 ference of the hole to be cut.
                             THE SPOKE SHATE.
    This is a very useful tool.    It is employed for smoothing the edges
 of round pieces,   or   other ends requirmg to be shaved down. It is
 a narrow plane made of boxwood, and has generally a steel blade let
into it to cut ; it is used by takmg hold of each end with a hand,
 and moving it to and fro over the wood to be shaved down.
                      STOCK AND BITS.
    There are about thirty-six bits to a set, all of dif
ferent shapes and sizes ; but our young friends need
not get quite so many : if they provide themselves with
a couple of a medium size, this will be sufficient, such
as the centre bit and the auger bit.          The centre bit
will cut holes varying from a quarter of an inch to
three quarters of an mch in diameter, and is used by
pressing the knob end against the chest, and twirling
the centre part round with the hand.          It cuts a hole
very   clean, leaving  it quite smooth   inside.  The auger
bit is for the same purpose, and is used in the same
manner.      Another bit, called the taper shell bit, is
used for making holes wider, and is a very useful
implement.
                    HOT TO MAKE A WHEELBARROW.
    One of the handiest things in a garden is a wheelbarrow, and one
of the prettiest for the young carpenter to exercise his ingenuity
upon.     To make one, take a wide plank or board about an inch and

570                        EVERY   BOY'S BOOK.
a quarter thick.   Proceed to your bench, and having fitted it to its
proper position, take your jack plane and plane off the rough, next
use your smoothing plane to make it smooth.   Then take your pencil
and draw upon its side the following figure, A.     Then take your
compass saw and cut round the marks you have made : to do this
you will have to fix your board in the screw of your bench.      When
this is done take your spoke shave, and shave] the edges all ,ronnd
till they are very smooth and even, and you have one side of your
                   barrow. Lay this on another piece of board, and
                   mark the shape of it with your pencil; cut and shave
  C       .  ^ ... it exactly as you did the first side, so that when
   4          A finished the two will exactly correspond; then cut
  ^          r   a piece off another board for the back and front of
                 the barrow, of the subjoined shape,         by_the same
method you cut the sides, and plane and finish them up in similar  a
way.   Cut some tenons at the end of each exactly to correspond with
the mortices shown on the sides, D     D
                                       ;  let them be trifle larger than
                                                        a
the mortices, so that they will drive in tight.     Then cut the bottom
out neatly, and nail it  to the sides.   Havmg proceeded thus far, cut
put the legs of your barrow, B, and nail one on each side as shown
in the figure. Give each leg shoulder for the sides to rest upon.

                                 CARPENTERING.                              071
                         THE WAY      TO   MAKE A BOX.
    First  ascertain the size you wish your box to be of.          Then cut off
 your   stuff, but take care  to  cut it a quarter  of an inch  longer  than the
 size of your box from outside to        outside.  Should   you  want  it deeper
 or broader than the length of a deal, the widest of which is generally
 only eleven inches ; suppose, for instance, you wish your box to be
 18 inches deep, and you have only 9-inch deal to make it with, you
 will of course have to join two together, or make what is called in
 carpentering a glue joint. First, then, after you have cut off your
 stuff, take your jack plane and "scuffle the rough off;" then put
 your board edgeways into the bench-screw, and take your trymg
 plane or lone plane to get the edge of the deals that are to be glued
 together perfectly straight and even; and lastly, use the joiner plane,
 which will take off a nice uniform shaving of the whole length of the
 board. Proceed exactly in the same manner with the other board
 to be joined to the first. Then, after having made each thoroughly
 smooth, clap the two together and see if they will lie close in every
 part, if not, you must plane them till they do, taking care to plane
 the edges perfectly square, or at right angles to the surface of the
board, for if you are not careful in this particular, when your boards
are glued together they will be of this form.
                                                                ^^^^^_
                                                                ^f*~*~~*
When yon have joined them properly for glueing,
let your glue be nicely hot and not too thick, and hold both edges
of the boards together so that you can with a brush put the glue on
both at one time, put the two together very quickly, let one of them
be in the bench-screw, and while there rub the other backwards and
forwards till the glue sets, which it will soon do if well joined. Let
the whole dry, and then the glued part will be as strong as any other
part of the board.
    After your sides, ends, bottom, and top arc thus prepared, you
must then plane them up nicely, so that they are perfectly smooth
and straight. Use first the jack plane, then the trymg plane. When
this is done you have to proceed to a nice little job, namely, to dove
tail the corners together, so as to form your box. In this process
much depends upon the planing and squaring of the stuff, for if you
have not done this nicely the dovetailing will be very imperfectly
performed. Assuming that everything has been well done, then take
the two ends of the box, and see that each is perfectly square and
true to the other.      Then allow one-eighth of an inch more than the
thickness of your      sides,  and set out the ends, squaring it over on
both sides, which when the dovetails are cut out will form the inside
of the box.
                           TO CUT THE DOVETAIU.
    Take one " end-piece
                             "   of the box and place it endways into the
bench-screw, and mark out the dovetails on the edge of the board
inside, thus :                   .

572                        EVERY   BOY   S BOOK.
then -with your dovetail saw cut in into the marks down to the lines
squared over on the flat side like this —
Then with a chisel cut out that part of the wood that is crossed, and
leave the other part, this being the part which will form the pins or tails.
Then take one side of your box and lay it flat on the bench, the
inside uppermost ; then place the end you have cut on           it,
                                                                  keeping
the edges flush, and marc round the shape of the pins, which will
leave them after this form —
the black places being the mortices which are to be cut out. In
cutting out these you must be careful to cut within side of the
stroke, so that the mortices will be      little smaller than the pins,
                                           a
which will admit of their being driven in quite tight, and will allow
the glue to adhere to them (for you have to glue these when you fix
them). When you have thus put the ends and sides together let
them stand till the glue gets dry, then take your planes and plane
the quarter of an inch off the pins which you allowed to oe               a
little longer than the length of the box, and you have then made the
body of your box.
                         THE BOTTOM   OF   THE BOX.
  Cut your bottom the exact size of the box, nail the bottom on,
                      and "get out

   OTTB. book is intended for the gratification of boys. We know full
well the intense delight taken by boys in risking their limbs or their
lives, especially when snch risk is accompanied with noise.      Boys
always have done so, and always will do so in spite of the very best
of advice or precautions. As, therefore, it is impossible to keep
them from making noises and endangering themselves, we have in
the following pages endeavoured to show them how to make as much
noise as possible with as little danger as possible.
    What is there that makes the most noise and is most dangerous P
Gunpowder, of course. Therefore, we have given descriptions of the
best methods of employing this material, feeling quite sure that of
accidents with gunpowder nine out of every ten are caused by igno
rance. We knew a boy who lost the use of a thumb, and took all
the skin off the palm of his right hand, by ignorant management of
powder. He had read of blasting rocks, and nothing would satisfy
him but blasting a bank. So he bored a deep hole in it with a stick,
filled the hole with gunpowder, and then poked a lighted lucifer into
the powder. The consequence was, that nis face was so scorched as
not to be recognised, all his eyebrows and eyelashes and most of his
hair were burned off, while his right hand was injured as has been
already mentioned.     Now that boy had been studiously kept out of
the way of powder by female relatives, and was naturally profoundly
ignorant of its effects.  Had he been taught to handle    it,
                                                            he would
not now be forced to keep his right hand dosed, or to write     by
                                                                hold
ing the pen between the fingers of his clenched hand.
                              GUNPOWDER,
    Itwill not be very advisable for the firework boy to make his own
powder, but stillit  will not be amiss that he should know how       it   is
prepared. Pulverise separately    5 drams of nitrate of potass, 1dram
of sulphur, and dram of newly burnt charcoal mix them together
                1                                  ;
in  a mortar with .a little water, so as to make the compound into
a  dough, which roll out into round pieces of the thickness of     pin
                                                                    a
upon    slab.
         a     This  must   be done    by
                                        moving a  board backwards  and
forwards until the dough is   of proper size. When three or four of
                               a
these pieces are ready put them    together thus, —

and cut them off into small grains.          Place these grains on a sheet of
paper  in  a warm   place  where   they will  soon dry, but away from a fire.
During granulation       the  dough   must   be  prevented from sticking by
using a little of the dry compound powder. This mode of granulation,
though tedious, is the only one to be used for so small a quantity for
the sake of experiment.          In making powder in a large way it is
granulated    by  passing   the composition    through sieves.
                        HOW TO MAK?, TOUCH-PAPEB.
   Dissolve in a little spirits of wine or vinegar a little saltpetre, then
take some purple or blue paper, and wet it with the above liquor and
it will be fit for use. When pasting paper on any of the following
works take care that the paste does not touch that part which is to
burn. The method of usmg this paper is to cut it into slips long
enough to go once round the mouth of a serpent, cracker, &c.

             Procure a hard wooden cylinder, or,       if possible, one made
          of metal, whose diameter        corresponds with that of the in
          terior of the proposed case. Roll round it several folds
          of cartridge paper, and paste the edges well, so that it may
          be held securely.      Tie it round until dry.
                                TO   CHOKE    THE CASES.
             When, the cases are thus made they will require to be tied
          at the lower end.        This is called choking them, and as
          much force is required it is necessary.          Fix a wire into a
          small solid cylinder (</). Take another short piece (li) an inch

                    long, with a hole up it to admit the other end of
    ^"    the   wire,  fit it on and pass it up the case. Then having
          fastened a piece of whipcord to a post, wind it round the
          part left hollow by the wire, which should be about half an
          mch from the end ; pull it tight with the right hand and
          work the case round with the left. Cut out a piece of touch
          paper two inches long and an inch and a half broad, wind
          it round the choke, and tie it on with a piece of fine string
          —twist it to a point.          The cases are oest choked while
           damp.

                              HOW TO     PILL THE            CASES.
    Your cases must be very dry when ready, and should be put into an
 iron or wooden mould ; first put in a thimble full of your powder,
 and ram it down very hard with your ruler, then put in a little more
 till the case is full, ramming it down hard every time.          you have     If
 no mould, hold the case in your left hand with the twisted touch-paper
 downwards, and fill it after the same manner.        When you have filled
 within an inch of the top, fill up this with loose powder not rammed,
 for a bang, and fold in the ends ; after filling a dozen or two melt some
 pitch in a small ladle, and smear the ends of the case with it by
 means of a small brush.
                                  TO MAKE CRACKEIiS.
    Cut some stout cartridge-paper into pieces three inches and a-half
 broad and one foot long, fold down one edge of these pieces length
 wise about three quarters of an inch broad, then fold the double
 edge down a quarter of an inch, and turn the single edge hack half
 over the double fold. Open          and lay all along the channel which

   Such arc the principles and methods by which fireworks may be
made ; but we would advise our young friends to be very cautious, and
never to attempt making any fireworks by candle-light; always to
select some outhouse for their operations ; to see that no iron or steel
implements are about the place in which their fireworks are being
manufactured, or they may go off before they wish it; to use wooden
or brass implements in the bruising, grindmg, and sifting of their
mixtures ; and never to bring the fireworks, or any of their ingre
dients, into the dwelling-house, or they may suddenly receive a
                  " Heavy blow and great discouragement."

             TO  MAKE AN ILLUMINATED SPIRAL        •WHEEL.
   Procure a circular horizontal wheel two feet in diameter with a
hole quite through the nave, then take four thin pieces of deal three
feet long each, and three-quarters of an inch broad each. One end of
each of these pieces is to be nailed to the felloe of the wheel at an
equal distance from one another ; and the other end nailed to a block
with a hole in its bottom, which must be perpendicular with that in
the block of the wheel, but not so large.       The wheel being thus
made, a hoop planed down very thin must be nailed to the felloe o
the wheel, and wound round the four sticks in a spiral line from the
                     wheel to the block at the top; on the top of
                     this block a case of Chinese fire must be fixed,
                     and on the wheel any number of cases, which
                    must incline downwards and burn two at a time.
                     The axis of the wheel must be a little longer than
                     the cone, and made very smooth at the top, on
                     which the upper block is to turn and the whole
                     weight of the wheel to rest. The entire framing
                     of the wheel, with its connecting tubes, is shown
                     in the above cut.
                                    THE GRAND VOLUTE.
                        Should my young friends wish to prepare a
                     grand volute illuminated with a revolving wheel ;
                     the first step is to procure a large circular
                     wheel, and on its rim lay as many four-ounce
                     cases as will complete the circle, only allowing
                     a sufficient distance between the cases that the
                     fire may pass free, which may be done by cutting
                     the upper part of the end of each a little shelv
                     ing. On each spoke fix a four-ounce case about
                     three inches from the rim of the wheel.      These

cases are to burn one at a time.     On the front of the wheel form a
spiral line with strong wire, on which tie port-fires, placing them on a
slant with their mouths to face the same way as the cases on the wheel ;
all these port fires must be fired with the second cases of the wheel.
Let there be a series of wooden spokes all made to screw into a
block into the centre.     When the large wheel begins to discharge
the fireworks, the spiral wheel will of course revolve and produce
a very beautiful illuminated cone.
                        A. BRILLIANT   YEW-TREE.
   To prepare a brilliant yew-tree, a frame like the one represented in
the drawmg must be firmly attached to the ground. When the
branches are fixed, place illuminating port-fires on the top of each, as
many as is convenient ; behind the top of the stem fasten a gerb or
white fountain, which must be fired at the beginning of the illumina
tion on the tree. A series of these, varying in the angular directions
taken by the boughs, produce a very fine effect.
   Such are a few general directions respecting the making of fire
works ; but we have again to advise our young friends to be cautious
of the gunpowder, and to keep away from the fire, or from a light,
or from flames, steel, iron, or any other matter likely to cause a
spark.

                        SECRET WEIT1NG.
   THE art of communicating secret information by means of writing,
which is intended to be illegible except by the person for whom it is
destined, is very ancient.   The ancients sometnnes shaved the head
of a slave, and wrote upon the skin with some indelible colouring
matter, and then sent hnn, after his hair had grown again, to the
place of his destination. This is not, however, properly secret writing,
but only a concealment of writing. Another kind, which corresponds
better with the name, is the following, used by the ancients.        They
took a small stick, and wound around it bark or papyrus, upon which
they wrote. The book was then unrolled and sent to the corre
spondent, who was furnished with a stick of the same size.             He
wound the bark again round this, and thus was enabled to read what
had been written.
   This mode of concealment is evidently very imperfect. Crypto
graphy properly consists in writing with signs, which are legible
only to him for whom the writing is intended, or who has a key or
explanation of the signs.   The most simple method is to choose for
every letter of the alphabet some sign, or only another letter.       But
this sort of cryptography (chiffre) is also easy to be deciphered without
a key.    Hence many illusions are used.        No separation is made

                                  SECRET    WRITING.                                   581
between the words, or signs of no meaning are inserted between those
of real meaning. Various keys are also used according to rules before
agreed upon.      By this means the deciphering of the writing becomes
difficult for a third person not initiated, but it is also extremely trou
blesome to the correspondents themselves, and a slight mistake often
makes it illegible even to them.
   Another mode of communicating intelligence secretly, viz. to agree
upon some printed book, and mark the words out, is also troublesome,
and not at all safe. The method of concealing the words which are
to convey the information intended in matter of a very different cha
racter, in a long letter which the correspondent is enabled to read by
applying a paper to         it,
                          with holes corresponding to the places of the
significant words,     isattended with many disadvantages: the paper
may be lost, the repetition of certain words may lead to      discovery,    a
and the difficulty      connecting the important with the unimportant
                       of
matter, so as to give to the whole the appearance of an ordinary
letter,   considerable.

   There are many kinds of sympathetic inks. They are so called
because the writings or drawings made                    by
                                              them are illegible, till                   by
the action of some chemical agents, such as light, heat, acids, or
other substances are brought in contact with them, when they appear.
A weak sulphate of iron will be invisible in writing till washed over
with weak solution of prussiate of potass, which turns
         a                                                    of beau       it    a
tiful blue.       If
               we write with the nitro-muriate of gold, and afterwards
brush the letters over with dilute muriate of tm, the writing will
appear of    beautiful purple.
               a                       If
                                     we write with   diluted solution of
                                                              a
muriate of copper, and when dry present        to the fire,

a  yellow colour.
   Chemistry was also in great request for secret writing, and various
substances were found to afford         fluid which would leave no mark
                                            a
behind the pen, until some chemical agent were applied. For example,
if   letter be written with
     a                           pen dipped in the juice of lemon, the
                                   a
words will be invisible until the paper        held before the fire. This
                                                    is                                  is
caused       by
            the action of heat. Again,          solution of nitrate of iron
                                                    if
                                                     a
be the fluid used, the writing cannot be seen until           dipped into
                                                                  it   is                a
solution of galls, or even into tea, which will act upon the iron, and
become ink.      It was found that         plain sheet of paper were sent,
                                           if   a
and intercepted, the very fact of its bemg plain rendered        suspicious,it
and every means were used to render visible any writing that might
be on it.      Aletter was therefore written with ordinary mk, on indif
ferent subjects, and between the lines the required information was
added in some sympathetic ink.         But writing with these or other
sympathetic inks        unsafe, because the agents employed to render
                       is
them visible are too generally known. Hence, the chinre indechiffrable,
as   it   called, has come very much into use, because
          is                                                          easily it   is
applied, difficult to be deciphered, and the key may be preserved in
the memory and easily changed.        It consists of table m which the

   Any word is now taken for a key. The word Paris, for example.
This is a short word, and for the sake of secresy it would be well to
choose for the key some one or more words less striking.            Suppose
we wish to write in this cypher with this key the phrase,        "We      lost
a battle," we must write faris over the phrase repeating        it   as often
as is necessary, thus :
                             Pa risP   a risPar
                             We lost a battle.
We now take      as a cvpher for v> the letter which we find in the square
opposite ic in the left marginal column, and under    p on the top, which
is m. Instead of e we take the letter opposite e,     and under a, which
is/;   for /, the letter opposite e, and unaer z and so on.
   Proceedmg thus, we should obtain the following series of letters, —
                             mf cxli b tkmimw

                              SECRET   WRITING.                      583
   The person who receives       the epistle writes  the key over the
letters
                        P a r i sPa r i  s P a  r
                        mfcxlibtkmimw
He now goes down in the perpendicular line, at the top of which is
p, until he meets m, opposite to which, in the left marginal column, he
finds  iff. Next, going m the line of a down to f, he finds, on the left,
e.   In the same way r gives /, i gives o, and so on. Or you may
reverse the process ; begm with p, in the left marginal column, and
look along horizontally till you find m, over which, in the top line, you
will find IP. It is easily seen that the same letter is not always
 designated by the same cypher; thus e and a occur twice in the
phrase selected, and they are designated respectively by the cyphers
f  and w, b and k.     Thus the possibility of finding out the secret
writing is almost impossible.
    The key may be changed from time to time, and a different key
may be used with each correspondent.           The utmost accuracy is
necessary, because one character accidentally omitted changes the
whole cypher. The best way of determining the key word is to
 arrange that any word which occurs at a certain distance from the
beginning or end shall be the key word — the tenth from the beginning,
for example. The key word will thus change every time, and any
combination of letters will make it. This wiB make it impossible to
 be guessed.
    The easiest method of working this square is to cut a piece of thin
wood like a carpenter's square, and by applying it to the alphabet
the letter is at once seen in the angle.   For example, supposing such
a square to be applied so that one side is on the letter p at the top,
and the other on the letter a at the left hand, the letter m will be m
the angle, so that the trouble of following the lines with the eye will
be avoided.

                               FENCING.
   FENCING is the art of using the small-sword or rapier. The small
sword has a straight blade, about thirty-two inches in length, outside
the guard, and is fashioned for thrusting only.    Although it is an art
of the greatest antiquity, very great improvements have been made
in it during the last half-century, chiefly by French masters, who
excel those of all other countries.       This has been attributed to
various causes ; by some to the agility and acknowledged power of
rapid physical action possessed by this nation; by others, to their
natural vivacity and mental quickness. In my opinion, however, a
more direct ana powerfid cause may be traced in the great encourage
ment and universal patronage which it has ever received from every
grade of a chivalrous and military people.      Every regiment has its
maitre  d'armes,  and every  barrack its fencing-school. Indeed, in so
important a light was the proper teaching of this art held, that one
of the French kings (Louis XIV.) granted letters-patent to twenty
eminent masters, who alone were permitted to teach in Paris. When
a vacancy occurred, no interest and no favour could enable a candi
date to obtain this privilege : he had to fence in public with six of
these chosen masters ; and if by any of them he was beaten by two
distinct hits, he was considered unqualified to teach in the capital.

                                FENCING.                            585
    Independent of its value as the scientific use of the sword, — the
gentleman's weapon of defence, par excellence, — fencing stands un
rivalled as an exercise; and it is in this sense that it will now be
treated.    The most eminent physicians which this country have pro
duced have all, in the most earnest manner, recommended it to the
attention of the young. Thus, Dr. Clive says : —
    " Muscular exertion is essential in perfecting the form of the body,
and those exercises which require the exercise of the greatest number
of muscles are the most conducive to this end. Fencmg causes more
muscles to act at the same time than most other exercises.       It pro
motes the expansion of the chest, and improves respiration, whereby
the functions of the most important organs of the body are more per
fectly performed."
    Sir Anthony Carlisle uses similar language : —
    " According to my judgment, the exercbe of fencing tends to pro
mote bodily health, and the development of athletic powers.         It is
likewise apparent, that the attitudes and exertions of fencing are con
ducive to the manly forms and muscular energies of the human
figure."
    Again, Sir Everard Home, in still stronger terms : —
    " Of all the diflerent modes in which the body can be exercised,
there is none, in my judgment, that is capable of giving strength and
velocity, as well as precision, to the action of all the voluntary
muscles of the body in an equal degree as the practice of fencing, and
none more conducive to bodily health."
   I  shall give one more extract from another physician of equal
eminence, Dr. Babbington : —
      I
    " am of
               opinion that, in addition to the amusement which this
exercise (fencmg) affords, it is particularly calculated to excite in
young persons a greater degree of energy and circumspection than
they nught otherwise possess ; and it is obvious that, m respect of
health, that mode of exertion is superior to all others, which, while it
gives motion and activity to every part of the body, produces at the
same time corresponding interest m the mind."
    Sir John Sinclair, Dr. Pcmberton, &c., speak in terms equally
recomm endatory   .
   To avoid all danger in the lessons and practice, foils are sub
stituted for real swords. Strong wire masks are worn on the face, a
well-padded glove on the hand, and the upper part of the body, at
which alone the thrusts are aimed, is protected by a strong jacket, the
right side and collar of which should be of leather.
   The first movement a beginner has to learn is the manner of
placing himself in the position called
                              THE GUARD.
   It  is from this position that all movements are made, whether
offensive or defensive.    Let the beginner be placed with his knees

straight, his feet at right angles, heel to heel ; the right foot, right
side, and face directed to the master.       The body must be held
upright and firm, the arms hanging down by the side, but easily and
without constramt; the left hand holding the foil p few inches
beneath its guard.    Next let him bring the right hand across the
body,  and  seize the  foil-handle; by a second mcvement, bring the
foil above the head, the hands separating as they ascend, until both
arms be nearly extended upwards and outwards. Here pause.           This
may be called the first position of the Guard.
   These movements should be frequently practised, as they accustom
the arms to move independently of the body, flatten the joints of the
shoulders, and give prominence to the chest.
   To arrive at the second position of the Guard, the right arm, with
the foil, is brought down to the front, until the right elbow is a little
above and in advance of the waist ; the fore-arm and foil sloping
upwards ; the point of the foil being the height of the upper part of
the face ; then, by a second movement, the learner must sink down,
separating the knees, and stepping forward with the right foot four
teen or sixteen inches; for, of course, the guard of a tall man will be
wider than that of a short one. However, his own comfort in the
position will direct him as to the distance ; and the general rule  is,that
the knee of the   left leg will jut over the toes of the left foot, and the
right leg from ankle to knee be perpendicular.      It   isin this position
that he will receive all attacks from an adversary, and from this
position will all his own attacks be made. Also in this position
will he
                                  ADVANCE
upon an adversary, when beyond hitting distance.   The step in the
advance   usually about that of the width of the Guard, although of
         is

                                    FENCING.                            587
course this would vary with circumstances.     The step is made by
advancing  the right foot the distance    have  I
                                                named; and on its
reaching the ground, the left foot is brought up, and takes its
place.         To
                                     RETREAT,
the reverse of the above movement is made. The left foot takes the
lead, stepping to the rear about as far as the right had stepped to the
front; the right occupying its place on its taking up its new position.
The next movement,
                             THE LONGE,
is a very important movement, and is rather difficult to make pro
perly, and fatiguing to practise. Indeed, the first movements in
fencing are the most trying to the learner ; and he must not be dis
couraged if he fails to do them correctly at first— practice only will
give him this power. The Longe is that extension of body which
              every attack, and is thus made : The right arm is
extended straight from the shoulder, the arm and blade being on the
same level ; by a second movement, the right foot is raised from the
ground, and a step made forward, about eighteen inches in length,
while the left remains firmly planted in its place.     At the instant
that this step is made, the left hand is allowed to fall within a few
inches of the left thigh, and the left knee is stiffened back until the
legis perfectly straight.
   The thigh of the right leg will now be in a position nearly horizon
tal; from the knee downwards, perpendicular. Having executed the
Longe, the next movement to be made is
                                  THE RECOVER;
that     is,   to return from the position of the Longe to that of the Guard,

588                           EVERY   BOY'S    BOOK.
and is thus effected : The left arm is nimbly thrown up to its place,
the right arm drawn in, and the left knee re-bent. These movements
must DC made at the same time, as it is their united action that
enables a person to recover from so extended a position as the Longe
quick enough to avoid a thrust if his own attack has failed.
   These movements must be frequently practised before any others
are attempted — the Guard, the Advance, the Retreat, the Longe, and
the Recover ; and when the learner has attained some proficiency in
them, he may begin the more delicate movements of attack and
defence.             I
           Of these will now speak.
                                THE ENGAGE.
   It is customary for adversaries, on coming to the Guard, to Engaqt,
or to join blades, on what is called the inside, that        is,
                                                             the right side   ;
although   there  are  occasions oil which    itadvisable
                                                   is      to engage on the
outside,  or on  the  left
                         ;  otherwise  called the Quarte  or  Tierce sides.
   Two men thus opposed to each other will at once perceive that
there are two lines of attack open to them,          e. the line inside and
                                                        i.
the line outside the blade — these, and no more.         But these may be,
and in fencing are, subdivided into inside above the hand, and inside
under the hand, and the same subdivision for outside.             This gives
                        —
four lines of attack or, to speak more simply, gives four openings
through which an adversary may be assailed.          Now, to protect each
of these assailable points, are four defensive movements, called
                                  PARADES.
   Each opening has its own parade or defence, and each parade will
guard its own opening, and, strictly speaking, no other. The opening
inside above the hana    defended
                         is             by
                                      two parades.
 As its name imports, the first and most natural parade            is   that of

                                FENCING.                            589
 Prime. The action of drawing the sword from its sheath is almost
 exactly the movement made use of in the parade of Prime.
    In this parade, the hand is raised as high as the forehead, so that
 the fencer can see his opponent's face under his wrist. The blade of
 the foil is almost horizontal, but the point is rather lowered towards
 the ground.     As this parade will throw the right side of the body
 open to the adversary's sword, it is good play to disengage from left
 to right, and deliver a rapid thrust at the adversary, m order to
 anticipate him before he can bring his own sword round for another
 thrust. His point will be thrown far out of line, so that he is behind
 hand in point of time.
    This is a very useful parade for fencers of short stature, as they
 can sometimes get in their blade under their adversary's arm, after
 they have parried his thrust.
    The other parade is that of
                                 QUABTE.
    It  is thus formed.   On the approach of the point of an adver
 sary's   blade (and how these approaches are made      I will presently
 explain), the right hand is moved a few inches — three or four will be
 enough — across the body on the inside; the hand being neither
 depressed nor raised, and the foil being kept on the same slope as in
 the Guard. This guards the body on the mside above the hand, but
(and here comes an important law in fencing) the very movement
which has guarded the body on one side has exposed it on the other;
this is the case with all the simple parades.
   Suppose, now, that the exposed part outside above the hand were
assailed, then the defence for it is the parade of
                                 TIEHCE.
   It  is formed by turning the hand with the nails downwards, and

590                     EVERY    BOYS BOOK.
crossing to the opposite side some six or eight inches ; the hand and
point at the same elevation as before : this will guard this opening.
If,   however, the attack had been made voder instead of over the
hand, then the proper parade would have been Seconde.
    There is another method of parrying, called Quarte, over the arm,
which is executed by making almost the same parade       as  in Tierce,
with this exception — first, the hand is retained in its original posi
tion, with the nails upwards ; and, secondly, the point is not raised
above the eye of the adversary.
    It is rather more delicate than tierce, but wants its power and
energy.    The Ripostes, or reply thrusts, are made, as they would
have been had the parade been that of Tierce.

                               FENCING.                            591
                               SECONDS
is formed by turning the hand in the same position in which it was
turned for Tierce, but the point of the foil slopes as much downwards
as in Tierce it did upwards ; the direction and distance for the hand
to traverse being the same. Again, had the attack been delivered at
none of these, but at the inside under the hand, then the proper
parade would have been
                            DEMI-CERCLE,
which, as its name expresses, is a half-circle, described by a sweep of
the blade traversing the under line.   Next comes the parade of

 592                         EVERY   BOY S BOOK.
                                   OCTAVE.
    In  this parade the hand is held as in Quarte ; the hilt of the foil is
 kept  lower   than that of the opponent; the blade is almost horizontal,
 the point being only slightly lower than the hilt, and directed towards
 the body of the adversary.
   Octave is extremely useful when the fencer misses his parade of
Demi-cercle, as there is but a short distance for the point to traverse,
and it generally meets the blade of the adversary before the point
can be properly fixed.        Moreover, it brings the point so near the
adversary's body, that he will not venture to make another thrust
until he nas removed the foil.
   Thus    I have enumerated, and partly explained, the forms and uses
of these four parades : thev are called Simple Parades, to distinguish
them from another set of defensive movements, called
                              CONTRE-PABADES.
   I  have said and shown that a man standing foil in hand, in the
position of the guard, is exposed in four distinct places to thrusts
from an adversary within longing distance.        I have also shown that
he has a defence for each of these exposed places ; but if a man has
but one defence for each assailable part, then his adversary, knowing
beforehand what the defence must t>e, would be prepared beforehand
to deceive him.      But if he has a reserve — if he has a second defence
for each part, then the adversary cannot tell what the defence will be,
until his attack, false or real, is begun.
   To meet this contingency, a second series of defences have been
devised, which are of an entirely different nature from the Simple
Parades.

                               FENCING.                              693
   Again, as each of the simple parades is framed to guard only one
openmg, it was found desirable that the contre-parades should be of
a more comprehensive character.      They are therefore devised so that
each is capable of protecting the entire front. It is evident that this
object could not oe attained without the sacrifice of quickness,
because a larger space must be traversed, and therefore more time is
occupied with a contre than a simple parade.
   To know one centre-parade is virtually to know all, as they are all
formed on the same plan. They are all full circles in the position of
hand and direction of foil of the different simple parades ; or more
clearly speaking, each simple parade has a contre-parade ; there are,
therefore, four simple ana four contre-parades, wnich may be thus
arranged : —
           Quarte
           Tierce
           Seconde
                     .......              Contre de Quarte.
                                          Contre de Tierce.'
                                          Contre de Seconde.
           Demi-cercle                    Contre de Cercle.
   I have  said that a contre-parade is a full circle in the position of
hand and direction of blade of its simple ; thus, contre de quarte is
made by retaining the hand in the position of quarte, while the foil
describes a circle descending on the inside, and returning by the
outside to the place of its departure.     So with all the others, the
foil following the direction of the simple parade, of which it is the
contre. These complete the entire system of defences.
   I  now come to movements of an opposite nature, namely, the
                               ATTACKS,
and shall begin with the most simple of them.       I will again suppose
two adversaries standing, en guard, within longing distance of each
other : now the most simple movement that the attacking party
could make would be,
                        THE STRAIGHT THRUST
to the outside or inside, according to his line of engagement.    I have,
in describing the longe, in effect described the straight thrust ; it is
but a longe m a straight line, taking care, however, to feel firmly the
adversarr s blade, but taking care also not to press or lean on it
during the delivering of the thrust.
   Next in character comes
                         THE DISENGAGEMENT.
   This attack is made by dropping the point of the foil beneath the
adversary's blade, and raisin? it on the opposite side, at the same
time, risme with the arm fully extended ; on the completion of the
extension the longe is made and the thrust delivered.
                                   Q Q

 594                            EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
                                         THE ONE-TWO
is but a double disengagement, the first being but a feint or false
attack, to induce the adversary to form a parade to cover the part
threatened, for the covering of one part of the body exposes the
opposite : the second disengagement   is made to take advantage of
tms exposure. The arm is extended halfway on the first, and then
wholly on the second, to be immediately followed by the longe.
                              THE BEAT AND THRUST.
   This is another variety of attack. Supposing the adversary's blade
to be firmly joined to yours, when you wished to deliver a straight
thrust, there would then be danger of your falling upon his point.
This danger is avoided by giving a slight beat on his blade the instant
preceding your extension of arm, of course to be followed en suite by
the longe.
   The companion attack to this attack is
                          THE BEAT AND DISENGAGEMENT.
   The btat here takes the character of the first disengagement in
one-two, i.e. becomes a feint, and is intended to induce the adversary
to return to the place he occupied when the beat was made.         You
then immediately pass to the opposite side of his blade in the manner
described in the disengagement.
   It will be seen that        aft
                           these movements pass under the adversary's
blade.   However, there are certain situations in the assault, as          a
fencing bout     called, when an adversary
                     is                        more assailable over the
                                                           is
point than under the blade    for this purpose there
                                     ;                 what the French
                                                                 is
call the    coupe1   sur peint, or
                               CUT OVER THE POINT.
   It thus made By the action of the hand, and without drawing
       is                 :
itback at all, the foil is raised and brought down on the opposite side
of the adversary's blade, the arm being extended during its fall to the
horizontal position, on attaining which the longe    delivered. is
                          CUT OVER AND DISENGAGEMENT
is on the same principle as the one-two and the beat and disengage
ment.   On the adversary opposing the first movement (the cut) with
a parade, the second movement (the disengagement)          made to theis
opposite side, to be followed of course     the longe by
                                                       the extension of
                                                                 ;
the arm being divided between the two movements.
   These attacks are called simple attacks, because they may be
parried     by
            one or more simple parades, according to the number of
movements in the attack.      In fact, every attack can be parried, and
every parade can be deceived:            the additional movement last
                                            it   is
made which hits or guards.

   Thus, you threaten by a disengagement to the outside; your
adversary bars your way effectually by the parade of tierce; you
make a second disengagement     to the inside, which is now exposed
from the very fact of the outside being guarded (for both lines of
attack cannot be guarded at the same time), thus converting your
attack into one-two; but if your adversary parries quarte on your
second movement,    your attack would be warded off! This can be
carried much further, but the above will,              I
                                               think, be sufficient to
explain the nature of simple parades and attacks.
   To deceive a contre-para&c, a separate movement, called a doubU,
or
                                       DOUBLE,
has been invented       ;    it is very simple in principle,     and admirably
answers the purpose.              For instance, if you were to threaten your
adversary by a disengagement to the outside, and        instead of tierce,
                                                           if,
he parried contre de quarte, the double       then made
                                                  is             by
                                                             your making
a second disengagement to the same side as the first, for         will be
                                                                      it
found that his contre de quarte  has  replaced the blades in the positions
they occupied previous to your disengagement.         You will then have
an opening, and may finish the attack             by
                                             the longe.
   As all the contre-parades are on the same plan and principle, so arc
all the doubles.   Of course,        understood that you will make all
                                      it   is
the movements of the double en suite, and without allowing your
adversary's blade to overtake yours.
                                     ALL FEINTS.
   The foregoing movements having been well practised in the lesson,
the next step  is  that of all feints and all parades, and may be prac
tised either with   a master or fellow-pupil.   The practice consists of
one pupil standing on the defensive entirely, while another assumes
the offensive, anf attacks him with all the feints of which he
master, the other, of course, defending with all his parades.       It      is is
excellent practice, as    accustoms the pupil to think for himself gra
                             it
dually, he having thus but one set of movements to think about. He
is therefore enabled to make them boldly, without having to encounter
unknown movements from his adversary.
   It also enables him to see the extent of his resources, both for
attack and defence.     When he can both attack and defend with some
presence of mind, he may then begin
                                     THE ASSAULT;
that is,he may encounter an adversary, to attack or defend as occa
sion presents. He    then left to his own resources entirely.

   " Do not put yourself on the position of the guard within the
reach of your adversary's thrust, especially at the time of drawing
your sword.
   "   If
       you are much inferior make no long assaults.
   "Do nothing that is useless ; every movement should tend to your
advantage.
      " Let your
              movements be made as much             within the line of your
adversary's body as possible.
   "Endeavour both to discover your adversary's designs, and to
conceal your own.
   "Two skilful men, acting together, fight more with their heads
than their hands.

                          BROADSWORD.
   THE principal distinction between the broadsword and the rapier
is, that the latter is formed only for thrusting, while the former       is
adapted for cutting also.   Indeed, those who use the broadsword are,
in my opinion, too apt to neglect the use of the point, and to give
their attention almost exclusively to the cuts.
   The first lesson inthe sword exercise  isnecessarily to know how to
stand.    The learner should be instructed to perform the different
movements      byword of command, remembering to consider the first
parts  of the word as caution, and not to stir until the last syllable
                     a                                                   is
ottered. At the last syllable, the movement should be performed
smartly. In giving the word, the instructor always makes           slight
                                                                   a
pause, in order to give his pupils time to remember what they must
do. For example, the words Draw Swords,         given thus, Draw
                                               is
Swords — the word swords being spoken smartly, in order that the
movement may correspond.

  First Position. — Make the target1 about fourteen inches in diameter,
and place it on the wall, having its centre ahout four feet from the
ground.    Draw a perpendicular line from the spot at the bottom of
the target to the ground, and continue it on the floor, in order to
ensure the proper position of the heels. The learner stands perfectly
upright opposite the target, with his right side towards       his hee&  it,
close together, his right toe pointing to the target, and his left foot
at right angles with the left.  TTia arms must be clasped behind his
back, his right palm supporting the left elbow, ana his left hand
grasping the right arm just above the elbow. In this position, he
must bend both knees and sink down as far as possible. This will
not be very far at first, but he     will soon sink down quite           easily.    See
accompanying figure (1).

                                                  placing the right foot
smartly in front, about sixteen or fourteen inches before the left.
See (2).    He must accustom himself to balance himself so perfectly
on his left foot, that he can place the right either before or behind                it,
without losing his balance.
   Third Position. —The third position must then be learned.        This
consists in stepping well forward with the right foot, until the left
knee  is  quite straight, and the right knee exactly perpendicularly
placed  over  the right foot. Great care must be taken to keep the
heels exactly in the same line, and the body perfectly upright.      See
Figure (3).

    These preliminaries having been settled, the learner stands upright
 before the target, as in (1). A sword is then put into his hand, and
 the target is explained as follows : —
                                 TARGET.
    The interior lines represent the cuts. Cut one being directed from
 No. 1 diagonally through the target, coming out at 4. Cut two is the
 same, only from left to right. Three is made upwards diagonally, and
four is the same, only in the opposite direction.    Cut five is horizon
tally through the target, from right to left, and six from left to right.

  Cut seven is perpendicularly downwards.       Care must be taken that
  the cuts are fairly given with the edge.
     The swords drawn on the target represent the guards. The
 seventh guard ought, however, not to be made directly across, but
 must have the pomt directly rather forwards and downwards, as a
 cut 7 glides off the blade, and can be instantly answered either by a
 thrust or by cut 1.
     The two dark circles represent the places where the thrusts take
 effect.
     The learner begins by taking the sword in his right hand, having
 its edge toward the target and its back resting on his shoulder. Hia
right arm is bent at right angles, and the elbow against his side. The
 left hand must rest upon the hip, the thumb being to the rear.       At
 the word —
                            CUTS AND GUARDS.
                                    CUTS.
     Cut 1. — The young swordsman extends his right arm, and makes
the cut clear through the target.         When the point has cleared the
target,   continue  the  sweep  of the sword, and by a turn of the wrist
bring it with its back on the left shoulder, its edge towards the left.
The arm is then ready for
    Cut 2. — Bring the sword from 2 to 3, continue the movement of
the sword, and turn the wrist so that the point is below the right hip
and the edge towards the ground.
    Cut 3. — Cut through the target diagonally, bringing the sword
from No. 3 to No. 2, and bring the sword onwards, so that it rests
with the edge downwards, and point below the left hip. At
     Cat 4. — Cut from 4 to 1, and bring the sword round until its point
is over the right shoulder, and its edge well to the right.

   Cut 5. — At the word Five, make a horizontal cut from 5 to 6, and
sweep the sword round until it rests on the left shoulder, with its
edge to the left, and its point well over the shoulder.
   Cui-6. — Cut horizontally through the target, from 6 to 5, and bring
the sword over the head, with its edge upwards, and its point hanging
over the back.      From this position, —
   Cut 7.— Make a downward stroke until the sword reaches the
centre of the target.       Arrest it there, and remain with the arm
extended, waiting for the word
                                  POINTS.
   First Point. — Draw back the sword, until the right wrist is against
the right temple, the edge of the sword being upwards.           Make a
slight pause, and then thrust smartly forward towards the centre of
the target, raising the right wrist as high as No. 1, and pressing the
left shoulder well back.
       FIRST POINT.                                  SECOND   POINT.
    Second Point. — Turn the wrist round to the left, so that the edge
comes upwards, draw the hand back until it rests on the breast, and
give the point forwards, to the centre of the target, raising the hand
as before.
    Third Point. — Give the handle of the sword a slight twist in the
hand to the right, so that the edge again comes uppermost, and the
guard rests against the back of the hand.         Draw back the hand
until it rests against the right hip, and deliver it forwards towards
the spot at the bottom of the target, raising the wrist as high as the
spot m the centre.     The object in raising the wrist is to deceive the
eye of the opponent, who will be more likely to notice the position of
your wrist than of your point. In all the'thrusts, the left shoulder

             —At     this word draw up the hand smartly, and form the
first guard. Make the other guards in succession as they are named,
while the instructor proves their accuracy by giving the correspond
ing cuts. The guards must be learned from the target, by placing the
sword in exactly the same position as those delineated. The guards
are these   : —
                   A First   guard.           E Fifth.
                   B Second.                  F  Sixth.
                   C Third.                    G Seventh.
                   D Fourth.
   The two spots H and I mark the places towards which the points
are made,     II for the first and second point, I for the third.
                                     PARHY.
   The parry or parade of a thrust is executed with the back of the
sword.    The firmest way of parrying is to hold the sword perpen
dicular, with its edge to the right and its hilt about the height of and
close to the right shoulder; then, by sweeping the sword round
from left to right, any thrust within its sweep is thrown wide of the
bodv.
   1'he parry is executed      with the wrist and not with the arm, which
must not move.

 602                      EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
                            HANGING GUARD.
   When the pupil is acquainted with both cuts and guards, he should
learn the hanging guard, a most useful position, as it keeps the body
 well hidden under the sword, and at the same time leaves the sword
in a good position to strike or thrust.
   It is accomplished in the following way. Step out to the second
position, as in Figure 2, raise the arm until the hand is just over the
right foot, and as high as the head. The edge of the sword is up
wards, and the point is directed downwards and towards the left.
The left shoulder is pressed rather forward, and the neck and chest
 drawn inward.
   In this position, the swordsman is in a position to receive or make
an attack as he may think fit. It is rather fatiguing at first, owing to
the unaccustomed position of the arm and head, but the fatigue is
soon overcome, and then it will be found that there is no attitude
which gives equal advantages.
                              HANG1KQ GUARD.
   There are two other modes of standing on guard, each possessing
their peculiar advantages.      These are, the inside and outside guard.
The inside guard is made as follows : —
                             INSIDE GUARD.
   Stand in the second position,
                                   having the wrist of the right hand
nearly as low as the waist, the hand bemg exactly over the right foot.
The point of the sword is raised as high as the
                                                   eyes, and the edge is
turned inwards, as will be seen from the
                                            accompanying engraving.

                           OUTSIDE    GUARD.
   The outside guard is formed in the same manner as the inside, with
 the exception that the edge of the sword is turned well outwards.
                             OUTSIDE GUARD.
   To get to the hanging guard, the words are given as follows : —
inside guard — outside guard —guard.

   The swordsman having learned thus far, is taught to combine the

  11.  Fourth Guard.
      The young swordsman must remember that in this, as in all the
exercises, the cuts and points must be given in the third position, as
in the accompanying illustration, which shows the swordsman just as
he has delivered the seventh cut, and is waiting for the next word
before he resumes the first position.
                                     SEVENTH   CUT.
      The guards, on the contrary, are given in the first position, as is
seen in the figure on p. 605, which illustrates the seventh guard.
      These exercises are always learned with the single-stick, or basket-
 hilted cudgel, in order to avoid the dangers which would be inevitable
 if the sword were used. But as the single-stick is only an imitation
                    I
 of the sword, will give the method of getting the sword out of the
 sheath into any position required.
                                  DBAW     SWORDS.
      The first word of command is draw swords.               At the word draw,
 seize the sheath just below the hilt, with the left hand, and raise the
 hilt as high as the hip, at the same time grasping the hilt with the
 right hand, turning the edge of the sword to the rear, and drawing it
partially from the sheath, to ensure its easy removal.

                               SEVENTH OUAIID.
   At  the word swords, draw the blade smartly out of the scabbard,
throwing the point upwards, at the full extent of the arm, the edge
being still to the rear.
                 RECOVER    SWORDS.
   The wrist is now smartly lowered until it is
level with the chin, the blade upright, and the
edge to the left.    This is the position of recover
swords. The elbow must be Kept close to the
body, as in the cut.
                  CARRY   SWORDS.
   The wrist is now sharply lowered until the
arm hangs at its full length, the wrist being in
the line with the hip, the edge of the sword to
the front, and its back resting in the hollow of
the shoulder, the fingers lightly holding the hilt.
The left hand hangs at the side until the word
ituide guard, when it is placed on the left hip.
                   SLOPE SWORDS.
   At the word swords,        raise the right hand
smartly, until it forms      a right angle at the
elbow.
                             RETURN SWORDS.            RECOVER SWORDS.
   At the word, raise the blade until it is perpendicular, move the hilt
to the hollow of the left shoulder, drop the pomt of the sword into the
scabbard, (which has been grasped by the left hand and slightly raised,)

606                              EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
at the same time turning the edge to the rear. Pause an instant, and
send the sword smartly into the sheath, removing both hands as the
hilt strikes against the mouth of the scabbard : drop them to the side,
with the pal ins outwards, and stand in the first position.
                                       PRACTICES.
   There are many exercises with the broadsword, called Practices.
I have  given one of them, which is to be practised alone ; but when
the pupil has attained some confidence in the use of his weapon, he
must be placed opposite another pupil, and they must go through
them, each taking the attack and defence in turn.
   The young swordsman must be provided with a very stout wire
mask, which defends the face and part of the neck, and which should
be worked in a kind of helmet above, to guard against the disastrous
consequences of receiving the seventh guard.    No practices, loose or
otherwise, should be permitted without the masks, as neither party
would be able to cut or thrust with proper confidence.
                            SECOND PRACTICE.
   This is very useful in teaching the point and parry, as well as giving
steadiness on the feet.    Two boys are placed opposite each other, at
just  such  a distance,  that when perfectly erect they can touch the
hilt of their adversary's sword with the point of their own.
   The one who gives the first point is called Front Rank, (there may
be a dozen in each rank, each having tried the distance to his right
by extending his sword,) and the one who gives first parry is called
Rear Rank.

   This should be continued until both are weary.            Both swordsmen
should learn to do       it      more rapidly every time they practise. Next

    In this and the preceding exercise, the power of shifting the leg is
 shown.      If two swordsmen attack each other, and No. 1 strikes at
 the leg of No. 2, it will be better for No. 2 not to oppose the cut by
 the third or fourth guard, but to draw back the leg smartly, and cut
 six or seven at the adversary's head or neck.
    In loose play, as it is called, i.e. when two parties engage with
 swords without following any word of command, but strike and guard
as they can, both players stand in the second position, because they
can either advance or retreat as they choose, and can longc out to the
third position for a thrust or a cut, or spring up to the first position
for a guard with equal ease.
    It is often a kind of trap, to put the right leg more forward than
usual, in order to induce the adversary to make a cut at it. When he
does so, the leg is drawn back, the stroke passes harmless, and the de
ceived striker gets the stick of his opponent on his head or shoulders.
    We now come to a very complicated exercise, called the
                              FIFTH PRACTICE.

    This practice is capital exercise, and looks vt?y imposing. All
these practices ought to be so familiar, that the words of command
are not needed, the only word required being First, Second, or Third
Practices, as the case may be.

608                           EVERY BOY'S BOOK.
   I remember once, that two of my pupils had attained such a mastery
of their weapons, that we used often to go through the practices with
real swords. On one occasion, we were acting a charade, and my
eldest pupil and myself were enacting the part of two distinguished
foreigners (country unknown) who were to get up a fight.          So we
began by   a little quarrel, and finally drew our swords and set hard to
work at the fifth practice, which we could do with extreme rapidity,
and without the use of words of command.            The spectators were
horrified, and the ladies greatly alarmed; for there seems to be no
particular order in that practice, and an inexperienced eye would
certainly fancy that the combatants were in earnest.
                               FORT AND FEEBLE.
   The half of the sword blade next the hilt is called the "fort,"
because it is the strongest place on which the cut of an adversary can
be received. Always parry and guard with the fort of your sword, as,
if you try to guara a cut with the " feeble," which is the remaining
half of the blade, your guard will be forced, and the cut take effect.
                                   DRAWING CUT.
  The drawing cut is made best with a curved sword, and is exe
cuted by placing the edge of the sword on the object, and drawing it
over it until it is severed. A good large mangel worzel is capital
practice. Place the root loose on a table, stand at arm's length from           it,
lay the edge of the sword lightly on                           by
                                         is it,
                                            and slice the root     repeatedly
drawing the sword over it. This            very difficult, although   itlooks
easy enough, and   is  sure to jar the arm from the wrist to the shoulder
the first time or two, while the sword glides off as  if  the root were cased
in polished steel.   However,       little practice will soon overcome the
                                    a
difficulty. This cut    ismuch in use among the Sikhs.
                             GENERAL ADVICE.
   Never look at your own sword, but watch the eye and sword wrist
of your opponent.
   Remember that the great point in this exercise, as in fencing,       to is
gain  time.   Endeavour,   therefore,  to advance your point nearer  your
adversary than his  is  to you.
   Begin the assault out of distance, so that neither party can com.
plain of being taken     bysurprise.
  If   the two parties exchange      cut or thrust at the same moment,
                                     a            a
the one who gave his cut or thrust in the third position      victorious.
   When cut or thrust                                         it is
         a                     made, the one who receives
                              is                               passes his
sword, i.e. stick, into his left hand, and his opponent comes to inside
guard.
   Always spring back to the second position after delivering         cut
                                                                       a
or thrust.
   Keep the line of direction carefully, or you will leave an open space
for the adversary to get his sword into.
   Last and most important, Don't lose your temper.

to the great Originator and Preserver of all things.
   Gardening was the first of the arts. Before man had fallen from
his " high estate," and lost his heirship of heaven, he was placed by
his Creator in a garden, and ordered to dress it and to keep it.
When, after the lapse of ages of sin and sorrow, the redemption of
man was nigh, the Redeemer was found often retiring to the garden
of Gethsemane to pray.
   From the earliest times of profane history, gardens are alluded to.
The gardens of the Hesperides abounded with' fruit of the most delicious

kind, and the hanging gardens of Babylon were among the wonders
of the world.    The gardens of the Persians are called by Xenophon,
" delightful
             places, fertile and beautiful ;" and the gardens of Alcmous
abounded with fruits, grapes, and various horticultural wonders. The
philosophers of Athens walked in ornamental gardens, among shady
groves, statues, and fountains.
   There are many styles of gardening ; and those who wish to see
gardening in its perfection, and become acquainted with the different
styles, may visit the gardens of the Botanical Society, in the Regent's
Park, or those of the Duke of Devonshire, at Chatsworth, where the
perfection of gardening may be witnessed.
   The great distinction between styles of gardening          is,
                                                              the natural
and artificial methods of laying out the ground.        In France, during
the reign of Louis XV.,      a   new style, or the artificial method of
regularity, was carried to excess; — clipped hedges, always laid
out in straight lines, — flower-beds tortured into fantastic shapes, —
trees cut into the form of pyramid haystacks, — animals, &c.             The
gardens   were   like the  manners   and  dress  of  that  period,  in which
scarcely anything natural was left.      The Dutch imitated the French
and this kind of gardening continued to prevail till attacked                by ;
                   "
Addison, in the Spectator, and Pope, in his Fourth Moral Epistle.
Then followed the natural style, which was soon carried to as great
an exeess as the artificial. Nature was imitated on       a small scale, and
what  is  dispersed   over  hundred   of  miles  was   huddled   together in
a  small spot of  a   few acres square.     Pools, somewhat noisome in
summer-tune,     were made to imitate lakes.        Houses, huts, castles,
convents, hermitages, ruins, rocks, decayed trees, bridges, temples,
tombs, — pattern-card of everything strange, from all nations under
           a
heaven, — was exhibited in such gardens    ;   and this was called nature.
The folly of this is   now felt, anaa  chaster style is   taking place   and
                                                                         ;
the true style of gardening lies between the two extremes —         it ought
to be natural, but yet to show traces of art.
   We merely make these introductory remarks, that our young
readers may know something of the " gardening pastime," which                is
very likely to come before them, in some form or other, in conversa

tion. They are not to be expected to pursue gardening on a grand
scale; but even in the smallest matters it is well they should be
taught to proceed upon right principles. A few yards of ground may
be laid out very pleasingly by a person of a little taste, or very
ridiculously by a person of no taste at all.
                    ON  LAYING OUT A SMALL GARDEN.
   The size of a piece of ground which we should recommend to the
young gardener ought to be about 33 yards long, and about 25
broad.     It should be divided into four portions, as in the diagram.
A B c D are four paths, 5 feet wide, which might be gravelled, and
the edg.es should be planted with box. The borders should be about
2 feet m width ; and this, with the breadth of the path, will take
9 feet, or 3 yards, from the 25 yards of width ; which will leave 11
 yards,  or 11 yards broad, for each of the four compartments.         The
 length  of  the four  compartments — reduced by   9  feet, or 3 yards,  as
 before, for the cross-path and two borders — will allow each of the four
 compartments to be 15 yards in length ; so that each quarter of the
 garden would contain 15 yards multiplied by 11 yards, and would
 equal 165 square yards, which again multiplied by 4, would give 660
 square yards of surface, which would be amply sufficient for a young
 person to obtain something like an idea of gardening, and at the same
 time be a profitable advantage.
          PLANTING THE GROUND WITH TREES, FLOWERS,             ETC.
    In  the foregoing diagram, the borders arc for flowers, and the
 other parts of the compartments for the raising of vegetables ; but

here and there a space should be left for the planting of fruit-
trees, rose-trees, currants, gooseberries, raspberries, &c.       The places
marked by dots (*) are where fruit-trees may be planted, which
should consist of some of the best sorts of apple, cherry, pear, and
plum-trees, which ought to be planted from four to five yards apart.
In the borders, rose-trees, both of the standard and common kind,
might be planted, as indicated by the dots (*) ; and at the four
corners, where the paths intersect, climbing-roses should be placed,
having strong poles upon which their tendrils and branches may run.
The spaces in the border may be appropriated to the various kinds of
flowers, at the choice of the young gardener.              In planting trees,
especially  fruit-trees,  a large  hole,  at least  a yard square, should be
dug in the ground,     to  the  depth  of  two   feet, and then some of the
best mould should be put at the bottom ; the tree then, having been
carefully taken up, should be placed upon the bed, so that its stem
reaches the surface just at the point at which it originally did.        The
hole should then be filled up with good mould ; and every now and
then, while the hole is filling, the tree should be gently drawn
upwards, and shaken vertically, so that the mould may fall among its
roots, and not lay in clumps about them.            The hole should then be
filled up, and left slightly concave towards the tree, lightly pressed
down. While the mould is being put in, a pailful of soft water should
be mixed with it.      The young planter should also be careful to plant
his tree in a perfectly upright position. Rose-trees, and, in short, all
woody shrubs, should be planted after the same manner, adapting
the hole to the size of the tree, and taking care that they have a
sufficiency of nice mould and water hud round their roots, so as to
ensure their growth.
                            Cropping the Ground.
                                    DIGGING.
    When land is first brought under the spade it should be well dug,
and    it ought to be trenched up ; that        is,a   full spit or spadeful
should be taken and thrown somewhat higher than the general level
of the ground, and turned, so that the under part of the soil              is
brought to the surface  ;    in doing this effectually     sort of trench will
                                                           a
be left at the part where the spade goes       in, and  at the end of digging
a   piece of ground in this manner this trench will be required to be
filled up. It    is  usual for gardeners to provide for this at the onset
 by  bringinga    barrow full of the mould from the part at which the
spade  is  first put in, and filling up the trench so left at the end of the
process.      Common digging, when the ground          isnot to be trenched,
consists in turning    it    over regularly and evenly with the spade.
When manure      is  necessary,it   iseither hoed over the ground and dug
in as the digger proceeds, or in trenching            itmay be laid in each

 successive trench as  it is made, which will of course be covered by the
 next line of digging. Flower-beds are best turned up with a small
 three-pronged spade-fork ; and it is often necessary to use the same
 instrument when digging between strawberry and other roots, which
 is technically called forkmg. The earth in this process is not turned
 over, but only broken up and loosened, and the handle of the fork
 not turned in the process, but drawn gently backwards with a kind
 of knock, which can be easily acquired by practice.
                                    HOEING.
    The hoe is of very great use in a garden.           There are generally
 three kinds of hoes : 1st, the narrow; 2d, the broad ; and 3d, the
                                   Dutch hoe. The small hoe is used for
                                   hoeing in flower-beds ; the broad one
                                  for earthing up peas, potatoes, &c., and
                                  the Dutch hoe is of service in dry
                                  weather in clearing the ground quickly
                                   of weeds. The two former hoes are
                                  used by drawint the handle to you,
                                   and hence called draw hoes; but the
                                   Dutch hoe is used by thrusting for
                                   ward, when the weeds cut up by it fall
                                   through the hollow portion at (a) clear
                                   of the operation.    In hoeing the hoer
                                   should be particularly careful to go quite
                                   to the roots of the weeds, and clear of
the roots of the plants.       In hoeing up peas he should be careful to
draw the earth nicely among the haulms ; and in hoeing up cabbages
not to sprinkle the dirt among the tender leaves forming the heart of
the plant.
                                   RAKING.
    There are two kinds of rakes, — the broad and narrow. The broad
rake is for raking over seed beds, and the narrow one for raking
borders among flowers, &c. In the use of the rake the gardener
should first lightly drag off all the weeds and stones from the soil.
In holding the handle of the rake high, all the loose stones, weeds,
&c., will be easily drawn from the ground without the mould ; when
the handle is held low, the teeth of the rake enter the ground and
scratch it up, which is sometimes necessary to be done ; but the little
gardener should be careful not to rake away his soil ; and the little
hard balls of earth that come over with the stones, &c. should be
pulverised by the back of the rake.
                                 WEEDDfO.
    The garden should always be kept perfectly clear of weeds ; a weed
in a garden is a disgrace to the gardener, ana unless a young person

 614                      BVBBY BOY'S BOOK.
 makes   up his mind to be very particular in this he had better never
 think of gardening. Chickweed, dandelion, plantain, and every other
 description of extraneous growth should be quickly removed, and
that worst of all weeds, called the gardener's plague, " couehgrass,"
 should be extirpated entirely, as should all suckers from the roots of
trees.    "Weeds if not in seed should be thrown into the manure pit,
but sticks or stones should never be mixed with them.
                             SOWING SEEDS.
    The ground having been dug and raked, and otherwise prepared, is fit
for the reception of the seed. In some instances the use of the roller
is necessary after seeds have been sown to consolidate the ground,
in others the seed cannot be scattered too slightly. Radishes, carrots,
parsnips, are sown by the hand broadcast ; the way of sowing carrot
seed is to mix it with the earth in a large flower-pot, and then to
scatter it very thinly over the bed. Peas are sown in drills about
three inches deep and four feet apart.    Broad beans are put in with
a dibber in straight lines about five inches apart, the
rows being four feet from each other. French beans are
sown thinly in drills about four feet apart.        Scarlet
runners are put in by the dibber singly about three inches
apart, and should have bean sticks placed near them as
soon as they appear, upon which to climb.         Cabbage-
plants should be put in by the dibber about nine incites
apart, in rows about four feet distant from each other.
Cauliflowers should be planted eighteen inches apart
either way, as should Scotch kale and sprouting brocoli.       Spinach
may be sown thinly in drills three feet apart, or oroadcast in beds.
Lettuce-seed, cabbage-seed, cauliflower-seed, and all kinds of flower-
seeds should be first sown in warm situations in good mould very
thinly, and then the plants should be transplanted as they grow
of sufficient size. Potatoes should be planted with the dibber nine
inches apart, in rows three feet apart, as should Jerusalem arti
chokes.    Onions should be sown broadcast, in beds about six feet
wide and fifteen or twenty long. The beds for parsnips and carrots

   This is a most important operation, and is indispensable in the art
of gardening. A vast number of seeds must be
sown in beds and afterwards transplanted into their
final situations ; this is particularly the case with
regard to flowers. The instrument with which trans
planting is performed is called a trowel, of which
there are both small and large.        In using it the
principal thing to be attended to, is to take the
best and most vigorous of the plants raised in the
seed-bed, without injuring their roots, and with the earth around

them, and placing them, with aa little disturbance of their roots as
possible, in their new situations.   In the transplanting of bulbous
roots, such as hyacinths, tulips, &c., the greatest care is necessary,
and to do it effectually it is sometimes requisite to use the spade,
and to take up witk the root a whole spadeful of earth.      In trans
planting shrubs, &c. from pots, the planter should take the pot in his
hand, and forcing the root up from the bottom, by placing his finger
on the hole at the bottom of the pot, he should then place the plant
and ball of earth in the hole prepared for            it,
                                              using little water, and a
very slightly breaking the earth round the roots of the plant, so that
its fibres may have free play in the new earth. In transplanting
shrubs, &c., particular care should be taken                 in
                                                  digging them up, so
that the young fibres of the roots are not injured, and they may be
replanted according to the manner recommended in plantmg fruit-
trees.   "When shrubs, &c. are first transplanted, they should,  pos                   if
sible, be shaded for    few days from the heat of the sun, and they
                          a
should also be moderately watered, and for many days afterwards
looked at from time to tune to see that they do not get too dry,
although  it  not right to keep them very wet.

the finger should be first passed round the pot when the mould joins
the sides of the pot, so as to close up the little creek or crevice
between them, otherwise the water will pass down this crack, and go
out at the hole at the bottom of the pot without affording                any          it
benefit.  In watering, never let the water pass from the watering-
pot close to the stem, but rather turn up the earth in             little cir      a

                   VARIOUS   MODES OP PROPAGATION.
   Plants are reproduced or propagated in various ways ; some by
seeds, some by offsets, as tulips and hyacinths ; some by dividing the
root, some by layers, some by cuttings.        Currant and gooseberry-
trees, as weft as rose-trees, and also the vine, are propagated bv
cuttings; i.e. pieces of the young last-year branches are cut off
about sii inches in length, and, the top being taken off, are placed
with the thickest end in the ground. Strawberries are reproduced
by dividing the root, or by taking the runner which the plant has
itself fixed in the ground as the nucleus of a new plant, and putting
it in a proper situation. Raspberries give out suckers from the
parent root, which may be taken off and replanted, like the lilac,
the rose, and many other plants ; but in takmg them off, which is
generally done by a spade, they should be taken pretty near to the
parent stem, and should have fibrous roots attached.            In taking
offsets, such as those of bulbous roots, it is only necessary to take
those which nature herself separates from the parent bulb ; m tubers,
such as the artichoke and potato, the tubers of middle size are to be
taken and planted ; or in regard to the latter root, the eyes or shoots
only are sometimes planted, the root being cut into various portions.
                                 LAYERS.
   If  we observe the strawberry plant, we find that at a certain
season of the year it throws out offsets, and at certain" distances
a knob or knot arises, from which roots shoot into the earth, while
from its upper centre a bud appears, and then a new plant is formed.
The process of layering is to artificially produce this, and similar
operations of nature. Some plants throw out roots whenever their
stump or branches come in contact with the soil, but others retraire
the assistance of art. The art of layering, therefore, consists in taking
the shoot of a growing plant as near the root as possible; this is first
to be out half through, and then a slit is made in an upward direction,
and, a piece of twig being placed in the divided part, the shoot is pegged
down with the jomt buried in the ground. After a time this jomt
begins to throw out roots, and when these are firmly established and
begin to draw nutriment from the earth, the shoot may be detached
from its parent stem, and it then becomes a new plant. Layers may
be made m the spring months, and also in the month of July.
                                 PIPINGS
Are cuttings of carnations,     pinks, &c.     They are tubular stems,
having joints at certain distances, and they are pulled asunder by the
fingers at these joints ; the lower leaves are then pulled off, and the
pipe is placed in some nicely prepared soil, leaving its upper portion,
consisting of the sprouting leaf bud, to grow, while the lower pipe
shoots into a root.

                                  GRAFTING.
     Grafting, inarching, and budding, is generally performed in the
  month of March. The operation of marchmg is sometimes performed
  by nature. When two branches of a tree lie in contact, the rough
  winds of winter often cause them to rub against each other, so that
  a wound is produced in one or both, and the juices that flow from the
  wounded parts gradually cause an incorporation of the substances, so
 that the two branches become united into one. This is not to be
  wondered at in branches of the same tree, or in those of the same
  kind, but it is a matter of some surprise to find that a tree bearing
  small and unpalatable fruit may be cut down, and the remaining part
 grafted with a scion from a species bearing large and delicious fruit,
 mstead of the small sour fruit of the stalk.       Thus it is then that by
 grafting, we preserve and multiply a favoured variety of trees which
 could not be propagated from seeds with any certainty of success.
     In order to the full success of this operation, grafting must be per
 formed according to the rules that experience has laid down.          The
 first is to graft or unite only such species as have a relationship sub
 sisting between them.       The operation never succeeds unless this
 union of nature is attended to, and the plants belong to the same
 genus.     The next rule requires that the inner bark of the scion, and
 the inner bark of the stalk, be exactly united together, in order to
 facilitate the free course of the sap.
    The most common method of grafting is whip-grafting, or tongue-
 grafting.    The name of whip-gnvfting is given from the method of
 cutting the stock and the scion sloping on one side so as to fit each
 other, and then tying them together in the manner of a whip-thong
 to the shaft or handle. The scion and stock are cut obliquely, and as
 nearly as possible at corresponding angles.      The top of the stock is
 then cut off nearly horizontally, and a slit is made near the centre of
 it downwards, and a similar one in the scion upwards. The tongue,
 or wedge-like process forming the upper part of the sloping face of
the scion, is then inserted downwards in the cleft of the stock, the
inner barks being brought closely to unite on one side so as not to be
 displaced by tymg, which ought to be done immediately with a
riband, or mattmg, or bass, brought in a neat manner several times
round the stock.      The next operation is to clay the whole over an
inch thick all round, for about half an inch or more below the bottom
of the graft to an inch over the top of the stock, finishing the coat
of clay m a kind of oval form, closing it effectually, so that no light,
wet, nor wind, may penetrate.
                             TONGUE-GRAFTINO.
    Tongue-grafting is not very different to whip-grafting, and is per
formed as follows. The stock being ready, cut it off at three or four
inches from the ground, and, with1 a very sharp, straight, and narrow

bladed knife, cut a thin slip of wood and bark upwards from about
two inches below the top of the shortened stock. Make this cut at
one pull of the knife, inserting the edge rather horizontally, and when
it has gone through the bark and into the wood a little short of the
middle, pull straight upwards. Then at less than half-way down this
cut a thin tongue, not more than three-eighths of an inch long.
Proceed in the same way with the thick part of the scion, making
a sloping cut of about the same length as the cut of the stock, and
make a tongue to correspond with that in the stock.      Bring the four
edges of the bark, that    the two edges of the cut in the top of the
                              is,
stock and the two corresponding edges of the cut in the bottom of
the scion, to meet precisely, which can never be the case unless
the first cut  the stock ana that in the scion
                in                                even as

performed with      knife as sharp as
                     a                  razor. The two parts thus
                                              a
formed, the tongues and the stock clasping one another must be
bound up as before.
                                     BUDDING.
   Budding      the art of taking
               is                     abud from one tree and making               it
grow on another.         A bud can only be planted upon       tree of the
                                                                 a
same kind as itself, and the operation        generally performed in the
                                                is
month of August. The bud should be taken from shoot of the same

year's growth, and, in taking       it,
                                     should be neatly cut out        by
                                                                  incisions
made above     it,below      it,
                              and longitudinally on either side, and the
piece taken should include the bud, without injury to the bark, and               a
small piece of wood of an oblong form pointed at its extremity.            A
place  is now  cut to  receive the bud  in the  shoot of   stock,
                                                             a     and   the

                                                                       open
on both sides of the slit, and the piece of bark to which the bud                 is
attached  is then filled in, and the bark of the stock closed over       the
                                                                          it  ;
two parts are then bound together with strips of fresk matting tied in
bows and ends, for the purpose of being easily loosened as the bud
increases in growth.      The operation of budding requires the aid of            a
budding-knife, which may be readily purchased, and the success of
the operation depends upon the care and nicety with which             itper  is
formed.
                                    INABCHING.
   We have already mentioned how nature performs what                 a is  called
inarching. The gardener's art consists simply in bending                   branch
partly cut through, and inserting the belt thus formed mto       slit        a
made downwards in the stock to receive it.    The parts being nicely
fitted are bound with matting. In five or six months the head of the
stock may be cut off, and the plant removed.

                             GBAFTING-CLAY.
  Most of the operations of grafting require clay to be put round the
parts. This is made of three parts of stiff yellow clay to one of horse-
dung fresh as it falls, with a little cut hay, well mixed together;
another kind of clay is made of a pound of pitch and a pound of yellow
wax, mixed with two pounds of cow-dung. The use of them in
covering the grafting posts is to keep them moist and cool till a
proper union has taken place.
                                 PRUNING.
   The proper time for pruning trees is in December or January, for
then the sap is down, and no injury can be done ; and the art in
                                        "
pruning consists in cutting away the water shoots," or non-bearing
        "                   "
wood, dead wood," and superfluous wood." The water shoots, as
they are called, appear to be strong growing branches, but generally
produce neither flowers nor fruit; the superfluous wood are those
shoots which grow in the way of each other, or cross each other,
which shoydd always be removed.        The great principle in pruning a
fruit tree is to leave all the tree free and open, so that the air and
sunshine may pass through         it,and to preserve the buds of the
bearing wood.      The shoots should  be cut off as near to the stem or
branch as possible, and all growths or suckers which appear below
the crown of the tree should be taken off.       The present practice of
thumb-pruning    is  very excellent;    bythis means the superfluous
shoots, &c., are removed    by the thumb nail as soon as they appear,
and thus the tree does not exhaust itself         by
                                                  the growth of useless
wood. The young pruner should be very careful in cutting away,
and recollect that what he cuts off he cannot put on again.
                                 TRAINING.
   The training of trees applies principallyto those that are fastened
to wooden trellises, to poles, or to walls. The principle of the art  is to
extend the bearing branches of     a tree or plant, so as to improve its
growth, its beauty, and its produce.       Peaches, nectarines, apricots,
vines, &c., are tramed against walls    by shreds of cloth being placed
round the branches, and the two ends nailed to the wall.         In doing
this, care should be taken to give the branch room to play,_and yet to
confine it, not to hurt the tender fruit-shoots in the operation, and to
let all the branches be free of each other. Roses and jasmines are
often trained round verandahs     bytheir different parts being tied with
ropes' end or tarred twine to different parts of the treUiswork.
Sometimes flowers are trained     bybeing tied to stakes or long poles,
and others are brought to pass through the round of an ornamental
ladder, or through the meshes of wirework of different forms.         But
in every kind of training the principle      isthe  same, namely   that  of
keeping the branches clear
                                 ofeach other, and of preserving        the
flowering and bearing shoots. Neatness and taste are also mdis

pensable    requisites to the training and management       of trees  and
flowers, whether for use or ornament.
                       INSECTS  AND DEPREDATORS.
    There are various kinds of depredators which find their way into
(gardens; — worms, slugs, caterpillars, moles, ants, birds, butterflies,
snails, &c.    These must be got rid of, or kept down, otherwise the
gardening labours are soon at an end. In wild nature all the above
 " vermin," as some people designate them, are of the greatest service
in some way or other; even worms and moles, which are very
 destructive in gardens, are of great service on commons, and there
fore in destroymg them we should always do so with as little pain as
possible to the individuals ; and, as prevention is better than cure,
the young gardener should look out in winter for the eggs of various
moths and butterflies, which may be often seen encircDng the twigs
 of trees, or under the eaves of paling, &c., and destroy them. Cater
 pillars are best got rid of by picking them from the plants ; and slugs,
 and snails, and worms, are ofted eradicated by turning a brood of young
 ducks into the ground for a short time, where they can do no injury to
the beds.     They may also be entrapped by laying cabbage leaves in
 different parts of the garden, under which they will creep m the night
time.     Moles must be caught with a
mole-trap set in the line of their march.
It consists simply of a bent stick, and
a wire formed mto a noose, slightly
attached to the neck of a peg, into
which the animal runs his head and
gets strangled, by the elasticity of the
rod drawing up the noose when the
peg is disturbed.     Ants are best got
ridof by destroying their nest and eggs,
the latter of which are excellent food
for young chickens, pheasants,        &c.
The most destructive insect is the
aphis, which attacks the rose, and this is best destroyed by the
fumigation of tobacco-smoke, either through a pair of common bellows,
or by means of the whirl-fumigator, which may be purchased for a
few shillings ; but the most certain mode of destruction is to obtain a
few "golden beetles," and put near the plants infected by aphides;
these are their natural enemies, and where they are placed the aphides
will soon become extinct.
                         PROTECTION   FROM FROST.
    The common trees and fruits of the
                                           garden require but little care
as regards   frost in our comparatively nuld winters, but many plants,

much attention during winter to keep them alive. It is useless
                                                                       to

attempt preserving geraniums, myrtles, and a great many of our
common summer plants, without preserving them through the winter
in a greenhouse of some kind or other. A small greenhouse may
now be cheaply erected, but for the preservation of a small number of
plants the greenhouse pit is the cheapest and most convenient sub
stitute. It consists only of a hole twelve feet by four dug in the
ground to the depth of six feet, having at the top a skylight.        It
should if possible be dug in a sheltered situation, open to the south
and well backed behind, and the glass-top, which should merely con
sist of one frame hud in a slanting position to the south over the top
of the hole, the back of which is raised to support  it,the front being
slightly lowered. The entrance to the pit     isat the side, to which a
stout wooden door nailed over with straw bands should be attached,
and two or three steps should lead to the interior of the pit, where  a
few shelves may be arranged upon which to place the flowers, &c. In
this pit flowers, cuttings, oulbs, and
                                     a   variety of other things, may be
preserved through   the  winter, with  very little cost or trouble, and
                                                                     it
will be of great deal of use in many other respects.

THE LITTLE GARDENER'S CALENDAR FOR THE WORK TO BE DONE
             IN ALL THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR.
                              JANUARY.
   IN January, if   the weather will permit, manure the ground, and
dig the manure in. Plant out some strong early cabbage in warm
situations: plant early kinds of "Windsor beans.       Sow peas, early
Warwick, in drills two feet and a-half asunder sow first early crop
                                               ;      a
of spinach sow early radishes, and cover them with straw two mches
          ;
thick, then uncover every mild day, and cover again in the evening.
Plant in the flower border the various bulbs, such as snowdrops,
crocuses, daffodils, jonquils, &c., and also their offsets. Plant also
the hardy herbaceous plants, such as asters, golden rods, campanulas,
Canterbury bells, &c.    Keep gravel walks clean.

    Peas, beans, spinach, lettuce, carrots, parsnips, beet, &c., may now
be sown ; and in hotheds cucumbers, small saladmg, melons, lettuce,
&c. Give air to plants under frames in the natural ground. Dig and
p repare the compartments of beds and borders ; sow many sorts of
h ardy annual flower seeds; the tender sorts in hotheds, such as lark
spurs,    candy-tuft, yellow lupines, pansies, virgin stock, sweet
scabious    mignonette, ten-weeks stock, &c.         And for edgmgs of
border, plant box, thrift, daisies, parsley, strawberries, &c.
                                    MABCH.
    Still continue to prepare an appropriate ground by digging and
manuring ; sow again peas, beans, &c., if necessary, and especially a
bed of turnips.      Now is the time also to sow small herbs, as thyme,
savory ; yon may also now plant various slips or cuttings of rosemary,
rue, wormwood, and lavender.          These should be the outward shoots
produced last year, five or six inches long, and should be planted in a
shady border, six inches apart.       Now also may be sown nasturtiums,
which may be sown in patches, dibbed in six inches apart, or in drills,
near a rail or running fence. Potatoes may also be now planted in
open weather.       In planting them, take care to get the best sorts, and
pick out some of the finest of a moderately large size, and then divide
the tubers into two or three parts, leaving an eye or two to each ;
plant the pieces in rows about eighteen inches from each other, and
 about four inches deep.         Now also is the time for pruning the
 various fruit trees, planting fresh sets of raspberries, strawberries, &c.
 In the flower garden the tender annuals are to be sown in hotheds,
 such as cockscomb, balsam, china-aster, tobacco, convolvulus, &c.
 Ranunculuses, anemones, and the hardy annuals, may be sown in the
 open ground, and transplanting of all kinds of plants, shrubs, &c.,
 may now be performed.
                                     APRIL.
     This is a transplanting month, particularly for cabbages and cauli
 flowers, all which should be now taken and put out for summer use.
 Celery should also now be pricked out. Continue to plant, if neces
 sary, pot herbs and sweet herbs, such as rooted slips of balm, penny
 royal, and camomile.       It is a good time also to plant out slips of
 mmt from the roots ; other crops of peas may also now be sown, as
  also a late crop of beans.        Now also you may sow gourds and
 pumpkins     in a frame.    All  pruning must be finished.   Insects must
  be looked after on fruit trees.      Vmes may be laid down in layers ;
 wall-fruit thinned; strawberry beds weeded, and kept very clean; new-
 budded and new-grafted trees well examined to see if the clay keeps
  close to the grafts.     In the flower garden or borders some of the
 tender annuals may now be pricked out, and some of the others sown

in the frame, such      as Prince's feather, capsicum, love-apples, Indian
corn, gourds,     sweet   balsam, marvel of Peru; stocks, and the hardy
annuals, may now be sown in the open ground, as Adonis poppy,
sweet peas, catch-fly, annual sunflower, larkspur, lupines, Venus s
looking-glass.       The best way to sow sweet peas is in pots, and
           them well from the birds, who will otherwise not leave one.
frotect
  narching may now be performed on evergreens and other plants,
which you may wish to propagate this way.
                                      HAY.
   Lettuces will now want tying up. Peas will require sticking. Do
not tie your lettuces up too tightly, and when you stick your peas
put in i he stick in a slanting direction.     Clear and thin carrots and
parsnips, leaving the largest plants at least four inches from each
other; thin also onions ; plant out cauliflowers.        Sow brocoli seeds
for the crop to come in on the following winter and early spring.
 Sow and plant savoys ; top the broad beans that are now in blossom,
which will make the pods set sooner and swell faster.            Plant the
 various kinds of Trench beans, such as the white speckled, in
 drills about three feet apart, and sow them thin. Prick out and
plant celery ; continue to sow radishes and small salading for daily
use.     Water new planted crops, and now let more than common care
be taken to destroy weeds amongst crops of every kind; and now is
the time for using your Dutch hoe freely among the rows of peas,
beans, and spinach ; but do not leave your weeds about in the drills
or borders ; clear all carefully away, and keep the garden clean and
neat.
                                     JUNE.
    Look after your melons,        pumpkins, gourds, and cucumbers, in
frames   ;  let them be well supplied with fresh air and water. To save
cauliflower seed, mark some of the best and earliest plants, with the
largest and whitest and closest flower heads, which should not
be cut, but left to run to seed.       Peas may still be sown, and French
beans also, as may cabbage and colewort seed.                Gather mint,
balm, and other aromatic herbs, towards the end of this month, for
drying.       Examine any new planted trees, see that they are not too
dry,   and   that  they are well secured. Water should be given to those
that    show    any symptoms of flagging; water them well, but not
frequently.       Take care that your strawberry beds are also well
watered. Hang up nets before early cherry-trees against walls, and
over small trees, to protect them from the birds. Most of the tender
annuals may be now finally planted out, and now is the time to take up
the roots of tulips, crown nnperials, jonquils, &c., and to take away
the offsets.      Continue to support with sticks all the tall growing
flowering plants. Cut box-edgmgs, and regulate your flower borders,
keeping TOUT plants well watered if the weather should be very dry.

                                    JULY.
    You may now sow a batch of turnips for winter or autumn use, and
also some carrot seed to raise young carrots for use later in the
autumn.       Celery may be transplanted, winter spinach may be sown,
lettuces may be planted out, coleworts may be sown.         Gather your
cucumbers as they appear, and gather all sorts of seeds as they ripen
in dry weather, pullmg np the stems with the seed where it can be
done.      Bring out the cockscombs, double balsams, and all other
curious annuals kept till this time in frames. Transplant annuals into
the borders.      Lay carnations and sweetwilliams ; propagate pinks by
pipings ; transplant perennial plants. Take np bulbous roots, cut
box-edgings, regulate your flower borders. Plant cuttings and slips
of succulent plants; shift geraniums and other plants into larger pots,
if  necessary.
                                   AUGUST.
    Cauliflower seed must be sown between the 18th and the 24th.
 Celery should now be transplanted into trenches, and lettuce planted
 out. In the end of the month the dry flower stems of aromatic plants,
 such as hyssop, sage, lavender, should be cut down. Now look
 well out for various seeds as they ripen, which gather by cutting or
 pulling off the seed-stalks, then place them in the full sun against a
 hedge or wall to get them thoroughly dry. All flowers should now be
 carefully attended, and watered when necessary.       The pink pipings
 should now be planted out in beds, and the seeds of many bulbous
 flowers, such as tulips, hyacinths, lilies, may be sown to obtain new
 varieties.    Flower borders should occasionally be gone over with a
 sharp hoe, after which they should be raked over neatly, and all weeds
 and   litter cleared away.
                                 SEPTEMBER.
     Lettuces may now be planted in frames, or in very warm borders,
 for winter use.       Brocoli, cabbage and savoy plants may also be
 planted    out, and young plants pricked out into nursery beds. Celery
 should be earthed up, and you should tie up the leaves of endive to
 blanch the plants white. The spinach sown in August should be
 thinned and cleared out, and small salading should t>e sown once
 a-week or fortnight.     Gather ripe seeds as before, and see that the
 birds do not devour them.        Now is a good time to plant the strong
 runner plants into separate beds, and at about fifteen inches asunder
 either way. Towards the end-of the month hyacinth and tulip roots
 may be planted, as well as any other bulbous root.        Anemone and
 ranunculus seed may be sown, and perennial plants transplanted.
 Continue to keep the flower borders always very clean, and begin
 digging vacant beds and borders for future planting.

                                    OCTOBER.
        Now the apples and pears begin to ripen. Seeds are still to bo
     looked for and preserved, vacant spaces of ground are to be dug up
     and manured.    Fruit trees may now be transplanted, and currant and
     gooseberry-trees may be planted.       Recollect that the currant-trees
     may be cut close down to the fruit buds, but the gooseberry only half
     way down the last year's wood.          Cut put irregular growths and
     suckers, and keep them trained to a single stem below.             Straw
     berry beds  should  this month have their wmter dressing of manure,
    and all the runners cleared away close to the head of the main plants.
    Raspberry plants may be pruned, the old stems cut away, and the
    last year's suckers' stems selected for the next year's bearings, and
    each of them shortened one-third iu height.          In the flower-garden
    the borders should be nicely dressed, and all kinds of plants may
    be transplanted, or their roots divided, and bulbs not yet planted may
   be put into the earth.     Plant all kinds of shrubs and evergreen trees.
                                   NOVEMBER.
       Now is the time for digging up potatoes, and taking up carrots,
   parsnips, onions, &c., and storing them for winter use. Wmter spinach
   should be weeded, and the red beet-root dug up. Onions may be
   pricked out to come in early in the spring. Trees may be pruned ;
   all sorts of fruit trees and bulbous roots planted.     Now tender plants
   should be removed to the pit or greenhouse.
                                   DECEMBER.
      Peas may be sown in a warm sheltered spot to come in early
  in   the spring, as may Windsor and broad beans. Celery should
 be well       earthed up, and all vacant ground manured, dug, or
 trenched.       Secure the roots of newly planted trees from the frost
 by laying dungy litter round them, and the same may be done
 to the spots m which hyacinths,             tulips, anemones, and ranun
 culuses are planted.'       Smau young    tender  seedling flower plants also
require care at this season. The borders may now be finally cleared
and laid nice and smooth, the remainder of pot plants removed to the
greenhouse or pit, which should be closed during the night, and only
opened in fine mild weather ; as the frost comes on place mats above
the glass during the night, which should be removed in the morning.
All leaves from trees, &c., should be collected in a pit for manure,
•ree from sticks or stones, and the whole garden put into order for
:he    frost.
