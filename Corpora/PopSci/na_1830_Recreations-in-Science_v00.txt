                    PREFACE.
A collection of curious facts in Nature and Art,
whether discovered by accident, or the result of
philosophical investigation, has always been deemed
information of the highest value and importance ;
an acquaintance with facts constitutes useful know
ledge, since they never can mislead, however sys
 tems and treatises founded upon them may differ in
 their conclusions. Without being acquainted with
 the materials from whence theories are constructed,
  .we may be imposed upon by the misconceptions of
  others, and the results of our studies will then be
  unproductive of solid benefit. The importance of
  drawing conclusions from observations on facts has
  long been universally admitted ; and acted upon, in
  the adoption of the Baconian, and the rejection of
  the Aristotelian methods, of investigating nature.
     Numerous phenomena are from time to time dis
  covered, many of which are regarded for centuries
                           b

merely as matter of curiosity or entertainment, be
cause no practical application of their nature has
been invented or thought of. Thus it was with the
loadstone, with which the ancients were acquainted ;
the extraordinary property it possesses of attracting
iron, naturally excited their astonishment and de
light, but it was reserved for their descendants in
after ages to render it subservient, in the mariner's
compass, to traverse the trackless ocean. At the
present time, the discovery of the expansive force
of the liquifiable gases is generally regarded as of
little utility, but it is not improbable that, centuries
hence, our posterity will discover means to manage,
control, and exercise the vast powers of these gases,
 as easily as we now do that of steam, of which the
 ancients were ignorant. Many other discoveries
 recorded in the pages of this volume, apparently of
 trivial importance, may hereafter be rendered sub
 servient to the uses of man.
    This work is, however, by no means confined to
 the explanation or relation of isolated facts; it con
 tains, within its convenient bulk, several hundred
 experiments and processes in the useful arts, a large
 portion of which are easily practised without any
 previous acquaintance with the subjects to which
 they relate, and many of them consist in valuable
 improvements in domestic economy.
    The experiments are also generally calculated to

 give the reader an insight into the various sciences,
 of which they form so many interesting illustrations,
 (especially Chemistry, Hydraulics, Hydrostatics,
 Pneumatics,) and incite him to a prosecution of
those studies, which will afford him lasting enjoy
ment and profit.
   A slight inspection of the volume will convince
the reader, that the object of the writer has been to
condense a great fund of information, of the most
pleasing and valuable kind, into the smallest space,
so as to render it conveniently accessible. The
eminent success which has attended a former work,
executed by the same hands, entitled "A Sequel
to Endless Amusement," is an earnest to the
public, that the present volume, which contains the
most recent discoveries in science and art, will meet
with an equally flattering reception.

             RECREATIONS
                    SCIENCE.
               The Automaton Chess Player.
      The automaton chess-player of Kempelen was
  introduced into England by its inventor in 1783, and
  has recently been exhibited in various parts of England
  and Scotland. The interest which it excited is still
  unailayed; and the public opinion is pretty equally
  divided between the two theories, of its being apiece
  of real machinery, directed by the exhibitor, or a
  piece of ingenious deception, under the controul of an
  internal agent. If the impossibility of a chess-player
  being concealed in the machine had been thoroughly
  established, there would have been no hesitation in
  considering magnetism as the moving power ; but a
  very narrow inspection of the apparatus convinces us
  that there is room for a living being : and while this
  appears to be the case, there is no occasion to call in
  the aid of more complex machinery.
      An ingenious author has demonstrated the truth of
  this opinion ; and has shown how a full-grown man
  may be concealed in the machine, and may take the
  successive positions which arc rendered necessary
  during the preliminary stratagem, as well as during
  the progress of the game. The following description
                             B

  2              RECUSATIONS IN SCIENCE.
  will exhibit the principal arguments which he employs.
  Fig. 1 (in the plate) represent the general appearance
 of the machine. It runs on castors, and is either seen
 on the floor when the doors of the apartment are
 thrown open, or is wheeled into the room at the
 commencement of the exhibition.
      The exhibitor, in order to show the mechanism, as
 he informs the spectators, unlocks the door of the
 chest, which exposes to view a small cupboard, lined
 with black or dark-coloured cloth, and containing
 different pieces of machinery, which seem to occupy
 the whole space. He next opens a door at the back
 of the same cupboard, and holding a lighted candle
at the opening, still further exposes the machinery
 within. The caudle being withdrawn, the back door
is then locked. The drawer (G G, Fig. 1 ) in the front
of the chest is then opened, and a set of chess men, a
 small box of counters, and a cushion for the support
of the automaton's arm, are taken out of it. The
exhibitor now opens the front doors (C C, Fig. 1) of
the large cupboard, and the back door of the same,
and applies a candle, as in the former case. This
cupboard is lined with cloth like the other, but it
contains only a few pieces of machinery. The chest
is now wheeled round, the garments of the figure lifted
up, and the door in the body of the figure, and another
in the thigh, are opened. But it must be observed
that the two side doors at the back are closed.
     The chest is now restored to its former position on
the floor; the doors in front, and the drawer, are
closed and locked ; and the exhibitor, after he has
occupied some time at the back of the chest, in ap
parently adjusting the machinery, removes the pipe
from the hand of the figure, winds up the works, and
the automaton begins to move.
     The eagerness of the exhibitor to display part of
the machinery at one time, and his studied conceal
ment of it at another; the regular and undeviating
node of disclosing the interior of the chest; and the
various facts which have been observed respecting
the winding up of the machine; afford positive proof

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                 3
that the axis turned by the key is quite free and
unconnected either with a spring or a weight, or any
system of machinery.
     But it will be seen that any person well skilled in
the game, and not exceeding the ordinary stature,
may secretly animate the automaton, and imitate the
movements of the chess player, which may be easily
understood by what follows:—
    The drawer (G G, Fig. 1,) when closed does not
reach to the back of the chest, it leaves a space behind
it, about one foot two inches broad, eight inches high,
and three feet eleven inches long. This space is never
exposed to view.
     The small cupboard is divided into two parts by
the door or the screen (I, Fig. 3,) which is moveable
on a hinge, and is so contrived, that when 15 is closed
this screen may be closed also. The machinery (H)
occupies the whole front of the division as far as I ;
the hinder division is nearly empty, and communicates
with the space behind the drawer, the floor of this
division being removed.
     The back of the great cupboard is double, and the
part to which the quadrants, &c. are attached, moves
on a joint at the upper part, and forms, when raised,
an opening between the two cupboards, by carrying
with it part of the partition which is composed of cloth
stretched tight.
     When the trunk of the figure is exposed by lifting
up the dress, it will be seen that a great part of it is
occupied by an inner trunk (N, Fig. 3,) which passes
off towards the back in the form of an arch, and
conceals a portion of the interior from the view of the
spectators. This inner trunk opens to the chest by
an aperture about one foot three inches high by one
foot broad.
     When the false back is raised, the two chambers,
the trunk, and the space behind the drawer, are all
connected together.
     The player may be introduced into the chest by
the sliding pannel (IT, Fig. 3,) at the end. He will
 then elevate the false back of the large cupboard, and

4             RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
assume the position represented by the dotted lines
in Fig. 2. Every thing being thus prepared " the
charm 's wound up," and the exhibitor may begin his
operations by opening the door A. From the crowded
and very ingenious disposition of the machinery in
this cupboard, the eye is unable to penetrate far
beyond the opening, and the spectator is led to con
clude that the whole space is occupied by a similar
apparatus. This illusion is strengthened and confirmed
by observing the glimmering light which plays among
the intricacies of the machinery, and occasionally
meets the eye when the lighted candle is held at the
back door. A fact, too, is ascertained, which is
equally satisfactory, though for opposite reasons, to
the spectator and the exhibitor, viz. that no opaque
body of any magnitude is interposed between the light
and the spectator's eye. The back door must now be
locked, and the screen (I) closed, which being done
at the moment the light is withdrawn, will wholly
escape observation.
     It has been already mentioned, that the back door
from its construction, closes by its own weight; but a-
the player's head will presently be very near it, the
secret would be endangered, if", in turning round the
chest, this door were, by any accident, to fly open;
it becomes necessary, therefore, " to make assurance
 doubly sure," and turn the key. If the circumstance
should be observed, it will, probably, be considered as
 accidental, the keys being immediately wanted for the
 other locks.
     The back door being once secured, and the screen
 closed, the success of the experiment maybe deemed
 complete. The secret is no longer exposed to hazard;
 and the exhibitor is at liberty to shape his conduct in
 any way he may think most likely to secure the confi
 dence of the spectators, and lead them insensibly from
 the main object of pursuit. The door (A) may safely
 be left open ; this will tend to confirm the opinion,
 which the spectators probably formed on viewing the
  candle through this cupboard, that no person was
  concealed within : it will further assure them that

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                  5
nothing can pass in the interior without their know
ledge, so long as this door continues open.
     The drawer stands next in the order of succession :
it is opened, apparently, for the purpose of taking out
the chess men, cushion, &c. but realty to allow time
for the player to change his position, and to replace
the false back and partition preparatory to the opening
of the great cupboard.
    The chest may now be wheeled round for the
purpose of showing the trunk of the figure ; leaving,
however, the front doors of the great chamber open.
The bunch of keys, too, should be suffered to remain
in one of the side doors at the back ; for the apparent
carelessness of such a proceeding will serve to allay
any suspicion which the locking the other side back
door might have excited, more especially as the two
doors resemble one another in point of construction.
     When the drapery has been lifted up, and the
doors in the trunk and thigh opened, the chest may
be returned to its former situation, and the doors be
closed. In the mean time the player should withdraw
his legs from behind the drawer, as he will not so
easily effect this movement after the drawer has been
pushed in.
     When the doors in front have been closed, the
exhibitor may occupy as much time as he finds neces
sary in apparently adjusting the machinery at the
back, whilst the player is taking the position described
at Fig. 4. In this position he will find no difficulty in
executing every movement required of the automaton :
his head being above the table, he will see the chess
board through the waistcoat as easily as through a veil ;
and his left hand extending beyond the elbow of the
figure, he will be enabled to guide its band to any part
of the board, and to take up and let go a chess man
with a string communicating with the finger. His
right hand being within the chest, may serve to keep
in motion the contrivance for producing the noise
which is heard during the moves, and to perform the
other tricks of moving the head, tapping on the chest,
te.

6              KECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
     In order to facilitate the introduction ofthe player's
left arm into the arm of the figure, the latter is obliged
to be drawn backwards ; and to account for and con
ceal this strained attitude, a pipe is ingeniously placed
in the automaton's hand. This pipe must not be
removed till the other arrangements are completed.
     When all is ready, and the pipe removed, the
exhibitor may turn round the winder, to give the

    The above process is simple, feasible, and effective;
showing, indisputably, that the phenomena may be

the concealment of a living agent is effected.
      Method of taking Casts of Leaves and Foliage.
    Mr. Deeble's object in making casts from the
natural leaves, was to supply himself with fac-similes
of the form and texture of those plants which, as an
engraver, he might have to introduce into the fore
ground of landscapes. Artists are not always so
circumstanced, that they can go out and study in the.
fields : and the plant he may wish to copy may not be
in season when he needs it. These considerations led
to the following process for obtaining fac-similes.
    The leaf, as soon as convenient after being gathered,
is to be laid on a fine-grained moist sand in a perfectly
natural position, having that surface uppermost which
is to form the cast, and being banked up by sand, in
order that it may be perfectly supported. It is then,
by means of a broad camel-hair brush, to be covered
over with a thin coating of wax and Burgundy pitch,
rendered fluid by heat. The leaf being now removed
from the sand, and dipped in cold water, the wax
becomes hard, and at the same time sufficiently tongh

to allow the leaf to be ripped off without altering its
form. This being done, the wax mould is placed on
moist Band, and banked up as the leaf itself was; it
is then covered with plaster of Paris made thin, care
being taken that the plaster is accurately forced into
all the interstices of the mould by means of a camel-
bair brush. As soon as the plaster has set, the warmth
thus produced softens the wax, which in consequence
of the moisture of the plaster, is prevented from
adhering thereto, and with a little dexterity it may
be rolled up, parting completely from the cast, without
injuring it in the smallest degree.
     Casts thus obtained are very perfect, have a
high relief, and are excellent models either for the
draughtsman, or for the moulder of architectural
ornaments.

 or card, as a substitute for the magnesian lime stone
 usually employed. This card is covered on one or
 both faces with an argillo-calcareous mixture, which
 has the property of receiving the ink or the crayon in
 the same way that the stone does, and of undergoing
the ordinary preparation, and furnishing impressions
as neat and perfect as those obtained from designs

                   Preparation of Quills.
     A boiler is to be about one-fourth part filled with

position over the surface of the water, with their tails
downwards, so the extremity of the tail is not below
the surface of the water. The boiler is then to be
close covered, and kept boiling four hours. The next
day, having cleared the quills of roughness, and
rubbed them with a piece of woollen cloth, let them
be exposed to a moderate degree of heat, and on the
following day they will be found hard and transparent,
and without the defect of splitting too freely.

    This beautiful black varnish, celebrated for its lustre
and durability, is prepared in the following manner :
the nuts of the Semacarpus Anacardium, and the berries
of the Holigarna longifolia, having been steeped a
month in clear water, are cut transversely and pressed
in a mill. The expressed juice is kept for several
months, and the scum taken off from time to time.
The liquor is then decanted, and two parts of the
Semacarpus are added to one part of the Holigarna.
The varnish is laid on like paint, and is polished by
rubbing it when dry, with an agate or smooth pebble.

           Manufacture of Cat-gut Strings.
    The cat-gut strings used for harps and violins, are
manufactured in Whitechapel, &c. of the peritoneal
covering of the intestines of the sheep ; but have
always been considered inferior to those exported from
Italy. Dr. Mac Culloch ascribes this superiority to
the leanness of the Italian sheep :—it is known, that
the membranes of lean animals are stronger than those
of fat ones; and he suggests, that the cat-gut should
be manufactured from the Welch, Highland, or South
down breeds, in preference to those which, like the
Lincoln, are prone to excessive accumulations of fat,
    Delicate Instrument for ascertaining the State of
                    the Atmosphere.
    A portion of the oat-beard cemented to a piece of
paper makes a valuable instrument for this purpose.
As the oat-beard untwists with moisture, the index
(made of straw) mpves the same way round as the
hand of a watch, and thus moving, coils the string
round the straw tube or axis, by which means the
number of revolutious from any time observed may
be known, and thus the confusion will be avoided,
which is occasioned by the index moving more than
once round, which it does in passing from extreme
dryness to wet.
    The spring may be so placed as to wind up when
the index moves the contrary way, that is, from moist
to dry, if the maker so chuses; and in this case the
circle must be numbered the contrary way from the
above. The oat-beard is fixed, and the index is not
to be turned or set to a certain point, as is the case
with the common hygrometer, by a contrivance behind
the case. The method of keeping a register of this
hygrometer will be thus :—
    When on the upper part of the axis there is one
coil, and the index points at 6, set down 1—6,
two coils,                      6,            2—6, S—

       Method of making the Iris Metal Ornaments.
     Mr. Barton, of the Mint, a gentleman well known
 for his ingenuity and his mechanical attainments, has
 recently conceived the happy idea of ornamenting
 steel and other articles with the colours of sti in ted
 surfaces, and has secured, by patent, the exclusive
 privilege of applying this principle to practical pur
 poses. The excellence of Mr. Barton's engine has,
 no doubt, enabled him to execute this kind of work
 with a beauty and precision which no other person
 can hope to imitate ; its merits depend chiefly on the
 beauty and correctness of the screw. The plate in
 the screw is not divided higher than the two hun
 dredth part of an inch; but Mr. Barton has drawn
 divisions on steel and glass so minute as the ten thou
 sandth part of an inch. In drawing lines of two
thousand in an inch, Mr. Barton often leaves out one
line intentionally ; and one of the greatest proofs of
the stability of the engine is, that after having taken
it off the brass table with the work upon it (when the
omission is distinctly perceived), he can restore it to
its place, and introduce the line, without its being dis
tinguishable from the rest.
     In applying the principle of striated colours to
ornament steel, the effect or pattern is produced
upon the polished surface by the point of a diamond,
so that either the whole or a part of the surface is
covered with lines or grooves, whose distance may
vary from the thousandth to the ten thousandth of an
inch. When these lines are most distant, the pris
matic images of the candle, or any luminous body
seen by reflection from the poUshed surface, are
nearest one another, and the common colourless
image ; and when the lines are least distant the co
loured images are farthest from one another, and
the colours are most vivid.
    In daylight the colours produced by these minute
grooves are scarcely distinguishable, unless at the
boundary between a dark and a luminous object;
and we conceive that their brilliancy will be very

12            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
 much impaired, even with artificial lights, when they
are dispersed by the interposition of globes, or
hemispheres of ground glass.
     In sharp lights, however, and particularly in that
of the sun, the colours shine with extraordinary bril
liancy, and the play of tints which accompany every
luminous image can only be equalled by their match
less exhibition in the reflections of the diamond.
The surface of fine steel, therefore, when grooved
by a skilful hand, is peculiarly fitted for imitative
jewels and other articles of female dress, and we
have no doubt that it will find an application to many
other purposes both of use and ornament.
     The divisions which Mr. Barton most commonly
uses for his metal ornaments are two thousand to an
inch; but, when the material is good, his engine
enables him to divide to five thousand and ten thou
sand. When the lines, however, are so close, the
labour is very great; but the beauty of the work is
generally a compensation for the time bestowed upon
it, as the strength of the colour increases with the
number of lines. The, depth of the line has a great
effect in producing brilliancy, owing to the increase
in the quantity of reflected light ; and the depth
may be in some measure judged of by the faintness
of the reflected image of the eye, when looking per
 pendicularly at the steel, until, at last, by totally
 removing; the original surface, in consequence of the
 edges of the cut meeting, the whole surface looks
 black, and the eye. is no longer seen.

gradually becomes milky and opake, and a white
 powder becomes deposited. When the action has
 nearly ceased, and the mixture acquired consistency,
add gradually water to it to suspend the further
action. Then wash the white precipitate by repeated
effusions of cold water, and suffer it to dry in the
open air, in a dark place, or secluded from the light,
by covering it with a few sheets of paper.
    This compound requires the utmost care ; it should
never be included in a phial, nor should it be touched
or handled in any way that can produce a consider
able friction; it explodes whilst wet, or under a
fluid, when touched with a glass rod ; it explodes
also when touched with a glass rod moistened with
sulphuric acid. A grain or two applied to a piece of
paper, and made to approach a candle, explodes
with extreme violence.
    This celebrated compound arrests the attention of
the curious in the form of various toys, called ful
minating balls, bombs, &c., which explode when
suffered to fall on the ground. Fulminating balls are
hollow, small globules of very thin glass rather larger
than a pea, containing a grain or two of fulminating
silver. The best method of exploding them is to
crush them under the heel of the foot. They are
prepared as follows : —Introduce one or two grains of
fulminating silver into a hollow glass globule, and
secure it by pasting over the opening or neck of the
globule a piece of soft paper, which should also be
extended over the whole ball so as to cover it com
pletely. Fulminating bombs are balls the size of a
hazel-nut, containing about three grains of fulminat
ing silver. They should never be exploded by crush'
ing them under the heel of the foot, because their
explosive effect is prodigiously violent.

dually bring the paper thus formed to that distance
from a candle at which it will begin to take fire. In
this case a beautiful blue flame may be seen hanging,

air upon all parts of it becomes white, though the
edges still continue of a blue or violet colour.

     Solid mercury possesses an evident degree of mal
leability, as it can be flattened with a hammer ; it is
somewhat flexible, and may be extended without
breaking; it is not possible to estimate its ductility.
Its hardness, when thus near to its melting point,
docs not appear to be considerable. In congealing it
assumes a crystalline structure and form. In its
structure it presents the appearance of striae diverg
ing from different centres ; and when the liquid part
is withdrawn from a quantity partially congealed,
small octahedral crystals are discoverable.
     If the congealation of mercury is wanted to be
exhibited in a miniature process, the readiest way is
to throw a little of the metal loose into a pretty large
mass of a freezing mixture, composed of snow aud
muriate of lime, where it will congeal in a few
minutes. It is of importance that the snow should
remain without doors till the moment that it is wanted,
and the whole of the muriate should be kept cold, by
Immersing in snow or iced water the vessel that con
tains it.
      Great caution should be used in touching frozen
mercury; it gives an immediate sensation like a
wound from a rough-edged instrument, or as if the
 finger was squeezed in a vice, and the mere sensation
 can hardly be distinguished from the burn of a red-
 hot iron. The part in contact immediately becomes
quite white and numb; and there is no doubt, that if
 it were to remain a very little time in contact with
 the frozen metal, a local gangrene, like that of a
 common frost-bitten limb, would come on. It is re
 moved, by rubbing the part a little time with snow.

occasioned by vinous liquors on litmus paper is owing
to the presence of tartaric, malic, or acetic acid.
    Paper, stained with the juice of the violet flower,
or the scrapings of purple radishes, answers the same
purpose.
    The colour of litmus paper ought to be a pale,
not a dark violet hue. This paper, when long ex
posed to the contact of air and light, loses its colour,
and then becomes unfit for use ; it should, therefore,
be preserved in opake-stopped bottles, or placed be
tween the leaves of a book.

portion of glue, alum, and other foreign matters,
which all writing-paper contains, and this may be
done by a repeated effusion of distilled water.

       The Eye described as an Optical Instrument.
     The eye is of a globular form, and composed of
 three coats or teguments, one covering the other.
 The external coat or case, which forms the globe of
 the eye, is at the back part strong and opake ; the
fore part is thin and transparent, so as to admit rea
 dily the rays of light, and it is therefore called the
 cornea, from its resemblance to polished horn. It
 encloses three pellucid matters called the humours,
 which are of different densities. That in the ante
rior part, immediately under the cornea, is called
the aqueous humour ; that immediately behind is the
crystalline humour, which is a double convex lens of
great refracting power ; and the rest of the eye is
rilled with a jelly-like substance called the vitreous
humour. The iris, which is the coloured part of the
eye, is an opake membrane, which is perforated by
a small hole, the pupil through which the rays of
Jight must pass to the crystalline humour. The optic
nerve enters at the under part, and is spread all over
the interior surface, at the back of the eye, in the
form of a fine net-work, and therefore is called the
retina. Thus, it will be seen, that the eye is alto
gether calculated to act as a convex lens of strong
refractive powers.
     From every luminous point of a visible object
cones or pencils of light are limited, or reflected in
every direction ; but to produce vision, it is necessary
that they should be concentrated or converged to
such a point as to make a forcible impression on the
retina, /fhus, from the luminous body A, Fig. 5. the
rays rrr are sent in various directions. Those which
fall upon the transparent cornea C C, are there
refracted in such a manner as to enter the pupil at
p, and in passing the crystalline lens or humour they
suffer a second refraction, and are converged to a
point or focus at the point a on the retina. Now, it
is evident, that if the rays could have passed the
humours of the eye in their natural direction, that
                           c 2

18             RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
is, in the direction of the cone or pyramid C, A, C,
they would have made upon the retina a very exten
sive but feeble impression, such as we know by
experience could not produce distinct vision. To
obviate this, by the force of the refraction which
they suffer in the eye, they form another cone
opposed to the first at its base, and the apex of
which is at a, and thus an impression sufficiently
forcible to produce distinct vision is made on the
 retina.
     We may verify by experiment what has been said
of the cause of vision, by taking the eye of an ox
recently killed, and dexterously removing the pos
 terior coats to the vitreous humour ; and if a piece of
 white paper is then placed at the part, the image of
 any bright object which is placed before the eye will
 be seen distinctly painted on the paper, but in an
 inverted position.
     Artificial eyes are sold at the opticians, in which
 all the humours are made of different kinds of glass,
 and may be separated at pleasure. At the back
 part, where the retina is supposed in the natural eye
 to receive the converged rays, is placed a piece of
ground glass, where the image from the opposed
objects is represented in an inverted position, as in a
camera-obscura.
                     The Kaleidoscope.
     The principal parts of the kaleidoscope are two
 reflecting planes made of glass or metal, or any other
 reflecting substance, ground perfectly flat, and highly
 polished. These reflectors may have any magnitude,
 but, in general, they should be from four or five to
 ten or twelve inches long, their greatest breadth
being about an inch when the length is six inches,
 and increasing in proportion as the length increases.
 When these two plates are put together at an angle
 of 00°, or the sixth part of a circle, and the eye
 placed at the narrow end, it will observe the opening
 multiplied six times, and arranged round the centre.

    On the Selection of Objectsfor the Kaleidoscope.
    Although the kaleidoscope is capable of creating
beautiful forms from the most ugly and shapeless
objects, yet the combinations which it presents, when
obtained from certain forms and colours, are so
superior to those which it produces from others, that
no idea can be formed of the power and effects of
the instrument unless the objects are judiciously se
lected.
    The objects which give the finest outlines by
inversion, are those which have a curvilineal form,
such as circles, ellipses, looped curves like the figure
8, curves like the figure 3 and the letter S ; spirals
and other forms, such as squares, rectangles, and
triangles, may be applied with advantage. Glass,
both spun and twisted, and of all colours and shades
of colours, should be formed into the preceding
shapes; and when these are mixed with pieces of
flat-coloured glass, blue vitriol, native sulphur, yel
low orpiment, differently coloured fluids enclosed
and moving in small vessels of glass, &c, they will
make the finest transparent objects for the kalei
doscope. When the objects are to be laid upon a
mirror plate, fragments of opaquely-coloured glass
should be added to the transparent fragments, along
with pieces of brass wire, of coloured foils, and
grains of spelter. In selecting transparent objects,
the greatest care must be taken to reject fragments
of opaque glass, and dark colours that do not trans
mit much light, and all pieces of spun glass or co
loured plates should be as thin as possible.
                     Magic Squares.

 cells, each in its cell,—if, then, you change the order
 of these numbers, and dispose them in the cells in
 such a manner, as that the five numbers which fill an
 horizontal rank of cells being added together, shall
 make the same sum with the five numbers on any
 other rank of cells, whether horizontal or vertical,
 and even the same number with the five in each of
 the two diagonal ranks : this disposition of numbers
 is called a magic square, in opposition to the former
disposition, which is called a natural square.

the one side take the first seven numbers, beginning
with unity, and ending with the root 7, and on the
other 7 and all its multiples to 49 exclusively; and as
these only make six numbers, add 8, which makes
this an arithmetical progression of seven terms as
well as the other, o, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42. This
done with the first progression repeated, fill the
square of the root 7 magically: in order to do this,
write in the first seven cells of the first horizontal
rank the seven numbers proposed, in what order you

please, tor that is perfectly Indifferent; and K is
proper to observe here, that those seven numbers
may be ranged in 5040 different manners in the same
rank. The order in which they are placed in the first
horizontal rank, be it what it will, is that which
determines their order in all the rest. For the
second horizontal rank, place in its first cell either
the third, the fourth, the fifth, or the sixth number,
from the first number of the first rank, and after that
write the six others in order as they follow. For the
third horizontal rank, observe the same method with
regard to the second that you observed in the second
with regard to the first, and so of the rest. For in
stance, suppose the first horizontal rank filled with
the seven numbers in their natural order, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, the second horizontal rank may either com
mence with 3, with 4, with 5, or with 6, but in this
it commences with 3.

    The third rank therefore must commence with 5,
 the fourth with 7, the fifth with 2, the sixth with 4,
 and the seventh with 6. The commencement of the
 ranks which follow the first being thus determined,
 the other numbers, as we have already observed,
 must be written down in the order wherein they
 stand in the first, going on to 5, 6, and 7, and re
 turning to 1, 2, &c., till every number in the first

  to the order arbitrarily pitched upon at first. By
  this means, it is evident, that no number whatever
  can be repeated twice in the same rank ; and, by
  consequence, that the seven numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
  6, 7, being in each rank, must, of necessity, make
  the same sum.

 and the pressure upon the plate is adjusted by
 screws which pass through the opposite pieces. A
 brass conductor, supported by a glass arm, is fixed
 to one pillar, or in large ones to the bottom of the
 frame of the machine, carrying two branches ex
 panding beyond the periphery of the plate. The
 extremities of the conductors are furnished with
 points in order to collect the electricity from the

              To strike Gold Leaf into Glass.
     Take two slips of common window glass, each
 about an inch broad, and four inches long, then take
 a slip of gold or silver leaf about the breadth of a
 straw, and six inches in length, and put it between
 the glasses lengthwise in the middle, letting the ends
of the leaf hang down an inch without the glasses at
each end. Tie the glasses close together by wrapping a
strong silk thread round them, and lay them down
on the table, so that one end of the metal leaf may
be in contact with the coating at the bottom of ajar,
placed so that it may be charged at the prime con
ductor. Then charge the jar, and having put one
end of the discharge upon that part of the leaf that
lies without the glass slips at the farthest end from
the jar, apply the other end of the discharger to the
ball on the top of the jar-wire, and all the fire in the
jar will be discharged through the metal leaf. If the
slips of glass remain whole, you will see that the
leaf is missing in several places, and instead of it a
metallic stain upon both the glasses exactly alike.
When they are taken asunder, you will observe that
the leaf has been melted by the electric lightning,
and actually driven into the very substance of the
glass, as neither aquafortis nor aqua regia will take
it off.

To freeze Water in Summer without the Application

     Take eleven drachms of muriate of ammonia, ten
of nitrate of potash, and sixteen of sulphate of soda,
reduce each of these salts separately to a fine pow
der, and mix them gradually in a glass vessel, or thin
metal is better, with five ounces of water (the capa
city of the vessel should be just only large enough to
 hold the materials), the result will be, that as the
 salts dissolve cold will be produced, and a thermo
 meter* immersed in the mixture will sink at or below
 freezing. A little water, about half an ounce, in a

        To prevent the Fracture of Lamp Glasses.
     The glass chimneys which are now in such exten
sive use not only for oil lamps, but also for the burners
of oil and coke gas, very frequently break, and not
only expose to danger those who are near them, but
occasion much expense and inconvenience, parti
cularly to those who are resident in the country.
The bursting of these glasses very often arises from
knots in the glass, where it is less perfectly an
nealed, and also from an inequality of thickness at
their lower end, which prevents them expanding
uniformly by heat. The best method of detecting
the knots is to examine the glasses by polarized light,
and reject those that exhibit at the knots the depo
larized tints. The evil arising from inequality of
thickness may be cured by making a cut with a
diamond in the bottom of the tube ; and it is worthy
of remark, that in establishments where six lamps
are lighted every day, and where this precaution
was taken, there was not a single glass broken for
nine years.

crystallization was observed by M. Buchner, during
the sublimation of benzoic acid, previously mixed
with pulverized carbon. The sublimation was carried
on in a tall glass cylinder upon a stove, and when it
had well begun, there appeared an uninterrupted
succession of sparks continuing for half an hour, and
which ceased only when the cylinder was removed
from the stove.

             Beautiful Chemical Experiments.
     1. Drop gradually small pieces of carbonate of
 ammonia (strong smelling salts) into a goblet contain
 ing nitric acid, slightly diluted with water, as long
 as any effervescence continues ; pour the solution
 into a china saucer, and place it near the fire (free
 from dust) till a considerable part of the liquid be
 evaporated, then remove it into a cool place, and
 beautiful needle-like crystals will be formed.
      2. Take an ounce of saturated solution of car
 bonate of soda, and add to it half an ounce of sul
 phuric acid, set it aside, and in a short time crystals
 of sulphate of soda will be produced.
      3. Moisten the interior of a tumbler-glass with
 a large feather previously dipped in muriatic acid,
  and also moisten the inside of another tumbler with
 liquid ammonia; bring the months of the glasses
  together, and the two gases (previously invisible)
  will unite, producing white fumes, which will deposit
  themselves in a crystalline form on the sides of the
  glass.
       4. Dissolve a portion of sub-carbonate of potash
  in a glass containing water, and add to it nitric acid
  as long as any effervescence continues; then pour
  the liquid into a saucer, and place it near the fire till
  a portion of the water is evaporated : remove it into
   a cool place, and hexahedral prismatic crystals will
   be formed.
       5. Evaporate any quantity of milk-whey to the
   consistence of honey, and suffer it to cool. Dissolve
   the mass in water, and clarify it by the addition of
   the white of eggs. Filter and evaporate it to the
   coasistence of syrup: when cool, beautiful white
   crystals will be deposited.
        6. Dissolve three quarters of an ounce of sulphate

               HECHKATIONS IN SCIENCE.               20
of soda in one ounce of boiling water; pour the solu
tion while hot into a phial, and cork it close : when
perfectly cool the mixture will still be fluid ; but by
removal of the cork crystallization will commence,
and proceed with great rapidity.
    If the above effect does not immediately take place
on the removal of the cork, drop into it a crystal of
the salt, and the effect will instantaneously be pro
duced.
                        Remarks.
    When the laws of crystallization are allowed to
perform their functions uncontrolled, the beautiful
geometrical forms which they create are marked with
the most perfect regularity. Even their physical
properties are symmetrically related to some axis or
fixed line ; and though all their functions are per
formed in utter silence and repose, yet their phy
siology, if we may apply that name to the actions of
apparently dead matter, is not less wonderful than
that which embraces the busy agencies of animal and
vegetable bodies.
                Preservation of Crystals.
    It is sometimes an object to preserve good crystals
of salts, especially with those who are attentive to
the study of crystallography. In attaining this end,
much assistance may be derived from the use of
sweet oil. Many crystals which change, and become
dull by exposure to air, as alum, sulphate of copper,
sulphate of iron, prussiate of potash, &c., if slightly
oiled, do not then alter in a long time ; and many
efflorescent substances are prevented changing by
the same means. Even crystals of Glauber's salt
may be exposed to the air for weeks.

               Magnetic Perspective Glass.
      Provide an ivory tube about two inches and a
half long, and of the form expressed at Figs. 7 and
8. The side of this tube must be thin enough to
 admit a considerable quantity of light. It is to open
 at one end with a screw, at which end there must be
 placed an eye-glass of about two inches focus, and
 at- the other end any glass you please. Have a small
 magnetic needle like that placed on a compass ; it
 must be strongly touched, and so placed at the bot
 tom of the tube that it may turn freely round. It is
 to be fixed on the centre of a small ivory circle C, of
 the thickness of a counter, which is placed on the
 object-glass D, and painted black on the side next it.
 This circle must be kept fast by a circular rim of
 pasteboard, that the needle may not rise off its pivot
 after the same manner as in the compass : this tube
 will thus become a compass sufficiently transparent
 to show the motions of the needle. The eye-glass
 serves more clearly to distinguish the direction of the
 needle, and the glass at the other end merely to give
 the tube the appearance of a common perspective.
 The needle in this tube when placed over, and at a
 small distance from a magnet, or any machine in

which it is contained, will necessarily place Itself in
a position directed by that magnet, and, consequently,
show where the north and south pole of it is placed,
the north end of the needle constantly pointing to
the south end of the magnet. You must observe , how
ever, that the attracting power must not be very far
distant from the needle, especially if it be small, as
in that case its influence extends but to a short dis
tance. This tube may be differently constructed, by
placing the needle in a perpendicular direction on a
small axis of iron, on which it must turn quite freely,
between two plates of brass placed on each side the
tube : the two ends of the needle should be in exact
equilibrium.
                  Communicative Money.
    Take a crown-piece, and bore a hole In the side
of it, in which place a large needle strongly touched
with a magnet, then close the hole with a small piece
of pewter that it may not be perceived. Now, the
needle in the " magnetic perspective " in the above
article, when it is brought near to this piece of
money, will fix itself in a direction correspondent to
the needle in that piece. Desire any person to lend
you a crown-piece, which you dexterously change for
one that yon have prepared as above, which give to
another person, and leave him at liberty either to
put it privately in a snuff-box or not ; he is then to
place the box on a table, and you are to tell him, by
means of your glass, if the crown is in the box or
not. Then bringing your perspective close to the
box, you will know, by the motion of the needle,
whether it be there or not ; for, as the needle in the
perspective will always keep to the north of itself,
if you do not perceive it has any motion, you may
conclude the crown is not in the box. It may hap
pen, however, that the wire in the crown may be
placed to the north, in which case you will be de
ceived. Therefore, to be sure of success, when you

certainly know if the crown-piece be there or not.

                   Barometric Changes.
     The mercury in the barometer is seldom to he
 seen lower than 28 inches, or higher than 3G£; it
 indicates as follows :—

28                        Stormy weather.
     In January, 1822, the mercury fell to 28-10,
which was said to have been the lowest eTer re
marked in England. By the fall, a pressure equal to
2000 lbs. was removed from each person's body, yet
probably no individual was at the time conscious of
it. The maximum height of the mercurial column is
about nine o'clock A.M., the mean at twelve, and
the minimum at three P.M. If the column rise from
nine A.M. to three P.M. it indicates fine weather ;
if it fall during that interval rain may be expected.

                  Exposition of a Paradox.
      It is a vulgar paradox, " that when water is boil-
  ng in a vessel the bottom is cool, but the moment it
 ceases to boil the bottom becomes hotter." The whole
 of the paradox appears to be founded on an error of
 sense. When a person applies his finger to the ves
 sel, though he applies it for a considerable time, it
 is not heated more than he can endure, for the blood
 in the course of its circulation loses some of its heat
 before it arrives at the extremities ; and till the blood

               IlECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                37
in the extremities is heated to the same degree with
that of the heart we feel no pain from burning, but
as soon as this is effected the least degree of heat
becomes painful. When the finger is first applied to
the bottom of the vessel, after it is taken off the fire,
the heat is endured for these reasons. When the
boiling ceases, it is natural to take the same finger
(for, having dirtied one, people seldom choose to
 take another), and that finger being already heated
 almost as much as it could bear, now finds the heat at
 the bottom of the vessel exquisitely painful.
                The Intermitting Fountain.
      The following account gives the construction of
 the intermitting fountain, Fig 9.
      A B C is a globe of glass (or if any other sub
 stance) pierced with several holes, to which are
 adapted the little tubes n, o, r, s, and traversed in
 the direction of its vertical axis by a tube C Z, whose
 upper part i is raised to within a small distance of
  the summit e, and whose lower part is fitted exactly
  into the hollow cylinder S D, fixed at the bottom of
  a cistern M T. The lower part of this cylinder is
  hollowed laterally atw, so that there is a free com
  munication between the air contained in the vessel
  ABC, and the exterior air. The cistern MT is
  pierced with a little hole, by means of which it com
  municates with a reservoir K. placed below it. When
  we would make use of this fountain, we must take
  the tube C Z from the cylinder S D, and then invert
  it in order to pour through it water into the vessel
  ABC, until the latter is full. The tube is then to
  be turned again, and replaced in the cylinder S D :
  at this moment the exterior air which enters freely
  by the cavity u, will exert its pressure upon the sur~
  face a b of the liquid ; it will also act with a force,
   equal as to sense, upon the water which tends to
   spout forth from the tubes it, o, r, s, in such manner,

38             RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
that in this respect the water is in equilibrium be
tween the two forces of the air; it will therefore
flow from the little tubes in virtue of its proper
weight. In proportion as this water falls into the
cistern M T, a part will pass through the hole with
which its bottom is pierced ; but, as it receives more
than it thus loses, there will be a term when the
cavity u will be so stopped up with water that the air
can no longer enter into the vessel ABC. Never
theless, the water will continue to run out for a short
interval, while the interior air dilates itself, and its
spring becomes so weakened that this force, together
with the weight of the water, are in equilibrio with
the pressure of the air at the orifices of the tubes
n, o, r, s; then will the discharge, which is made by
these tubes, stop at once. But the cistern M T con
tinuing to empty itself, it will soon happen that the
cavity u becomes open again, and that the air is
again introduced into the vessel ABC, so that the
little tubes will recommence their delivery of water.
The fountain will thus flow and cease alternately,
until the vessel which furnishes the water is emptied.
To cause a Green Lambent Flame to appear and alter
        nately disappear at the Mouth of a Flask.
    Put a few pieces of phosphorus of the size of a
bean into a Florence flask half filled with water,
and make the water boil over a lamp : when the
water has boiled for a few minutes, the empty part
of the flask becomes filled with dense white vapours;
and when the ebullition is suffered to go on, the
fumes gradually disappear, and a lambent green
flame makes its appearance with an undulatory
motion at the orifice of the flask, and continues as
long as the water is kept boiling. W hen the lamp is
withdrawn the phosphorescent flame gradually rushes
down, and the intemal surface of the vessel exhibits,
in a dark place, illuminated clouds rolling over each

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                39
other. When the heat is again applied to the flask
the flame re-appears, and again vanishes, and de
scends into the body of the vessel the moment the
water ceases to boil ; and these appearances may be
repeated as long as any water is left in the flask.
                Curious change of Colour.
     Put into an onnce phial a slip of copper scraped
bright, All up the phial with liquid ammonia, and
cork it air-tight. No apparent change will take
place ; but if the bottle be left open for some hours,
and then be closed, a solution of the colour is
effected, which is absolutely colourless, and turns
blue on re-opening the bottle, beginning at the sur
face, and gradually extending downwards through
the mass. Again, if this blue solution has not been
too long exposed to the air, and fresh pieces of
copper be put in. stopping the bottle again, the
solution is deprived of all its tinge, and recovers its
colour by the admission of air ; and this effect may
be produced repeatedly.
 To shew that Water is contained in the Atmosphere in

 it in a saucer, and suffer it to be exposed to the open
 air for a few days, the dry salt will thus be rendered
 completely liquid, by the watery vapour which al
 ways exists in the atmosphere.

         Effect of the Friction of Silk oh Glass.
     The effect of long-continued action, Where the
impression in any single instant of time is altogether
inappreciable, is nowhere more clearly illustrated
than in the machinery for winding silk in silk mills.
To change the direction of the threads, they are
made to pass over the polished surface of a rod of
glass, and, though the softness of silk be proverbial,
it appears, that the constant sliding of a line thread
of it over the surface of a glass rod in process of
time wears even that hard body into perceptible
furrows ; while we observe this effect, its illustration
of the minute divisibility of matter appears very
striking. What must be the magnitude of the par
ticles removed at once, when the continued action of
 ten hours per day, for half a year, produces a furrow
 not exceeding one ten thousandth part of a square

   To shew that the White of Eggs cotitain an Alkali.
     Add to half a wine-glass full of tincture of red
 cabbage a small quantity of the white of an eg;

 be changed to green, because the white of the egg
 contains soda.
 To change a Blue Fluid to Red by the Air respiredfrom
                        the Lungs.
     Add to two tea-spoons-full of water (in a wine
glass) a sufficient quantity of tincture of cabbage to
tinge it very slightly blue, and blow through the
coloured water the breath from the lungs by means
of a qvill or tobacco-pipe dipping into the fluid. The
bubbles of air expired whilst passing through the
water will speedily produce the reddening effect,
because the air respired from the lungs contains car
bonic acid.
          Preparation of Tincture of Cabbage.
     Tincture of cabbage is very liable to spoil; it
soon undergoes a kind of putrefaction which destroys
its colour. It is obtained by cutting fiesli leaves of
the red cabbage into small pieces, and pouring over
it boiling hot distilled water, and suffering the whole
to macerate for a few hours. The clean fluid being
then decanted, and mixed with one-eighth of its bulk
•f spirit of wine, is fit for use.

42                RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
     The cabbage leaves may be preserved for many
years, by drying them in a warm place, at a tem
perature of about 120° F., having previously cut
them into small pieces.
      To prepare the test liquor from the dry leaves,
let them be digested in distilled water, to which
a minute portion of sulphuric acid has been added,
which will produce a red tincture; then let the acid
be neutralized by marble powder, the red colour
 will vanish, and the tincture become blue. This
 being done, suffer the mixture to become clear by
subsidence, or filter it; and, lastly, mingle it with
 one-eighth of its bulk of spirit of wine.
           Expansive Force of Freezing Water.
      Colonel E. Williams, of the Royal Artillery, when
  at Quebec, made many experiments on the expan
 sive force of freezing water. He filled all sizes of
 iron bomb-shells with water, then plugged the furze-
 hole close up, and exposed them to the strong freezing
  air of the winter in that climate, sometimes driving
  in the iron pings as hard as possible with a sledge
  hammer ; and yet, though they weighed near three
  pounds, they were always forced out by a sudden
  expansion of the water in the act of freezing, like a
  ball impelled by gunpowder, sometimes to the dis
  tance of between 400 and 500 feet ; and when the
  plugs were screwed in, or furnished with hooks or
  barbs, by which to lay hold of the inside of the
   shell, so that they could not possibly be forced out,
  in that case the shell will always split in two, though
  its thickness of metal was about an inch and three
   quarters. It is farther remarkable, that through the
   circular crack, round about the shells where they
   burst, there stood out a thin film, or sheet of ice
   like a fin ; and in the cases where the plugs were
   projected by freezing water, there suddenly issued
   from the fnrze-hole a bolt of ice of the same diame

              RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                 4S
ter, and stood over it sometimes to the height of eight
inches and a half. Hence, we need not be surprised
that excessive frost should cause the ice to split rocks
and other solid substances.
         Chances of obtaining a Sum of Money.
     Suppose, in order to obtain -£90, two events must
happen, the first of which has three chances to hap

     The probability of the first happening is j, the
probability of the second happening is J, now, these
multiplied, are $ or ^, and this multiplied into the

 of taking the three cards out of the remaining stock
 of thirty-nine deducted from unity, will give the
 answer, being f, : $ : g — 1 zz jm, or nearly nine

 The points called mains are 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, either
 of which he may call before he throws ; and as there
 are several points allotted in the game for the caster

either to win or lose in the first throw, called a nick

diagonal planes with plane mirrors : in the lateral
planes make round holes, through which the eye
may see within the cells of the box. The holes are
to be covered with plain glasses ground within side,
but not polished, to prevent the objects in the cells
from appearing too distinctly. In each cell are to be
placed the different objects whose images are to be

exposing it to dry. If it be wished to throw any
colour on the objects, it may be done by colouring

                  Arithmetical Paradox.
     Two Arabians sat down to dinner, one had five
 loaves, the other three ; a stranger passing by, desired

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                 47
permission to eat with them, which they agreed to :
the stranger dined, laid down eight pieces of money,
and departed ; the proprietor of the five loaves took
up five pieces, and left three for the other, who
objected, and insisted for one half. The cause came
before Ali, (the magistrate,) who gave the following
judgment:—let the owner of the five loaves have
seven pieces of money ; aud the owner of the three
loaves one.-—Query, the justice of this sentence?
      Ali's sentence was just; for, suppose the loaves
to be divided into three equal parts, making twenty-
four equal parts in all the eight loaves, and each per
son to eat an equal or eight parts; therefore, the
 stranger had seven parts of the person who contri
 buted five loaves, or fifteen parts, and only one of him
 who contributed only three loaves, which make nine
 parts.
                     Cheap Hygrometer.

 horizontal board ; to the lower end of the cord is fixed
 a horizontal index, having a circular graduated scale
 on the board. As the cord attracts moisture, or the
 contrary, it twists or untwists, and thereby turns the
 index. On this principle, the Dutch toys, called
 weather-houses, are made ; one end of the index sup
 ports a small image of a man, and the other that of a
 woman ; the former appears, or is brought out in wet
 weather, and the latter in fair weather.

          On Sounds excited in Hydrogen Gas.
     As the intensity of sound is diminished by the
 rarefication of the medium in which it is produced, it
 might have been expected that the sound in hydrogen
 gas would be feebler than when produced in atmos
 pheric air in similar circumstances. Mr. Leslie, how
 ever, has found the difference to be actually much
 greater. Having placed within a receiver of an air-
 pump, a small piece of clock-work, by which a bell
 was struck every half minute, the air was rarefied,
 and after the re- action had been carried the length of
 one hundred times, hydrogen gas was introduced.
 The sound, however, so far from being augmented,
 was, at least, as feeble as in atmospheric air of that
 extreme rarity, and decidedly much feebler than
 when formed in air of its own density, or rarefied ten
 times. Mr. Leslie likewise observed the very curious,
 fact, that the mixture of hydrogen gas with atmos
 pheric air, has a predominant influence in blunting or
 stifling sound. When one half of the volume of

                RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                 49
atmospheric air is extracted, and hydrogen gas ad
mitted to fill up the vacant space, the sound will now
become scarcely audible; an effect which he ascribes
to a want of intimate combination between the gases,
which causes the pulsatory impressions to be dissi
pated before the sound is originally formed.
            Inflation of Rarefied-Air Balloons.
    With regard to the rarefied-air balloons, the me
thod of filling them is by means of a scaffold, the
breadth of which is at least two-thirds of the diameter
of the machine, and elevated about six or eight feet
from the ground. From the middle of it descends
a well, rising about two or three feet above, and
reaching to the ground, furnished with a door, through
which the fire in the well is supplied with fuel. The
well should be constructed of brick, and its diameter
should be somewhat less than that of the machine.
On each side of the scaffold are erected two masts,
each of which is fixed by ropes, and has a pulley at
the top. The machine is to be placed on the scaffold,
with its neck round the aperture of the well. The
rope passing over the pulleys of the two masts, serves
to lift the balloon about fifteen feet above the scaffold ;
and it is kept steady and held down whilst filling, by
ropes passing through loops or holes about its equator.
These ropes may easily be disengaged from tlie ma
chine, by slipping them through the loops when it is
able to sustain itself. The proper combustibles to be
lighted in the well, are those which burn quick and
clear, rather than such as produce much smoke,
because it is hot air and not smoke that is required.
Small wood and chopped straw are very fit for this
purpose. As the current of hot air ascends the ma
chine will dilate, and lift itself above the scaffold and
gallery which was covered by it. The passengers,
fuel, instruments, &c. are then placed in the gallery.
When the machine makes efforts to ascend, its aper
ture must be brought, by means of the ropes annexed

 come into contact with the air : each bubble of gas
 as it explodes, if the air be calm, is succeeded by a
 horizontal ring of dense white smoke, which mounts
 up to the deling with an undulatory motion, and
 gradually enlarges in diameter as it ascends.
      The residue of the phosphuret of lime, when taken
 out of the water and suffered to dry, inflames, by
 pouring on it a little muriatic acid.
      The bottle containing the phosphuret of lime should
 never be left open, for the contact of air soon renders
 it unfit for use.
            The Thaumatrope—an amusing Toy.
      In a round box are contained several cards, eacb
  suspended by a piece of bobbin at either side. There
 is part of a figure or object represented on one side
  of the card, and the remainder on the other. For
  example : we have the head of a watchman on the
  obverse of one, and the empty watch-box on the
  reverse ; by twirling the bobbins, and consequently
  spinning the card, the head and box fit together, and
  we see a complete guardian of the night.
       Then there are some choice jeux d'esprit. There
  is on the obverse of one card a thing like a well-worn

              Cheap and useful Apparatus.
     For many of the experiments mentioned in this
book, useful apparatus may be made with a common
 Florence oil-flask, divided into two parts by means
 of a thread, previously dipped in oil of turpentine,
 tied round the middle and ignited ; the upper part
 will make a good funnel, the other will contain che
 mical ingredients, which may require to be held over

 Easy method of ascertaining the illuminating power of
    Candles, Lamps, or Gas-lights, so as to) ascertain
    the real and comparative value of different kinds of
    lights.
     Fasten a sheet of white paper against the wall of
 a room, and place two lights intended to be compared,
 so that the rays of light from each fall with nearly
 the same angle of incidence upon the middle of the
 paper. In this situation, if a book or other object be
held to intercept part of the light which would have

fallen on the paper, the two shadows may be made
to appear, as at Fig. 33, where A represents the
surface illuminated by one of the lights only ; B the
surface illuminated by the other light; C the perfect
shadow, from which both lights are excluded. It will
easily be understood that the lights abont D and E,
near the angle F, will fall with equal incidences when
the double shadow is made to occupy the middle of
the paper ; and consequently, if one or both of the
lights be removed directly from or towards the paper,
as the appearances may require ; until the two shadows
at E and D have the same intensity, the quantity of
light emitted by each, will be as the squares of the
distances from the paper.
     By experiments of this kind, many useful partial -
culars may be shown ; for, since the cost and duration
of candles, and the consumption of oil in lamps, are
easily ascertainable, it may be shown whether more
or less light is obtained at the same expense during a
given time, by burning a number of small candles,
instead of one or more of greater thickness. It will,
therefore, be easy to compare the power of different
kinds of lamps, or candles, or gas-lights, so as to
determine the relative cost of each particular kind of
the combustible substance employed for furnishing
 light: for example,—if a candle and a gas-bnrher
 supplying coal-gas, adjusted by a stop-cock, if more
 or less be required, and the candle is carefully snuffed
 to produce the most regular and greatest quantity of
 light. The size of the flame, in experiments of this
 kind, of course becomes unnecessary, and will vary
 very much with the quantity of the coal-gas. The
 bulk of the gas consumed, and the quantity of the
 tallow used, by weighing the candle before and after
 the experiment, furnish the data for ascertaining the
 relative costs of tallow and gas-light, When compared
 with each other.

                 The Portable Gas Lamp.
     Mr. D. Gordon, of Edinburgh/was the inventor of
 the portable gas-lamp, in which carburetted hydrogen
 gas may be condensed, and used as a moveable light.
 There is one application of the portable ga3-lamp to
 which a high valve is attached. By an extreme
 diminution of the apertnre, the flame can be ren
 dered so small (in which case it is reduced to a bine
colour) as to give no perceptible light, and to occasion
almost no consumption of gas. In this state the lamp
 may be used in bed-rooms ; and the imperceptible
 flame may at any time be expanded into the most
 brilliant light, by turning the cock, by means of a
 metallic rod terminating near the bed.          Fig. 12
 represents one of the portable gas-lamps, six inches
in diameter, and nine inches high, exclusive of the
hemispherical ends and burner at the top, which,
when filled with coal-gas condensed twenty-five times,
will supply a lamp equal to five candles, six to the
pound, for six hours ; and when filled with vegetable
oil-gas, will burn for about twelve hours.
    Gas lights require no trimming, snuffing, or any
trouble whatever, except merely turning a cock, by
which a flame of any size may be formed.

gently blowing upon it, phosphorescent undulations
will be termed, which illuminate the air above the
fluid to a considerable distance.
    In winter it will be necessary to render the water
blood-warm. If the phosphorized ether be applied
to the hand, or other warm objects (which may be
done with safety,) it renders them phosphorescent in
the dark.

    Singular Explosions of Fulminating Mercury, and
                    Fulminating Silver.
     During a lecture in the laboratory of Yale College,
 about 100 or 150 grains of fulminating mercury lay on
 a stool, and were covered with a glass receiver, of
 about five or six quarts capacity. A small quantity of
 the same powder, at a distance ofa few feet, was merely
 flashed by a coal of fire, but without explosion. In a
 manner not easily understood, the whole powder
 under the glass receiver instantly exploded with . a
 dreadful report ; but, what was particularly remark
 able, the glass was merely lifted up a little, and was
 shattered by its fall, while the stool, made offirplank, an
 inch and a half thick, on which the powder lay, had a hole
 blown quite through it, almost as large as the palm of
  the hand. The whole effect of the explosion was con
  fined to the stool, every thing round having remained
 Uninjured.
      An effect almost equally singular, took place lately
  in the same laboratory, with some fulminating silver
  on the point of a knife, which was about to be put
  upon a plate of copper, connected with one pole of a
  galvanic battery in active operation; The other pole
  was not touched by the experimenter, but, probably

Hral Developed in Solutions Crystallized by Exposure

     When 51 parts of sulphate of soda, and 49 parts
of water are placed in a phial, and the stopper
removed in a temperature under 50°, the crystalliza
tion of the mass takes place, and there is a rise of
temperature equal to 24° of Fahrenheit. When the
carbonate of soda is used, small crystals or stars are
abundantly precipitated, and the temperature rises
14°. From a series of experiments made in this way,
it is concluded, that the latent heat of the water of
crystallization is in both cases, the cause of increase
of temperature.

sulphuretted hydrogen gas. Now fill another flask
half-full of water; remove the bladder, and in a
similar manner apply the cock to the orifice of this

On the Discoloration and Porosity of Coral Ornaments,
       and the Method of preventing those defects.
    It has been long known, that necklaces, bracelets,
and ear-rings of coral, undergo, after being worn, a
very remarkable change, and become extremely
white and porous. Jewellers have no other remedy

                RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                57
for this deterioration, than to remove the upper stra
tum of coral, till they come to a depth where no alter
ation had been produced.
      This change has been ascribed to the action of air
and of light ; but this was found by experiment, not
to have been the case ; and a discoloration never
took place, unless when the coral had actually been
worn as an ornament, in which case it has sometimes
been completely whitened, when used only two or
three times upon the naked skin, and in heated apart
 ments. M. Virey, therefore, very properly ascribes
 the discoloration and porosity of the coral to the
 action of a particular acid which exists in the moisture
 of the body. According to the analysis of Tlwnard
 the acetic, according to Berzelius, the lactic, and
 according to Berthollet the phosphoric acid, is found
 in it under particular circumstances.
       In order to prevent the deterioration of coral
 when used for the purposes of jewellery, it will be
 sufficient to impregnate it with a fat body, which will
 defend it from the immediate action of weak acids j
 and , for this purpose the coral should be digested in
 warm oil, or melted wax, which will enable it to
 resist the action of the acid to which it is exposed.
             Preparation of Pltosphorized Ether.

  prevent it being bleached ; but if the sponge is soaked

in cold water, and the water be changed three or
four times a day, the sponge being pressed perfectly
dry : at the expiration of five or six days, it will be
 ready for bleaching.
    If the sponge, as is frequently the case, should
contain small pieces of chalk or shells, which cannot
 be got out without tearing it; the sponge must be
 soaked for twenty-four hours in muriatic acid, with
 twenty parts of water, which will cause an efferves
 cence to take place, when the shells and chalk will
 become perfectly dissolved. After that it must be
carefully washed in fresh water, and immersed in a
 weak solution of sulphuric acid ; which immersion
 should continue about eight days, occasionally being
pressed dry, and thoroughly washed. After being
 perfectly washed and cleansed, it should be sprinkled
 with rose water to give it a pleasant smell, which
 completes the process.
Experiment to prove the Dilatability of Metals by Seat.
    Take a plate of copper hollowed into the form of
a ring, and a globe of the same metal, the diameter
of which is precisely equal to that of the opening of
the ring, so that when the latter is at the ordinary
temperature, the globe will pass through its opening
without having a perceptible interstice : afterwards,
when the globe is heated, it will be sustained by the
ring, in whatever position it is placed upon it.
Another Experiment to prove the Dilatability of Glass.
    Take a glass tube, of a small diameter, terminated
by a ball ot the size of an orange, fill the ball and a
part of the tube with a coloured liquor, and mark
on the tube the height at which it stands ; immerse
the ball in a vessel full of water near boiling, and
then draw it out again : at the moment of the immer
sion the liquor in the tube descends precipitately by

  a considerable quantity ; but it rises again a little
  higher than the mark made upon the tube, as soon as
  the ball is drawn out of the hot water. In this
  experiment the heat, which is communicated at first
  to the glass, dilates the parts, which augments the
 capacity of the ball, and causes the liqnor to descend ;
 the ball being afterwards taken out of the hot water,
 and again placed in contact with the air, counteracts,
 and the liquor, which has previously acquired a small
 quantity of heat, rises a little above its first level.
                   Brilliant Electrical Star.
      If a plate of tin be cut into the form of a star, and

 machine is turned, and this apparatus electrified, a
 flame will appear at the extremity of every angle of
 the star, which will be very beautiful ; and if the star
 be made to turn swiftly on its centre, an entire circle
 of fire will be seen in the dark. This experiment
 will appear very surprising to persons unacquainted
 with electricity ; if the operator now and then pri
 vately touch the prime conductor, which may easily
 be managed as tue experiment is performed in the
 dark ; for by this means he may command the appear

brilliance of a falling star. If the receiver is six
inches diameter, and fourteen or sixteen inches high,
the full charge of a moderate sized jar is necessary to
produce this effect, and it occurs most readily when

60            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
the receiver is but moderately exhausted, so that the
rarefied air it contains may have some degree of
resistance. The artificial imitation of these two phe
nomena, therefore, require the same conditions for
their production as appear to obtain in nature; for
the Aurora occurs in the highest parts of the atmos
phere, where the air is most rarefied ; and the most
accurate imitation of its appearance is obtained in
the most perfectly exhausted receiver ; falling stars
take place much lower, where the air has more density,
and to imitate them, it is necessary to employ a me
dium that opposes some resistance.
Method of making a Cheap Aromatic Vinegar, for puri

    Take of common vinegar any quantity, mix asuffi-

with it, to destroy the acidity ; then let the white
matter subside, and pour off the insipid supernatant
liquor; afterwards let the white powder be dried
 either in the open air, or by a fire. When it is dry!
 pour upon it sulphuric acid, as long as white acid
 fumes continue to ascend. Stone vessels are most
 proper to be used on this occasion, as the acid will
 not act upon them. This product is the acetic acid
 known in the shops by the name of aromatic vinegar.
 The simplicity and cheapness of this process, point it
 out as a very useful and commodious one for purify

 the flame of a spirit lamp, so that the portion of the
water in the upper part of the tube only may be

that part of it which is wrapped up in flannel. When
the surface of the water boils, the heat may gradually
 be applied, nearer and nearer, towards the lower
part of the tube ; and thus the water may be made,
to boil violently within half an inch of the surface of
the ice, without melting any notable portion of it.

             Instantaneous Light Apparatus.
     The extremity of a fine platina wire is to be
 rolled into a spiral form, and then dipped in ammo
 nia-muriate, or muriate of platina, until about two
 grains are taken up ; after which it is to be heated
 red-hot in a spirit lamp. In this way a quantity of
 spongy platina is formed on the wire so minute, that
 if put into contact with a mixture of oxygen and
 hydrogen, it becomes heated, and inflames the gas
 as rapidly almost as if an electrical spark had passed.
Such a wire as this, fixed on the jet-pipe, so that the
spongy metal shall be exposed to the current of
 hydrogen, immediately inflames it. It happens that
 if an instrument of this kind has been exposed for
some hours to a humid atmosphere, the inflammation
does not take place readily, but in this case, if the
top of the platina be touched by the finger or palm
of the hand, either before or during the time that the
current of hydrogen is passing out, the inflammation
immediately takes place. Contact, indeed, is not
necessary, for the mere approach of the hand is
sufficient to elevate the temperature so much as to
cause instant inflammation.

An Improved Mode ofSecuring Oil Colours in Bladders.
    Instead of drawing the neck of the wetted bladder
close, (in the act of tying up, as usual) previously
insert a slender cylindrical stick, and bind the blad

tube; through which, when the stick is withdrawn,
the colour may be squeezed, as wanted ; and the
neck be again closed by replacing the stick. This is
a more cleanly mode, than the usual one, of perfo
rating the bladder, and stopping the hole with a
nail, or more commonly, leaving it open, to the
prejudice of the colour.
    The barrel of a small quill may be used instead
of the stick, with the closed end outward ; which will
 keep the colour secure in travelling, and when
 wanted to be used, the end of the quill being cutoff,
 it may afterwards be closed by a stick.

softened or decarbonated, and thereby rendered a
better material for receiving all kinds of work than
copper itself. After the intended engraving has been
executed upon the block, it is then hardened by a
new process, which prevents injury to the most deli
cate work. A cylinder of steel, previously softened, is
then placed in the transferring press, and repeatedly
passed over the engraved block, by which the engrav
ing is transferred in relief, to the periphery of the
cylinder ; the press having a vibrating motion equalling
that of the cylinder upon its periphery, by which new
surfaces of the cylinder are presented, equal to the
extent of the engraving. The cylinder is then hard
ened, and is employed to indent copper or steel
plates, with engravings identically the same with that
upon the original block ; and this may be repeated
ad infinitum, as the original engraving will remain,
from which other cylinders may be impressed, if
required. This invention promises to be of great
advantage to some of our manufactures, particularly
that of pottery, which may now be embellished with
beautiful engravings, so as to place the successful
competition of other nations at a great distance. It
is also applied with great advantage to calico printing,
by producing entire new patterns upon the cylinders
from which they are printed. It would be super
 fluous to mention the beautiful highly-finished
 engravings which now adorn our books, rooms, &c.

are executed upon steel plates, which, when hard
ened, will print 200,000 perfect impressions.
    It is to Messrs. Perkins, Fairmau, and Heath, that
the world is indebted for this valuable invention.
      Metallic Casts from Engravings on Copper.
    A most important discovery has lately been made,
which promises to be of considerable utility in the fine
arts : some very beautiful specimens of metallic
plates, of a peculiar composition, have lately appeared,
Under the name of " cast engravings." This inven
tion consists in taking moulds from every kind of
engravings, with line, meezotihto, aquatinta, anJ
pouring on this mould an alloy, in a state of fusion,
capable of taking the finest impressions. The obvious
utility of this invention, as applicable to engravings
which meet with a ready sale, and of which great
numbers are required, will be incalculable ; as it will
wholly prevent the expense of retracing, which forms
so prominent a charge in all works of an extended
scale. No sooner is one cast worn out, than another
may be immediately procured from the original plate,
so that every impression will be a proof. Thus the
works of our most celebrated artists may be handed
down, ad infinitum, for the improvement and delight
of future ages, and will afford at the same time, the
greatest satisfaction to every lover of the fine arts.
             To make Transparent Paintings.
     The paper must be fixed in a straining frame, in
order to place it between the eye and the light, when
required. After tracing the design, the colours must
 be laid on, in the usual method of stained drawings.
When the tints are got in, place the picture against
 the window, on a frame of glass, framed for the pur
 pose, and begin to strengthen the shadows with
 Indian ink> or with colours, according as the effect

Requires, laying the colours sometimes on both sides
of the paper, to give greater force and depth of
colour. The last touches for giving final strength to
shadows and forms, are to be done with ivory-black,
or lamp-black, prepared with gum-water ; as there is
no pigment so opake, and capable of giving strength
and decision.
    When the drawing is finished, and every part has
got its depth of colour and brilliancy, being perfectly
dry, touch very carefully with spirits of turpentine,
on both sides, those parts which are to be the brightest,
Such as the moon and fire ; and those parts requiring
less brightness, only on one side. Then lay on imme
diately, with a pencil, a varnish, made by dissolving
one ounce of Canada balsam in an equal quantity of
spirits of turpentine. Be cautious with the varnish,
as it is apt to spread. When the varnish is dry, tinge
the flame with red lead and gamboge, slightly touch
ing the smoke next the flame ; the moon must not be
tinted with colour.
    Much depends on the choice of the subject ; and
none so admirably adapted to this species of effect,
as the gloomy gothic ruin, whose antique towers and
painted turrets finely contrast their dark battlements
with the pale yet brilliant moon. The effect of rays
passing through the ruined windows, half choked with
ivy ; or, of a fire among the clustering pillars and
broken ornaments of the choir, round which are
figures of banditti, or others, whose haggard faces
catch the reflecting light, afford a peculiarity of effect
not to be equalled in any other species of painting.
Internal views of cathedrals also, where windows of
Stained glass are introduced, have a beautiful effect.
           Peculiar Characteristics of Plants.
    The vital principle of plants is effected by exter
nal stimuli ; hence the well known tendency of plants
 to lean or turn from the ordinary position of their
stems or boughs, when in dark situations, towards

another which affords a freer access of light. The
daughter of Linnaus is said to have been the earliest
observer of the folding back of the trifoliate leaves
of clover during the night. The leaflets of robinia
and the liquorice are pendulous at night. The leaves
of mimosa pudica fold themselves, and overlap one
another: they thus seem composed to rest, after
exposure to the stimuli of day light. This I/inna-ns
has called the sleep of plants. But this is an ordained,
and not a necessary consequence of the stimulus of
light acting on vegetable fibre. Many flowers expand
only when the sun shines, and close their petals at
night. Though many open their blossoms in the
morning, and close them at night, yet many species
differ as to their homs of opening and closing, and
the succession of their periodical times has been
called the Horologium Flora. But some plants only
open their blossoms and exhale their sweet perfumes
at night, as the Oenothera, or tree-primsose, the
night-blowing stock, and cereus, or cactus grandiflora.
Some flowers turn towards the sun in the morning,
are nearly erect at noon, and incline to the west in
the evening. This property is called nutation. The
fable of Clytic shews that it was noticed by the
ancients.
    Wheat, and probably other corn, bending with
weight of grain, is observed to bend always towards
the south.
    Some plants are especially remarkable for their
peculiar irritability. This property is well exemplified
in the genus mimosa, particularly in that species well
known by the name of the sensitive-plant. The
leaves of dionaca muscipula, close exactly like a
gin, and ensnare, and commonly squeeze to death
any insect which alights on a circular process at the
apex. A similar property has been observed in the
leaves of the doosera, or sun-dew. The stamina of
the common berberry and of the stylidium glandulo-
suni exhibit similar sensibility.
    In annual and biennial plants, says Dr. Hunter,
one may observe, that before they have flowered they

but if they flower the first year, as soon as winter
approaches, they generally die ; if they do not flower,
they vi ill often continue in vigour three or four years.
The plaintain-tree has often continued in the gardens
of Holland for a hundred years ; but when it has
cnce flowered, no art, skill, or experience, can pre
vent its lofty stem from perishing in the year follow
ing. The cooypha, or umbrella palm-tree, remains
barren for thirty-five years, growing in that time to
the Iveitht of seventy feet ; in the space of four
months from that time, it rises thirty feet higher, puts
forth its flowers, and produces fruit the same year ;
which done, it totally dies, both root and stem.
        Steam Engine, Two Thousand Years Old.
     Mr. Partington has lately exhibited a working
model of a steam engine, of which the principle is
more than two thousand years old. It was invented
by Hero, of Syracuse ; and a representation of Mr.
P.'s working model may be seen at Fig. 13. Water
must first be placed in the hollow tube a, and steam
generated by the flame b ; the revolving tube a is
supported by a point at c, so that the steam rushing
from the apertures e e, by its re-action produces a
rotary motion.

              Private Corresponding Seals.
    A frame similar to those in which seals are mount
ed generally having been first prepared, a number of
moveable circles may be made to slide within each
other on one common centre. If three are employed,
they should he engraved with numerals, the alpha
bet, and, if intended for secret writing, the third
circle may be furnished with any arbitary signs that
may suggest themselves. These, by means of a key,
of which both the corresponding parties must possess
a duplicate, may be combined to form the day of the
week, month, year, &c.
    It would be found very useful in preventing and
detecting the mistakes which so frequently occur in
the delivery of letters, if the seals in common use were
provided with at least two of these revolving circles,
with the day of the month and hour of the day en
graved on their face, parallel to the stone. A parti
cular part of the arms or cypher being used as an
index hand, it would then show the precise hour the
letter was sent, without the trouble of dating, &c.
    In engraved seals where coals of arms are used it
will be obvious that the seal must be larger than those
generally in use, as the circles must be made to revolve
round the outer extremity of the stone, and their use
fulness will be considerably diminished.

    For writing by the taste, it will be necessary to

liquid, whose taste is sufficiently pungent or aro

The Principle on which the Invention of the Diving-bell
                         is founded.
    Invert a clean dry glass tumbler over a large
bason nearly full of water, and when the whole rim
is brought exactly parallel with the surface, plunge
 it perpendicularly downwards. It may now be ob
served, that the water has risen considerably in the
bason ; this rising is owing to the displacement by
 the glass of a volume of water equal to its own
bulk ; consequently, no water can be in the tum
 bler : for if the inverted tumbler were filled with
water, of course no greater rise could be observed
 in the bason, than what would be caused by the
 solid bulk of the sides of the glass which were im
 mersed in it. The reason, then, that no water
 ascends in the glass, is, that previous to its immer
 sion, it was filled with air, which, pressing upon the
 water below, prevents its ascent. Another proof
 that no water has entered the glass, is, that the
 inside will be found quite dry.
                   Phosphoric Fire-bottle.
     The fire-bottle is founded on the known property
  of phosphorus to inflame more or less rapidly, ac
  cording to the state of the substances upon which
  it is rubbed.
     The preparation of these fire-bottles is extremely
  simple. About eighteen or twenty grains of phos
                               ii

74            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
phorus are to be put into a phial or glass tube, of
any length, so that it can be easily held in the hand.
The lower part of this tube may be filled with any
substance whatever, which is to be pressed down
with a cork. A space being reserved for the phos
phorus, it is cut into small pieces, and put into the
bottle, which is immediately stopped with a good
stopper. By heating with precaution, at a lamp,
the part which contains the phosphorus, this sub
stance quickly melts, and falls into the shape of the
bottle, as it cools: the fire-bottle is then completed.
The manner of using it is equally simple. The little
bed of phosphorus is lightly scratched with a com
mon match, a very small portion adheres to the
match, and on being lightly rubbed upon a piece of
leather glove, woollen cloth, cork, &c. it takes fire,
and communicates inflammation to the match. A
hundred matches in succession may be lighted,
without consuming more than a grain and a quarter
of phosphorus.
Experimental Illustration of an Electrical Thunder
                     cloud at Sea.
   With a view of illustrating experimentally the
advantages to be derived from fixed conductors on
ship-board, the facility and safety with which the
above mentioned method of their application admits
of conducting a charge, and likewise to exemplify
their efficacy under every possible situation of the
mast, a series of experiments, in which many well
known electrical actions are made to bear on these
points, were instituted.
   A model of a corvette, about five feet long, and
of a proportionate width and depth, was placed to
float in a reservoir of water, as represented at Fig.
14. The masts of this model were fitted with con
ductors formed of copper slips, on a somewhat pro
portionate scale ; the connections through the keel
were likewise complete. It is evident, that when

              HECKEATIOVS IN SCIENCE.              75
ships are struck by lightning, the damage sustained
is the effect of the electric fluid passing suddenly
and violently through them into the sea : hence,
from the known laws of electrical actions, the
clouds and sea must be considered in opposite
electrical states. In order to imitate this by artifi
cial means, it is necessary, first, to place our sub
stitute for the sea in one state, and our representa
tion of a cloud in another. This was done by
means of an electrical jar or battery at E, charged
either positively or negatively ; when charged posi
tively, the water in the outer coating was placed
 under the influence of the negative side, by means
 of the metallic wire E A B ; a boat A D, having a
 small wire through the keel, was now connected
 with this metallic line, and the cloud at C being in
 connection with the inner coating by means of the
 flexible silver line M N C, formed of a silver
 thread, produced a discharge through the ship into
 the water. In order to approximate as nearlv as
 possible to the manner in which a thunder cloud ap
 proaches the point through which it strikes, the
 cloud C was attached to a silk line, balanced over
 two wheels set on fine pivots by equal weights
  W W ; this cloud was formed of a light hollow ball
 of wood, gilded and covered with a mass of cotton
 wool ; its first situation was at the point O, where
 the conducting metallic thread was shortened
  through the ring at M, and coiled away inside the
 jar ; by increasing the weight of W it descends,
  and conveys the charged cloud forward with any
  required degree of velocity ; this velocity can be
  measured by means of a pendulum at P, which
  beats seconds, and by the scale x y divided into
  inches : as the ball moves forward, the conducting
  thread elongates through the ring at M, and pre
  serves the connexion with the inner coating of the
  jar. The charge was accumulated to a given height,
  observable by an electrometer, and the conductor on
  the lower mast surrounded with a detonating pow
   der (formed of chlorate of potash two parts, sul

76           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
phuret of antimony one part,) mixed with a little
common gunpowder ; a similar quantity was placed
in the boat at D. The artificial cloud was now
caused to move forward : at the instant of its ap
proaching the main-top-gallant-mast-head, a dense
spark passed through the vessel without igniting
the powder placed around the conductor, but in
flamed that in the boat, in consequence of a spark
being produced at the instant of its passing out of
the water, by means of the wire through the keel
of the boat; the top-gallant-mast-head was sur
mounted by a brass bait On repeating the experi
ments without the ball, the discharge always be
came dissipated by the action of the pointed mast
head, and presented in the dark a luminous appear
ance, so that, with some velocities, it was completely
drawn off, and in all cases the dense shock was
invariably avoided. About eighty square feet of
coated surface was used in these experiments. The
same effects constantly took place in every possible
situation of the masts, and with every species of
velocity, whether uniform, accelerated, or retarded,
with which the charge approached the mast-head.
The constant agreement in the results of these
experiments proves the efficiency of a pointed con
tinuous conductor on ship-board, and that its appli
cation is calculated to answer the end in view ; for
if it had not transmitted the charge in the most
perfect manner, the detonating powder in contact
with the conductor on the mast must have been
 exploded.

  French Method ofpainting on Silk or Cotton Velvet.
   Extend come tracing paper upon the object to be
copied, and trace the design upon it with a pencil.
Rub the contrary side of this paper all over with
fine lac in powder, and apply this reddened surface
upon a smooth piece of parchment. With a pencil
go over every object separately, using as many
pieces of parchment as there are different objects
and different colours in the design, so as to transfer
every object on a different piece. Afterwards cut
out all the pieces of parchment by the transferred
lines, and, this done, extend the piece of velvet
intended to be painted upon a table covered with a
green cloth ; place every piece of parchment, one
after another, on that part of the velvet where the
 portion of the drawing ought to be which has been
 cut in the piece of parchment ; and with a pencil
charged with a colour suited to that part of the
drawing, go over the velvet where it is not covered
 by the parchment. The same is done for each piece
 of parchment separately, till the whole drawing is
 completed. The execution of this process requires
 a great deal of care and attention, in order to avoid
 obliterating the design, for the whole part is per
 formed continuedly, without waiting for the part
 which has just been painted to dry, before commenc
 ing another. At last, the parts which may not have
 taken well, are corrected and finished with a pencil,
 or by means of new pisces of parchment.

 Preparation of the Oil used in this kind of Painting.
   Grind into very fine powder twenty grains of sal-
ammoniac, and twenty grains of sal-prunella. Throw
this powder into one pound of the clearest linseed
oil that can be obtained, and boil it for three hours.
One hour before taking it off the fire, put into it a
piece of soft bread, which has been carefully soaked
in oil of vitriol, and three large onions cut in pieces.
When this bread is almost calcined, and the onions
are dissolved, take off the oil, and strain it through
a new piece of coarse cloth. Put it afterwards into
bottles, and use it for grinding the colours as may
be required for painting, observing to employ it
with management, that the ground colours shall not
run on the glass, but have the consistence of butter.
This oil does not spread on the velvet beyond the
outlines of the drawing.
               To restore decayed Writings.
   Cover the letters with phlogisticated or prussic
alkali, with the addition of a diluted mineral acid ;
upon the application of which the letters change
very speedily to a deep blue colour, of great beauty
and intensity. To prevent the spreading of the
colour, which, by blotting the parchment, detracts
greatly from the legibility, the alkali should be put
on first, and the diluted acid added upon it. The
method found to answer best has been, to spread the
alkali thin with a feather, or a bit of stick cut to a

   The matter of the shell is secreted by the covium
or skin of the insect, and the form it assumes is
regulated by the body of the animal. It is coeval
with its existence, and appears pervious to the ex
clusion of the egg. The solid matter of the shell
consists of common lime, united with a small por
tion of animal matter, resembling coagulated albu
men. The mouth of the shell is extended by the
application of fresh layers of the shelly matter to
the margin, and its thickness is increased by a coat
ing on the inner surface.
    Shell is hardened by carbonate of lime ; bone by
phosphate of lime.

                  Grand Conjunction.

 curred since the creation of the universe.
                     Camera Lucida.
    That very compact and elegant instrument, for
 drawing objects in perspective, called the Camera
 lucida, was the invention of the late Dr. W. H.
 Wollaston.
    In this instrument two plane reflectors are fixed
 at such angles with regard to each other, that the
 objects intended to be delineated are seen after re
 flection from the second mirror, as though they
 were on the same plane as that whereon the paper
 is placed which is to contain the drawing. These

              RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                 81
plane reflectors may be either common mirrors with
a silver coating at the back of each, or two conti
guous faces of a glass prism, in which latter case
the image will be produced by what is called pris
matic reflection. In either case the most convenient
position, in which the reflecting surfaces can be ar
ranged, will be such as will cause the rays proceeding
directly from the object, and falling as incident
rays upon the first surface, after reflection from
thence to the second, to emerge from that second
reflecting surface in angles of 90 degrees with the
direction of the originalincident rays : for in these
circumstances vertical objects may be projected
upon a horizontal plane, and the instrument will
be adapted to drawing upon a horizontal surface.
Now, if two plane mirrors are used, the incident
rays upon the first will make right angles with the
emergent rays from the second, when those mirrors
are fixed so as to make angles of either 45 or 135
degrees from each other. In this case the mirror
which first receives the rays from the object may be
entirely silvered at its back, but the second mirror
is only to have a sufficient portion silvered to reflect
the image of the proposed object to the eye, and
thus to allow the paper, on which the drawing is to
be made, to be seen, either through an opening of
the silvering, or past the edges of the same, by one
portion of the eye, while the double reflected object
is seen in the silvering by the other portion of the
same eye. When prismatic reflection is employed,
the prism must not be triangular, as usually con
structed, but quadrangular, and the two reflecting
surfaces (to produce an angle of 90 degrees between
the first incident and the second emergent rays)
must make an angle of 135 degrees, while the oppo
site angle must be one of 90 degrees, and the other
two angles may be either respectively equal or un
equal at pleasure ; then one of the faces which made
right angles with each other is to be turned towards
the objects to be delineated, and the rays, after
passing through that surface and reflection from the

82           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
two next faces, will emerge from the fourth under
the proposed angle.
   The mirrors, or other reflecting surfaces, are
mounted in a proper frame, and supported at a suit
able distance from the paper intended to receive
the drawing : and, when necessary, either a double
concave or a double convex glass may be fixed in
the frame and properly adjusted, to produce-distinct
vision when the apparatus is used by short-sighted
or long-sighted persons respectively. These concave
and convex glasses may conveniently be made of
twelve inches focal length ; the instrument must
then be supported at the distance of twelve inches
from the paper, a distance which is convenient
enough in other respects.
   Dr. Wollaston instituted a comparison between
the camera obscura and the camera lucida.
   The objections to the camera obscura are—
   1st. That it is too large to be carried about with
convenience.
   The camera lucida is as small and portable as can
be wished.
   2dly. In the former, all objects that are not situ
ated near the centre of view, are more or less dis
torted.
   In this, there is no distortion, so that every line,
even the most remote from the centre of view, is
as straight as those through the centre.
   3dly. In that, the field of view does not extend
beyond 30°, or at most 35°, with distinctness.
   But in the camera lucida, as much as 70° or 80*
 might be included in one view.
   Dr. Wollaston remarks further, that by a proper
 use of the same instrument, every purpose of the
 pentograph may also be answered, as a painting may
be reduced in any proportion required, by placing it
at a distance in due proportion greater than that of
 the paper from the instrument. In this case a lens
 becomes requisite for enabling the eye to see at two
 unequal distances with equal distinctness ; and in
 order that one lens may suit for all these purposes,

there is an advantage in varying the height of the
stand according to the proportion in which the re-
duction is to be effected.
            Beautiful Appearance in Vacuo.
    Take a glass barometer tube, having on the end a
steel cap, fastened to the glass with cement. From
it must proceed a wire and ball. Fill the tube with
quicksilver, and then, by sending up a large bubble
of air, and repeatedly inverting the tube, free the
quicksilver and iron ball from air : then put a small
drop of ether on the quicksilver, and put the finger
on the end of the glass tube, and then invert the
end in a bason of quicksilver, taking care not to
remove the finger from the end of the tube till the
 latter be immersed under the surface of the quick
 silver. When the finger is removed, the mercury
 will descend, and the ether expand itself : present
 the metallic top of the tube to a large charged con
 ductor, and a beautiful green spark will pass through
 the vapour of the ether from the ball to the quick
 silver. By admitting a small quantity of air into
 the tube, an appearance something like a falling
 star is produced.

nished and appear to vanish, the support of the lens
F suffers the screen M to fall and intercept part of
the light. The rod K N must be equal to I K, and
the point I must be twice the focal length of the
lens F, before the object L being immediately under
the focus of the lens. The screen M may have a
triangular opening, so as to uncover the middle of
the lens only, or the light may be intercepted in
any other way.
   The apartment must be deprived of all light, ex
cept that which proceeds from the apparatus hid
behind the screen, which is of gauze or gummed
muslin, posited vertically, which serves as the
fround of a picture where the images are depicted
  y reason of the transparency. At the moment
when the operation commences, a spectre appears
 (as of a skeleton, the head of a celebrated person,
&c.) at first extremely small, but which afterwards
 increases rapidly, and thus seems to advance at a
 great rate towards the spectators : and when the
scene passes before them in a room representing a
 cave hung with black, a solemn silence being occa -
sionally interrupted by mournful sounds from an
appropriate musical instrument, it is not easy for an
 observer to defend himself from the impression of
terror, at the sight of an object in itself formed to
produce the illusion, and which finds in the imagi
 nation a place already prepared for the reception of
 phantoms.

line a b, Fig. 17, equal to A B, Fig. 16, and divide
it into the same number of equal parts as the side
of the prototype A B ; and in E, the middle of it,

erect the perpendicular £ V, so much the longer,
and draw V S perpendicular to E V, so much the
shorter, as the image is designed to be more dis
torted. From each point or division draw right
lines to V, and join the points a and S by the right
line a S. Through the points d, e, f, g, draw lines
parallel to a, b ; then will a, b, c, d, be the space in
which the monstrous projection is to be delineated.
    Lastly, in every small square of the space a, b, c,
d, draw what appears delineated in the correspond
ent square ABCDj by this means you will obtain
a deformed image, which yet will appear in just
proportion to an eye distant from it by the length
 of E V, and raised above it by the height V S.
    It is by these means that the horizontoviums are
 drawn.
    An image may be also distorted mechanically, by
 perforating it here and there with a needle, and
 placing it against a candle or lamp ; and observing
 where the rays, which pass through these little holes,
 fall on a plane, or curved superficies, for they will
 give the correspondent points of the image de
 formed, by which means the deformation may be
 completed.
     Let the image, whatever it be, e, g, I H S, be
 drawn upon a cylinder of pasteboard, A B C D , Fig.
  18, and the perforations being made as above de
 scribed, place a candle G behind the cylinder, and
 mark upon the ground the points corresponding to
 the perforations of the image, which will be dis
 torted more or less, according to the position of the
 candle, or the plane, &c. Then, let the picture
 that is formed be an exact copy of this distorted
  image, and substitute a metallic speculum in the
  place of the cylinder, and let the eye of the specta
  tor have the same position before the cylinder that
  the candle had behind it, the distorted image will,
  by reflection from the speculum, be restored to its
  proper shape.

 prototype be formed. With double the diameter
A B, as a radius, describe the quadrant E F G,
Fig. 20, so that the arch E G may be equal to the

 will form the superficies of a cone, whose base is
 the circle A B C D. Divide the arch E G into the
 same number of equal parts as the craticular proto
 type is divided into, and draw radii from all the
 points of division. Produce G F to I, and F I to
 F G : and from the centre I, with the radius I F,
 draw the quadrant F K H, and from I to E draw
 the right line I £. Divide the arch K F into the
 same number of equal parts as the radius of the
 craticular prototype is divided into, and draw radii
 through each of the points of division, from the
 centre I, meeting E F in 1, 2, 3, &c. Lastly, from
 the centre F, with the radii, F 1, F 2, F 3, &c.
  describe the concentric arches. Thus will the crati-
 cularectype be formed, the areola of which will
 appear equal to each other.
      Hence what is delineated in every areola of the
  craticular prototype, being transferred into the
  areola? of the craticular ectype, the images will be
  distorted ; yet an eye raised above the vertex of the
  cone, at a height equal to that of the cone itself,
  will perceive them in just proportion.

pound into a crucible, which has been before filled
with pulverized sulphur, made into a paste by
means of water : the crucible is then immediately
covered, that the sulphur may not take fire, and
the mixture is calcined over a smelting fire, until
the superfluous sulphur is burnt away. The com
pound is then coarsely pounded, and, with a solution
of muriate of ammonia, formed into a paste, which
is rubbed into the engraving on silver plate. The
silver is then wiped clean, and suffered to become
so hot under the muffle, that the substance rubbed
into the strokes of the engraving melts, and adheres
to the metal. The silver is afterwards wetted with
the solution of muriate of ammonia, and again
placed under the muffle till it becomes red Tiot.
After this, the engraved surface may be smoothed

                The Ocular Harpsichord.
   The first person who attempted to supply the
organ of vision with the luxuries of light and colour,
was Father Castel, a learned Jesuit. The account
of this instrument was printed at the end of
Castel's VOptique des Couleurs, which appeared at
Paris in 1740. The ocular harpsichord is a common
harpsichord, fitted up in such a manner, that when a
certain sound is produced by striking the keys, a co-
lour related to that sound is at the same instant ex
hibited to the eye in a box or frame connected with
the harpsichord ; so that, when a piece of music is
played for the gratification of the ear, the eye is
simultaneously delighted by the display of corres
ponding colours.
   In adjusting the colours and the sounds, Castel
lays down the following six propositions.
   1st. There is a fundamental and primitive sound
in nature, which may be called ut, and there is also
an orginal and primitive colour, which is the foun
dation of all other colours namely, blue.
   2nd. There are three chords, or essential sounds,
which depend upon the primitive sound ut, and
which compose with it a primitive and original
accord, and these are ut, mi, sol. There are also
three original colours depending on the blue, which,
while they are not composed of any other colours,
 produce them all, namely, blue, yellow, and red. The

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                    Ill
blue is here the note of the tone, the red is the
fifth, and the yellow is the third.
   3rd. There are five tonic chords, ut, re, mi, sol, la,
and two semitomic chords, fa and si. There are
also five tonic colours, to which all the rest are
ordinarily related, namely, blue, green, yellow, red,
and violet, and two semitonic or equivocal colours,
namely, aurora and violant, (related to the orange
and indigo of Newton.)
   4th. Out of these five entire tones, and two semi-
tones, is formed the diatonic scale, ut, re, mi, fa, sol,
la, and si; and, in like manner, out of the five entire
or tonic colours, and the two demi-colours, are
formed the gradation of colours, blue, green, yellow,
aurora, red, violet, and violant ; for the blue leads to
green, which is demi-blue ; the yellow to aurora, which
is gilded-yellow. The aurora leads to red, the red
to violet, which is two-thirds of red, and one-third of
blue ; and the violet leads to violant, which has more
blue than red.
    5th. The entire tones divide themselves into semi
 tones; and the five entire tones of the scale, a gamut,
 comprehending in this the two natural semitones,
 make twelve semitones viz. ut natural ut dieuze, re,
 re dieze, mi, fa, fa dieuze, sol, sol dieuze la, la dieuze,
 and si. In like manner there are twelve demi-co
 lours, or demi-tints, and there can be neither more
 nor less, according to the opinion of painters them
 selves, and as may be demonstrated by other means.
 These colours are blue, sea-green, green, olive, yellow,
 aurora, orange, red, crimson, violet, agathe, and violant.
 Blue leads to sea-green, which is a greenish blue;
 sea-green leads to green; green to olive, which is a
 yellowish-green ; olive to yellow ; yellow to aurora ;
 aurora to orange ; orange to red, the colour of fire ;
 red to crimson, which is red mixed with a little blue ;
 crimson to violet, which is still more blue ; violet to
 agathe, or bluish violet ; and agathe to violant.
    6th. The progression of sounds is in a circle, set
 ting out from ut, and returning back : thus, ut, mi,
 sol, ut, or ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, ut. This is called

92           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
an octave, when the last ut is one-half more acute
than the first. The colours also have their progres
sion in a circle.
   7th. After an octave, ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, there
recommences a new one, which is one-half more
acute, and the whole circle of music produces several
octaves.
    Such are the principles upon which the ocular
 harpsichord was founded.
     To shew the Combustion of Zinc in Oxygen Gas.
    Take some turnings of zinc, form a ball of it,
 and affix it to a wire ; insert a small bit of phos
 phorus into the ball, set fire to it, and introduce it
 quickly into a bottle filled with oxygen gas. The
 zinc will take fire, and burn with a beautiful green
 flame surrounded by a white one.
                           Or,
    If a current of oxygen gas be conveyed to filings
 of the metals, they will burn with great rapidity.
  For this purpose, fill a large bladder with oxygen
 gas, and adapt it to a tube ; by pressing the bladder
  and throwing the gas on a piece of ignited charcoal,
  on which filings of metal have been put, they will
  burn rapidly. The filings of metal which exhibit
  the most brilliant appearances, are those of zinc,

tones higher than the air that surrounds us. A
mixture of azote and oxygen, in the same propor
tions as in the atmospheric air, will give the same
tone as the latter ; but when the mixture of these
gases is not uniform, the sounds are totally dis
cordant.
    When a plate of glass is agitated by means of a

the like circumstances, the figures are always the
same, their changes depending only upon the gra
vity or acuteness of the tone.

               Changes of the Kaleidoscope.
    The following curious calculation has been made
of the number of changes this instrument will
admit.
    Supposing the instrument to contain twenty
small pieces of glass, &c. and that you make ten
changes in each minute, it will take the inconceiv
able space of 402,880,899,576 years, and 360 days to
go through the immense variety of changes it is
 capable of producing. Or, if you take only twelve
 small pieces, and make ten changes in each minute,
 it will then require 33,264 days, or 91 years and 49
 days, to exhaust its variations.

   A light hollow globe rf, representing the earth,

   Beautiful Pictures produced by the Polydngular
                      Kaleidoscope.
   In order to convey some idea of the effect pro
 duced by the kaleidoscope in grouping figures, we
refer to the plate for Fig. 22, which is a design cre
ated by the instrument, from a single figure. The
inclination of the mirrors by which the figures are
 arranged is 60°, or one-tenth of a circle ; and there
fore the object is multiplied ten times, so as to give
five pair of direct and inverted images.
    The effect which is produced by a simple outline
 will convey some idea of the beauty which must
 characterise the designs when the figures are finely
 shaded, or chastely coloured.
    When the figures which are wished to be intro
 duced are larger than the aperture of the kaleidos
 cope, the lens must be used, and the figures placed
 at such a distance as to reduce them to the proper
 magnitude.

        To measure the Height of a Tower, c\c.
   By means of the shadow projected on an hori

curacy the height of a tower, or any other similar
object. The method is this :—Fix a stick vertically
in the ground ; measure the part of it that ia above
the ground ; measure also its shadow and the sha
dow of the tower. The length of the shadows be
ing proportional to the respective height of the two
objects producing them, we shall have the height of
the tower by multiplying the length of its shadow
by the height of the stick, and dividing the produce
by the length of the shadow of the stick.

              Curious Experiment in Music.
    A verv curious experiment was first pointed out
by Wallis, but which was neglected till it occurred
in the observations of Sauveur, who has since passed
for the inventor. The experiment is this.
    If we stretch a musical cord above a board, and
divide it into two unequal portions, yet respectively
commensurable by means of a slight obstacle which
only presses moderately, these two parts being
struck successively will yield the same sound, which
 will be different from that of the whole cord : and
 such indeed will that sound be, that if we represent
 by the most simple numbers the ratio between the
 lengths of the two parts of the cord, the sound which
 is heard, the slight obstacle being interposed, will be
 that of a cord which is represented by unity. Thus,
 if a cord were divided into two parts, which are
 respectively as the numbers 3 and 2, in which case
 the corresponding sounds would be in the relation
 of ut and sol rising, if the lengths of the two deter
 mined their resonance, then the sound will be that
 of the cord 1, that is to say, the sol, which is the
 acute octave to the sound given out by the smaller
 portion in the ordinary case.
    It would seem, then, that each part subdivides
 itself into as many equal portions, as the number
 that measures it contains units. Hence, between
 two neighbouring subdivisions there is a point of
 rest, or a node, and at the middle of each subdivision

98           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
the undulation forma a bellied part, as in a cord
which vibrates from end to end. In the preceding
example, the larger part subdivides itself into three,
and the smaller into two ; so that the sound ut is
rendered at once by all the subdivisions, which are
thus found in unison one with another. It is ob
vious that the smaller part ought not to subdivide
itself when the sound to which it is analogous has
the unit for its impression ; for then the same sound
is yielded by the smaller part, as by each of the
subdivisions of the greater.
   Such, therefore, is the mechanism on which the
series of unisons given by this experiment depends,
that the slight obstacle which divides the cord
merely prevents the total vibrations, but permits a
communication to subsist, or a mutual dependence
between the two parts, whence their vibrations tend
to accord perfectly, or, in other words, to become
isochronous. Of consequence, they are forced to
subdivide themselves, but they do this as little as
possible: so that the number of subdivisions is
always the smallest among all those which would
furnish isochronism.
   Thus, in the preceding example, if the cord 2
made total vibrations, the two thirds of the cord
3 might be able to put itself in union with it; but
there would remain one-third which would perform
its vibrations separately : now it is this third which,
being alone proper to determine the isochronism,
gives law to all the rest.
   Sauveur rendered sensible to the eye the distinc
tion between the nodes and the moveable parts, by
placing at the point of each node a chevron of white
paper, and another of coloured paper, about the
middle of each vibrating part. At the moment when
the cord commenced vibration, all the coloured
pieces were seen to tall off, while all the white ones
remained in their places. This experiment will suc
ceed very well, if we use a violin string, by dividing
it with a bridge of pasteboard, after having stretched
it upon a board ; and making it vibrate by lightlv

                To Bronze Plaster Figures.
    Bronzing is colouring plaster, or other busts and
 figures, with metallic powders, to give them the
 appearance of metal. The powders used for this
purpose are either copper filings, anvum musivum,
or copper precipitated from its solution in aqua
fortis by iron, Having done over the substance to
be bronzed with either isinglass size, japanners' gold
size, or, in some cases, with drying oil or oil paint,
the powders are rubbed on, taking care that the
projecting parts receive more of the powder than the
cavities, to imitate the brightness on those parts of
bronze which are liable to be rubbed.
               To take Casts from Medals.
   To take copies of medals, a mould must first be
made ; this is generally either of plaster of Paris, or
of melted sulphur.
   Having oiled the surface of the medal with a bit
of cotton wool dipped in oil of olives, put a hoop of
paper round it, standing above the surface of the
thickness you wish the mould to be. Then take
some plaster of Paris, mixed with water to the con
sistence of cream, and with a brush rub it over the
surface of the medal, to prevent air holes appearing ;
add more plaster immediately to make it sufficiently
thick. In about half an hour it will be so hard you
may take it off'; then pare it smooth on the back
 and round the edges neatly. Dry it before a brisk
 fire, if the weather be cold or damp.
    To prepare this mould for casting sulphur or
 plaster of Paris in, take half-a-pint of boiled linseed
 oil, and one ounce of oil of turpentine, mix them

100           KECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
together in a bottle ; when wanted, pour some of it
into a flat vessel, and dip the surface of the mould
in it ; take the mould out, and when it has sucked
in the oil, dip it again. Repeat this till the oil
begins to stagnate upon it ; then, with a little cotton
wool rolled hard, wipe it carefully off. Lay it in a
dry place for a few days, and it will acquire a very
hard surface.
   To cast plaster of Paris in this mould, proceed is
above directed for obtaining the mould itself, fint
oiling the mould with olive oil.
   If sulphur casts are required, it must be melted
in an iron ladle.
   Sulphur must not be poured on silver medals, as
it will tarnish them.
             Another Method with Isinglass.
   Dissolve isinglass in water over the fire, with a
 hair pencil lay it over the medal, and let it dry.
 When it is hard raise it up with the point of a pen
 knife, and you will have a sharp impression of the
medal.
   Breathe on the concave side of the impression,
and lay gold leaf on it, which, by shining through,
 will make it appear like a gold medal, or like a cop
per one by mixing a little carmine with the isinglass,
 and laying gold leaf as before ; or any colour may
 be given to the isinglass by mixing the requisite
 colour with it.
 To make Sulphur Red or Green, or to resemble Marble.
   Take two ounces of the best stone-brimstone, and
melt it slowly over a gentle fire ; then add an ounce
 of vermilion, stir them well together, and pour the
 composition over the surface of the mould, imme
diately pour it off again, and fill the mould to a
 proper thickness with common brimstone; let it
stand to cool, pare it, and rub the surface with clean

cotton to give it a polish. To make it green, add
the same quantity of the best smalt, instead of
vermilion ; but it requires more stirring to mix
properly.
                  To imitate a beautiful Marble.
    Mix with the brimstone any several colours sepa
 rately, and make them into squares of equal sizes ;
 dispose them according to your fancy, in an iron
 frame that will open with a joint ; then melt them
 together, and the colours will unite in a pleasing
 manner, and each will appear distinct. When you
  melt it, be careful not to shake it, and let it cool
  by degrees.
      Sulphur may be made to have a more solid me
  tallic appearance, by rubbing it over with powder

                     The Self-Amoving Orrery.
       The Busby Orrery, unquestionably the most beau
   tiful contrivance of modern times, for the popular
    exhibition of astronomical phenomena, ranks nigh,
    as well for its mechanical merit as its singular beauty
    of action: it is properly termed a self-acting ma
    chine, and, to the eye ol taste, is equally charming
    in its conception, its organization, and its effect; and
    of which the following is a description :
        In the centre of Mr. Busby's exhibition room
     was placed a circular reservoir, five feet diameter.
     (See Fig. 23.) The Sun, represented by a ball of
     nine inches diameter, sustained upon a slender shaft,
     about two feet above the surface of the water, was
     borne by a small circular floating vessel in the mid
      dle of the reservoir ; this vessel carried a syphon,
      which discharged a minute lateral stream into a
      separate floating rim, or concentric circular vessel
      which surrounds it. The re-action of this discharge
      causes the vessel bearing the Sun to revolve upon an
                                K 2

102          RECHEATIONS IS SCIENCE.
axis erected in the centre of a bar, extended dia
metrically across the inner circle of the rim, or
surrounding vessel. The water thus received into
the room flows along a tube beneath the surface of
a reservoir, and enters a floating cylindrical chamber
at the other extremity. In the centre of this cham
ber a tube is erected, through which a forked rod
passes, and bears the Earth, represented by a ball of
three inches diameter, at an approximate elevation,
and having its axis duly inclined to the ecliptic.
A separate floating rim surrounds the cylindric
chamber, bearing the shaft which carries the Moon
on one side, and a re-acting syphon on the other,
the discharge from which impels it round the shaft
which bears the Earth. This floating rim also acts,
by contact, upon a small wheel, attached to a slender
rod, communicating by an universal joint with the
axis of the Earth, and thus causes that body to
revolve ; while the action of a vertical wheel, with
a radiating axis rolling round a horizontal circle
fixed to the rod sustaining the Earth, gives motion
to a small crank, which imparts an ascending and
descending motion to the Moon, and produces the
obliquity of its orbit ; and a calculated disparity
between the diameters of the vertical wheel, and
the circle upon which it rolls, causes these ascending
and descending motions to take place in a less period
than one revolution of the Moon, and thus gives
the due changes of the nodes.
   The shaft which bears the Earth is continued
beneath the surface of the water, and a flat plate,
of six inches diameter, is connected with a plate of
equal diameter at the circumference, by three pa
rallel and oblique rods extending to it at the bottom
of the centre of the reservoir, thus preserving the
parallelism of the Earth's axis on a principle ana
logous to that of a parallel ruler, at the same time
the lateral motion of the centre vessel bearing the
Sun is prevented by a spur, which embraces the
circumference of the plate beneath.
   But, as the water which is discharged by the two

              RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.               H)3:
 syphons already described, would soon fill the recep
 tacles, the operation of a third syphon is introduced,
 which carries away the superfluous water, and by its
lateral discharge on the outside of the general re
servoir, gives the annual motion of the Earth and
Moon about the sun.
    We have thus attempted to describe the construc
tion of this beautiful machine ; but description does
but imperfectly convey an idea of its novelty and
beauty of action.
              Another simple Hygrometer.
   The following is the most lasting and convenient
mode of constructing an instrument of this kind.
   Take a very nice balance, and place in it a sponge,
or other body, which easily imbibes moisture, and
let it be in equilibrio, with a weight hung at the
other end of the beam. Now, it the air become
moist, the sponge becoming heavier will preponde
rate ; if dry, the sponge will be raised up. The
balance may be contrived two ways; by either
having the pin in the middle of the beam, with a
slender tongue, a foot and a half long, pointing to
the divisions on the arched plate fitted to it ; or,
the other extremity of the beam may be made so
long, as to describe a large arch on a board placed
for the purpose.
   To prepare the sponge, it maybe necessary to
wash it in water, and when dry, in water or vinegar,
in which sal-ammoniac or salt of tartar has been
dissolved, and let it dry again : then it is fit to be
used.
                   Chinese Shadows.
   This ingenious instrument consists in moving, by
pegs fastened to them, small figures cut out of
pasteboard, the joints of which are all pliable, be
hind a piece of fine painted gauze, placed before an

104           KECKEATIONS IN SCIENCE.
opeuing in a curtain, in such a manner as to exhi
bit various scenes, according to pleasure ; while the
opening covered with gauze is illuminated, towards
the apartment where the spectators sit, by means of
light reflected back from a mirror, so that the sha
dows of the pegs are concealed. When it is requisite
to cause a figure to perform a variety of movements,
it is necessary to have several persons, who must be
exceedingly expert. When a snake is to be repre
sented gliding, the figure, which consists of delicate
rings, must be directed, at least, by three assistants.
   This amusement, which one can hardly see the
first time without pleasure, is a Chinese invention.
Many years ago, Chinese boxes were seen, on which
such moveable figures were apparent only when the
box was held against the light. In China, these
shadows are used at the well known feast of lan
terns.
                        Gilding.
   Fifty thousand pounds worth of gold and silver
are said to be annually employed in Birmingham in
filding and plating, and, of course, for ever lost as
  ullion.
                      Dry Gilding.
   Dry gilding, as it is called by some workmen, is a
light method of gilding, by steeping linen rags in
a solution of gold, then burning them, and with a
piece of cloth dipped in salt water, rubbing the
ashes over silver intended to be gilt. This method
requires neither much labour, nor much gold, and
may be employed with advantage for carved work
and ornaments.
                     Gold Varnish.
    Take gum lac, which, having freed from all impu
 rity, put into a small linen bag, and wash it in pure

             RECUSATIONS IK SCIENCE.                105
water, till the water no longer becomes red : then
take it from the bag and dry it. When it is per
fectly dry, pound it very fine to an impalpable pow
der. Then take four parts of spirit of wine and
one part of the gum, mix these well together, and,
having put them into an alembic, graduate the fire
so that the gum may dissolve. When dissolved,
strain it through "a piece of strong linen cloth, and
preserve the liquor in a glass bottle closely corked.
This is the gold varnish, which may be employed
for gilding any kind of wood. It is to be applied
as follows : With a very soft brush dipped in the
liquor, wash over gently, three times, the wood
which has been silvered ; letting it dry between the
application of each coat of varnish, it will be ex
tremely beautiful, and resemble the finest gold.
                 Artificial Mahogany.
   The following method of giving any species of
wood of a close grain the appearance of mahogany
in texture, density, and polish, is said to be practised
in France with such success, that the best judges
are incapable of distinguishing between the imita
tion and mahogany. The surface is first planed
smooth, and the wood is then rubbed with a solution
of nitrous acid. One ounce and a half of dragon's
blood, dissolved in a pint of spirits of wine, and
one-third of an ounce of carbonate of soda, are
then to be mixed together and filtered, and the
liquid in this thin state is to be laid on with a
brush. This process is repeated, and in a short in
terval afterwards the wood possesses the external
appearance we have described. When the polish
diminishes in brilliancy, it may be restored by the
use of a little cold-drawn linseed oil.
                 New Stain for Wood.
   The new stain proposed by Mr. Hill consists of a
decoction of walnut or hickory bark, with a small

 106         RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
 quantity of alum dissolved in it, in order to give
 permanency to the colour. Wood of a white colour
receives from the application of this liquor a beau
tiful yellow tinge, which is not liable to fade. It is
particularly adapted for furniture made of maple,
particularly that kind of it which is called bird's-
eye, and which is commonly prepared by scorching
its surface over a quick fire. The application of
the walnut dye gives a lustre even to the darkest
shades, while to the paler and fainter ones it adds a
somewhat greenish hue, and to the whiter parts va
rious tints of yellow. After applying this stain to
cherry and apple wood, the wood should be slightly
reddened with a tincture of some red dye, whose
colour is not liable to fade. A handsome dye is
thus given to it, which does not hide the grain, and
which becomes still more beautiful as the wood
grows darker by age.
                    Hatching Fith.
   The Chinese have a method of hatching the
spawn of fish, and thus protecting it from those ac
cidents which ordinarily destroy so large a portion
of it. The fishermen collect with care, on the
margin and surface of waters, all those gelatinous
masses which contain the spawn of fish. After they
have found a sufficient quantity, they fill with it
the shell of a fresh hen egg, which they have previ
ously emptied, stop up the hole, and put it under a
sitting fowl. At the expiration of a certain num
ber or days, they break the shell in water warmed
by the sun. The young fry are presently hatched,
and are kept in pure fresh water till they are large
enough to be thrown into the pond with the old fish.
The sale of spawn for this purpose forms an impor
tant branch of trade in China.

  Extraordinary Diversity of Colours used in Mosaic
                           Work.
    In Mr. Cadel's Travels, an account is given of
 the manufacture of mosaic, in which it is stated,
 that 17,000 tints of colour are employed in imitat
 ing the finer paintings. In a very amusing work of
 the celebrated Goethe, entitled " Winkelmann und
 Seit Jahrhundert," it is stated that about 15,000
 varieties of colour are employed by the workers in
 mosaic at Rome, and that there are 50 shades of
 each of these varieties, from the deepest to the
palest, thus affording 750,000 tints, which the artist
can distinguish with the greatest facility. We
should imagine, with the command of 750,000 tints
of colour, that the most varied and beautiful paint
ing might be perfectly imitated ; yet this is not the
case, for the mosaic workers find a want of tints,
even amidst this astonishing variety.

               Composition of Ancient Statues.
    According to Pliny, the metal used by the Ro-
inans for their statues, and for the plates on which
they engraved inscriptions, was composed in the
following manner. They first melted a quantity of
copper, into which they put one-third of its weight
of old copper, which had been long in use ; to every
 100 lbs. weight of this mixture they added 124 lbs.
of an alloy composed of equal parts of lead and tin.
    New Method of making Single Microscopes of Glass.
     Take a piece of platinum leaf, about the thickness
 of tinfoil, and make two or three circular holes in
 it, from one-twentieth to one-tenth of an inch in
  diameter, and at the distance of about half an inch
  from each other. In the holes put pieces of glass,
  which will stick in them without falling through,
  and which are thick enough to fill the apertures.
  "When the glass is melted at the flame of a candle
  with the blow-pipe, it forms a lens which adheres
  strongly to the metal, and the lens is therefore
  formed and set at the same time. The pieces of
  glass used for this purpose should have no mark of
  the diamond or file upon them, as the mark always
  remains, however strongly they are heated by the
  blow-pipe.
     The lenses which are larger than one-tenth of an
   inch, are not so good as the rest, and the best are
  even of a smaller size than one-tenth. The reason
   for using platinum is, that the glass is more easily
   and more perfectly melted in this than in any other
   metal, which may arise, perhaps, from its requiring
   a more intense heat to fuse it, or to impair its.
   brightness.

110          RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
On the application of the Kaleidoscope to the Magic
   Lantern, Star Microscope, and Camera Obscura.
   The general principle of the apparatus requisite
for this purpose, is shewn at Fig. 24, where CDGF
is the tube containing the reflectors A O E, &c.
The objects from which the pictures are to be cre
ated are placed in the cell C D, which may be made
either to have a rotary movement round the axis of
the tube, or to slide through a groove, like the sli
ders of a magic lantern. These objects are power
fully illuminated by a lens B, which concentrates
upon them the direct light of the lamp or candle at
H, and also the part of the light which is reflected
from the mirror M N. At the eye end E of the
kaleidoscope is placed a lens L L, close to the end
of the reflectors, and having its centre coincident
with the centre of the aperture at E. In order
that this lens may form behind it an image P F of
the objects placed in the object plate CD, its focal
length must be less than the length A E of the
plates. If the focal length of LL is so small as
one half of A E, then it follows, from the principles
of optics, that the distance L P at which the image
is formed behind the lens, will be precisely equal to
the distance A E of the object ; but this is obvi
ously too small a distance, for the diameter of P P
would be equal only to the apparent diameter of the
circular aperture of the kaleidoscope, or to twice
A O. Hence it is necessary, that the focal length
of the lens L Ij be less than A E, and greater than
half of A E. Two-thirds, or three-fourths of A E
will be found a suitable focal length ; for if it is
larger than this, the image will be formed upon the
 wall at two great a distance from the instrument.
   When the instrument is thus fitted up, an en
larged image of the pattern will be thrown upon the
waU, or screen, or any white ground. By turning
the object plate round its centre, or, if it is a recti
lineal one, by pushing it through the groove, and

             RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.               Ill
it the same time giving it a rotary motion, the
pattern on the wall will undergo every possible
transformation, and exhibit to the spectators, in a
magnified form, all those variations which would
have been observed by applying the eye to the ka
leidoscope.
   When the preceding apparatus is used in day.
light, so that the objects are illuminated by the
rays of the sun, the mirror M N is unnecessary.
The kaleidoscope, &c. must, however, be attached
to the part of the frame of a solar microscope,
which goes into the aperture in the window shutter.
   As the most brilliant light is obtained from the
burning of oxygen, an oxygen lamp is peculiarly
fitted for displaying the pictures of the kaleidoscope
to a number of spectators.
   The patterns which are created by the compound
kaleidoscope from natural objects, or from objects
independent of the instrument, may in like manner
be exhibited to several spectators at once. If the
objects are in a room, such as bunches of flowers,
statues, human figures, or large pictures, they must
be placed in one apartment, and strongly illumi
nated. The lens must then be placed upon the end
A O of the kaleidoscope, the object plate C 1)
having been removed, and must be so adjusted, that
the images may fall exactly upon the end A O of
the reflectors. The objects may be placed at any
distance from, the lens, from six inches to twelve
feet, according to their magnitude, and the pictures
will be exhibited with great distinctness and effect
upon the wall of the other apartment. If a blazing
fire is employed, the most brilliant display of fire
 works may be exhibited. When the objects are out
 of doors, such as trees, shrubs, &c. the kaleidoscope,
 with its two lenses, must be fixed on the circular
 opening of a window shutter, and the picture re
 ceived upon a screen, as in the camera obscura.
    Similar effects may be produced in a portable ca
 mera obscura, by placing the apparatus CFLLDG
 in the moveable drawer of that instrument. If the

   lens I, L is of such a focal length as to admit the
   formation of the image within the instrument, the
   picture will be finely displayed upon the ground
   glass, and may be copied with great exactness.
      In order to render the effect as brilliant as possi
   ble, the inclination of the reflectors should, in the
   present case, never exceed 30°, or might be even
   36° or 45°. The objects should be selected as thin
   as possible, and none with dark tints ought to be
   admitted into the object plates.
           To render Ivory or Boxwood luminous.
      Place an ivory ball on the prime conductor of the

  of a Leyden bottle through its centre, the ball will
  appear perfectly luminous ; but if the charge be
  not taken through the centre, it will pass over the
  surface of the ball and corrode it. A spark taken
  through a ball of boxwood not only illuminates the
  whole, but makes it appear of a beautiful crimson,
  or rather fine scarlet colour.
                    The Invisible Girl.
     This very ingenious apparatus was publicly exhi
 bited both at Bristol and London for a considerable
 period, during which time no discovery was made of
 its internal mechanism ; and it is probable that its
 construction would have remained a secret to all
 but the exhibitors, but for the ingenuity of Mr.
(now Professor) Millington, who, in a course of
lectures delivered in the winter of 1806, explained
the manner in which it was performed.
    The visible part of the apparatus connected with
the invisible girl was thus constructed : first, a ma
hogany frame resembling a bedstead, having at the
corners four upright posts about five feet high, was
united by a cross-rail near the top, and two or more

                 RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.             US
cross-rails near the bottom to strengthen the frame,
which was about four feet square. The frame thus
constructed was placed upon the floor, and to the
top of each of the four pillars were attached as
many strong bent brass wires, converging towards
the top, where they were secured by a crown and
other ornaments. From these wires a hollow cop
per ball was suspended by slight ribbons, so as to
cut off all possible communication with the frame.
The globe thus supported was supposed to contain
the invisible being, as the voice apparently pro
ceeded from the interior of it: and, for this pur
pose, it was equipped with four trumpets, placed
round it in a horizontal direction, and at right an
gles to each other : the trumpet mouths coming to
 within about half an inch of the respective cross-
 rails of the frame surrounding them.
     When a question was proposed, it was asked from
 any side of the frame, and spoken into one of the
 trumpets, and an answer immediately proceeded
 from the whole of them, so loud as to be distinctly
 heard by the enquirer, and yet so distant and feeble,
 that it appeared as if coming from a very diminutive
 being. In this the whole 01 the artifice consisted ;
 and the variations were so contrived, that the an
  swer might be returned in several languages ; a kiss
  might be returned, the breath producing the voice
  .was felt, and songs were sung, accompanied by the
  piano-forte, &c. To produce this allusion, the sound
  was conveyed by a tube, in a manner similar to the
  old and well known contrivance of the speaking bust ,-
  the invisible girl only differing in one circum
  stance ; that an artificial echo was produced by
  means of the trumpets and hollow globe, in conse
  quence of which the sound was completely reversed.
     In the invisible girl, the orifice of the tube was
   in one of the hand-rails just opposite the mouth of
   one of the trumpets, the opening being concealed
   by reeds and other mouldings; the tube itself,
   which was about half an inch in diameter, ran
   through half the hand-rail, then down one of the

corner posts, and from thence under the floor till it
reached a lpree deal case, almost similar to an in
verted funnei, along the side of which it rose till it
came nearly in contact with the ear of the confede
rate, who, with a piano-forte, &c. was concealed in
this case. Any question asked by a voice directed
into one of the trumpets, was immediatelv reflected
back from the concave interior surface of the globe
to the orifice of the tube, along which it was con
veyed, so as to be distinctly heard by the person in
the deal case, who returned the requisite answer,
 which appeared to come precisely from the interior
 of the globe. A small hole, closed with glass, was
 likewise left through the deal case, and side wall of
 the apartment, by means of which the concealed
 person had an opportunity of observing and com
 menting upon any circumstance which occurred in
 the room.

membrane, will cause the sand on its surface to form
regular lines and figures with astonishing celerity,
 which vary with the sound produced, affecting a
particular mode of division, according to the num

                      Damp Walls.
    A hall, of which the walls were constantly damp,
 though every means were employed to keep them
 dry, was intended to be pulled down, when M.
 Scnmitthals recommended, as a last resource, that
 the walls should be washed with sulphuric acid. It
 was done, and the deliquiescent salts being decom- .
 posed by the acid, the walls dried, and the hall was
 afterwards free from dampness.
                    Forest Vegetation.
     There are some singular facts related relative to
  the antiquity of trees, in Major Hooke's sketch of
  the forest of Sherwood. Upon some timber cut
  down in Berkland and Bilhaugh, letters have been
  found cut or stamped in the body of the trees, de
  noting the king's reign in which they were marked.
  The bark appears to nave been cut oft", and then the
  letters to have been cut in : after which, the next
  year's wood grew over it without adhering where
  the bark had been cut. The cyphers in this case
  were found to be of James the First, William and

 116           RErREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
 Mary, and (one) of King John. One of the cyphers
 of James was about one foot within the tree, and
 one foot from the centre : it was cut down in 1786.
 The tree must have been two feet in diameter, or
 two yards in circumference, when the mark was
 cut. A tree of this size is generally estimated at
 120 years' growth; which number being subtracted
 from the middle year of James's reign, would make
 1492, about the date of the planting of the tree.
 The tree with the cypher of William and Mary
 displayed that mark about nine inches within the
 tree, and three feet three inches from the centre :
 this tree was also cut down in 1786. The cypher
 of John was eighteen inches within the tree (which
 was cut down in 179 1), and rather more than a foot
from the centre. The middle of John's reign was
 1207, from which subtracting 120, the number of
years requisite for a tree's growth to arrive at the
 diameter of two feet, the date of its planting would
appear to have been 1085, or about twenty years
after the Conquest. But, then, this tree, when cut
down in 1791, must have been 706 years old, a fact
scarcely credible: for it appears from trees whose
 marks are better authenticated, that those exactly of
the same size, when marked, had increased twelve
inches in diameter in 173 years, whilst this tree had
encreased no more than eighteen inches in 584
years. Major Rooke says, that several trees with
this mark have been cut down, so that deception or
mistake is scarcely possible.

 The probability of Two Heads being thrown with
                      Halfpence.
   If, in tossing up two halfpence, the probability
was required of their being both heads, it must first

118           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
be considered, that the probabilities of throwing a
head with the first halfpenny is 4, as there is one
chance for a head, and two chances in all, (there
being both a head and a tail), and with the second
halfpenny the chances are the same ; therefore, 4
multiplied into 4, which is equal to i, will express
the probability required; showing that there are
four chances in all, but only one chance for the
event to happen, being three chances to one against
it happening : and this will appear true by consi
dering, that with the head of the first halfpenny,
either the head or tail of the second may be com
bined ; and the same with the tail of the first half
penny, making together four combinations, being,
head, tail ; tail, head ; head, head ; and tail, tail.
 These are all the ways that two halfpence can come
up, and there being only one way out of four for
 them to come up head, head, the chances are three
 to one against it happening, as above.

the edge of each speculum stands upon the diameter

         Gigantic Meteorological Motion Harp.
   Captain Haas, of Basle, has designated by these
an apparatus which emits of itself a variety of
sounds during a change of weather. Since the year
1787, he had stretched above his garden fifteen iron
wires, three hundred and twenty feet long, and at
the distance of about two inches from one another :
the largest wire was two lines in diameter, the
smallest one line, and those of intermediate size
one line and a half. They were situated towards
the south, and are inclined 20° or 30° to the horizon,
being stretched by means of rollers, properly ar
ranged for the purpose. Whenever the weather
changes, these wires sound with such loudness that
it is impossible to go on with a concert in the house.
The sounds sometimes resemble the hissing noise of
water rapid in ebullition, sometimes that of an har-
monicon, and sometimes that of a distant chime, or
an organ.
   The inventor of this curious apparatus is Mr.
Ventau, provost at Burkli, not far from Basle. He
sometimes shot at a mark from his window, and in
order that he might not go to the mark at each shot,
he attached to it a long iron wire to draw it to him

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.             121
 at pleasure. He remarked more than once that the
 wire sounded exactly an octave ; and he found that
 every iron wire, stretched in a direction parallel to
 the sounds, emitted this tone at every change of

   A brass wire did not produce any sound, nor did
 an iron wire when it was stretched from east to
west.
   M. Dobereiner, of Jena, conceives that the phe
 nomenon now described, is the effect of an electro
magnetic action ; and he proposes to try if the
brass wire would not sound when it communicates
at its extremity with an energetic electrometer.
                Action of Water on Glass.
   Glass is most extensively used for vessels for con
taining both fluid and dry substances, which it is
desirable to preserve in a state of purity, and it is
believed to be capable of resisting the action of even
strong chemical solvents. A most interesting me
moir, by Mr. Griffiths, places this subject, however,
in a very different view from that in which it has
usually been regarded.
   The inquiries of this ingenious chemist inform us,
that glass possesses highly alkaline properties, and
that they may be easily shewn by the usual tests.
The alkali separates from glass by the action of
pure water ; it appears to be potash, and its evolu
tion from the fragments of glass was much facilitated
by the application of heat to the water. By long
continued boiling in two or three successive portions
of water, flint glass in fine powder lost about 1 per
cent, of alkaline matter.
   Though the greater part of the experiments were
made on flint glass, it is not the only kind which
affords alkali to water. Crown glass, plate glass,
white enamel, and even the Newcastle green bottle
glass, exhibit alkaline qualities when acted upon by
pure water ; and Reaumer's porcelain, which is made
from green bottle glass, afforded like results.

122            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
   Whether we consider these researches with regard
to the glasses employed in the laboratory of the
chemist, or to contain medicines, or for the inconceiv
able variety of purposes to which they are applied in
domestic affairs, it must be evident that the glasses
so employed will be acted upon by water, and often
aided by other solvents, so as to remove the alkali in
the glass to a certain depth in the surfaces in contact
with the solvent. In some cases, the alkaline mat-
ter may be of use in neutralizing a slight tendency
to acidity ; but, in general, it must be injurious, and
particularly to chemical bodies.
    Mr. Griffiths examined some specimens of trans
parent and coloured ancient glass, and found them in
every case to contain more alkaline matter than any
modern glass containing lead hitherto examined;
 therefore it ceases to be a matter of surprise that
 the specimens of ancient glass are so frequently
 found in a state of rapid decay.
    The contact of ammoniacal, or decomposing ani
 mal matters, decomposes glass very rapidly. Stable
 windows, and bottles kept in such situations, often
 present a very beautiful iridescent appearance, some
 times inclining to a pearly, and sometimes to a
 metallic aspect, from the decomposition of the glass.
 Solution of potash acts rapidly on glass, and parti
 cularly at high temperatures; and it has been re
 marked, that flint glass bottles used for keeping solid
 carbonate of ammonia in, are invariably rendered
 more brittle, and pieces of glass sometimes fall out
 on a very slight motion of their contents.
                     Phantasmagoria.
     In the optical deception called Phantasmagoria,
  the object increases in brightness as it diminishes in
  size, or as it seems to retire, till it finally verges
  into a luminous point ; a mode of disappearance so
  unexpected as to destroy the illusion it is designed
  to produce. This defect Mr. William Ritchie pro

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                123
poses to avoid by the following method, by which the
disappearance of the objects may be rendered more
in accordance with what is supposed to take place
under the circumstances intended to be represented.
   He proposes to supply the light by a portable gas
lamp, with apparatus for increasing or diminishing
the supply ot gas to the burner at pleasure, which,
by a peculiar stop cock, might very readily be
accomplished. Then, by diminishing the light gra
dually, the brilliancy of the figure might be reduced
as it retires, its lineaments would become shadowy
and obscure, and at length vanish into thin air, as it
is expected a phantom would do.
To measure the Focal Distance ofa Globe of Water and
                         of Glass.
   Take a hollow globe of glass, or, instead of it, a
thin round flask or decanter, and making a moderate
round hole about an inch diameter, in a piece of
brown paper, paste it on One side of the belly of the
decanter; and having filled it with water, hold the
covered side to the sun, that the perpendicular
rays may pass through the middle of the water, and
the emergent rays will be collected to a focus, whose
nearest distance from the decanter will be equal to
the semi-diameter of the belly of it ; as will appear by
receiving the rays upon a paper, held at that dis
tance. That this effect is owing to the water, and
not to the glass, will be evident by emptying the
decanter ; for the light that passes then through
the hole, will then be as broad as the hole itself, at
all distances of the paper from the decanter. If a
similar experiment be tried, with a solid globe or
ball of glass, the distance of the focus from the near
est part of the ball will be one quarter of its diameter.

 the box ;
    3. A considerable number of pieces ofpliant paper,
from one to four inches square ; and
    4. Some small flat leaden weights, and a few small
 bound books.
    The plant is first to be cleared from the soil and
 decayed leaves, and then laid on the inside of one of
the leaves of a sheet of common cap-paper. The
upper leaves and flowers are next to be covered,
 when expanded, by pieces of the prepared paper, and
 one or two of the leaden weights placed on them.
 The remainder of the plant is now to be treated
 in a similar manner.
    The weights ought now to be gently removed, and
the other leaf of the sheet of paper folded over the
opposite one, so as to contain the loose pieces of
paper and plants between them. A book or two is
now to be applied to the outside of the paper till the
intended number of plants is thus prepared ; when a
box is to be filled with sand to the depth of an inch,
one of the plants put in, and covered with sand
sufficient to prevent the form of the plant from

succession, and likewise covered with a layer of sand,
one inch thick between each ; after which the whole

whole may be put into an oven gently heated. In
the course of two or three days the plants will be
perfectly dry, when the sand ought to be taken out

An Improvement of the Gulvanic Trough, to prevent
  the Cement from being melted when the Action it
  very powerful.
  A gentleman of Tunbridge has found that con
siderable advantage arises from making galvanic
troughs with glass partitions, for constructing gal
vanic batteries, on the principle of Volta's covronne
des tasses ; the superiority of which, he takes for
granted, to be fully established. In troughs con
structed on Mr. Wilkinson's plan, one material in
convenience is experienced : the increased action of
the acid on the zinc elates, arising from their hav
ing the whole of their surfaces exposed to it, occa
sions so great an heat, as frequently to melt the
cement, with which the wooden partitions of these
troughs are coated. Glass partitions completely
prevent the heat from having any bad effect. It is
best to make them so much larger than the metallic
plates, that a space of about half an inch may be
left between the sides and bottom of the trough,
and the extremities of the metallic plates. Com
mon crown glass is well adapted for this purpose, if
of thickness proportioned to the size of the parti
tions wanted, the upper edges of which should be
ground very smooth. In batteries constructed on
this plan the greatest intensity of excitation has
been found to do no injury whatsoever to the ce
ment.
How those who cannot Swim mag Float if they fall
                     into Water.
   Mr. William Nicholson has published some very
good directions for this object, the chief of which
are, that when a person fails into water, who has
not learned to swim, he should carefully avoid rais
ing his hands above the water, and then by moving
them under water, in any manner he chooses, his
head will rise high enough to enable him to breathe

                 RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.               127
 freely ; if he moves his legs, as in the action of
 walking up stairs, more of his body will rise above
 the water, which will allow him to use less exertion
 with his hands.
    To which we will add, that by throwing back the
 head and shoulders, so as to thrust out the chest to
 its greatest extent, and keeping it in that position,
 the volume of air contained in the lungs will be so
 much increased, as to add very considerably to the
 buoyance of the upper part of the body ; this alone
 would enable some people to float without using any
 motion of their limbs.
     Method of obtaining exact Copies of Inscriptions.
    The stone, or other matter, on which the inscrip
tion is cut, is to be first well washed and dried ; then
with printers' balls the surface is laid over with
printing ink, in the same manner as it is laid on
types ; one or more sheets of paper, according to
the size of the inscription, previously damped, are
then laid over it, and the impression taken off by
striking the paper with a clean printing ball, the
hand, or a brush. Three or four copies should be
taken in this manner, as the fourth is usually the
most perfect. As the inscription will be reversed
on the paper, it may be read off right at the other
side, by holding the paper against the light. If the
inscription is in relievo, the letters will be black ;
if in hollow, the letters will be white, and the ground
black.
   Beautiful Figures in Sand, S[c. produced by Sound.
   It has long been known that the agitations pro
duced in the air by a sounding body may be sufficient
to excite a second body placed even at a great dis
tance from the first, provided, however, that both
be capable of producing exactly the same number
of vibrations in the same time.

128            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
   Dr. Savarb has been making experiments with
stretched membranes, which, at the same time that
the thickness are very inconsiderable, present large
surfaces to the air, which puts them in motion. He
took, for example, a circular piece of thin paper, or
gold-beaters' skin, about ten inches in diameter, and
carefully stretched it by its circumference upon the
edge of a large glass vase ; on strewing the surface,
placed horizontally, with fine and dry sand, and
bringing a plate of glass in vibration within the
distance of nine or ten inches, and parallel with
the surface, the membrane entered into motion, and
the sand assumed figures, which were sometimes
perfectly regular, and which often formed them
selves with so much rapidity, that his eye had
scarcely time to perceive the circumstances which
accompanied the transformation of the light layer
 of sand into a greater or less number of quiescent
 lines. Various figures were thus obtained—stars,
 with four, six, ten, or more radiations, circles, &c.
 When the plate, instead of being parallel, was
 placed perpendicularly to one of the diameters of
 the surface, the sand formed itself into a system of
 quiescent lines, which generally were parallel with
 one another: one of these lines passed always
 through the centre of the membrane, and was con
 tained^ in the plane which passed through the face
 of the plate ; the direction of the motion conse
 quently continually changed with the direction of
 the vibrating plate. If, instead of holding the plate
 in the direction of perpendicular to that of the sur
 face, it was inclined ; at every degree of inclination
 the phenomena obtained were different, and the
 lines traced by the sand continually modified them
 selves differently, although the number of vibra
 tions remained the same.
    The tones of the flute, trumpet, musical glasses,
  &c. or of the voice, produced the same results as a
  vibrating plate. When the tones were successively
  varied, for example, when a very slow air was per
  formed on the flute, at about nine or ten inches dis

                 RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.             129
lance from the membrane, the sand was agitated,
and traced lines, the combinations of which inces
santly varied with the sound produced. Stringed
instruments were not so well calculated to produce
these effects.
    These experiments were varied in a number of
ways, by employing membranes, of which the di
mensions, nature, and tension, as well as form, were
different : they always, however, presented analo
gous results.
                     Frozen Mercury.
    Some idea of the very low temperature of frozen
 mercury may be derived from the circumstance,
 that if a lump of it be dropped into a small quantity
 of water at the boiling point, it will abstract the
 caloric with such rapidity, that the mercury will
 instantly become fluid, and the hot water will at
 the same moment be converted to ice.

 whose hands it falls.
    When the despatch is composed, write the key-

                    Cohesion of Water.
    If a glass be filled to the brim with water, and
 several small articles, as counters for instance,
 dropped in, what is the reason the water does not
 run over the brim of the glass ?
    It is the natural quality of all dry substances to
 resist water in a small degree ; hence the top of the
 glass being dry, the counters not being so great as to
 overcome the resistance, and slipped in with a steady
 hand, the water will rise above the dry edge, with
 out running over, till so many are put in as to cause
 the weight of the heaped up part to overcome the
 repulsion of the dry edge. The truth of this may
 be proved by dipping your finger in the water
 and wetting the edge of the cup with it, upon which
 all the water which is above the rim of the cup will
 run over.
    Patent Crystallo Ceramie, or Glass Incrustations.
    Mr. Pellat's patent process for ornamenting glass,
called by its inventor Crystallo Ceramie, bids fair to
form an important era in the aft of glass-making.
By this process, ornaments of any description may
be introduced into the glass, so as to become perfectly
imperishable. The substance of which they are
composed is less fusible than glass, and at the same
time susceptible of contraction or expansion, which
latter desideratum is a matter of considerable im
portance, as, in the course of manufacture, the glass
varies both in the temperatare and dimensions. It
may previously be formed into any device or figure,
by either moulding or modelling, and may be paint
ed with metallic colours, which are fixed by expo
sure to a melting heat. The ornaments are intro
duced into the body of the glass while hot, by which
means the air is effectually excluded, the composi
tion being actually incorporated with the glass.

     A most important advantage to be derived from
tliis elegant invention, respects the preservation
of dates and inscriptions. Casts of medals and
coins present no equal security perpetuating them.
Had this art been known to the ancients, it would
 have preserved to us many interesting memorials.
 The inscriptions, when once incrusted in a solid block
 of crystal, like the fly in amber, will effectually
 resist for ages the destructive action of the atmos
  phere.
                        Hero's Altar.
     The great expansive force of steam was known
  at a very early period, and the engine contrived by
   Hero may be considered a sufficient illustration of
  this fact. The elastic power of air was also gene
  rally understood, and reference to Fig. 26, will fur
  nish a picturesque view of the application of this
  knowledge, to aid the purpose of idolatrous supersti
   tion described by the same philosopher, who was one
   of the builders of the church (now the mosque) of
   Saint Sophia.
     The altar A is supported by the base B, a com
  munication being made by the dotted aperture E.
  The lower vessel being filled with any inflammable
  fluid, the application of a few half extinguished
  embers to the top of the altar will expand the air
  contained within it, and, pressing on the surface of
   the fluid, it must ascend the tube C. The vase sup
  ported by the priest at D will then overflow, and
  the fuel will appear to blaze by super-human aid.

                   A Defence against Fire.
     Professor Palmer, of Hamburgh, has lately dis
  covered a means by which all inflammable matters,
  such as wood, paper, linen, &c. cannot only be
  secured from burning, but also be speedily extin
   guished when on fire. These means consist in a

 184            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
powder composed of one ounce of sulphur, one ounce
of red ochre, and six ounces of copperas water. To
render wood incombustible, it is first daubed over
with cabinet-maker's glue, after which the powder
is strewed over it ; and this operation, when the
wood becomes dry, is three or four times repeated.
When the powder is to be applied to linen or paper,
plain water is employed in the room of glue : in
other respects the process is the same, with this dif
ference only, that the operation is performed only
once or twice. When the powder is used for articles
already on fire, two ounces are sufficient to extin
guish a square foot of surface. Professor Palmer
intends to publish a full account of his invention,
and of the different methods of using it, and to show
how at the time of large conflagrations it may be
employed to most advantage to save the lives of men
and valuable articles.
  Method of preventing Iron and Steel from Rusting.
   C. Conte has found out a method of preventing
the oxydation of iron and sl'eel, or, to speak in lan
guage more generally understood, to prevent iron
and steel from rusting. This method consists in
mixing with fat, oil varnish, a halfat least, or rather
four-fifths, of well rectified spirits of turpentine.
This varnish is applied slightly, and in an equal
manner, by means of a sponge : after which the arti
cle is suffered to dry in a place sheltered from dust.
Articles varnished in this manner, it is said, will
retain their metallic brilliancy, and never contract
any spots of rust. This varnish may be applied also
to copper, of which it preserves the polish, and
brightens the colour. It may be employed in par
ticular with advantage, for preserving from altera
tion philosophical instruments, which, in the course
of experiments, are brought into contact with water,
and by those means are liable to lose their splendor,
and to become tarnished.

                Phosphorescence of Wood.
    Dr. Carradori, in a paper on the phosphorescence
of wood, asserts that phosphoric wood acquires by
putrefaction the properly of attracting and absorb
ing light, and of retaining it mechanically, To
make it shine, it is sufficient to expose it for some
time to the sun. A bit of wood, which the author
examined, continued to shine under oil for two
 whole days. In that situation, says Dr. Carradori,
it was not in contact with oxygen gas.
                 Botanical Experiment.
   A singular and ingenious method of multiplying
the tongue-leaved eucomis, or futillary, is described
in Professor Hedwig's collection of memoirs and
observations on subjects of Botany and Economy.
This futillary is called by Lamarck, Basile a epi
couronne. When this beautiful plant of the lily
kind is in full flower and vigour, the flowers, leaves,
and the upper part of the bulb must be cut, and
wrapped up in several folds of sized writing paper, so
that the whole be exactly covered. They are then
to be moderately compressed between two pieces of
board ; and at the end of some months several small
bulbs will be seen formed at the lower extremity.
I cultivate, (says C. Willeret, who has made known
the above observation,) this charming unilobed plant
in the National Botanic Garden at Nancy. It re

                      Orange Gas.
   In making some experiments in fluoric acid, M.
Unverdorben, a German chemist, obtained a gas
from a mixture of fluor-spar and chromate of lead,
with fuming sulphuric acid, which has some singu-
larproperties.
   The experiments were repeated by Professor
Berzelius, who found that it succeeded quite as
well when common concentrated sulphuric acid was
used. The gas was collected over mercury, in glass
flasks, lined with melted resin, and it is of an orange
red colour. It gradually destroys the resin, and
penetrates to the glass, which it decomposes ; when
ammoniacal gas is introduced, it burns with explo
sion. Water dissolves the orange gas, and yields an
orange-coloured liquid, which being evaporated to
dryness in a platina dish, leaves us a residue of pure
chromic acid, the fluoric acid volatilizing entirely.
This is the only known method which gives pure
chromic acid.
   If the gas be received in a platina vessel of some
depth, of which the sides have been slightly wetted,
and into the bottom of which the gas is made to de
scend, the water begins to absorb the gas, and, soon
after, crystals of a fine red colour, are seen to form
themselves round the opening of the metal tube
which conveys the gas, and the crystals collect so as
to fill the vessel. The matter deposited has the
appearance of red snow, and consists of crystallized
chromic acid. These crystals have a curious pro
perty. If they be heated to redness in a platina
dish, they begin first to melt, and afterwards, with
a slight explosion, accompanied by a flash of light,
they decompose into oxygen gas, and the green
oxide of chrome.

                  RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.            137
i liu in, a gas similar to the preceding is obtained. It
contains chrome combined with chlorine in such
 proportions, that the water, by its decomposition,
 causes the formation of hydrodoric and chromic
 acids. The gas is red, and may be collected over
 mercury, but it is very much charged with chlorine
 when the preparation is eifected by means of com
  mon concentrated sulphuric acid, whose water of
  combination destroys a certain quantity of the gas.
                   Windsor Mineral Waters.
      There are two springs in the Great Park at
   Windsor, which afford mineral water, and they
   have lately been much frequented; hence an ac
   count of their nature may not be unacceptable to
   the reader.
       These waters have been examined by Mr.
    Brando, from whose paper it appears that the water
    of one of the springs contains a larger proportion of
    saline matter than the other ; but the nature of the
    saline matter seems to be the same in both springs.
       Their taste is salt, and slightly bitter, without
    the smallest admixture of chalybeate flavour. The
    specific gravity of the stronger water is 1.0104,
    that of the weaker 1.0077- Of the former, 7073
     grains of water afforded, on evaporation, 88 grains
     of dry saline residue ; of the latter, 7054 grains of
     water yielded 65 grains of residue.
        The" 88 grains from the stronger water consisted

throw down carbonate of magnesia ; and it appears,
from Mr. Brande's trials, that the existence of car
bonate of soda is compatible with the other earthly
salts in a cold and dilute solution only.
               Improved Drawing Tablets.
   The extra stout drawing-boards, or card-boards,
as they are usually called, are liable to many de
fects. They are made by pasting several sheets of
paper togetner, in the manner of common paste
board, and are then pressed and rolled. In conse
quence of this process, it frequently happens that
a small portion ofpaste is left on the surlace, which,
escaping observation at first, causes injury when
a drawing is made on the board. In drawing,
also, if frequent re-wetting on a particular part be
necessary, the paste sometimes gives way, the
sheets separate, and blisters rise. It has been re
marked too, that drawings made on such boards,
and hung up in rooms where fires are seldom made,
spoil, from the tendency of the paste to mould or'
mildew. Another defect is, a hollow or spongy tex
ture, arising from the indiscriminate mixture of
linen and cotton fibres in the pulp of the paper,
and another, the deleterious effect of bleaching by
oxymuriate of lime, a process which, though it

makes the paper beautiful in appearance, leaves a
small portion of muriatic acid, which speedily de
stroys the fine and delicate tints laid upon it.
   In consequence of these defects, Mr. Steart, of
the Montalt paper-mills, near Bath, has submitted
to the Society of Arts specimens of drawing-boards,
which he calls Lino-Stereo Tablets, entirely free
from these defects, and which have been found to
answer every trial made of them. The only material
used in their manufacture is the best and purest
white. linen rags, all muslins, calicoes, and every
other cotton article being rejected : and they are
not composed of several sheets, but are moulded
from the pulp of any required thickness of one en
 tire mass, so that no separation of their parts can
 take place, either by wetting or mouldiness. These
 tablets are made with either a rough or a smooth
 lace, the former for drawings, made with pencil,
 chalk, or crayon, the latter for paintings in water-
 colours, or other delicate works. They are also
 tinted of various shades of drab-gray, sand-colour,
 &c., the pulp being dyed in the vat before it is made
 into doublets.
              Easily-acquired Secret Character.
    Mr. Allsop describes, in a letter to the Editor of
  the Technical Repository, a mode of secret writing
  which he has long used for making private notes
  and memorandums. It is simply to substitute the
  preceding or succeeding letter for the one used ;
  thus,—for the letter o, substitute b, for b, c, and so
  on. The following is a specimen :—

Apparatus for exhibiting the Simultaneous Rotation of
     two Voltaic conducting Wires round the opposite
                     Poles of Magnets.
    An apparatus of this description was constructed
 some time ago by Mr. T. Griffiths, and shewn at
 the London Institution during a course of lectures
 on Electro-magnetisn, delivered in 1823, by Pro
 fessor Brande. It consists of two copper wires, sus
 pended in the usual manner, and dipping into a
 shallow vessel of mercury, in which are placed two
 bar magnets with their opposite poles arranged
 above its surface. The connexion being established
 between the battery and the apparatus, the wires
 revolve round the magnets simultaneously, but in
  opposite directions. In this form of apparatus the
  necessity of stopping the single rotation, to exhibit
 its contrary movement by reversing the magnet, is
  avoided.

               Of the Combinations of the Cards.
      The tables here given are the basis of many re
   creations, as well on numbers, letters, and other
    subjects, as on the cards : and the effect is good, as
    that which seems to prevent collusion, that is, the

                RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.            141
shuffling of the cards is, on the contrary, the cause
from whence it proceeds.
   It is a matter of indifference what numbers are
made use of in forming these tables : we shall here
confine ourselves to such as are applicable to the
subsequent recreations ; any one may construct
them m such manner as is agreeable to the purpose
he intends they shall answer.
   To make them, for example, correspond to the
nine digits and a cypher, there must be ten cards,
and at the top of mne of them must be written one
of the digits, and on the tenth, a cypher; these
cards must be placed upon each other in the regular
order, the number 1 being on the first, and the cy
pher at bottom ; you then take the cards in your
left hand, and, taking off the two top cards, 1 and 2,
you place the two following, 3 and 4, upon them,
and, under those four cards, the three following, 5,
6, and 7 : at the top you put the cards 8 and 9, and,
at the bottom, the card marked 0, constantly plac
ing, in succession, 2 at top and 3 at the bottom, and
they will then be in the following order :
                8.9. .3.4. .1.2.. 5.6.7. .0
If you shuffle them a second time, in the same
manner, they will stand in this order :
                6.7. .3.4.. 8.9.. 1.2.3. .0
    Thus, at every new shuffle they will have a dif
ferent order, as expressed in the following lines :
         The 3rd shuffle .. 2.5.3.4.6.7.8.9.1.0
              4th „           9.1.3.4.2.5.6.7.8.0
              5th     „       7-8.3.4.9.1.2.4.6.0

              7th „           1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.0
 It is a remarkable property of this number, that
 the cards return to the order in which they were
 first placed, after a number of shufHes, which, added
 to the number of columns that never change the
 order, is equal to the number of cards : thus, the

number of shuffles is 7, and the number of columns
in which the cards marked 3, 4, &c. never change
their places is 3, which are equal to 10, the number
of the cards : this property is not common to all
numbers, the cards sometimes returning to the first
order in less number, and sometimes in a greater
number of shuffles than that of the cards.

    The construction of this table is very simple.
 The Ene Ao consists of the first twelve numbers.
 The line A b consists every where of units ; and
 second term 3, of the line B c, is composed of the
 two terms 1 and 2 in the preceding rank ; the third
 term 6, in that line, is formed of the two terms 3
 and 3 in the preceding rank; and so of the rest,
 every term after the first being composed of the
 two next terms in the preceding rank : and by the
 same method it may be continued to any number of
 ranks. To find by this table how often any number

13, as suppose 5 cards out of 8 : in the eighth rank
look for the fifth term, which is 56, and that is the
number required.

                       Electric Chime.
     Fig. 27 represents the arrangement of an electric
  chime. For this purpose, a series of about 1000
  groups of zinc, silver, and paper disks, are disposed
  in two columns, separately insulated in a vertical
   position : the positive end of one column is plaf
                                               /

146           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
lowest, and the negative end of the other, their
upper extremities being connected so as to form in
effect one series, having at each of its extremities a
small bell; between the bells a small ball is sus
pended by a thread of raw silk, so as to hang at an
equal ana very small distance from each of them if
unelectrified. The action of the column occasions
this ball to vibrate between the bells and produce
an electric chime, in which the variable action of
the instrument at different times is indicated
by an increased or diminished velocity of ringing-
There is a circular groove in the base of the instru
ment which receives the rim of a glass shade, by
which dust and moisture are prevented from im
peding its action.
          Rotation of Glass Tubes before a Fire.
   A most remarkable phenomenon is produced in
 glass tubes placed in certain circumstances. When
 they are laid before a fire in a horizontal position,
 having their extremities properly supported, they ac
 quire a rotatory motion round their axis, and also
 a progressive motion towards the fire. When the
 progressive motion of the tubes towards the fire is
 stopped by any obstacle, their rotation still continues.
 When the tubes are placed in a nearly upright pos
 ture, leaning to the right hand, the motion will be
 from east to west ; but if they lean to the left hand,
 their motion will be from west to east ; and the
 nearer they are placed to a perfectly upright posture,
 the less will the motion be either way.
    If the tube is placed horizontally on a glass plane,
 the fragment, for instance, of coach-window glass,
 instead of moving towards the fire, it will move
 from it, and about its axis in a contrary direction to
 what it had done before ; nay, it will recede from
 the fire, and move a little up hill, when the plane
 inclines towards the fire.
    The experiment succeeds best with tubes about

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                147
twenty or twenty-two inches long, which have in
each end a pretty strong pin fixed in cork, for an
axis.
                Singular Properties of Glass.
     When glass is suddenly cooled, it becomes exceed
ingly brittle ; and this brittleness is sometimes at
tended with very surprising phenomena. Hollow
balls made of unannealed glass, with a small hole in
them, will fly to pieces by the heat of the hand only,
if the hole by which the internal and external air
communicate be stopped with a finger. Some ves
sels, however, made of such unannealed glass, have
been discovered, which have the remarkable property
of resisting very hard strokes given from without,
though they shiver to pieces by the shocks received
from the fall of very fight and minute bodies drop
 ped into their cavities. The glasses may be made of
 any shape : it is only necessary that their bottom be
 thicker than their sides. The thicker the bottom
 is, the easier the glasses break. One whose bottom
 is three fingers' breadth in thickness flies with as
 much ease as the thinnest glass. Some of these
 vessels have been tried with strokes of a mallet
 sufficient to drive a nail into wood, and have not
 been broken. They have also resisted the shock of
 heavy bodies let fall into them from the height of
 two or three feet, as musket balls, pieces of iron, &c.
  &c. ; yet, taking a small shiver of flint, the size of a
  pea, and letting it fall only from the height of three
  inches, will occasion the glass to fly, sometimes at
  the very moment of the shock, sometimes in two
  seconds ; a bit of flint, no larger than a grain, drop
  ped into several glasses successively, though it did
  not immediately break them, yet, when set by, they
   all flew in less than three quarters of an hour.
      These experiments were made before the Royal
    Society ; and succeeded equally when the glasses
   were held in the hand, when they were rested on a

148          RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
pillow, put in water, or filled with water. It is also
remarkable, that the glasses broke upon having then-
bottoms slightly rubbed with the finger, though
some of them did not fly till half-an-hour after the
rubbing.
From the three Primary Colours, red, yellow, and blue,
   to produce the other Prismatic Colours, and all the
   intermediate ones.
   Provide three panes of glass of about five inches
square, and divide each of them into five equal parts.
Paint lightly three sheets of very thin paper, one
blue, another yellow, the third red ; then paste on
one of the glasses five pieces of the red paper, one
of which must cover the whole glass, the second
only the four lower divisions, the third the three
lower, the fourth the two lowest, and the fifth the
last division only. On the other glasses, the blue
and yellow papers must be pasted in like manner.
Have also a box of about six inches lone, of the
same depth and width as the glasses, black inside ;
let one end be open, and in the opposite end a hole
large enough to see the glasses completely. It must
also open at the top, that the glasses may be placed
in it conveniently.
   When you have put any one of these glasses in
the box, and the open end is turned toward the sun,
you will see five distinct shades of the colour it
contains. If you place the blue and yellow glasses
together, in a similar direction, you will see five
shades of green distinctly formed. When the blue
and red glasses are placed, a bright violet will be
produced : and by the red and yellow, the several
shades of orange.
   If, instead of placing these glasses in a similar
direction, you reverse them, and place the side of
the yellow glass by the top of the blue, you will
have all the various greens that are produced by
nature ; if the blue and red glasses are similarly

                  HECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                         149
placed, you will have all the possible varieties of
purples, violets, &c.; and, lastly, if the red and
orange glasses be so placed, there will be all the
intermediate colours, as the marygold, aurora, &c.
Several Letters that contain no meaning, being written
     upon. Cards, to make them, after they have been twice
    shuffled, give an answer to a question that shall be
    proposed : as, for example, What is Love }
     Let twenty-four letters be written on as many
 cards, which, after they have been twice shuffled,
 shall give the following answer :
               A Dream of Joy, that soon is o'er.
      First, write one of the letters in that line on each
 of the cards, (these letters should be written in capi
 tals in one of the corners of each card, that the
  words may be easily legible when the cards are spread
  open ;) then write the answer on a paper, and assign
  one of the twenty-four first numbers to each card,
  in the following order :
  A DREAM OF JOY THAT SOON IS O'EIt.
  1, '2,3,4,5,6, 7,8, 9,10,11, 12,13,11,15, 16,17,18,19,20,21, 22,23,24
      Next, write on another paper a line of numbers,
  from 1 to 24, and looking in the table for twenty-
  four combinations, you will see that the first number
  after the second shuffle is 21, therefore the card
   that has the first letter of the answer, which is A,
   must be placed against that number in the line of
   numbers you have just made ; (for the same reason,
   if you would have the answer after one shuffle, the
   cards must be placed according to the first column
   of the table ; or if after three shuffles, according to
   the third column ;) in like manner, the number 22
   being the second of the same column, indicates that
   the card which answers to the second letter, D, of
   the answer, must be placed against that number ;
    and so of the rest ; the cards will then stand in the
    following order :
                                 o 2

 From whence it follows, that, after these cards have
 been twice shuffled, they must infallibly stand in
 the order of the letters in the answer.
    You should have several questions, with their
 answers, consisting of twenty-four letters, written
 on cards ; these cards should be put in cases, and
 numbered, that you may know to which question
 each answer belongs ; you then present the ques
 tions, and when any one of them is chosen, you pull
 out the case that contains the answer, and shewing
  that the letters written on them make no sense, you
  then shuffle them, and the answer becomes obvious.
  On the Cause of regular Figures, formed by Hoar-
                          Frost on Windows.
     The following are among the principal causes of
  this curious phenomenon. 1. The natural force of
  crystallization. 2. The necessity of the hoar-frost
  extending itself along a plane surface, which retains
  the auAauA-VERsus tendency of crystallization.
  3. The numerous and varied resistances presented
  by the surface of the glass. 4. The imperfect and
  irregular conducting power of the glass, which is apt
  to produce in the vapours curvilineal motions, at the
  instant preceding their congelation. By placing a
' small copper disc on the outside of one of the panes
  of glass, it will be found that the corresponding part
  of the glass will always be free from hoar-frost.
   On the Apparent Direction of the Eyes in a Portrait.
     Dr. Wollaston observes, that when we consider
  the precision with which we commonly judge whe
  ther the eyes of another person are fixed upon our
  selves, it is surprising that the grounds of such
 judgment are not distinctly known, and that most
  persons, in attempting to explain the subject, would

              RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.               151
overlook some of the circumstances by which they
are generally guided.
   Dr. W. adverts to the influence of the form of
the iris, as announcing the direction of the eye in
portraits, and to that of the variable portion of the
white shewn when the eye is variously directed, in
living persons. He remarks, however, that even in
real eyes we are not guided by this circumstance
alone, but are unconsciously aided by the concurrent
position of the lace; and the apparent position of the
eyes is powerfully influenced by that of the adjacent
parts of the face, especially those which are most pro
minent ; and these considerations are not limited in
their application merely to cases of lateral turn of
the eyes or face, but the same principles also apply
to instances of moderate inclination of the lace
upwards or downwards ; for when the face is direct,
 ed downwards, the eyes that look at us must be
 turned upwards, from the position of the face to
 which they belong; and if to eyes so drawn an
 upward cast of features be substituted for the
 former, the eyes immediately look above us. From
 these details, the author concludes that the apparent
 direction of the eyes to or from the spectator de
 pends upon the balance of two circumstances com
 bined in the same representation ; namely, 1. The
 general position ofthe face presented to the spectator.
 2. The turn of the eyes from that position; and
 thence proceeds to examine why, if the eyes of a
 portrait look at the spectator placed in front of the
 picture, they appear to follow him in every other
 direction. When two objects are seen on the
 ground at different distances from us in the same
 rlirection, one appears, and must be represented, ex
 actly above the other, so that a vertical plane from
 the eye would pass through them : and since such a
 line will be seen upright, however far we move to
  one side, it follows that the same objects still seem
  to be in a line with us, exactly as in the front
  view, seeming, as we move, to turn from their first
  direction.

152           KECHEATIONS IN SCIENCE.
   In portraits, the permanence of direction, with
reference to the spectator, and corresponding change
of its apparent position in space when he moves to
either side, depends upon the same principles. The
nose drawn in front, with its central line upright,
continues directed to the spectator, though viewed
obliquely ; or, if the right side of the nose is repre
sented, it must appear directed to the right of the
spectator in all situations ; and eyes that turn in a
due degree from that direction toward the spectator,
so as to look at him when viewed in front, will con
tinue to do so when viewed obliquely.
  Method of taking very beautiful Impressions from
                         Leaves.
   Prepare two balls ofsmooth kid or chamois leather,
stuffed with wool ; moisten them with linseed oil ;
then take as much dry finely powdered colour which
will rub, as will lay on the point of a penknife, and
spread it over the balls : rub it in with a little more
oil, till they are smooth, and free from knots. Take
any fresh-gathered leaf, (those whose veins are most
prominent are best adapted for the purpose,) and
 place it between the balls, till every part of it is
 coloured : lay it between two pieces of paper, and
 press it lightly. The under sida of the leaf will
give the impression.
    Very elegant borders, taken off on satin, for ladies'
 dresses, may thus be procured ; also embellishments
lor hand screens, and various ornamental works.
                To marble Books or Paper.
    Dissolve four ounces of gum arabic in two quarts
 of fair water : then provide several colours mixed
 with water in pots or shells, and, with pencils pecu
 liar to each colour, sprinkle them, by way of inter
 mixture, upon the gum-water,which must be put into

              RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.               153
a trough, or some broad vessel ; then with a stick curl
them, or draw them out in streaks, to the greatest
variety. Having done this, hold your book close
together, and only dip the edges in, on the top of the
water and colours, very lightly; which done, take
them off, and the plain impressions of the colours in
mixture will be upon the leaves.
   Marbling books on the covers is performed by

                    Musical Glasses.
   The advantages of the musical glasses are, that
the tones are incomparably sweet beyond those of
any other instrument ; that they may be swelled
 and softened at pleasure, by stronger or weaker
 pressures of the finger, and continued to any length ;
 and that the instrument being once well tuned
 never again wants tuning. The following is a de
 scription of it.
    The glasses are blown as nearly as possible in the
 form of hemispheres, each having a stem by which
 it is fixed into a box or table. The number em
 ployed is sometimes 37, which are sufficient for the
 three octaves with all their semitones. A much
 larger number are occasionally used, but then two
 persons must play on them. The number usually
 employed is 17.
    The glasses are to be tuned by diminishing the
 thickness of those that are too sharp. This is done
 by grinding them round, from the neck towards the
 brim, the breadth of one or two inches, as may be
 required; often trying the glass by a well-tuned
 harpsichord, comparing the note drawn from the
 glass by your finger with the note vou want, as
 sounded by that string of the harpsichord. Much
 care is necessary, because, if you go below your
 required tone, there is no sharpening it again, but
 by grinding somewhat off the brim, which will after
 wards require polishing.

154           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
   When the glasses are not ground to the required
tone, the desired effect is obtained by putting water
into them, more or less, as each note requires ; then
mark each glass with a diamond or paint, when at
the proper height.
   The glasses are played upon with the middle
finger of each hand, which should be a little soaked
in water, and entirely free from soil ; sometimes, a
little fine chalk, or lemon juice in the water with
which the fingers are moistened, is useful to make
them bring out the tones more readily. The tones
are best drawn out when the fingers turn from, not
to, you.
    To distinguish the glasses more readily by the
eye, they are sometimes painted within side ; the
semi-tones white, the other notes of the octave
with the seven prismatic colours : viz. C, red ; D,
orange ; E, yellow ; F, green ; G, blue ; A, indigo ;
 B, purple; and C, red again; so that the glasses of
 the same colour (the white excepted) are always
 octaves to each other.
                  Vegetable Galvanic Pile.
    A galvanic pile has been constructed by a scien-
 tine gentleman, entirely of vegetable substances.
 For this purpose, he cut discs of horse-radish and
 beet-root, of two inches in diameter. He then pre
 pared equal discs of walnut-tree wood, which were
 raised at their edges, to contain a little solution of
 acidulous tartrate of potash in vinegar, in which
 they had been previously boiled, to free the wood
 from rosin. Sixty pairs of discs were employed in
 the following order ; viz. horse-radish, beet-root,
 discs of wood. The spinal marrow of a prepared
 frog was connected with the pile, by means of a leaf
  of cochlearia ; the muscles of the frog were connected
  with the top of the pile by means of a double band
  of grey paper, wetted with vinegar, and, as often as
  this circuit was completed, contortions were excited
  in the animal.

    In domestic economy, charcoal is invaluable.
From its property of retarding putrefaction, it sur
passes, as a preserver of meat, any thing we know '
of. Game, or any kind of animal food that has
been over-kept, will be rendered perfectly sweet
and wholesome by covering it with a few pieces of
fresh-burnt charcoal ; or, if it be far gone, boiling
it for some minutes in water, with a few ounces of
such charcoal, will effectually purify it.

                    Optical Tadpole.
  Make with ink, on white paper, a very black spot,
about half an inch in diameter, with a tail about an
inch in length, so as to resemble a tadpole: look
steadfastly for a minute on the centre of this spot,
and, on moving the eye a little, the figure of the
tadpole will be seen on the white part ot the paper,
which figure of the tadpole will appear more lumi
nous than the other part of the white paper ; which
can only be explained by supposing that part of the
retina, on which the tadpole was delineated, to have
become more sensible to light than the other parts
of it which were exposed to the white paper ; and
not from any idea of mechanical impression or che
mical combination of light with the retina.
          Restoration of the White in Painting.
   M. Thenard has lately applied his oxygenated
water with great success to the arts. It is constant
ly happening in paintings, where the white used is
prepared from lead, that sulphurous vapours change
the tint, and render it brown or black. Paintings of
the first masters are frequently injured in conse
quence of this effect, being blotted, as it were, with
spots of colour, which spoil the effect. An artist
at Paris, who possessed a design of Raphael's thus
disfigured, and who was too careful of the original
work to re-paint the places, applied to M. Thenard
for chemical assistance. That chemist, during his
attempts, remembering the effect of oxygenated
water in converting the black sulphuret of lead into
a white sulphate, sent some water, very slightly oxy-
genated, to the artist, who by applying it with a
pencil, instantly removed the spots, and restored the
white. The fluid was so weak as to contain not
more than five or six times its volume of oxygen,

between two horizontal and insulated rods of brass,
each terminated by a knob, and distant from each
 other between one and two inches ; then pass from
 one to the other a strong charge of a large electrical
battery : the plate of tin will be found pierced by
 two holes, with their burs in opposite directions.
That the experiment may succeed, the tin-foil should
be thin, and the charge strong, otherwise only two
impressions will be seen on the plate.
                     Preservation of Eggs.
     It is proposed to preserve eggs by covering them
  with a coat of gum arabic, rather than of varnish,
  and then to imbed them in charcoal. The gum is
  readily removed by water, and the charcoal preserves
  the eggs from any great and sudden change of tem
  perature in passing from one country or situation
  to another.
         Luminous Phenomena produced by a Flower.

  its effluvium most strongly after sunset. One sul

different intervals, but, during the whole evening,
its intensity seemed to be equable. He has subse
quently noticed that the smell from the flower is
most diffused in the light, but he has not again ob
served the singular electric phenomenon, though
he has nightly and attentively looked for it. Du
ring the time of the appearance of the flashes, or
sparks, he was anxious to ascertain whether their
emission was attended by a crackling or snapping
noise, as is the case when the electric spark is elici

attentive, he was not conscious of hearing the least
noise.

              Methods of polishing Shells.
   The art of polishing shells has but lately reached
its present state of perfection ; and as the admira
tion of sea shells has become so general, it may be
desirable to give some instructions in the means of
adding to their natural beauty.
   A shell which has a smooth surface, and a natural
dull polish, need only be rubbed with a piece of
chamois leather, on which is some tripoli, or fine
rotten stone, and it will become of a bright and fine
polish. A shell that is rough, foul, or crusty, or
covered with a tartareous coat, must be left a whole
day steeping in hot water ; when it has imbibed a
quantity of this, it is to be rubbed with rough emery
on a stick, or with the blade of a knife, to get the
coat off. After this, it is to be dipped in diluted
aquafortis, spirit of salt, or any other acid ; and
after remaining in it a few moments, be again
plunged in water. After this, it is to be well cleaned
with soap on linen cloth ; and when, by these several
means, it is made perfectly clean, the polishing is to
be finished with fine emery and a hair brush. If,
when dry, the shell has not so good a polish as may
be desired, it may be rubbed over with a solution of
gum arabic, which must not he so thick as to give a
sensible coat, only heightening the colours. If the
shell has an epidermis, which prevents the polishing
of it, it must be dipped several times in diluted
aquafortis, and, after remaining in it a few minutes,
be taken out, and plunged into common water. The
progress the aquafortis makes is to be carefully ob
served each time it is taken out. The point of the
shell, and any other tender parts, are to be covered
with wax ; also any worm holes ; and a long piece of
wax must be provided, and one end of it be made
entirely to cover the mouth of the shell, the other
will serve as a handle. When the repeated dippings
into the aquafortis shew that the coat is sufficiently
eaten away, then the shell is to be carefully wrought
with fine emery and a brush, and, when highly po-

                 RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                 161
lished, rubbed over with gum water or the white of
an egg. When it is only a pellicle that hides the
colours, the shell must be steeped in hot water, and,
after that, the skin worked off by degrees with an
old file.
 . "When a shell is covered with a thick and fatty
epidermis, aquafortis will do no service, as it will
 not touch the skin : then a rough brush and coarse
 emery are to be used ; if that does not succeed,
 seal-skin, or, as the workmen term it, fish-skin and
 pumice-stone are to be employed.
      These are the methods to be used with shells that
 require but a moderate quantity of the surface to
 be taken off; but many require to be uncovered
  deeper : this is called entirely scaling a shell. This
  is done by means of a horizontal wheel, impregnated
  with rough emery ; it is a work, however, of diffi
  culty. "Very often shells are cut down too far by it,
  and wholly spoiled; to avoid this, a coarse vein
   must often be left standing, and taken down after
   wards with the file, when the cutting down at the
   wheel would have spoiled the adjacent parts.
       After the shell is thus cut down to a proper de
   gree, it is to be polished with fine emery, tripoli, or
   rotten stone.
       When a shell is full of tubercles or protuberances,
   it is then impossible to use the wheel, and industry
    and patience are the only means of effecting a po
    lish. A camel's hair pencil must be dipped in aqua
    fortis, and with this the intermediate parts of the
    shell must be wetted, leaving the protuberances
    dry ; this is to be often repeated, and after a few
    moments the shell is always to be plunged into
    water, to stop the corrosion of the acid, which would
    otherwise cut too deep. When this has sufficiently
     cleansed the shell, it is to be polished with the finest
     emery, or tripoli, by means of a small stick ; or the
     common polishing stone used by goldsmiths may be
     used. There will probably remain several places
     which could not be reached by any instrument, so
     that the shell must necessarilv be rubbed over with

gum-water or the white of an egg afterwards, to
bring out the colours, and give a gloss ; in some
cases it is even necessary to give a coat of varnish.
   Shells are subject to many imperfections ; some
of which are natural, and others accidental. Besides
those arising from age and sickness in the fish,
morbid cavities, or protuberances occur where they
ought not. When the shell is valuable, these faults
may be hid ; the cavities may be filled with mastic
or isinglass, dissolved in spirit of wine; these must
be coloured to the tinge of the shell, or water-
colours must finish them up to the resemblance of
 the rest ; and then the whole shell being rubbed
 over with gum-water, or the white of an egg, scarce
 any eye can perceive the artifice ; the same sub
 stance may also be used to repair the battered edge
 of a shell, if the pieces chipped off be not too large.
 When the excrescences of a shell are faulty, they
 are to be taken down with a fine file. If the lip of
 a shell be so battered that it will not admit of re
 pairing by any cement, it must be filed down, or
 ground on the wheel till it becomes even.
               Dr. Brewster's Microscopes.
    The best method of constructing fluid micros
 copes, is to take Canada balsam, balsam of capivi,
 or pure turpentine varnish, and let a drop of any of
 them fall upon a thin piece of parallel glass. The
 drop will form a plano-convex lens, and its focal
 length may be regulated by the quantity of fluid
 which is used. If the lens is uppermost, the gravity
 of the fluid will make it more flat, and diminish its
 focal length : this, however, may be avoided, and
 the contrary effect produced, by inverting the piece
 of glass. If these lenses are preserved from dust,
 they will be as durable as those which are made of
 glass; and when thick Canada balsam is used, the
 lenses will soon be indurated into a hard gummy
 substance, and resist any change of figure from the
 gravitation of their parts.

    The same object, attained by modifying the com
mon method ; and this modification admits of our
extracting, with facility, the metallic vegetation from
tbe liquor, and preserving it, without any alteration,
out of the vessel in which it has been formed.
     The operation is very simple. In the nitric solu
 tions of mercury and silver, both being well satu
 rated and diluted with the quantity or water pre
 scribed by Baume, is suspended a small knot of fine
 linen rag, doubled up, and containing five or six
 drachms of very pure mercury.
     The metallic solutions soon penetrate to the mer
 cury, which is enclosed in the rag, and we soon see
 some beautiful spicuUe formed and grouped around
  the rag, adhering to the nucleus of mercury, which
  serves as a kind of support for them.
     These spiculre progressively increase in size, and,
  in a short time, exceed an inch in length.
      When we perceive that the metallic vegetation
  makes no more progress, the piece of rag with the
  spiculae may be withdrawn from the liquor, and, by
  menus of a silk thread fastened to the cork of the
  bottle, the whole may be suspended under a bell of
  glass. The crystals, which are tetrahedrons, may
  thus be kept as long as wanted.

prevent the bagging between line and line.
   New Optical Machine, called the Phantasmascope.
   In this apparatus, a concave mirror, fifteen inches
in diameter, is placed at the extremity of a box
about three feet long. The other end of this box
has at its upper part a circular hole, about half the
diameter of the mirror, through which the image
is reflected outwards ; and from its lower half a
sort of drawer, whose end next the mirror is taken
off, moves forwards and backwards as required ; at
the farther extremity of this drawer a sliding piece
is laid, that may be moved lengthwise in it by a
strong wire passing through the Iront of the drawer.
This sliding piece nas an upright partition attached
to it, that traverses the drawer, in which is a circu
lar aperture about three inches in diameter, over
which a painting of the image desired to be seen,
done on glass, or transparent paper, is placed ; be
hind this partition, two short candles are fixed,
whose light is partly reflected by a screen placed a
little way farther back, which prevents the image
of the inside of the drawer from being thrown on
the mirror. On the top of the drawer a tin cover
is fitted, to conceal the light ; and a lid rises up
wards from hinges in front of the top of the box,
which both conceals the mirror, and gives passage
to the smoke of the candles. The image, by this
apparatus, appears in the air about three or four
feet before the front of the box ; and, by drawing
the slide forward by the wire, seems to retire to a
distance ; and is made to advance again, by pushing
the slide towards the mirror.
   The effect of this method of throwing forward an

              RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.               J6S
image into the air, differs from that which is used
in the exhibition of the phantasmagoria, by its pro
ducing the phantom in a room, well illuminated,
the light of which rather increases the perfection of
of its appearance, while the other can only be shown
to advantage in a dark apartment. The phantom-
appears considerably more beautiful than the image
 drawn on the glass ; in painting which, care must
 be taken that all the parts of the glass surrounding
 the image be rendered perfectly opaque.
    Representations of the moon and the planets have
a very fine effect in the phantasmascope ; the images
for them are made by punching holes through thick
 paper, stained very black, and pasting it over rough-
ground glass.
    A pleasing appearance is also caused by introduc
 ing a small painting or coloured print, instead of
 the painting on glass, and placing the candles on the
 other side, between it and the mirror.
    Phantasmagoric Chronometer, or Nocturnal Dial.
     The exterior part of this apparatus consists of
 a vase, or ornamented case of any suitable materials,
 so constructed as to allow a free communication
 with the air, yet to prevent the rays of light from
  being visible, and having on one side a watch with
  two dials, and on the other a glass, or the combina
  tion of glasses, fixed in a sliding tube. The diame
  ter of this glass is an inch and three quarters, and
  the pins two inches and three quarters ; its use is
  to represent the nocturnal dial against the wall. A
  lamp is placed in the bottom of the vase, in such a
  manner as to be capable of being either taken out,
  or of having its position altered with respect to the
  magnifier of the dial. The exterior dial plate of
   the watch fixed in the side of the vase, is that of a
   common time-piece ; but the inner one is made
   concave instead of convex, and, as well as the hands,
  consists of any kind of polished metal. Upon this

 166          B.ECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
plate the numbers representing the hours are en
graved in a reverse manner. It is a little inclined
towards the light, and acts as a reflector to the light
of the lamp, which renders it visible against the
wall. This reflector or dial is supported by an arm
fixed upon one of the plates of the watch. A steel
centre is fixed upon the cock, and carries two cylin
ders, to which the hands, and the minute and hour
wheels are attached : these wheels are double,
namely, one on each side of the body of the watch,
and made to act in unison with each other by a
wheel and pinion.
   The mysterious circulator, which the patentee
states may be applied instead of the watch work
above described, or may be used as a separate time
piece, or as an orrery, consists of the work of an ho
rizontal or verticalwateh, fixed in a box or globe
representing the earth. A weight is attached to
the hour-hand wheel, and the box with the watch
and weight are fixed to one end of a lever, through
which a steel axis passes. The other end of the
lever carries a box, with a sufficient quantity of
lead to counterbalance the watch in every position
when in motion, and which is to be adjusted by
trials, as different time-pieces require different
weights. The whole of this apparatus rests upon
two jewelled supporters, or friction rollers, screwed
upon a stand, upon which is also fastened the sup
port for the rim, which serves as a dial, upon which
the hours and minutes are described. This rim
may be divided into twelve or twenty-four parts,
according to the construction of the time-piece : the
hours and minutes are shown by one hand only, or,
instead of which, a nonius may be applied to sub
divide the minutes.
   When this apparatus is to be used as a nocturnal
dial, the reflector above described is fixed to the
steel centre, and confined within the ornamental
case that contains the lamp and magnifier ; the hand
 showing the hours is likewise fixed within the case.

teeth, acting into a wheel with thirty teeth. The
axis of this last carries another pinion, the teeth of
which act upon a second wheel of thirty teeth, upon
the axis of which the bent arm that supports the
moon is fixed. This apparatus, turning round with
the box or globe to which it is attached, causes the
wheel which supports the moon to move one tooth
every day.

    In a large case, such as is used for dials and
spring clocks, the front of which, or, at least, the
lower part of it, must be of glass, covered on the
inside with gauze, let there be placed a barrel-or
gan, which, when wound up, is prevented from
playing by a catch that takes a toothed wheel at
the end of the barrel. To one end of this catch
there must be joined a wire, at the end of which
there is a flat circle of cork, of the same dimensions
 with the inside of a glass tube, in which it is to rise
and fall. This tube must communicate with a re
 servoir that goes across the front part of the bottom
 of the case, which is to be filled with spirits, such
 as is used in thermometers, but not coloured, that
it may be the better concealed by the gauze.
    This case being placed in the sun, the spirits will
 be magnified by the heat, and, rising in the tube,
 will lift up the catch or trigger, and set the organ
 in play, which it will continue to do as long as it is
 kept in the sun ; for the spirits cannot run out of
 the tube, that part of the catch to which the-circle
 is fixed being prevented from rising beyond a cer
 tain point, by a check placed over it.

room on which the sun shines strong, it may con
stantly remain in the same place, if you enclose it
in a second case, made of thick wood, and placed at
a little distance from the other. When you want
it to perform, it will only be necessary to throw
.open the door of the outer case, and expose it to
the sun.
   But if the machine be moveable, it will perform
in all seasons, by being placed before a fire ; and in
the winter it will more readily stop when removed
into the cold.
               Quantity of Air in Apples.
    Br. Hales found by experiment, that the air in
apples is so much condensed, that if it were let out
 into the common air, it would fill a space 48 times
 as great as the bulk of the apples themselves ; so
 that its pressure outwards was equal to 11,776 lbs.;
 and, in a cubic inch of oak, to 19,860 lbs. against its
 sides. So that, if the air was let loose at once in
 these substances, they would tear every thing to
 pieces about them with a force superior to that of
 gunpowder. Hence, in eating apples, it is well that
 they part with the air by degrees, as they are chew
 ed, and foment in the stomach, otherwise an apple
 would be immediate death to him who eats it.

How light Wood may be made to lie at the bottom of
                           Water.
    Let two pieces of wood be planed quite flat, so
as no water may get between them when they are
put together : let one of the pieces be cemented to
the bottom of a vessel, and the other piece be laid
flat and close upon it, and held down to it by a stick,
whilst water is poured into the vessel ; then remove
the stick, and the upper piece of wood will not arise
from the lower one ; for, as the upper one is pressed
down, both by its own weight, and the weight of all
the water over it, whilst the contrary pressure of
 the water is kept off by the wood under it, it will
 He as still as a stone would do in its place. But if
 it be raised ever so little at any edge, some water
 .will then get under it, which, being acted upon by
 the water above, will immediately press it upwards ;
 and, as it is lighter than its bulk of water, it will
 rise, and float upon the surface of the water.
           Improved Method of embossing Wood.
     Raised figures on wood, such as are usually em
  ployed in picture frames, and other articles of orna
  mental cabinet work, are usually produced by means
  of carving, or by casting the pattern in plaster of
  Paris or other composition, and cementing or other
  wise fixing it on the surface of the wood. The for
  mer mode is expensive, the latter is inapplicable on
  many occasions. This invention may be used either
  by itself or in aid of carving, and depends on the
  fact, that if a depression be made by a blunt instru
  ment on the surface of the wood, such depressed
  part will rise again to its original level by subse
  quent immersion in water.
     The' wood to be ornamented having been first
  worked out to its proposed shape, is in a state to
  receive the drawing of the pattern. This being put
  on, a blunt steel tool is to be applied successively to
                                                     /

all those parts of the pattern intended to be in relief,
and at the same time is to be driven very cautiously,
 without breaking the grain of the wood, till tfie
 depth of the depression is equal to the intended pro
minence of the figures. The ground is then to be
reduced, by planing or filing, to the level of the
depressed part : after which, the piece of wood being
placed in water, either hot or cold, the part previ-
onsly depressed will rise to its former height, and
will then form an embossed pattern, which may be
finished by the usual operations of carving.
        Plaster of Paris, for Moulds, Casts, 8[c.
   Put some powdered, calcined sulphate of lime
into a basin, and pour over it as much water as will
make it into a thin dough : mould this quickly into
any shape. Almost before the moulding is com
plete, the whole mass will be so hardened, that it
will require a heavy blow of a hammer to break it,
or reduce it again to powder.
   In preparing casts, moulds, &c., the plaster of
Paris always gives out heat when it begins to set, or
harden. This may be perceived by laying the hand
on it at the time, when it will feel warm. Modellers
say, that, when taking casts of any part of the hu
man body , this is the instant when the plaster should
be removed ; as, whenever the cast becomes harden
ed, the contraction, or condensation of bulk is so great,
as to cause most acute pain in the part under the
operation.
       Improvement in using Magnifying Glasses.
   Many persons find it necessary, occasionally, to
make use of a magnifying glass ; in the use of which
it is desirable to find, without loss of much time
or distress to the eye, the proper focal distance.
And it often so appears, that a partial use of the
hand, required to support the lens, is wanted for
other purposes.

   In the first place, take a common pocket-lens, and
drill a hole through the centre of each side of the
horn or tortoiseshell case, almost the tenth of an
inch in diameter : into which insert a slender spindle,
of wood, about the size of a small quill, cut to a pro
per length, to suit the focus of the glass, and also a
little tapering at the end. This very simple mode
of mounting the glass, adjusts the focus at once at
the object ; allows a partial use of the hand that sup
ports it, for other purposes, and leaves the hand at
full liberty, for any operations that may be required.
   If the free use of both hands is required, this also
is provided for, by the small and cheap addition of a
pedestal, consisting of a piece of wood of about two
inches square, and half an inch thick ; with a hole
made through its centre, to receive the lower end of
the said spindle of wood, which also must be made
tapering.
           Method offixing Crayon Colours.
   Crayon colours are easily defaced and spoiled ; and
an easy and certain method of fixing them without
injury has long been a desideratum. A method has
been tried by Mr. J. Smithson, which we shall give
in his own words. " On thinking on the subject, the
first idea which presented itself to me, was that of
gum-water applied to the back of the picture ; but
as it was drawn on sized blue paper, pasted on can
vas, there seemed little prospect of this fluid pene
trating. But an oil would do so, and a drying one
would accomplish my object. I applied drying oil,
diluted with spirit of turpentine : alter a day or two,
when this was grown dry, I spread a coat of the
 mixture over the front of the picture, and my crayon
drawing became an oil painting." Where this can
be done without destroying the hue of the colours,
 this process will, no doubt, effect the object ; and
 the use of those colours only which would bear the
 action of oil without change, would be a necessary
 precaution in works to be submitted to the process.

                The Pantochronometer.
   The Pantochronometer is one of those clever little-
philosophical instruments, which may be said to
nave multum in parvo, and the invention of which
does credit to the ingenuity of modern science. It
has been produced by Mr. Charles Essex, and it is
at once a curious and useful thing. In a box, about
the size of a small snuff-box, are combined the
machinery of a compass, sun-dial, and universal
time-dial ; and a compass card, a gnomon, and an
indexed border, are included in this apparatus. It is
a desirable power, to be able to pull this " dial from
your poke, and ascertain at once what o'clock it is,
 the situation of the spot where you are, and the way
 you ought to go.
                   Optical Experiment.
   If a box be formed with a small aperture at one-
of its sides, and three candles be made to revolve on
a piece of wood in the centre, the light opposite the
 axis will be visible on a semi-transparent screen,
 placed to receive its image. The other two candles
will also have their flames depicted on the screen, at
similar distances on each side. This experiment
serves to shew the exceeding minuteness of the rays
which emanate from the candles ; for, if they were
 not exceedingly small, they would not pass each
 other without destroying the perfection ofthe image.
   This experiment may be made very amusing by
 placing a piece of glass, with a ship or any other
 object painted on it, in the aperture ; and when the
 candles are parallel to the screen, three images may
 be seen ; but, on making them revolve through a
 quarter of a circle, only one image will be visible on
 the screen. By increasing the number of candles,
 the ships will be encreased in an equal ratio, and a
 single ship, by turning the row of candles, will be
 converted into an entire fleet.

     There is no person, probably, who, standing at one
 of the extremities of a long avenue, has not ob
 served that the two rows of trees of which it is
 formed, appear to converge towards each other, so
 as even to touch, if the avenue be of sufficient
 length. In this case, the intervals between the cor
 responding trees on each side subtend visual angles,
 that regularly diminish, till at last they are insensi-
 hle at a great distance. It follows in this, that in
  the small picture on the bottom of the eye, the
  images of the trees are situated on two lines that
  are inclined towards each other, and tend towards a
  common point. Now, if we suppose that the two
  optic axes direct themselves successively towards the
  different trees, as they increase in distance, the varia
  tion of these angles, and at the same time that of the
  impression of the distance, will continually become
  less perceptible ; and, by a necessary consequence,
   the impression of the magnitude, which depends on
   the interval between the corresponding trees, will
  be so predominant, that it will nearly determine, of
   itself, the type of the sensation, so that two lines
  exactly parallel will present themselves to us under
   the aspect of two converging lines. It is owing to a
   similar cause that, when we are at the entrance of a
   long gallery, the ceiling appears to slope downwards
   a little, and the floor to rise.

    The best artists require only the following appa
 ratus and tools :— a low earthen pot, full of chaff or
 saw-dust, on which to make a little charcoal fire ;
 a small bamboo blow-pipe, about six inches long,
 with which he excites the fire ; a short earthen tube,
 or nozzle, the extremity of which is placed at the
 bottom of the fire, and through which the artist
 directs the blast of the blow-pipe ; two or three
 small crucibles, made of the fine clay of ant-hills, a
 pair of tongs, an anvil, two or three small hammers,
 a file, and, to conclude the list, a few small bars of
 iron and brass, about two inches long, differently
  pointed, for different kinds of work. It is astonish

 the bed of the fire being composed of combustible

resin, rendered liquid by heat, and well incorporated.
The mixture is poured into a wooden mould, and its

when cold, it is extremely hard. It is much valued
by the natives, and preferred by them to the best

         Preservation of Anatomical Preparations.

of their action upon the edges of the knives, the
two best, as preservers of the substance, being the
 worst as destroyers of the instruments. A better
 agent than any of the above, and one free from this
 great inconvenience, is common whiskey. Fix a pipe
 into a large artery, and inject the whiskey until no
 more can be thrown in. It does not flow out by the
 bowels or mouth, as the solution of common salt,
 which may be attributed to the action of the spirit
 contracting the delicate extremities of the capillary
 vessels. In this way, the whole of the muscular and
  cellular system is acted on ; and if the skin be then
  sponged with impure pyroligneous acid, the body
  may then be kept for a great length of time, even in
  warm weather.

 To take a Cast in Metal from any small Animal Insect
                      or Vegetable,
    Prepare a square box, sufficiently large to contain
the subject, in which it must be suspended by a
string, and the legs, wings, &c. of the animal, or the
tendrils, leaves, &c. of the vegetable, must be sepa
rated, and adjusted, in their natural position, by a
pair of small pincers. Mix some plaster of Paris
with talc, tendered to a proper consistence with
water, and oil the sides of the box. Put a strait
piece of stick into the principal part ofthe body, and
pieces of wire to the extremities of the other parts,
that they may form, when drawn out after the clay
is set and firm, proper channels for pouring in the
metal, and vents for the air, which otherwise would
burst the mould. When the plaster is set, withdraw
the stick and wires, and remove the frame in which
the mould was cast ; and put the mould first into a
moderate heat, which is to be encreased till the
mould be red hot, when the subject in it will be
burnt to a coal, and may be totally calcined to ashes,
and blown out at the passages for pouring in the
metal. The mould must then be- suffered to cool
gently, and will be hollow, the destruction of the
substance included in it having produced a corre
sponding hollow. Be careful to expel with the bel
 lows all the ashes, or, where it may be possible to
 fill the hollow with quicksilver, it will be found a
 very effectual method of clearing the cavity, as all
 impurities will be poured out with it.
     The mould being thus prepared, it must be heated
 very hot, if the cast is to be made of copper or brass.:
 a less degree will serve for lead or tin. The metal
 being poured into the mould, must be gently struck,
  and then suffered to rest till it is cold ; then take it
  carefully, without force, from the cast ; if any part
  adhere strongly, it must be removed by soaking it in
  water, that none of the delicate parts of the cast be
  broken or bent.

                  Red Chalk Crayons.
  The red chalk crayon and its uses are too well
known in daily life, to require any thing to be said
of them. The preparation of those red crayons
which are best adapted for drawing, however, is less
known. The following is the manner in which it is
performed :—
   A quantity of hematite is ground in a porphyry
mortar, with filtered water, until it be extremely
divided, so as to form an impalpable powder. This
powder is again diffused in a quantity sufficient to
allow the finer parts of the mixture to be passed
through a fine sieve, placed above a large vessel
filled with water. The liquid holding the nematite
in suspension is then agitated, and, after this, allowed
to rest four-and-twenty hours. At the end of this
time, there is formed at the bottom of the vessel a
deposit of hematite, in the form of a very fine pow
der, and the water is cautiously decanted from it.
   To form crayons of this impalpable powder, a
uniting medium is necessary. This is afforded either
by gum arabic or isinglass, of which the proportions
vary, according to the use to which the crayon is
destined ;, less of it being required for soft crayons,
which, consequently, yield their colour more readily ;
and more for the hard ones, which preserve their
points longer. The following are the proportions
deduced from experiments, to be employed in the
fine kinds of crayons.
   1. For the soft crayons, which leave a broad trace,
18 grains of dry gum arabic to one ounce of the pre
pared hematite powder.
 . 2. For harder crayons, 21 grains of gum, to one
ounce of the hematite powder.
   3. For still harder crayons, and which make small
and delicate marks, 22 grains of gum to one ounce of
hematite.
   4. For the hardest of this kind, 27 grains of gum
to one ounce of hematite.
   j. For crayons which leave shining traces, 3U

 178          RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
grains of isinglass to one ounce of the prepared he
matite powder.
   The gum or isinglass is to be dissolved separately
 in a sufficient quantity of water, and their solutions
 passed through a linen cloth : the hematite powder
is then added? The liquid is brought near to a gen
tle fire, until the mass is somewhat thickened by the
evaporation of the water, when it is to be removed
 from the fire. The mixture is then to be carefully
ground on a porphyry slab, to render it as intimate
as possible, and is ready to be formed into crayons.
 To effect this, the mass, when it has become of a
proper consistence, is forced through a cylinder : the
sticKs thus formed are dried, and divided into cray
ons of two inches long. They are then sharpened
at their points, and the hard crust which had formed
upon them, while drying, is removed.
         To write on Paper with Letters of Gold.
   Put some gum arabic into common writing ink,
and write with it in the usual way. When the
writing is dry, breathe upon it ; the warmth and
moisture softens the gum, and will cause the gold
leaf to adhere to it, which may be laid on in the
usual way, and the superfluous part brushed off:
or, instead of this, any japanners' size may be
used.

                  New Scarlet Colour.
   Mr. Badams has recently described a process for
obtaining scarlet chromate of lead ; and highly re
commends its use as a colour, either in painting or
calico-printing. He prepares the scarlet chromate
by boiling yellow chromate of lead with potash ; and
has made several experiments upon the properties
of the scarlet colour tnus obtained. It appears, that
it may be made what is termed a fast colour in
calico-printing, and that it is a durable and beau
tiful colour when used with oil, possessing consider
able body. It is not degraded in its hue by ad
mixture with white lead, as vermilion is ; and it
also mixes with other colours. As a water-colour,
it has not been sufficiently tried to render it certain
that it will not blacken ; but several slips of card
and thin paper, painted with it, and hung up in si
tuations likely to affect colour, have not, in some
months, perceptibly diminished in brightness. Mr.
Badams very justly remarks, that, should it succeed,
no tint would be a more desirable accession to the
pallet than a bright and permanent scarlet, or scarlet
 orange.
                  Radiation of Heat.
   The radiant matter, emitted by terrestrial bodies,
at high temperatures, agrees in many of its proper
ties with that constituting the solar rays ; but in
others it presents apparent peculiarities : the inves
tigation of this subject constitutes a beautiful de
partment of philosophic inquiry.
   The effect we perceive in approaching a fire, chiefly
 results from radiation, and is little connected with
 the immediate conducting power of the air; and if a

180            RECREATIONS IN SCrENCE.
concave metallic mirror be held opposite the fire, a
heating and luminous focus will be obtained. The
affections of terrestrial radiant matter are best de
monstrated by employing two concave mirrors of
planished tin or plated copper, placed at the distance
of about ten feet asunder. Under these circum
stances, when a thermometer is in the focus of one
of the mirrors, it will be found sensible to the effects
of a heated body placed in the focus of the oppo
sed mirror; and that effect is produced by reflection,
and not by mere direct radiation, is proved, either
by drawing the thermometer out of the focus to
wards the opposed mirror, or by placing a screen
between the thermometer and its mirror, when
diminution of temperature is in either case indicated.
In these experiments, the differential thermometer
is most advantageously employed, and the mirrors
may be placed opposite each other on the ground,
or vertically suspended as at Fig. 28, where a a
 represent the mirrors, b a pan of hot charcoal, and
 c an air thermometer.
                  The Cylindric Oracle.
     Provide a hollow cylinder of about six inches high
 and three wide, a A, B, Fig. 29, its cover C D, must
 be made to fix on. On one side of the cylinder let
 there be a groove, nearly of the same length with
  that side; fii which place a small steel bar that is
  strongly impregnated, and with the north pole the
  bottom of the cylinder. On the upper side of the
  cover describe a^ circle ; and divide it into ten equal
  parts, in which are to be wrote the numbers from
  1 to 10. Place a pivot at the centre of this circle,
  and have ready a magnetic needle. Then provide a
  bag in which are several divisions ; in each of which
  put a number of papers, on which amusing questions
  are written. In the cylinder put several different
  answers to these questions, and seal them up, lite
  billets dour. On each of these answers write one of
  the numbers of the circle at the top of the box.

that number which is written on the answer directly
over the bar. You then desire the person who drew
the question to observe the number at which the

 the answer.
     Repeat the experiment by offering another divi

                       Ideal Spectrum.
     I was surprised, and agreeably amused, (says Dr.
 Darwin,) with the following experiment. I covered
 a paper about four inches square with yellow, and
  with a pen filled with a blue colour wrote upon the
  middle of it the word BANKS in capitals, and sitting
  with my back to the sun, fixed my eyes for a minute
  exactly on the centre of the letter N in the middle
  of the word; after closing my eyes, and shading them
  somewhat with my hand, the word was distinctly
  seen in the spectrum in yellow letters on a blue field ;
  and then, on opening my eyes on a yellowish wall
  at twenty feet distance, the magnified name of
  BANKS appeared written on the wall in golden
  characters.

on the surface, as to give them the effect of a mirror,
which can only be done, in a perfect manner, by the
use of quicksilver, applied in the same general way
as in the case of looking-glass. The method by
which it may be best performed is as follows.
   Take leaves of tin, prepared in the same manner
as for silvering looking-glasses, and cut them into
small pieces of such size as to cover the surface of
the sockets of the stones that are to be set. Lay
three of these then one upon another, and, having
moistened the inside of the socket with thin gum-
water, and suffered it to become again so dry that
only a slight stickiness remains, put the three pieces
of leaves lying on each other into it, and adapt
them to the surface in as even a manner as possible.
 When this is done, heat the socket, and fill it with
 warm quicksilver, which must be suffered to continue
in it three or four minutes, and then gently poured
out. The stone must then be thrust into the socket,
and closed with it, care having been taken to give
 such room for it that it may enter without stripping
 off the tin and quicksilver from any part of the
 surface. The work should be well closed round the
 stone, to prevent the tin and quicksilver contained
 in the socket from being shaken out by any violence
    The lustre of stones set in this manner will con
 tinue longer than when they are set in the common
 way, as, the cavity round them being filled, there
 will be no passage found for moisture, which is so
 injurious to the wear of stones treated in any other
 way.
    This kind of foil likewise gives some lustre to
 glass, or other transparent matter, which has little, of
 itself; but to stones or pastes, that have some share
 of play, it gives a most beautiful brilliant.
                      To colour Foils.
    Two methods have been invented for colouring
 foils ; the one by tinging the surface of the copper
 of the colour required by means ofsmoke, the other
 by staining or painting it with some pigment or
  other colouring substance.

              BECHEATIONS IN SCIENCE.                183
   The colours used for painting foils may be tem
pered either with oil, water rendered duly viscid by
gum-arabic, size, or varnish. Where deep colours
are wanted, oil is most proper, because some pig
ments become wholly transparent in it, as lake, or
Prussian blue ; the yellow and green may be better
laid on in varnish, as these colours may be had in
perfection from a tinge wholly dissolved in spirit of
wine, in the same manner as in the case of lacquers ;
and the most beautiful green is to be produced by
distilled verdigris, which is apt to lose its colour and
turn black with oil. In common cases, however,
any of the colours may be, with the least trouble,
laid on with isinglass size, in the same manner as
the glazing colours used in miniature painting.
                      Ruby Colours.
   For red, where the ruby is to be imitated, a little
lake used in isinglass size, carmine, or shellac var
nish, is to be employed, if the glass or paste be of a
ftdl crimson, verging towards the purple; but if the
C"ss incline to the scarlet or orange, very bright
    e (that is, not purple) may be used alone in oil.
                       Garnet Red.
   For the garnet red, dragon's Wood dissolved in
seedlac varnish may be used ; and for the vinegar
garnet, the orange-lake tempered with shellac
 varnish, will be found excellent-
                        Amethyst.
   For the amethyst, lake, with a little Prussian
blue, used with oil, and very thinly spread on the
foil, will completely answer the end.
                          Blue.
   For blue, where a deep colour, or the effect of the
 sapphire is wanted, Prussian blue, that is not too
 deep, should be used in oil, and it should be spread
 more or less thinly on the foil, according to the light
 ness or deepness of the colour required.
                      Eagle Marine.
    For the eagle marine, common verdigris, with a
 little Prussian blue, tempered in shellac varnish.

 184          RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.'
                         Yellow.
    Where a full yellow is desired, the foil may be
 coloured with a yellow lacquer, laid on as for other
 purposes ; and for the slighter colour of topazes, the
 burnish and foil itself will be sufficiently strong,
 without any addition.
                         Green.
    For green, where a deep hue is required, the
 crystals of verdigris, tempered in shellac varnish,
 should be used ; but where the emerald is to be
 imitated, a little yellow lacquer should be added,
 to bring the colour to a true green, and less verging
 to the blue.
                     Other Colours.
   The stones of more diluted colour, such as the
 amethyst, topaz, vinegar-garnet, and eagle-marine,
 may be very cheaply imitated by transparent white
glass or paste, even without foils. This is to be
done, by tempering the colours above enumerated
with turpentine and mastic, and painting the socket
in which the counterfeit stone is to be set with the
mixture, the socket and stone itself being previously
heated. In this case, however, the stone should be
immediately set, and the socket closed upon it before
the mixture cools and grows hard. The orange-lake
above-mentioned was invented for this purpose, in
which it has a beautiful effect, and was used with
great success by a considerable manufacturer. The
colour it produces is that of the vinegar-garnet,
which it affords with great brightness. The colours
before directed to be used in oil should be extremely
well ground in oil of turpentine, and tempered with
old nut or poppy-oil, or, if time can be given for
their drying, with strong fat oil, diluted with spirit
of turpentine ; which will gain a fine polish of itself
   The colours used in varnish should be likewise
thoroughly well ground and mixed ; and in the case
of the dragon's blood in the seedlac varnish and the
lacquer, the foils should be warmed before they are
laid out. All the mixtures should be laid on the
foils with a broad soft brush, which must be passed

 from one end to the other, and no part should be
crossed, or twice gone over, or, at least, not till the
 first coat can be dry ; when, if the colour do not lie
strong enough, a second coat may be given.
         To make Varnish for coloured Drawings.
   Take one ounce of Canada balsam, and two ounces
of spirit of turpentine, and mix them together.
   Before this composition is applied, the drawing or
print should be sized with a solution of isinglass in
water; and when dry, apply the varnish with a
camel's hair brush.

   Pulverize a quantity of gum adragant, and let it

            Mackintosh's Water-proof Cloth.
   A most valuable process has lately been invented,
by Mr. Charles Mackintosh, for rendering cloths,
leather, and paper, impervious to water and air. It
consists in joining the surfaces of two or more pieces
of cloth, leather, or paper, by a flexible varnish,
made of India-rubber dissolved in the naptha ob
tained in the distillation of coal. The cloth is
stretched on a frame, and then covered by means of
a brush with a coat of the elastic varnish ; another
piece of cloth is prepared in a similar manner, and
as soon as the varnish has dried till it has a certain
degree of adhesiveness, the varnished surfaces are
joined together, and to render the union of the sur
faces perfect, the cloth is passed through a roller
press. Il is afterwards dried in a warm room.
   The cloth thus prepared is of various thicknesses,

186           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
from that of fine cloth to the substance of the
strongest hide leather. Besides being useful for
outer garments to keep off rain, it is likely to be
extensively employed for various purposes in the
arts and manufactures.
 To take Impressions from recent Manuscripts Ity means

   In order to shew the application of it, paste a
piece of white paper on the bottom of a china saucer,
and allow it to dry : then write upon it with com
mon writing ink, and sprinkle some finely powdered
gum-arabic over the writing, which produces a slight
relief. When it is well dried, and the adhering
powder brushed oft', the fusible metal is poured into
the saucer, and is cooled rapidly to prevent crystal
lization. The metal then takes a cast of the wri
ting; and when it is immersed in slightly warm
water, and any adhering gum removed, impressions
may be taken from it as from a copper-plate.

    Mr. Donovan has invented an apparatus for til-

              RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                187
for filtering any liquid to which the carbonic acid, or
the moisture of the atmosphere, would be injurious ;
and also for any thing of a volatile nature, as alcohol,
ether, ammomacal liquor, &c. The apparatus con
sists of an upper and a lower glass vessel ; the upper
one being formed as a funnel, but with a neck and
stopper at the top of it. The lower vessel has two
necks, into one of which the funnel is inserted, and
the other neck is connected to the neck at the top of
the runnel by a long bent tube of glass. In conse
quence of this arrangement, whatever drops from
the funnel which contains the filter displaces an
equal volume of air from the lower vessel, and the
air ascends to the upper one by the bent tube.

                   Remarkable Wood.
    Mr. Boyle describes the ligntim nephriticum to be
 a whitish kind of wood, brought from Mexico, which
 the natives call coatl or tlapaxatli, and which he
 found to communicate all kinds of colours. If, says
 he, an infusion of this wood be put into a glass globe,
 and exposed to a strong light, it will be as colourless
 as pure water; but if it be carried into a place a
 little shaded, it will be a most beautiful green;
 in a place still more shaded, it will incline to red ;
 and a very shady place, or in an opaque vessel, it will
 be green "again. He also distinctly noted the two
  very different colours which this remarkable tinc
  ture exhibits by transmitted and reflected light. If,
  says he, it be held directly between the light and
  the eye, it will appear tinged (excepting the very
  top of it, where a sky-coloured circle sometimes
  appears) almost of a golden colour, unless the in
  fusion be too strong; in which case it will be dark

or reddish, and requires to be diluted with water.
But if it be held from the light, so that the eye
be between the light and the vessel, it will appear
of a deep lovely blue colour ; as will also the drops,
if any he on the outside of the glass.
             The Flute Player qf Vaucanson.
 . A particular account of the mechanism of this
beautiful automaton has been published in the
Memoirs of the French Academy.
    The figure was about five feet six inches high,
and was placed upon an elevated square pedestal.
 The air entered the body by three separate pipes,
 into which it was conveyed by nine pairs of bellows,
 which expanded and contracted in regular succes
 sion, by means of an axis of steel turned by the
 machine.
     The three tubes, which conveyed the air from
 the bellows, after passing through the lower extre
 mities of the figure, united at the chest ; and as
 cending from thence to the mouth, passed through
 two artificial lips. Within the cavity of the mouth
  was a small moveable tongue, which by its motion
 at proper intervals, admitted or intercepted the air
 in its progress to the flute. The fingers, lips, and
  tongue, derived their specific movements from a
  steel cylinder turned by clock-work. The cylinder
  was divided into fifteen equal parts, which, by means
  of keys, pressing upon a like number of levers,
  caused the other extremities to ascend. Seven sf
  these levers directed the fingers, having rods and
  chains fixed to their ascending extremities; which,
  being attached to the fingers, made them to ascend
  in proportion as the other extremity was pressed
  down by the motion of the cylinders, and vice versa.
  Three of the levers served to regulate the ingress
  of the air, being so contrived as to open and shut,
  by means of valves, the communication between the
   lips and reservoir, so that more or less strength

              RECUSATIONS IN SCIENCE.:             189
 might be given, and a higher or lower note pro
 duced as occasion required.
    The lips were directed by four similar levers ;
 one of which opened them to give the air a freer
 passage ; another contracted them ; a third drew
 them backward, and the fourth pushed them forward.
 The remaining lever was employed in the direction
 of the tongue, which, by its motion, shut or opened
 the mouth of the flute. The varied and successive
 motions performed by this ingenious androides,
 were regulated by a contrivance no less simple and
 efficacious. The axis of the steel cylinder or barrel
 was terminated by an endless screw composed of
 twelve threads, above which was placed a small arm
 of copper, with a steel stud made to fill the threads
of the worm, which, by its vertical motion, was
continually pushed forward. Hence, if a lever was
moved, by a peg placed on the cylinder, in any one
revolution, it could not be moved by the same peg
in. the succeeding revolution, in consequence of the
lateral motion communicated by the worm. By
this means, the si?e of the barrel was considerably
reduced; and the statue not only poured forth a
varied selection of instrumental harmony, but exhi
bited all the evolutions of the most graceful per
former.
To determine the magnifying Power of Glasses employed
                  in Single Microscopes.
   If the focus of a convex lens be at one inch, and
the natural sight at eight inches, which is the
common standard, an object may be seen through
that lens at one inch distant from the eye, and will
appear in its diameter eight times larger than to the
naked eye. But as the object is magnified every
way equally, in length as well as in breadth, we
must square this diameter to know how much it in
reality appears enlarged; we shall then find that
its superficies is magnified 64 times.

Another mode of conversing by means of a Silk String.
   The letters of the string alphabet are distributed
into seven classes, which are distinguished by knots ;
each class comprehends four letters, except the last,
which comprehends but two. The first, or A class,
is distinguished by a large round knot ; the second,
or E class, by a knot projecting from the line ; the
third, or I class, by a series of links ; the fourth, or
M class, by a simple noose ; the fifth, or Q class,
by a noose*with a line drawn through it ; the sixth,
or U class, by a noose with a net-knot cast on it, and
the seventh, or Y class, by a twisted noose. The
first letter of each class is denoted by the simple
characteristic of its respective class; the second by
the characteristic, and a common knot close to it ;
the third, by the characteristic, and a common knot
half an inch from it. Thus A is simply a large
round knot ; B is a large round knot, with a com
mon knot close to it ; C is a large round knot, with
a common knot half an inch from it, and so on.
   A person may easily acquire a knowledge of the

     Distinction of Positive and Negative Electricity.
    Positive and negative electricity may be readily
 distinguished by the taste, on making the electric

 The taste of the positive electricity is acid, that of
 the negative electricity is more caustic, and, as it
 were, alkaline.

put the copper balls into a crucible, and when in a

have been melted and properly combined, recast
the alloy, by pouring it into the mould. Instead
of four balls, the operator will be able to form only
three.
    The quantity of metal is exactly the same as at
 first, but the alloy is capable of being more compact
 than the metals in a separate state.
             Curious Alloy of Silver with Steel.
    If steel and silver be kept in fusion together for
 a length of time, an alloy is obtained, which appears
 to be very perfect while the metals are in a fluid
 state; but on solidifying and cooling, globules of
 pure silver are expressed from the mass, and appear
 on the bottom of the button. If the alloy be forged
  into a bar, and then dissected by the action of dilute
  sulphuric acid, the silver appears, not in combina
  tion with the steel, but in threads throughout the
  mass, so that the whole has the appearance of a
  bundle of fibres of silver and steel, as if they had
  been united by welding. The appearance of these
  silver fibres is very beautiful.

      The period of life at which man (under all cir

   number of years to come, is the age of 33. To this
   all the powers of medicine will probably never be

  make a perceptible addition to the mean term of

A's value in B's stake is half of £100, and B's value
in A's stake is the same ; therefore, the ratio of the
values in exchange being 50 to 50, there is neither
profit nor loss ; but suppose A deposits £100, and B
£200, here A's value is half of £200, or £100, and
B's value only half of £100, or £50, the ratio of the
values being two to one ; and as A receives a value
£100 for a value £50, he adventures in the ratio of
100 per cent, profit. If A bets B five guineas to
two, that an ace is not thrown the first trial, with a
single die, A's profit is in the ratio of 100 per cent.,

                       Observations.
   1. The nearer the time of the moon's change,
first quarter, full, and last quarter, is to midnight,
the fairer will the weather be during the seven days
following.
   2. The space for this calculation occupies from
ten at night till two next morning.
   3. The nearer to mid-day or noon these phases of
the moon happen, the more foul or wet the weather
may be expected during the next seven days.
   4. The space for this calculation occupies from
ten in the forenoon to two in the afternoon. These
observations refer principally to summer, though
they affect spring and autumn nearly in the same
ratio.
   5. The moon's change, first quarter, full, and last
quarter, happening during six of the afternoon
hours, i. e. from four to ten, may be followed by
fair weather : but this is mostly dependent on the
wind, as it is noted in the table. .
   0. Though the weather, from . a variety of irre
gular causes, is more uncertain in the latter part of
autumn, the whole of winter, and the beginning of
spring, yet, in the main, the above observations will
apply to those periods also.
Description of an Udometer, a new Instrument, which
           shews the Quantity of Rain fallen.
   This instrument is composed of a circular basin,
made of tin plate or copper, the outer edge of which
is surrounded by a double inclosure, forming a ca
nal. An opening is made six lines above the bot
tom, so that the basin cannot become full of water,
but all the rain that falls into it runs out through
this opening, into a receiver placed beneath. Through
the whole height of this vessel there is a vertical
slip, covered by a stripe of glass, which closes it
hermetically, and allows the height of the surface
of the water in the vessel, and all its variations, to

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.               197
be seen. A scale, divided into inches and parts, is
marked at one side : and a tube, closed by a cork,
serves for emptying the vessel when it is full of
water. The basin communicates, by a closed canal
above, with another and a smaller basin, surmounted
by a cylindrical reservoir, which has likewise a Ion.
gitudinal opening, closed by a piece of glass, in the
same manner as in the larger basin. At the side a
scale is marked, which is lengthened in the ratio of
the difference of the diameters of this reservoir and
of the large basin. This reservoir, which is filled
with water before it is put in its place, being con-
structed like the reservoirs which supply oil to the
wick of an argand lamp, replaces the water which
evaporates from the large basin, by means of the
canal of communication. The effect of this instru
ment is as follows :—When it rains, all the water
that falls into the large basin passes into the receiver
below, where the quantity of it may be afterwards
measured. When the rain is over, and evaporation
begins to take place, the water which evaporates
from the large basin is immediately replaced by the
 water contained in the little reservoir, and the scale
 on the latter shews at once the quantity.
                Colours considered in Bodies.
    Bertholet, the celebrated French chemist, remarks,
 that the three primitive colours in the arts develope
 themselves in the bodies of the three mineral, vega-
 taile, and animal kingdoms, by a greater or less ab
 sorption of oxygen, which combines with the dif
 ferent principles of those bodies.
     In its natural state, iron is without colour. The
 first impression of fire, or the first degree of oxyda-
 tion, developes a blue colour ; a second degree of
 oxydation produces yellow : if the oxydation aug
 ments, the iron becomes red. The major part of
 metals present similar phenomena.
  . In vegetables, the blue is formed by fermentation,
                            s 2

!&8           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
that is to say, by a fixation of oxygen; and most
of these colours are susceptible of passing to red by
a greater quantity of oxygen. It is thus that turn-
sol is reddened by air, and by the action of acids.
   The same colours are seen to develope themselves
in animals, by the combination of oxygen. When
meat putrefies, the first degree of oxydation de
cides the blue colour ; the red colour soon succeeds
it, as the oxygenation augments. This phenomenon
is very perceptibly manifest in the preparation of
cheeses, which are covered first with a blue mould,
that afterwards becomes red.
   Lastly, the flame of burning bodies exhibits the
same phenomena. It is blue when the combustion
of oxygen is slow, red when it is stronger, and white
when the oxygenation is complete. It would seem
that the maximum of oxydation determines the re
flection of rays of every kind, in the same propor
tions as subsist in solar light.
An easy method of comparing the Time indicated by
   any number of Chronometers, with the given time at
   a certain Season.
   Let a transit instrument, or even a sextant with
an artificial horizon, be established in a conspicuous
situation on shore, where a clock can always be re
gulated to true time : then provide a powerful ar-
gand's lamp, with a shutter, so as to be able. to
darken the lamp instantaneously. A few minutes
before a certain hour in the evening, notice being
previously given to the ships, let the lamp be light
ed, and at the proper instant of time let it be dark
ened : this may be repeated several times, at short
 known intervals. Then the errors of every chrono
 meter on board of all the ships from which the lamp
 can be seen are immediately found. After a certain
 number of days, let the same be repeated, when the
 daily ship rates will be given, since they are only
 the differences of those errors, divided by the mini

 ber of days elapsed between the two acts of obser
 vations. No objection can be made from the chro
 nometer being generally below deck, as one person
 might have his eye upon it, and another immedi
 ately above him on the upper deck might give a
 stamp with his foot the instant the lamp is dark
 ened.
     The Wheel Barometer in the form of a Syphon.
    A small float of iron or glass rests on the exterior
 surface of the mercury, suspended by a slender
 thread, passed round a small wheel, or cylindrical
 axis, tbat carries the index. By this construction,
 the variation of the height of the mercurial column
 is reduced to half the ordinary measure, yet the
 circumference traversed by the needle is greatly
 augmented.
                      Artificial Cold.
    The greatest artificial cold that has yet been
 produced, was effected by the mixture of diluted
 sulphuric acid with snow, which sunk Fahrenheit's
 thermometer to 91°, or 123° below the freezing
 point.
 Neutralization of the Attraction of the Ship's Iron,
                 usually called Deviation.
   Place the centre of a small circular iron plate in
the line of no attraction (of the ship's iron), and at a
proper distance behind and below the pivot of the
compass needle, (which must be ascertained and
fixed before the ship leaves port), and the needle
will not only remain active and vigorous in the polar
regions, but will continue to point to the correct
magnetic meridian, uninfluenced by the attraction
of the ship's iron hi every part of the world.

                Spontaneous Combustion.
    There are instances of spontaneous combustion of
the human body by the rapid absorption of oxygen,
so that the whole became silently reduced to ashes,
 independent of any external agent to which the
commencement of the combustion could be attri
 buted. These instances have always occurred to
 females addicted to spirituous liquors.
         Safest Situation during a Thunder Storm.
     The safest situation during a thunder-storm is the
 cellar ; for when a person is Delow the surface of the
 earth, the lightning must strike it before it can
 reach him, and wilfof course, in all probability, be
 expended on it. Dr. Franklin advises persons
 apprehensive of lightning to sit in the middle of a
 room, not under a metal lustre, or any other con
 ductor, and to lay their feet upon another chair. It
  will be safer still, he adds, to lay two or three beds
  or mattrasses in the middle ofthe room, and folding
  them double, to place the chairs upon them. A
  hammock suspended by silk cords would be an im
  provement upon this apparatus. Persons in fields
  should prefer the open parts to the vicinity of trees,
  &c. The distance of a thunder storm, and conse
  quently the danger, is not difficult to be estimated.
  As light travels at the rate of 72,420 leagues in a
  second of time, its effects may be considered as
  instantaneous within any moderate distance. Sound,
  on the contrary, is transmitted only at the rate of
   1,142 feet, or about 380 yards, in a second. By
  accurately observing therefore the time which inter
  venes between the flash and the noise of thunder
   which follows it, a very near calculation may be
   made of its distance, and I know no better means
   of removing apprehensions.

            Beautiful Electrical Experiment.
   Take some oxalate of lime, obtained by precipita
tion, well washed, and dried in a Wedgewood's
basin at a temperature of 300°, until so dry as not
to render a cold glass plate, placed over it, dim.
Stir it with a platina spatula ; in a few moments, by
friction against the metal, it will become so strongly
electrical, that it cannot be collected together, but
will fly about the dish whenever it is moved, and
over its sides into the sand-bath. It requires some
little stirring before the particles of the powder are
all of them sufficiently electrical to produce this
effect.
                   Amusing Explosion.
    There is a tree growing in America, which they
 call the Devil's tree ; its fruit, in a state of matu
rity, is elastic, and when dried by the heat of the
 sun, noisily splits, and bursts forth its grains. To
 this sport of nature, the tree owes its name ; for, at
 the moment of bursting, the effect of a piece of
 artillery is produced, the noise of which succeeds
rapidly, and is heard tolerably far off. If its fruit
 be transplanted, before it is ripe, to a dry place,
 or exposed on a chimney-piece to a gentle heat, it
 will have the same effect, and produce the same
 phenomenon.
     New mode of securing Anatomical Preparations.
    Dr. Macartney, of the University of Dublin, has
 employed a thin plate of Indian rubber as a covering
 for preparation jars, in place of the former laborious
 and offensive one, by means ofputrid-bladder, sheet-
 lead, &c. It is essential, that the Indian rubber
 should be painted or varnished; after which, not
 the slightest evaporation of the spirits takes place.

20J            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
The material, by its elasticity, adapts itself lo the
variations in the volume of the contents of the jar
from different temperatures, and this removes the
principal cause of the escape of the spirits. It is
probable, that leather coated with Indian rubber,
and painted, would answer as well as the rubber
itself, by which the expense would be greatly
diminished.

               Description of Monochords.
   Monochords are peculiar in having one string only,
as the name imports.
   The best contrived monochords are those of Earl
Stanhope and Mr. Attwood. In the Stanhope mo-
nochora, the peculiarities are these :
   1st. The wire is made of steel, which does not
keep continually lengthening, like brass or iron.
   2dly. The whole wire forms one straight horizon
tal line, so that the moveable bridge can be moved
without altering the tension of the wire, which is
not the case when the wire pulls downwards on the
bridges.
   3cuy. The ends of the wire are not twisted round
the two stout steel pins that keep it stretched ; but
each end of the wire is soft soldered in a long groove
formed in a piece of steel, which goes over the cor
responding pin.
   4thly. One of these steel pins is strongly fastened
by a brass slider, which is moved by means of a
screw with very fine threads ; this screw having a
large micrometer head minutely divided on its edge,
and a corresponding nonius, whence the tension of
the wire may be very exactly adjusted.
   5thly. A slider is fixed across the top of the
moveable bridge, and is moved by means of ano
ther screw with very fine threads.
   6thly. The slider is adjusted to the steel rod or
scale, by means of mechanical contact against pro
jecting pieces of steel, firmly fixed on that steel
scale, at the respective distances specified in the
monochord table.
   7thly. Each bridge carries a metallic finger, which
keeps the wire close to the top of such bridge, while
the remainder of the wire is made to vibrate.
   8thly. The vibrations of the wire are produced
by touching it with a piece of cork with the same
elastic force, and always at the distance of one inch
from the immoveable bridge.
   In Mr. Atwood's apparatus, the string hangs vex

 204            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
 tically, its tension being regulated by a weight sus
 pended at its lower extremity, a little below the
 place where the string comes in contact with a fixed
 pulley ; the length of the string is terminated at
 top by a horizontal edge : the other point of termi
 nation, which, in the common monochords, as well
 as in many musical instruments, and in the Stan
 hope monochord, is a bridge over which the string
 is stretched, is in this construction effected by two
 steel edges vertically placed, that are capable of
 approaching, or of receding from one another, like
 the cheeks of a vice ; these, being fixed on a frame
 worked by micrometer screws, can be easily moved
 in a vertical direction, so as to alter the length of
 the string in any desired proportion : these edges
 are separated occasionally by a spring, in order to
 let the string pass freely through, when its length
 is altered, and are closed again so as to press the
 strings lightly when that length is properly ad
justed.
    By means of this construction, the alteration of
 the tending force, by the application of bridges, &c.
 is wholly avoided.
    The scale placed under the string of this mono-
 chord is divided into 100 equal parts, and each of
 these by a micrometer screw into 1000 equal parts ;
 so that, by the aid of a microscope, and a proper
 index, the length of a given part of the string may
 be adjusted on the monochord true to the T5£5ireth
 part of its whole length.
    It will be seen that the Stanhope monochord,
 though very ingeniously constructed, is, in some
 respects, inferior to the monochord contrived by
 Mr. Atwood.

by the pomp, splendour, and variety of its colours,
seems to attract the attention of every eye that has
an opportunity of beholding it. In this short de
scription, the reader will readily recognise the rain
bow. We know this phenomenon never takes place
but when a cloud opposed to the sun dissolves in
rain ; from which it follows, that, to observe this
spectacle, the back of the spectator must be turned
towards the sun. There is, likewise, though not-
always distinctly visible, a secondary, or much
fainter rainbow, investing the former at some dis
tance. This beautiful phenomenon has engaged the
attention of persons in all ages, but the cause of it
could not be ascertained till the discoveries con
cerning the division of the rays of light into their
primary colours were made.
    The doctrine of the different refrangibility of
light enables us to give a reason for the size of a
bow of each particular colour. The following are
 the facts upon which the phenomena depend.
    1st. When the rays of the sun fall upon a drop
 of rain, and enter into it, some of them, after one
reflection and two refractions, may come to the eye
of the spectator, who has his back turned towards
the sun, and his face towards the rain. Of the rays
reflected from a drop of rain coming to the eye,
those are called effectual which can excite a sensa
tion ; and they will not be effectual, when they
come out of a drop of rain, unless they are parallel
and contiguous.
    When the sun shines upon' the drops of rain as
 they are falling, the rays that come from those drops
 to the eye of the spectator, after one reflexion and
 two refractions, produce the primary rainbow, which
 is never larger than a semi-circle.
    When the sun shines upon the drops of rain as
 they are falling, the rays that come from these drops
 to the eye of the spectator, after two reflexions and
 two refractions, produce the secondary rainbow.
 The colours of the secondary rainbow are fainter
 than those of the primary rainbow, and are ranged
                            T

206            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
in contrary order ; for the primary rainbow is
produced by such rays as have been only once re
flected, the secondary rainbow is produced by such
rays as have been twice reflected. But at every
reflection some rays pass out of the drop of rain
without being reflected, so that the more frequently
the rays are reflected, the fewer of them are left to
excite a sensation in the eye ; therefore, the colours
of the secondary bow are produced by fewer rays,
and, consequently, will be fainter than the colours
of the primary bow.
    In the primary bow, reckoning from the outside,
the colours are ranged in the following order : red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. But in
the secondary bow, reckoning from the outside, the
colours are reversed, and are ranged : violet, indigo,
blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. So that the
red, which is the outermost, or highest colour in the
primary bow, is the innermost, or lowest colour in
the secondary one. If the space occupied by all
the coloured rays be divided into 360 equal parts,
the red will occupy 45 of them, the orange 27, the
yellow 48, the green 60, the blue 60, the indigo 40,
and the violet 80, as shewn by the diagram, Fig. 31.
    An experiment representing the phenomenon of
the rainbow, consists in suspending a glass globe,
 filled with water, in a situation in which it is ex
 posed to the sun, and moving it up and down in
such a manner that the angles formed by the inci
dent and emergent rays vary from 40° to about 61*.
 And in this globe the colours are observed to paint
 themselves successively in the order in which they
 present themselves in the globules of rain.
    From the explanation thus given of the rainbow,
 it is easy to account for several effects, which are so
 many copies, as it were, of this magnificent picture.
 We succeed in the artificial imitation of it, by
 throwing water into the air, so as to scatter it, turn
 ing our back to the sun. We often perceive its
 colours in a jet ifeau ; sometimes it is painted on
 the grass when wet with dew, and sometimes it

                RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.             207
mixes its tints with the flowers that embellish the
fields.
   A lunar bow will be formed by rays from the
moon, effected by drops of rain ; but as its light is
very faint in comparison with that of the sun, such
a bow will very seldom be seen, and the colours of
it, when seen, very faint and dim.
              Pleasing Optical Appearances.
    1. If a soap-bubble be blown up, and set under a
glass, so that the motion of the air may not affect
it, as the water glides down the sides, and the top
grows thinner, several colours will successively ap
pear at the top, and spread themselves from thence
in rings down the sides of the bubble, till they va
nish in the same order in which they appeared. At
length a black spot appears at the top, and spreads
till the bubble bursts.
   2. If a piece of plain polished glass be placed
upon the object-glass of a telescope, and the inter
val between them be filled up with water, as the
glasses are pressed together, the same colours arise
at the point of contact, and spread themselves in
circular rings round that point in the same order as
in the soap-bubble.
   3. A convex and concave lens, of nearlv the same
curvature, being pressed closely together, exhibit
rings of colours about the points where they touch.
Between the colours there are dark rings, and, when
the glasses are very much compressed, the central
spot is dark.                                  >
   4. Two pieces of plate glass, wiped clean, and
rubbed together, will soon adhere with considerable
force, and exhibit various changes of colours.
To render visible the opposite Currents in which Fluids
    are thrown, while they change their Temperature.

glass jar, about two inches or more in diameter, and

 five or six inches long, with cold water, and diffuse
 through it a small portion of pulverised amber : let
 the phial of water be immersed into a tumbler,
containing hot 'water : this being done, two cur
rents, going in different directions, will be observed
in the inner vessel, the one ascending, the other
 descending ; that is to say, the minute particles of
amber, which were diffused through the fluid, and
 were at rest before the heat was applied to the water
 in the inner vessel, will be seen m motion ; those
particles that are situated towards the sides of the
glass, or which are nearest to the source of heat, will
move upwards, whilst those that are in the centre
move downwards; and thus two distinct currents
are formed in opposite directions. These currents
gradually diminish in velocity ; and, when the wa
ter in the inner vessel has acquired the same tem
perature as that in the outer one, the particles of
amber will again be brought to a state of rest.
   If the position of the two glass vessels be revers
ed, namely, if the glass containing hot water be
immersed in a vessel containing cold water, the
motion of the currents will be also reversed : the
particles next to the sides of the glass are thrown into
currents, directed downwards, whilst the particles
in the centre form a current upwards. The equili
brium of these two currents will also be restored,
when the equalization of temperature of the water
within, and that without, has been effected.
   To render the experiment more decisive, the
lower part of the water may be coloured by tinc
ture of cabbage, or red ink, leaving the upper part
uncoloured. If heat be then applied to the bottom
part of the glass, the coloured part of the water
gradually ascends, and uniformly tinges the whole
   To change a Pack of Cards into various Pictures.
   Take a pack of cards, and paint upon the white
side of half the pack, any kind of figures, as men,

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.             20»
women, birds, flowers, &c. ; then paint the other
half of the cards, on that side on which the spots
are, in the same way as the other half; so, between
them both, you will have a complete pack of all
pictures; and when you perform this trick, you
must shew the cards but half way.
 To let Twenty Persons draw Twenty Cards, and to
                make each draw the same.
   Let any person draw a card from a pack, and put
it in the pack again, but where you know where to
find it again ; shuffle the cards, as before directed ;
then let another person draw a card, and be sure he
takes the same the other did ; proceed in the same
way with all the persons but the last, who is to
 draw another card, which also return to the pack,
 and shuffle till you have brought both the cards
 together. Then, shewing the last card to the com
 pany, the other will shew the trick.
  To name several Cards which Two Persons have drawn
                      from a Pack.
    Divide a piquet pack into two parts by a long
 card ; let the first part contain a quint to a king in
 clubs and spades, the four eights, the ten of dia
 monds, and ten of hearts, and let the other part con
 tain the two quart majors in hearts and diamonds,
 the four sevens and the four nines. The cards may
 be divided in any other way that is easy to be re
 membered.
    Then shuffle the cards, but be careful not to dis
  place any of those cards of the last part which are
  under the long card : you then cut at that card, and
 leave the pack in two parts ; next, present the first
  of these parts to a person, and tell him to draw two
  or three cards, and place the remainder on the table ;
  you present the second parcel in like manner to
                           t 2

 210            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
 another, then having dexterously placed tne cards
 drawn by the first person in the second parcel, and
 those drawn by the second person in the first parcel,
 you shuffle the cards, observing not to displace any
 but the upper cards : then spreading the cards on
 the table, you name those that each person drew,
which you may very easily do, by observing the
cards that are changed in each parcel.
 To make a Card jump out of the Pack, and run on the
                          Table.
   Take a pack of cards and let any one draw any
card they please ; put it into the pack, so that you
may know where to find it at pleasure. Put a small
piece of wax under your thumb-nail, to which fasten
a hair, and the other end of the hair to the card ;
spread the cards open on the table, and desire the
one chosen to jump out, which you may readily
cause it to do by means of the hair.
How to tell a Person any Card he thinks of, and to con
                    vey it into a Nut.
   Take a nut, in which burn a hole with a hot bod
kin, and with a needle break and extract the kernel.
Write the name of a card on a piece of thin paper,
and roll it up hard, and put it in the nut, stop the
hole with wax, which rub over with a little dust
that the puncture may not be perceived, then let
some one draw a card ; you must take care it be that
which is written on the paper ; desire him to break
the nut, in which he will find the name of the card
he has drawn.
To shuffle Cards in such a manner, as always to keep one
               certain Card at the Bottom.
   In shuffling, let the bottom card be always a little
before, or, which is best, a little behind all the rest

                RECKEATIONS IN SCIENCE.               211
of the cards ; put it a little beyond the rest before,'
right over your fore finger, or else, which is the
best, a little behind the rest, so that the little finger
of the left hand may slip up and meet with it ; at
the first, shuffle as thick as you can ; and, at last,
throw upon the board the bottom card, with as many
more as you would preserve for any purpose, a little
before or a little behind the rest ; and be sure to let
your fore finger, if the pack be laid before, or your
little finger, if the pack be laid behind, always
creep up to meet with the bottom card ; arid when
you feel it, you may there hold till you have shiii-
fled over again ; which being done, the card which
was first at the bottom will come there again : hav
ing perfected yourself in this manner of shuffling,
you may accomplish any thing you please with packs
of ten, twelve, or twenty cards, always leaving it at
the bottom, however frequently you may shuffle
them.
                  Hydramatic Temple.
   The following is an account of a very elegant op
tical toy, or hyaromatic temple. See Fig. 30.
   Let us suppose two vessels, the uppermost filled
with water, and sustained by two little pillars, one of
which is hollow, and furnished with a cock, e. Let
the other vessel be divided by a partition into two
parts ; the lower of which may be opened, or closed,
by means ofa cock at U.
   Upon the partition place an image, a, which the
spectator at /, cannot see, by a direct ray/, g. If
now the cock, e, be opened, the water descending
into the cavity, beneath the ray, will be refracted
from the perpendicular ; so that the spectator will
now see the object by the refracted ray. And again
shutting the cock, e, and opening the other, d, the
water will descend into the lower cavity ; whence
 the refraction ceasing, no rays will now come from
the object to the eye ; but by shutting the cock, </,

212             recreations in science.
again, and opening the other, e, the water will fill
the cavity again, and bring the object in sight afresh.
                      Artificial Halos.
    The coloured rings, or halos, which are often seen
surrounding the moon and sun, are occasioned by
very thin vapour diffused through the atmosphere.
They are supposed chiefly to encircle the moon ;
but, in this climate, hardly a day passes with light
fleckered clouds, when, at least, portions of halos may
not be perceived near the sun. It is only necessary
 to remove the glare of light which makes the deli
 cate colours appear white. Thus, if we examine
 the reflexion from a smooth surface of water, we
 shall perceive that the sun gilds the fleecy clouds
 with segments of beautiful coloured rings. This
 effect is still more distinctly seen, if the rays from a
 hazy or mottled sky be received upon a sheet of
 white paper, held before a small hole in the window-
 shutter of a dark room. But even when the sun
 shines from an azure firmament, circles of the rich
 est tints may be produced by experiment. Holding a
 hot poker below, and a little before the small hole in
 the shutter, throw a few drops of water upon, and the
 sun will be painted on the paper like the glowing
 radiations of the passion flower. The appearance is
 exactly similar to what the traveller, in awakening
 from a short slumber, perceives in a winter's morn
 ing, on opening his wearied eyes to a burning candle.
  concentric rings of violet, green, yellow, and red.
                   Beautiful Experiment.
     It is easy to imitate and examine a most remark
  able optical deception of horizontal refraction, by
  means of a square parallelopiped composed of plate
  glass. Having filled the half of this with cold water,
  let hot water be gently poured over it, and the
  cover placed upon the top. On standing a few feet
  behind the parallelopiped, and looking at distant

                RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.            213
objects through the stratum where the hot and cold
water have become blended, the double and inverted
images will for a short time be clearly perceived.
But a more durable effect is obtained, by filling one-
third of the glass case, as represented in Fig. 32,
with syrup, or a strong solution of white sugar, ano
ther third with distilled water, and the rest with
pure alcahol. A mutual penetration slowly takes
place between the conterminous surfaces of the alco
hol A, and the water B, and between this and the
syrup C, and after the lapse of perhaps two or three
days, the blending spaces become sufficiently broad
for observation. The appearances then are such as
those exhibited.
                   Phosphoric Tapers.
   Take a glass tube about four inches long, and one
or two lines in the bore, closed at one end ; intro
duce into it a few grains of phosphorus, previously
 dried on blotting paper. When this has been done,
 put a small taper, the extremity of which has been
 deprived of wax, into the tube, taking care that the
 end of the taper freed from the wax touches the
 phosphorus. Then seal the open end of the tube
 hermetically, and plunge the extremity into hot
 water, which will cause the phosphorus to melt and
 affix itself to the cotton of the wax taper. A line
 may then be drawn, by means of a diamond, or file,
 at one end of the tube. To use these tapers, the
 tube must be broken at the marked line ; and, when
 the taper is drawn out, it takes fire and burns
 rapidly.
 To imitate the lumino'is Appearance of the Lunar Disc.
    Introduce a few pieces of phosphorus of the size
 of a pea, into a hollow glass ball of three or four
 inches in diameter, and having heated it to cause the
 phosphorus to catch fire, keep turning the ball

round, till half the inner surface is covered with
phosphorus. When the inflammation has ceased,
there will be left a whitish crust or lining, which
in a dark place shines for some considerable time.
Broad spaces will assume by degress an obscure as-
pect, while circular spots frequently interspersed,
will yet glow with a vivid lustre.
           Phosphorescence produced by Heat.
   Take coarsely pulverized fluor spar ; sprinkle it,
in darkness, on the surface of a fire-shovel heated
below redness ; it will shine with a beautiful phos
phorescent light, and the shovel will appear, for a few
seconds, as if sprinkled over with gems. To exhibit
the luminous property of fluor spar in the greatest
perfection, let some oil be heated in a Florence flask
till it nearly boils, and drop into it, gradually, pul
verized fluor spar ; the moment the latter touches
the hot oil, a bright flash of light is emitted, which
may be renewed by a fresh admixture of fluor spar,
and by shaking the vessel. The variety of fluor
spar, which is of a purple blue colour, and which,
when scraped or struck, emits a fetid bituminous
odour, is more phosphorescent by heat than any
other variety of this mineral.
                 The Portable Diorama.
   The ingenious and beautiful invention of the
Portable Diorama is a most instructive and delight
ful production of art, capable of affording endless
and refined amusement to all ranks and ages. A neat
box contains a series of transparent views, abbey
ruins, sea-pieces, various landscapes, &c., which fit
into a slight wooden frame. There is also a number
of atmospheric and other effects produced by having
similar transparencies painted in clouds, with a rain
bow, with a moon, or merely plain pieces of silk, of
crimson, yellow, &c. ; any of which, being placed
behind the first-mentioned views, (and occasionally

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.                215
combined with a moveable gauze curtain,) impart
to them all the changes of morning, evening, dawn,
sunset, moonlight, &c. &c., and gratify the spectator
with the most charming and picturesque changes.
Objects seem to take novel positions, and the entire
scenes have all their relations varied from tempest
to profound repose. It is really difficult to imagine,
without seeing them, how materials so unimposing
in their forms should be made to convey so much
gratification to the mind.
                      Coral Islands.
   The coral-making animals do not commence their
labours at the extreme depth of the ocean, but on
 rocky shoals, the summits of sub-marine mountains,
 round which they form a united chain, irregular in
shape, but generally approaching more or less to a
circle. The outer ledge of the reef exposed to the
surf of the sea is the first that shews itself above
 water; in process of time it becomes indurated,
 breaks, and crumbles by the action of the sea, and at
 length forms a barrier, within the sloping sides of
 which the living animals are seen carrying on their
 operations. Those observed by Chamiso, (the natu
ralist with Lieut. Kotzebue,) were the tubipora
 musica, millepora, coelurea, obstichopora, and vari
 ous kinds of polypi. As soon as the ledge has reached
 such a height that it remains almost dry at low-
 water, the coral insects leave oil' building any higher.
   Coral reefs rise almost perpendicularly on the
 windward side, sometimes from the depth of 200
 fathoms.
                Steam-Gun Experiments.
    At length this formidable weapon, destined, if
 ultimately adopted, to change the whole system of
 modern warfare, has been so perfected by Mr. Per
 kins, that the effects of its projectile power, from a
 musket bore, and with a lead ball of the usual

216            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
weight, may be fully judged. A trial was lately
made at Mr. Perkins's manufactory in the Regent's
Park, before the Duke of Wellington and Staff,
together with the field officers of the engineers and
artillery from Woolwich, most competent to judge
from their scientific knowledge. Some preparatory
experiments having been made, about the hour of
nine, <j. m., Mr. Perkins commenced his discharges
separately, but at short intervals, against an iron
target, at the distance of thirty-five yards, being
the utmost length the court- yard of the manufac
tory would admit. The bullets were rendered per
fectly flat with the lowest pressure employed ; and,
on increasing it, they were shivered to small pieces.
Twelve one-men deal planks, framed in grooves an
inch apart, were then opposed to the gun, at the
same distance, and the ball passed through eleven
of them. It was also discharged at a block of wood,
against which the utmost force of gunpowder had
projected bullets, and it was found equal to all that
gunpowder could do. Musket-balls were also sent
through an iron plate one-fourth of an inch thick,
on which the utmost force of gunpowder had been
tried, while that of the steam was not half so high
as it was possible to carry it. The pressure used
was about 900 lbs. to the square inch, or Co atmos
pheres, while it might be carried as high as 200
atmospheres with perfect safety. Hitherto, steam
has shewn its equality with gunpowder in force,
and at 100 times less expense. For example, it
would require 250 musket-discharges to project the
same number of balls as the steam-gun at a slow
rate, say 250 discharges per minute, or 15,000 per
hour, which would demand 15,000 charges of pow
der every hour. The steam-gun would do this with
five bushels of coals. The difference of cost of
 15,000 charges of powder and five bushels of coals
is easily calculated. It next became needful to
shew wherein this terrible weapon of destruction
left all that gunoowder would do far beyond com
petition. To discharge single balls, a hopper had

             RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.              217
been filled with them, and they were dropped, one
by one, into a barrel at the breech, as quick as the
hand could move a small winch. This winch, with
its valve, was now unscrewed, and the barrel com
municated with the steam through an apparatus
resembling the nave of a wheel, into which it was
screwed. A tube, projecting like a single spoke, was
screwed into this nave, (numerous radii of the same
kind were shewn in a model applied to one nave, so
that in one revolution each would stand in turn
perpendicularly over the gun :) close to the gun it
had a valve, above which were fifty-two musket-
balls, and a screw closing the orifice of the tube at
the top. This tube being perpendicular, the bul
lets, on opening the valve, fell into the gun by their
own gravity, and were projected, one by one, at in
tervals barely perceptible to the senses, at the rate
of 1000 per minute. The roar of the discharge
resembled that of the loudest thunder; and the
contents of one tube discharged in three or four
seconds, afforded the most awful evidence of the
power of this " mighty fluid" that imagination can
conceive. After a discharge or two of this kind, at
the target, in which the balls were shivered to
atoms, and the ground strewed with their frag
ments, a plank of deal, about two feet wide, placed
horizontally against a brick wall, was fired at,
giving the gun a trifling lateral motion at the same
time. The bullets perforated the board from end
to end, regularly, at a few inches only apart from
each other, and with astonishing regularity, the
gun being capable of motion, like the pipe of a fire
engine, in any direction. Thus, one musket-bore
barrel would, in a second or two, annihilate a com
pany of infantry opposed to it in line, and dis
charge nearly three times as many balls at once, as
a company of ninety men could do with muskets
previously loaded :—to re-charge their pieces before
such a weapon, would be impossible. What, then,
could not fifty such guns effect ; the astonishing
precision with which the balls are projected, each

218           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
hitting within an inch of its predecessor, was exem
plified by a discharge against a brick wall, 18 inches
thick.    One discharge literally dug out a hole
nearly a foot in diameter, half through its entire
thickness, and this with common lead balls only :
iron ones would have gone through it. A laudable
anxiety has been displayed by government to avail
itself of this tremendous application of steam, and
we may now rest assured it will not be lost. Ten
steam cannon in a field of battle would be more
than equal to 200 on the present system, and a ves
sel of only six guns would be rendered more than
a match for a 74. Of 500 balls fired every minute
from one of these guns, if only one out of twenty
were to reach the mark, ten of such guns would
destroy 150,000 men daily. Unfortunately, it re
quires something more than individual property
to try the discovery on a large scale. Mr. Per
kins should be employed to direct other experi
ments, and perfect his invention upon the public
account, for it is easy to see that this use of steam
is yet but in its infancy, giant as it is : and that the
expenses of enlarged experiments are more than
private property can be expected to sacrifice.
   The adoption of the most destructive implements
possible in war, will be most friendly to humanity,
by shortening its duration. Offensive war will pro
fit much less than defensive. A fort may be made
impregnable against an attacking force: and a
breach (could such a thing be made under the fire
of steam artillery,) could not be stormed. It is
impossible to foresee what changes this discovery
may not effect in the history of nations.
                    Production of Ice.
   A chemist at Caen has discovered a very conve
nient method of obtaining ice at every season. It
consists in mixing, in a small cask, five pounds of
sulphate of soda pulverized, with four pounds of

                RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.             219
sulphuric acid, at 36 degrees. The composition is
capable of quickly freezing water. This freezing
would inevitably take place at once, if large quanti
ties were used ; but in cases in which only such
quantities as those above-mentioned are employed,
the vessels necessarily parting with a large portion
of their caloric to the bodies which they contain,
the mixture must be made three times before the
production of ice can be insured.
               Improved Galvanic Battery.
    A considerable improvement in the mode of form
 ing the troughs of a galvanic battery has been made
 by Mr. Hart, of Glasgow; in order to illustrate
 which, it will be desirable to notice the preceding
 improvements of this interesting and powerful ap
 paratus.
    The substitution of the galvanic trough, instead
 of the pile of Volta, we owe to Mr. Cruikshanks,
 Of Woolwich; but the exciting liquid causes a
 trough, made of wood, to warp, which cracks the
 cement, by which the plates are fixed, and the
 liquid insinuates itself inco the fissures so as to
 destroy the insulation, and the repair of this defect
 is troublesome. In the Children battery, porce
 lain troughs were employed instead of wooden
 one's ; these, however, are expensive, and from the
 affinity of the glazing, for acidulated moisture, it is
 difficult to keep the upper edges so dry as to render
 the insulation perfect. Dr Wollaston's ingenious
  improvement added to the power of the battery,
  yet did not remove the defect we have noticed.
  But Mr. Hart, after seeing the improvement made
  by Dr. Wollaston, who introduced a counterpart
  of copper to each plate of zinc, determined to add
  sides and bottoms to the double copper plates, so
  that they might form cells of themselves for the
  acidulated liquid ; and copper, he found by experi
  ence, was only partially acted upon by the exciting

220            RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
liquid ; therefore this arrangement enabled him to
dispense with the use of troughs.
    In a battery constructed in this manner, the
power, measured by the amount of gas evolved
from the decomposition of water, was found conside
rably superior to that of one on the construction
proposed: by Dr Wollaston ; and the augmentation
of power Mr. Hart attributes entirely to the insu
lation being more perfect in his arrangement.
                 Experiments in Optics.
        Dr. Brewster, on the Powers of the Eye.
    If we look on a narrow slip of white paper placed
upon a black or a coloured ground, it will never
appear to vanish, however long and attentively we
view it. But if the eye be fixed steadily upon any
 object within two or three inches of the paper, so
as to see it only indirectly, or by oblique vision, the
 slip of paper will occasionally disappear, as if it had
 been removed entirely from the ground, the colour
of the ground extending itself over the part of the
retina occupied by the image of the slip of paper.
 If the object seen indirectly be a black stripe on a
white ground, it vanishes in a similar manner ; and,
what is still more remarkable, the same phenomena
of disappearance take place whether the object be
viewed with one or with both eyes. When the indirect
object is luminous, like a candle, it never vanishes
entirely, unless it be placed at a great distance ; but
it swells and contracts, and is surrounded by a halo
of nebulous light, so that the excitement must
extend itself to contiguous portions of the retina,
which are not influenced bv the light itself. If we
place two candles at the distance of about eight or
ten feet from the eye, and about twelve inches from
each other, and view the one directly, and the other
indirectly, the indirect image will be encircled with
a bright ring of yellow light, and the bright light
within the ring will have a pale blue colour. If

               RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.             221
 the candle be viewed through a prism, the red and
green lights of the indirect image vanish, and leave
only a large mass of yellow, terminated by a portion
of blue light. While performing this experiment,
and looking steadily and directly at one of the
prismatic images of the candle, Dr. Brewster was
surprised to observe that the red and green rays
began to disappear, leaving only yellow and a small
portion of blue : and when the eye was kept im
moveable fixed on the same part of the image, the
yellow light became almost pure white, so that the
prismatic image was converted into an elongated
image of white light. If the slip of white paper,
viewed indirectly with both eyes, be placed so near
as to be seen double, the rays which proceed from
it no longer fall on corresponding points of the re
tina. In this case, the two images do not vanish
simultaneously, but when the one begins to disap
pear the other begins soon after it, so that they
sometimes appear to be invisible at the same time.
In order to ascertain whether or not the accidental
colour of an object seen indirectly would remain
after the object had disappeared, Dr. Brewster
placed a rectangular piece of red wafer upon a white
ground, and having looked steadily at an object in
its vicinity, the wafer disappeared ; and though the
accidental colour shewed itselfjust before the wafer
had vanished, yet no trace of colour was visible
afterwards.
   The insensibility of the retina to indirect ira-
Eressions has a singular counterpart in its insensibi-
  ty to the direct impression of attenuated light.
When the eye is steadily directed to objects illumi
nated by a feeble gleam 01 light, it is thrown into a
condition nearly as painful as that which arises from
an excess of splendour. A sort of remission takes
place in the conveyance of the impressions along the
nervous membrane : the object actually disappears,
and the eye is agitated by the recurrence of excite
ments which are too feeble for the performance of
its functions. If the eye had, under such a twilight,
                          u2

222            RECUSATIONS IN SCIENCE.
been making unavailing efforts to read, or to examine
a minute object, the pain which it suffers would
admit of an easy explanation ; but, in the present
case, it is the passive recipient of attenuated light ;
 and the uneasiness which it experiences can arise
 only rrom the recurring failures in the retina to
 transmit its impressions to the optic nerve. The
 preceding facts respecting the affections of the retina,
 while they throw considerable light on the functions
 of that membrane, may serve to explain some of
 those phenomena of the evanescence and re-appear
 ance of objects, and of the change of shape of inani
 mate objects, which have been ascribed, by the
 vulgar, to supernatural causes, and, by philosophers,
 to the acting of imagination. If, in a dark night,
 for example, we unexpectedly obtain a glimpse of
 any object, either in motion or at rest, we are
 naturally anxious to ascertain what it is, and our
 curiosity calls forth all our powers of vision. This
 anxiety, however, serves only to baffle us in all our
 attempts. Excited only by a feeble illumination,
  the retina is not capable of affording a permanent
  sight of the object, and, while we are straining our
  eyes to discover its nature, the object will entirely
  disappear- and will afterwards appear and disappear
  alternately. The same phenomenon may be obser
  ved in day-light by the sportsman, when he endea
  vours to mark, upon the unvarying heath, the
 particular spot where moor game has alighted.
  Availing himself of the slightest difference of tint
  in the adjacent heath, he keeps his eye steadily fixed
  upon it as he advances ; but, whenever the contrast
  of illumination is feeble, he uniformly loses sight
 of his mark ; and, if the retina is capable of again
  taking it up, it is only to lose it again. Dr. Brewster
  concludes bis interesting paper by an explanation
  of the phenomenon observed by Messrs. Herschel
  and South, and shews that an expansion of the
  image accompanies indirect vision, and, therefore, a
 luminous point, seen indirectly, spreads into a disc
 and acts upon a greater portion of the retina: and,

he remarks, that the eye cannot correctly distinguish
the colours of luminous points seen indirectly.
And, he adds, if the explanation of the phenomena
be the correct one, the astronomer may, by direct
vision, obtain a view of faint stars by re-adjusting
his eye.
                    Solar Pltosphorus.
   This name is given to various substances, which,
when exposed to light, combine with it, and emit
it again in the dark. Solar phosphori shine without
any appreciable production of heat. The best sub
stance of this kind is known by the name of Canton's
Phosphorus. To prepare this substance, calcine
oyster-shells in the open fire for half an hour, select
the whitest and largest pieces, and mix them with
flowers of sulphur, in the proportion of one part of
the latter to three parts of the former, pack the
whole closely into a crucible, put on a cover, and
heat it pretty strongly for one hour; when the
crucible has again become quite cold, turn out its
contents and select the whitest pieces for use.
   The quantity of light which an eight-ounce bottle
full of it gives, when brought into a dark room, after
having been exposed for a few minutes to the sun,
or day-light, is sufficient to shew the hour by a
watch, ir the eyes have been previously kept shut a
 minute or two.
   Another preparation of this kind, which is known
by the name of Wilson's Phosphorus, is thus prepared :
 Select ovster-shells, the thicker they are the better ;
then take most of the flaming coals, but not all of
them, off a charcoal fire which is burning briskly,
strew the shells over the surface, and replace the
coals that have been taken off'. In about an hour's
 time, take out the calcined shells, observing to
break them as little as possible ; and, after exposing
 them for a few minutes to the light, they will be
found to have acquired a high degree of phospho
rescence, glowing in the dark in a very beautiful

224           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
manner with most of the prismatic colours. It is
not, however, absolutely necessary that the shells
should be calcined in the open fire ; for, if they are
heated sufficiently in a close crucible, they will
exhibit prismatic colours, chiefly blue and green,
though not so bright as by the former method. If
the calcination is effected in an iron crucible, all
those parts of the shells that are in contact with the
sides of the crucible will glow with a red light.
The contact of inflammable matter, and particularly
charcoal, with the shells during their calcination,
appears to contribute eminently to the brilliancy
of the phosphorus : hence it is, that if shells are
calcined in a crucible in contact with thin plates of
steel, the phosphorus thus produced will be much
brighter, and of more various colours, than when
plates of iron are employed ; tad, on the other hand,
if flat pieces of charcoal are made use of, the
intensity of the colours, especially the blue, green,
and red, is far greater than in those produced
by steel.
    To kindle Spirit of Wine without contact of Fire.
   Pour four or six drachms of spirit of wine into a
tea-cup, and add to it ten or fifteen grains of
chlorate of potash. If to this mixture about six
drachms, by measure, of sulphuric acid be added, it
begins to boil, a multitude of small fire-balls of a
 vivid blue colour dart out of the fluid, and the
 whole bursts into flame.
         v            Compression.
   In gases, expansion produces cold, and compression
 heat. A sudden compression of air produces heat
 enough to inflame tinder. Take a small tube, either
 of glass or metal, about three-eighths of an inch in
 diameter, and four inches long, securely stopped at
 one extremity. Fix a bit of dried fungus to the

                 RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.            229
end of the rammer, then thrust it smartly down the
tube, and the heat of the compressed air therein
contained will cause the fungus to ignite.
 To make tlte Torricellian Experiment, or to prepare a
                          Barometer.
    Procure a glass tube about 33 inches long, with
an aperture of about a quarter of an inch in diame
 ter ; pour mercury into it with a small paper funnel,
 till it is quite full, then place the finger hard upon
 the mouth of the tube, and invert it in a cup half
 filled with quicksilver. If this is dexterously per
 formed, no air will remain in the tube, and it will
 be completely filled with quicksilver from the top
 to within three or four inches of the quicksilver in
 the cup ; this will, however, depend on the state of
 the air at the time of the experiment. Should any
 air remain in the tube, the above operation of in
 verting tbe tube must be repeated till it is expelled.
 A tube prepared in this manner is a barometer in
 the simplest form ; and if fastened to a frame with
 an attached scale, and a small box, containing mer
 cury, instead of the cup, it will be the common ba
 rometer.

          Illustration of the Formation of Water,
    Fill a jar with oxygen gas, and fill also with hy
 drogen gas a bladder, furnished with a stop-cock,
 and with a long brass pipe like the letter S, and
 drawn out to a fine point. On pressing the bladder,
 a stream of gas will issue from the pipe, which may
 be set fire to, and brought cautiously under the
 inverted jar of oxygen gas. By this intercourse,
 the stream of hydrogen gas will be burnt in a con
 fined portion of oxygen gas: by continuing the
 combustion a sufficient time, the water will rise
 gradually witbin the jar. On the first impression

!'20           RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.
of the beat, indeed, a small quantity of gas will
escape from the jar, which will render it difficult to
ascertain what degree of absorption actually takes
place. But this loss may be prevented by using a
jar with a neck at the top, to which a compressed
bladder is firmly tied. The expanded air, instead
of escaping through the water, will now enter the
bladder at the top ; and when the experiment is
closed, and the vessels have cooled, it may be ascer
tained, by pressing out the gas from the bladder,
 what quantity of oxygen has been consumed.
    By the slow but continued inflammation of hy
 drogen gas in common air, a sufficient quantity of
 water may be formed to satisfy any one with respect
 to its composition. This may be done in the fol
 lowing way :—Fill a bladder, furnished with a stop
 cock and pipe, with hydrogen gas. Procure a large
 glass globe, having openings opposite to each other,
 then set fire to the stream of hydrogen gas passing
 from the tube, and introduce it into the centre of
 the globe. The combustion may be continued, if
 required, till all the inflammable air is burnt ; and
 drops of water will be observed running down the
 inside of the globe.
            Effect of Hot Water on Flowers.
     The following feet is deserving of record, as an
  interesting addition to what has hitherto been dis
  covered on the subject of vegetable physiology,
  and as enabling the lovers of flowers to prolong for
  a day the enjoyment of their short-lived beauty.
  Most flowers begin to fede after being kept twenty-
  four hours in water ; a few may be revived by sub
  stituting fresh water; but all the most fugacious
  (such as the poppy, and perhaps one or two others
  excepted) may De completely restored by the use of
  hot water. For this purpose, place the flowers in
  scalding water, deep enough to cover about one-
  third of the length of the stem, and by the time

               RECREATIONS IN, SCIENCE.            227
the water has become cold, the flowers will have
become erect and fresh ; then cut of the coddled
ends, and put them into cold water.
               Mode of Attracting Water.
   Hang a quantity of wool, tied loosely together,
down into a deep well, about five or six yards from
the water ; leave it in that position through the
night, and its weight will, in the morning, be greater
by one-fifth than it was the evening before. The
additional weight will have been caused by the ac
cession of particles of water from the humid atmos
phere.
Illustration of the Art of Calico Printing.— To produce
         a Scarlet Pattern on a Black Ground.
   Boil a piece of white muslin, or calico, for a few
minutes, in a solution of acetate of iron, and dry it
strongly near a fire. Having done this, rince it
in water, and dye it black, by boiling it for a short
time with a few chips of logwood and water; and,
lastly, clear it of the superfluous dye, by rinsing it
in water. Then suffer the dyed cloth to dry again,
and sprinkle it over with lemon-juice, or dilute mu
riatic acid. It will then be seen, that, wherever the
lemon-juice is applied, it will turn the dyed stuff
of a scarlet colour ; and in this manner any pattern
may be produced upon a black ground, upon calico
or linen cloth.
        To produce White upon a Black Ground.
   Boil a piece of white muslin for a few minutes in
a solution of sulphate of iron, composed of one

spots, or any pattern you choose, with lemon-juice ;
render it dry again, and rinse it well in water. If
the stuff' now be boiled with logwood chips and wa
ter, it will exhibit white spots upon a black ground.
Experiment to shew the separation of Bodies by Weight.
   Take a bottle with a long neck, and fill part of
it with water ; take a glass, and pour claret and water
into it ; reverse the bottle with the bottom upwards,
.-topping the mouth of it with your finger; then
dip the mouth within the glass, and remove the
finger : keep the bottle in that position for a time,
and the wine will separate from the water, ascend
and settle in the top of the bottle, and the water
will descend from the bottle, and settle in the bot
tom of the glass ; the passage will be apparent to
the eye, for you will see the wine, as it were in a
small vein, rising through the water.
   Let the upper glass be wine and the lower water,
there follows no motion at all ; this separation of
the wine and water appears to be made by weight,
the water being made pensile, and a considerable
weight of it in the belly of the bottle, supported by
a small pillar of the same liquid in the neck of the
bottle, it is this circumstance which sets the motion
at work, for wine and water in a vessel will not se
parate by long standing.
 To bleach Books and Copper-plate Prints, which have
          become discoloured by Age, Smoke, fyc.
   If a book, take off the binding, unsew the leaves,
and separate then ; place them in a shallow leaden
vessel, with slips of common window glass inter
posed between them, so that the leaves or prints' lie
horizontally, without touching each other; or, a
still better method is the following : —Make a wood
en frame, of about the size of the leaves or prints to

                RECREATIONS IN SCIENCE.             229
be bleached, and having placed upon it the slips of
glass, let the leaves or prints be placed on the glass
perpendicularly, about a line distant from each
other. This being done, pour into the vessel the
bleaching liquid, which is made by dissolving one
part by weight of oxmuriate of lime, in four parts of
warm water, and suffer the articles to be immersed
in it for twenty-four hours ; they may then be
rinsed in soft water. By this process the paper will
acquire a whiteness superior to what it originally
possessed. All ink spots, if any, will be removed ;
but oil or grease spots are not affected by it. Cop
per-plate prints bleach more easily than letter-press.
                 Cleaning of Engravings.
    Put the engraving on a smooth board ; cover it
 thinly with common salt, finely pounded ; pour, or
 squeeze lemon-juice upon the salt, so as to dissolve
 a considerable portion of it ; elevate one end of the
 board, so that it may form an angle of about forty-
 five or fifty degrees with the horizon. Pour on the
 engraving boiling water from a tea-kettle, until the
 salt and lemon- juice be all washed off; the engrav
 ing will then be perfectly clean and free from stains.
 It must be dried gradually on the board, or some
 smooth surface. If dried by the fire, or the sun, it
  will be tinged with a yellow colour.
  To form a Lamp which floats on the Surface of the Oil
                    which it consumes.
    Take a piece of common writing paper, and cut
 it in the form of a circle, of about three-eighths of
 an inch in diameter ; in the middle of which, make a
 small hole with a pin, and insert a small piece of
 soft cotton thread, raised nearly a quarter of an
 inch above the paper ; this serves as the wick of the
 lamp, and, when lighted, has the effect of making

the whole move about on the surface of the oil, in a
very curious manner.
  To exhibit the Pressure of Fluids at different Depths.
   The pressure of fluids at very great depths is
finely illustrated by making a well corked empty
bottle descend to a great depth, and then pulling it
up again : however well corked it may be, the cork
is always found in the inside, and the bottle full of
water, when pulled up.
            Experiment with a Bed-hot Poker.
   The effects Commonly known by the appellations
of mirage, and Fata Morgana, may be completely
imitated, as Dr. Wollaston has shewn, by looking at
a distant object along a red-hot poker, or through a
saline or saccharine solution, with water and spirit
of wine floating on it. Fig. 34 shews the appearance
of a pin, and of the word POKER, when looking
along the surface of a red-hot poker.
                   Magnetic Experiment.
    The following easy experiment furnishes a nume
 rous assemblage of little phenomena.
    Put on a board a pinch of iron filings, and so place
 a magnet underneath the board, that its direction, if
 continued, would pass through the centre of the
 part strewed with filings. In proportion as you
 agitate the board by slight concussions, you will
 see the particles of filings disperse themselves on
 all sides, as if they were moved upon the radii of a
 circle, leaving void the spot they first occupied,
 and ranging themselves round it in the form of a
 disc.

                    Prismatic Spectrum,
    The common optical instrument called a prism is
 a triangular piece of glass, through which, if a pen
 cil of rays is made to pass, and thrown on a white wall
 or screen, an oblong spectrum is produced, which is
 variously coloured, and it consequently follows that
some of the rays are more refrangible than others.
    The spectrum thus formed is, perhaps, the most
beautiful object which any of the experiments of
philosophy present to our view. The lower part,
which consists of the least refrangible rays, is of a
lively red, which, higher up, by insensible grada
tions, becomes an orange ; the orange, in the same
manner, is succeeded by a yellow ; the yellow by a
green ; the green by a blue ; after which follows a
deep blue or indigo ; and, lastly, a faint violet.
                  The Prismatic Tetotum.
    Cut out a circular piece of stout card-paper, on
which paint the prismatic colours in the proper pro
portions, which, if the space occupied by the colour
ed ray be divided into 360 equal parts, the different
colours will occupy the spaces as described at Fig.
31. Fix an ivory peg in this piece of card paper,
like a common tetotum, and, causing it to turn round
rapidly, it will be found that no particular colour
can be perceived, but that a light greyish colour is
produced.
                     Snow Spectacles
    Are made of wood, or solid bone, properly formed
to cover the organs of vision, and tied on behind the
bead. They have two slits the exact length of the
eyes, but very narrow, and can be seen through, very
distinctly, and without the least inconvenience-
They were invented by the Esquimaux, who call
them their " snow-eves," the use of which preserves
them from snow-blindness, a very dangerous and

232            RECBEATIONS IN SCIENCE.
painful malady, caused by the action of the light
strongly reflected from the snow, especially in the
spring, when the sun is considerably elevated above
the horizon. The use of these eyes considerably
strnegthens the sight, and the Esquimaux are so
accustomed to them, that when they have a mind to
view distant objects, they commonly use them in
stead of spy-glasses. Surely, a more ingenious device
never originated among any untutored tribe.
                         Paradox.
   How can twenty-four trees be planted, that there
shall be twenty-eight rows, and four trees in each ?
   First, make a circle Fig. 33, which divide into
eight equal parts, and inscribe two geometric squares,
in each of which draw two diagonals ; then draw the
lines AB, AC, &c. from all the angles of both the
squares ; after which, draw the parallels, as per figure,
and it will answer the conditions of the problem.
                   Artificial Memory.
   To remember any thing in history, &c. a word is
formed, the beginning whereof being the first sylla
ble ofthe things sought, does, by frequent repetition,
of course draw after it the latter part, which is so
contrived as to give the answer : thus, in history, the
deluge happened in the year before Christ 2348, and
is signified by the technical word Delelok, del stand
ing for deluge, and etok for the figures expressing
the period, as hereafter shewn. The first thing,
therefore, is to learn exactly the following series of
vowels and consonants, which are to represent the
numerical figures, so as to be able, at pleasure, to
form a technical word, which shall stand for any
number, or to resolve a word already formed, thus-^
    a e i         0    u au       01   ei    ou     y

Here, a and b stand for 1, e and d for 2, and so on.
   These letters are assigned arbitrarily t' the re-
spective figures, and may very easily be renietiAjered.
The diphthong au being composed of a 1 and u 5
stands for 6 ; oi for 7, being composed of o 4 and i 3 ;
ou for 9, being composed o 4 and u 5. The dipthong
ei will easily be remembered for 8, being the initials
of the word. In like manner, for the consonants,
where the initials could conveniently be retained,
they are made use of to signify the number, as t for
3, f for 4, s for 6, and n for 9, the rest were assigned
without any particular reason. Thus, to remember
the diameter of the orbit of the earth in English
miles 172,102,795, the technical word for which will
be dorbter boid-aze-poul ; further let it be observed,
that as z and y are made use of to signify the cy
pher, where many of them meet together, to avoid
repetition, let g stand for hundred, th for thousand,
and m for million ; thus, ag will be 100, ig 300, ong
903, &c., ath 1000, oth 4000, &c. ; for instance, sol-
conter esoklaum is the technical word for the solid
content of the earth 264,856,000,000 cubic miles.
   In the application thereof to chronology, the ages
of the world before our Saviour's time are generally
divided into six ; the first from the creation to the
deluge, the second from the deluge to the call of
Abraham, &c. according to the following periods :

These two lines are a short history of the first six
general councils, and each syllable has its distinct
signification.
   The first represents the place where it was held ;
the second shews who was pope at that time ; the
third, under what emperor ; the fourth, against what
heretic ; the fifth, in what year of our Lord ; for in
stance, Nicsilconarife/, nio, denotes the council of
Nice; sil, Pope Silvester; con, the Emperor Constan -

The second memorial word Codathemateio, co, de
