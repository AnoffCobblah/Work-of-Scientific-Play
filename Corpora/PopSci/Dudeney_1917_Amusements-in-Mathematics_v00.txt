                                                                                                                          with his walking-stick. But every lady is pro            wearing a coat already, while No. 7 lady is very
                                                                                                                          vided with a parasol, except No. 3 ; therefore           lightly clad.   We therefore pair No. 7 lady with

                                                                                                                          Then No. 12 is holding a bicycle, and the dress-         and we are consequently forced to the conclusion
