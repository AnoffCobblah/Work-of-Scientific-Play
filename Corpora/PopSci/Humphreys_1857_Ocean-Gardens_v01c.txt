                      INTRODUCTION.
WHAT the vast majority of our migratory flocks of
summer and autumnal idlers generally do and think
at the sea-side, cannot be better exemplified than
by reference to the clever sketches which are found
occupying entire pages of our illustrated periodicals
and newspapers, during the season of marine migra
tion. But the habits and customs of the annual
shoal of visitors to our watering-places, may be still
more intimately comprehended through the medium
of the sprightly essays which generally accompany
those truly artistic delineations.
    And is there really nothing better to do—no
                            1.               E.

better regime to go through, than the daily repetition
of the monotonous programme of entertainment thus
playfully described and ridiculed       P
    Surely the visitor at the sea-side is in reach of
something more pleasant and profitable than such a
routine !
     Do not the sublime aspects of the ocean—the
sound of its deep, ceaseless voice—the eternal on
coming of its waves, now in calm undulations, and
now in hurtling wildness against the base of those
cliffs whose white brows are wreathed with perennial
flowers—suggest  other matters both for reflection
and amusement *     Surely the very whispering of
the breeze that has travelled so far over that vast
moving surface of the fathomless deep, and which
seems muttering of its mysteries, while laden with
its sweet saline odour—“ce parfum acre de la mer,”
as Dumas has termed it—might lead us towards
other and higher trains of thought. Surely those
voices in the wind, mingling with the strange             mur
mur of the waves as they break in cadenced regu
larity upon the shore, rouse, in the feelings of those
who hear them     forthe first time,        or
                                         after   long a
absence, strange sensations    admiration, and curio
                              of
sity, and wonder.     But no;      to

understand                     of Nature's language,
                          the word-music
nor to read the brightly-written signs on     mighty                           its
page.
    To appreciate Nature,                             as   well    as     Art, the mind
requires       a   special education, without which the eye
and the ear perceive but little
                                                                       of of
                                    the miracles
passing before them. To the eye     the common
observer, the farthest field the landscape             in                                 is    as
green   the nearest,
            as         the scene outspread before
                                          in
him; while    the practised glance
                          to          the accom                           of
plished artist, every yard                         of      distance lends            its     new
tone      of     colour      the tints
                                to          the herbage, till,
                                                            of
through            thousand delicate gradations, the brightest
verdure      at a    last mingles with the atmospheric hue,
and     eventually lost
       is                  the pervading azure.
                                          in                                                   If,

interpreted               by
                 the untutored eye, how should her
more hidden mysteries                       be          understood,

                water that covers     many mysteries,             so
would feel, like the child taken for the first time
within the walls                 of   a   theatre,          an    intense anxiety              to

does not guess at the wonders concealed                                  by the
dark-green curtain of the ocean, and, consequently,
never dreams of wishing to peep beneath     waving                 its

              OR,   GLIMPSES BENEATH THE WATERS.
   I would remind all those suffering from inactivity
of mind, of the wholesome dread of that kind of
mental torpor entertained by the Gymnosophists;
who, as Apuleus tells us, when they met at meals,
required that each should be able to narrate the
particulars of some discovery, or original thought,
or good action, or it was deemed that he did not
exhibit sufficient reason for being allowed to con
          a
sume a share of the Viands, and he was conse
quently excluded from the repast. Were each of our
most idle sea-side loungers to impose upon himself
the necessity of a discovery, or an original thought,
before he considered himself entitled to dine, that
torpor, so deadening to the natural capacities of his
mind, would soon give way to a state of mental
activity, which, were it only from the brightness of
the contrast, would be found highly agreeable, to say
nothing of its advantages, or of the elevating and
refining trains of thought to which it would neces
sarily give rise.
   I know of nothing more likely to stimulate the
mind to healthy exertion, and take it out of the
immediate track of common interests and pleasures,
the monotony of which is so oppressive, than the
study of natural history in some of            its
                                    least explored

how few there are who seek that charming mode of
dissipating the dreary monotony of social life, such

popular        love of natural          history, even in     best         its

subject,     in fact, is but even now beginning              to
develop itself beneath the pens of an enterprising
band of marine naturalists, with such leaders as
Johnston, Harvey, John Edward Gray, the indefati
gable Gosse, and the revered shade of the lamented
Forbes at their head.
     A truly popular knowledge even of those more
accessible regions of our woods and fields, is but
little more ancient; for, till Gilbert White had
made the story of such knowledge as attractive as
romance, in his “ Natural History of Selborne,” few
guessed what an arena of ever new interests and
discoveries it presented.
    Through the fascinating        interpretation
                                            of the
good Gilbert, many now understand the attraction of
those branches of natural history which he so curi
ously investigated; but few are willing to admit that
it is   as easy to make the natural featuresof some
obscure fishing-village, with no herbage on its bare
rocks, and no bush, no blade of grass, no bird to be
seen or heard, equally interesting; yet      I
                                          can assure
them, that by lifting even the mere border of that
green curtain of the ocean, or by awaiting        its   unveil

                     CHAIPTER     II.
              THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN.
THE wonders of the ocean floor do not reveal them
selves to vulgar eyes.    As the oracle was inaudible
to sacrilegious listeners, and as none but poetic ears
heard the cadenced beating of the feet that danced
to unearthly music, near the fountain       haunted by
the Muses of classic fable—so, none but the initiated
can see the myriad    miracles that each receding tide
reveals on the ocean floor. The initiation, however,
is   not  mysterious;    there are    no dark rites to
observe—no Herculean labours to accomplish, before
entering upon the noviciate, which at once opens a
large area of unexpected      pleasures, and an ample
field for admiration and investigation.          A few
elementary works carefully studied, or even this
present little book attentively perused, would supply
the first helps towards seeing, at all events, a por
tion of the “wonders of the shore,” as the brilliant
author of “ Glaucus” has eloquently termed those
revelations of the retiring deep.
   It is the seeing that is everything.    But let none

the Devonshire squire, Colonel George Montague”
(thus wrote the late                   Professor         Edward        Forbes),
“might have become one of the greatest in the whole
range of British science, had his whole career been
devoted to marine physiology;” and that mainly be
cause, from a sincere devotion to a favourite pursuit
of his leisure,    acquired the art of seeing—an
                           he
art sought by so few, though open to     who will                all
earnestly seek            it.
    Each department                  of    science requires       a    separate
and distinct         kind       of   sight.      The astute merchant

there are things well worthy of investigation beyond
the region of money-making, and the attractive but
narrow circle distinguished      by the fascinating cha
racters, £ s. d.
     Those who cannot see Nature, who cannot see
more than an unclean thing in the little creeping
beetle, are like one gazing at a carved Egyptian
record, who perceives, in the hieroglyphic scarabaeus,
simply the sculptured figure of a beetle, and no
more—they are in      a state of   “Egyptian darkness”
as regards one of the highest and most enchanting
fields of human research.        But to those who have
acquired this rare though easy art, and learned to
see  Nature, even to a moderate extent (for in that
art are an infinite number of degrees and grada
tions), the aspect of the ocean floor must present
 an appearance as beautiful and strange, and seem
ingly   as supernatural,   as the wildest imagination
 could depicture.
     When poets would travel, in their inventive
flights, to other floating and revolving worlds than
ours, they describe rosy skies, instead of azure, and
trees like branching crystals, with jewel-like fruits
glittering on every stem.         They present us with
pictures, in short, in which all the ordinary aspects
 of our planet are reversed, or metamorphosed, in the
region of their invention   ;  but in their most fanciful
                              11

                     OCEAN GARDENS:
 pictures they do not surpass in strangeness the
 wonders of the world beneath the sea.
     On the land, we have, as the ordinary aspect of
 Nature, the green herbaceous mantle of the earth
below the eye, and the azure sky above; while a
 spectator, standing beneath the water on the ocean
 floor, would see these features more than reversed:
 he would see above him a liquid atmosphere of green,
 and below,    an  herbage     of red or of purple hue,
exhibiting strange yet exquisite forms, such         as no
terrestrial vegetation displays.         Roseate shrubs of
jointed stone, and arborets of filmy glass, and crea
tures full of active, emergetic life, whose forms are
 stranger still, both in structure and in appearance;
mere worms, whose colours are gorgeous as the
tints of the butterfly's wing, or the peacock's tail,
or the humming-bird’s breast.
     What scenery is formed by that translucent
and miniature forest of Delesseria sanguinea, how
lovely in its tones of soft rich crimson ; and those
fan-like shrubs, in crisply graceful tufts, the bright
and singular Padina pavonia; and the tree-like
masses of Callithamnion arbuscula, and the delicate
 P<U+017F>ilota plumosa, and the purple-tinted Corallines,
forming those
                 “Arborets of jointed stone.”
And then the high waving fronds of the grandly
                             12

            OR, GLIMPSES BENEATH THE WATERS.
graceful Porphyra vulgaris, the deep carmine of the
Iridaea edulis, the nacreous tinges of the Chondrus
crispus, and the blood-red of the splendid Rhody
menia lacinata, with its embroidered and lace-like
edges;   these, with the gorgeous tufts of the rich
purple Bangia, and other objects which form the
elements of still life in a submarine landscape, surely
cannot    be  surpassed,    either   for  magnificence   of
colour or variety of structure.
   But to these features must be added others more
extraordinary—forms        that    the   elder naturalists
imagined to be links between the animal and vege
table creation, but which are now known to have
no affinity whatever with plants, though they exhibit
the appearance of expanded flowers of various hues,
displaying the forms of the Carnation, the Ane
mone, the Mesembryanthemum, and other beautiful
flowers whose names they bear.            These curiously
beautiful Zoëphytes, the wonderful Actinia, exhibit
every tone of colour, from purple and scarlet, to
green and white, and might be taken in their pic
turesquely-placed     groups for rare exotic flowers,
planted among the rosy-tinted shrubs expressly to
add the last touch of richness and effect to the
scenery of an ocean flower-show.
    Yet they are not flowers, but animals—sea
                              13

monsters, whose seeming delicate petals are but their
thousand Briarean arms, disguised as the petals of a
flower, and expanded to seize the unconscious victim
as he passes near the beautiful                   form—fatal to him
as the crater of a                 volcano; in which he is soon
engulphed by the closing tentacles of his unsus
pected enemy. And if he pass not near enough for
that       deadly    floral          pretty crimson
                               embrace,        those
tubercles that dot so gracefully the seeming stalk,
beneath the seeming flower, can shoot forth a thread,
armed,       like the fisher’s line, with              a barbed   hook,
which strikes and secures the distant prey; and so
the unwary Annelid or Infusory is captured and
devoured.           In this    capacity        the creature has been
compared to Pope's spider, who
            “Feels at each thread, and lives along the line.”
But then the living thread of the Actinia (or of the
 Cirriped, which has a similar power) is a fact, while
the sensitive gossamer of the poet is a fiction.
     But notwithstanding these ogre-like attributes,
the lovely Actinia long deceived our naturalists as
to   its   true nature—and               of   course the poets—from
whom his flower-like disc and petaloid tentacles
completely concealed his grosser nature. Then,                       as
the tide recedes,             he    so   meekly closes his beautiful
                                         14

oubliette, with so much grace, and looking so much
like those shrinking flowers that close at eve, as
though they dared not to look on the black darkness
of the night, that it is no wonder poets were be
guiled, and that the romantic Southey sings of the
Actinia as of some lily of the deep that, on the
retiring of the ocean,
          “Sinks down within                 its   purple stem   to   sleep.”
    To add      to
             the wonders   this strange landscape  of
come the creeping Nudibranchs and Tectibranchs,
gliding over the gracefully-waving Algae; their ele

       These, and other wonders of still greater beauty,
  will reward the persevering student who learns
  to see them ; but then he must learn.             Even the
  intellectual giant, Shakspeare, could not see clearly
  many of the minuter things of
                                           Nature.    In his
  line  upon   the slow-worm, for instance, vulgarly
  called the blind-worm, which he describes as
                  “The eyeless, venomed worm,”
 are concentrated two mistakes; in the first place,
 the minute eyes of this little creature are brilliant
 in the extreme, and not very difficult to discover, to
 the naturalist who has learnt to see nature; and, in
 the second place, it has no venom, its tiny bite being
 perfectly harmless. In another place he speaks
                                                         of
                   “The blind-worm's sting.”
 But it is useless to multiply examples of the phy
 siological errors of great men who had
                                                not learned
to see Nature; or, Milton’s errors in regard to the
leaf of the Banyan-tree, and many others, might be
readily cited.

like another Prospero,   he waves his wand, and every

like manner, guided by the fascinating science of a
Johnston or a Harvey, or the persuasive industry of
a Gosse,  or the eloquently glowing descriptions of a
 Kingsley, students, who have not the energy or
leisure to work for themselves, will find the dark
Ocean   glow with an unexpected light; and the
delighted explorer will long for the power to renew
the impressions of his sea-side rambles after his
return to his inland home, perhaps in the heart of a
densely-populated city. Even this he may now do
through the medium of the marine Aquarium, within
the narrow boundaries of which he may, with a little
care and experience, establish in healthy existence
some of the most beautiful of the animal and Vege
table forms that people the caves and depths of the
ocean, and make  its

                   CHAPTER        III.
                     THE AQUARIUM.
 THE successful treatment      of aquatic plants and
 animals, in the confined space of a glass Aqua
 rium, depends entirely upon the discovery that
 there exists in Nature a self-adjusting balance be
 tween the supply of oxygen created in water, with
 the quantity consumed by aquatic animals.       And
 it became   equally necessary   to know   the means
by which that supply was continually generated.
Without the knowledge of these facts, and the
principles  by which    they are regulated, it would
have been impossible to establish such a marine
Aquarium as that we may now any day examine in
the Regent’s Park; where, in a few glass tanks of
very moderate size, we may see examples of some of
the most curious forms of animal and vegetable life
peculiar to the depths of the ocean—forms so singu
lar, that their first exhibition created a sense of
wonder little less intense than that which must have
been caused, long years ago, by the first public dis
play of the mountain form of the elephant to the

people of cold northern     countries; and much more
so than the recent introduction of the giraffe or
hippopotamus, although they have never been seen
in Europe since the days of the Romans.
     Those principles, the knowledge of which was
requisite to enable us thus to view the wonders of
the ocean in their living state in an Aquarium, were
not mastered at once, or by one man, or in one
generation. The nature of certain relations between
 animal and vegetable life, upon which they are
founded, was first advanced by Priestley, towards
 the close of the last century, who proved that plants
 give forth the oxygen necessary to animal life. The
 learned Ingenhauss,     a native   of Breda, but who
 principally resided in England, defined this princi
 ple still more clearly, in a work the title of which
 pretty fully explains the entire nature of his dis
 covery.   It  was published in French, at Leyden,  in
 1778, and in London, in English, in 1779.         The
  French edition is before me, the title of which    I
 translate, “Experiments      upon Plants, which prove
  their important influence in the purification of the
  atmospheric air when they are exposed to the rays
  of the sun, and the contrary results which ensue
  when they are placed in the shade, or during the
  night.” The action of the sun's rays in disengaging
                             20

           OR, GLIMPSES  BENEATH THE WATERS.
the oxygen generated in plants is thus clearly an
nounced, and the knowledge of this principle is one
of those which have mainly conduced, as I have
said, to the successful establishment of Aquaria.
     In the course of his essay Ingenhauss states,
still more directly, that plants “immersed in water,”
when exposed to the action of light, emit an air
which he announces as oxygen gas; and this idea is
the key-stone of the Aquarium.
     But, although the discovery of Ingenhauss at
once rendered the thing practicable, Aquaria did
not then come into fashion. The science of natural
history was not at that time sufficiently advanced;
for the specimens, even in public museums, were
merely heterogeneous collections, assembled without
the slightest regard to classification, or any other
useful   purpose.     A   stuffed cat with nine legs,
 stood, perhaps, next to a bottled snake, followed by
 the skin of a crocodile, to be succeeded in turn by
 a very moth-eaten specimen of a King Charles
 spaniel, “supposed, upon good authority, to have
 belonged   to Nell Gwynne.”      A few scores of such
 objects, with the addition of an ostrich egg and
 a few sea-shells, without any attempt at name or
 description, formed a very respectable museum in
 those times; and we may, therefore, easily conceive
                             21

                     OCEAN GARDENS   ;
that (in  so far as experiments  illustrative of natural
science were concerned)    the suggestions of    Ingen
hauss remained tolerably dormant.
     It was not till the year 1833, that Professor
Daubeny communicated, to the British Association
at Cambridge,      a paper concerning     some new   re
searches prosecuted in the same direction; and not
till 1837, that Mr. Ward became the first to apply
the principle to any purpose analogous to that of
the Aquarium. In that year he made a report to
the British Association, on the hermetically closed
glass cases in which he had succeeded in growing
many classes of plants, and keeping them in a
healthy state without any fresh supply of air.       He
 stated, at the same time, his belief that certain
 classes of animals    would  live and     thrive under
 similar circumstances. This was the first direct
hint towards the formation of a closed Vivarium,
whether atmospheric or aquatic.
     In 1842, Dr. Johnston satisfactorily proved the
true vegetable nature of Corallines by observing
their growth in a vessel containing sea-water; and
thus was established the first true Aquarium. With
the experimental tuft of Coralline was a small frond
of a green Ulva, and numerous Rissoa, &c., and
several Annelids afterwards appeared, having been,
                           22

             OR, GLIMPSES BENEATH THE WATERS.
no doubt, attached to the branches of the Coralline,
or the fronds of the Ulva. At the end of four weeks
the water was still pure, the Molluscs and other
animals alive, and the Confervae grown; the Coral
line having thrown out several additional articula
tions.    After eight weeks, the water still remained
sweet.    But had any animal, of even the lowest order,
been so confined, without the accompanying pre
sence of vegetables giving off oxygen, all of that vital
gas contained in so small a quantity of water would
have been quickly exhausted, and the water would
have become corrupt, ammoniacal, and poisonous to
the life of any living thing.    But the author of this
experiment had not in view the testing of the possi
bility of preserving the forms of ocean life in a
healthy state in confinement; his business had been
to settle an important point connected with the
 classification of the Corallines ; and having success
 fully decided that question, the embryo Aquarium
 was abandoned.
      On the 4th of June, 1850, Mr. R. Warrington
 communicated to the Chemical Society a series of
 observations on the adjustment of certain relations
 between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, very
 important to our present purpose. Two small gold
 fish were placed in a glass receiver, a small plant of
                              23

                           OCEAN GARDENS;
  Valismeria spiralis being planted at the same time
 in some earth, beneath a layer of sand in the same
 vessel. All went on well by this arrangement, with
 out any necessity for changing the water ; the
 oxygen given off by the plant proving itself suffi
cient for the supply of its animal co-tenants, and the
water therefore remaining clean and pure, until some
decaying leaves of the Valisneria caused turbidity,
and confervoid growth began to accumulate on the
sides of the vessel.         To remedy this evil, Mr.               War
rington brought to bear the results of previous obser
vations on water in natural ponds under analogous
circumstances; and, guided by these observations and
their results, he placed a few common pond-snails in
the vessel containing his gold-fish and plant of                   <U+017F>alis
meria.
   The new inmates, immediately upon their intro
duction, began to feed greedily upon the decaying
vegetable         matter, and        all
                                   was quickly restored
to      a   healthy state.  They proved, indeed,    still       of
further advantage, for the           masses     of   eggs which they
deposited evidently presented              a   kind   of   food natural
        the fishes, which was eagerly devoured                by   them,
so to
   that the snails became not only the scavengers,
but also the feeders  the little colony. And
                           of                 this              so
first       of   true Aquaria prospered; the animals and
                                24

            OR, GLIMPSES BENEATH THE WATERS.
 plants proving of mutual value and support to each
 other. The snails disposed of the decaying leaves,
 which would have tainted the water and rendered         it
unfit for the healthy existence of the plant, and the
plant in turn gave forth, under the rays of sunlight,
 the supply of oxygen necessary to both fish and
 snails.
    In January,      1852, Mr. Warrington,     commenced
a series   of similar experiments with sea-water;
which were, at first, not      so satisfactory, but in the
end proved as entirely successful.        In the course of
his experiments, he found the red and brown Algae,
or sea-weed, less proper for the formation of oxygen
than the green.        Of the latter class he procured
specimens of Enteromorpha and Ulva latissima,
which he chiselled from the rocks about Broad
stairs, along with the pieces of chalk or flint to
which they were attached; and, when he placed them
in his own marine Aquarium, he put in along with
them, to represent the pond-snails in the fresh
water tank, some of the common sea-snail,           better
known    as the  Periwinkle (Littorina littorea).     But
these proved,     it  appears, insufficient  for the   de
struction of the mucous and gelatinous matter that
arose from the decay of the red sea-weeds, which,
           I
however, have no doubt may yet be cultivated with
                             25

                      OCEAN GARDENS,
equal success with the green, as       I
                                 shall state when
describing them.    Under the existing difficulty,
Mr. Warrington found it necessary to aerate the
water by other means, many processes being equally
available; such as injecting fresh-water from a
syringe, or establishing a drip, of some height, from
a vessel containing a supply of entirely fresh-water.
Mr. Warrington also discovered, in the course of
these experiments, the necessity that the light
should pass directly through the surface of the
water to the plants, as in natural ponds and seas–
a very important step in the successful manage
ment of Aquaria; and he therefore had a slab of
slate adjusted to the side of his tank which stood
next to the light.
   These successful experiments, both in fresh-water
and marine Aquaria, assign       to    Mr. Warrington,
beyond  dispute, the credit of being the originator,
or inventor, if the term may be so used, of these
charming additions to our conservatories, corridors,
and even living-rooms, to which they are certainly a
much more attractive and instructive addition than
the old globe of blank water, with         its
                                        pair    gold

escaping from their glaring and inconvenient prison;

in which they would inevitably have perished very
shortly but for the daily change of water, which,
previous to our knowledge of air-emitting plants
and their use, was absolutely necessary.
      But another experimentalist was now           in the
field.    Mr.    Gosse,   whose   charming    works upon
Aquaria and other subjects connected with natural
science, have, perhaps, made his name more widely
known than that of his predecessor, Mr. Warrington,
commenced       a series of experiments on the subject
of the marine Aquarium, about the same time as the
last-named gentleman, in the beginning of January,
1852.     His experiments were crowned with such
complete success that he was induced to put him
self in communication with Mr. David Mitchell, the
enterprising Secretary of the Zoological Society, the
result of which was the removal of the collection
 of Annelids and Zoëphytes which Mr. Gosse had
formed, to the gardens of the Society in the Re
 gent’s Park;      where it formed the nucleus from
 which has grown the magnificent series of Aquaria
 in the     building    constructed   specially for   their
reception.     These marine Aquaria at once became a
 subject of public as well as private interest, and the
 Aquarium house was so crowded daily with its curious
 visitors, that it was difficult to get a glimpse of the
                              27

to   require repetition.               His principal difficulty arose
from over-crowding, although his tank did not appear,
as    he   states, too much filled.                   Another disappoint
ment was caused              by
                        putting   animals before the in

           of

    Mr. Gosse’s tank was made with slate bottom,                   a

 1. A tuft of Furcellaria fasti-      7. Several masses of Corallina
       giata.                               officinalis.
 2. Two of Rhodymenia palmata.        8. Griffithsia setacea.
 3. One of Dictyota dichotoma.        9. Delesseria alata.
 4. A small   Fºcus serratus.        10. Plocamºum       coccineum.
 5. One Laminaria digitata.          11. Phylophora rubens.
 6. Two tufts of Padina pavonia.   | 12. Zostera marina.
     In   a few days the water, poured                     carefully    to
these specimens, became clear as pale green crystal,
the green tinge being too slight to obscure the colour
of any object      seen through its medium.
     From these weeds alone, before any supply of
Zoophytes or Molluscs were intentionally added, a
whole host of minute animal life swarmed forth                           ;
 some, doubtless, issuing from eggs newly hatched;
 others from the shelter of the matted ramifications
 of some of the sea-weeds, in which they had been
 taken, as in a net. Among these swarming crea
 tures were Annelids of the genus Syllis, Rissode, and
 other minute shell-fish, but principally Isopodous
 and Entomostracous Crustacea, many of them being
 so minute as not to be perceived                 without the use
 of a powerful lens.

    These additions brought the collection up to above
a hundred specimens, and no doubt the tank made
a glorious show ; but         Mr. Gosse, though the Napo
leon of his specialty, was forced to acknowledge that
there was an “impossible.”                 Although his collec
tion was superb, and his interesting tank did not
look over-crowded, yet he soon discovered that a                     for
bidden limit had been passed, and that the creatures
of the    ocean    that have yards—fathoms—of their
native element to their own separate share, cannot
accommodate        themselves to the allotment system,
in the proportion of a square inch to each individual.
    To remedy this state of things, the evil effects of
which soon became apparent, artificial aeration was
resorted to, by means of another vessel, which kept
up a continuous supply of dripping fresh water. But
even this assistance did not enable the crowded
colony to exist more than ten days. In the first
place, there were many predatory species, which
destroyed their associates;            these kinds must,          there
fore, be excluded from an Aquarium, or kept in a
                                  32

separate  tank.    But, after all, the impossibility of
providing   a sufficient supply    of oxygen was evi
dently the great and principal cause of failure.
The Univalves and smaller Crustacea disappeared
first, a disagreeable smell giving intimation that
decay    was going on, the creatures that had
perished having, many of them, died in conceal
ment, under the stones, weeds, &c., at the bottom of
the Aquarium.      The first signs of unpleasant effluvia
rising from the tank must, therefore, be carefully
attended to ; and, in such cases, the Aquarium
ought to be immediately searched for the cause;
which, when discovered, should be immediately
 removed.
     Mr.  Gosse having taken out the whole of the
 specimens, dead and alive, and carefully cleansed the
 tank,  a much smaller number was         put in, which,
 being well selected, and having sufficient space,
 throve abundantly well; and the ingenious experi
 mentalist was at last amply rewarded for all his
 persevering exertions. This result benefited others
 as well as himself, for a general taste suddenly
 arose for this kind of pursuit, among all who read
 the various works which soon appeared on the
 subject; and, to gratify the new taste, a host of dealers

brisk and profitable trade.
    The first experiments of Mr. Gosse sufficiently
point out the kind of cautions to be observed
in the formation                  of a marine Aquarium.                           The

a suitable position, should not be convenient. A
miniature landing-net is also useful for the removal
of decaying matter, or occasionally the living speci
mens when any change may be required.
   A layer of sand and pebbles, about three inches
deep, placed upon the slate flooring, is the first
step towards arranging the interior of the tank.
Upon this beginning, removing the sand and stones
in places to procure a firm basis, the rock-work
may be built; which should be picturesque and
fanciful in character, as partially suggested in the
two Plates, leaving miniature archways and caves
for the shelter of such creatures             as shun thelight,
either constantly or occasionally.              Such a disposi
tion of the rock imparts, at the same time, many
pleasing effects to the pictorial composition.              These
matters are not, however, much attended to by
dealers, whose arrangements of the Aquaria they offer
for sale are generally tasteless enough.            But that is
perhaps all the better, as it entails upon the ama
teur the necessity            of providing his own          taste,
which is at         all
                     times both   useful and pleasant
                                          a
effort   of   mind, and which, moreover, leaves, after
each period         of        permanent trace
                         exertion,   a           an         of
increased     refinement which influences the whole
character.

      In
       the distribution of the rocks,  would always  I
allow at least one point to project above the water,
in order to afford the opportunity to those animals
whose instincts lead them to seek occasional expo
sure to the air, the means of gratifying it by that
contrivance.       I have
                    thought, indeed, of construct
ing a kind of double Aquarium, and perfecting a
contrivance by means of which a large portion of
water should flow gradually from one tank to the
other at fixed periods, in imitation of the ebb and
flow of the tide.    Many interesting phenomena
would be exhibited in this manner, such as the
closing of the Actiniae as the water receded, and
their expansion as it covered them on its return.
This alternation, too, might be found highly advan
tageous to the health and development of the
animals whose natural habitat lies between high
and low water-mark, and whose constitution is
therefore framed to require entire or partial expo
sure to the air at certain intervals of time.  also          I
prefer, as preserving a similar set of analogies, a
sloping bottom, similar to that of the coast. For
instance, if the slate back of the Aquarium be
placed next the light, which is                its
                                   proper position,
as   the light ought          penetrate        the water entirely
through     its   upper   or to   horizontal     surface,   then I
                                   36

            OR, GLIMPSES BENEATH THE WATERS.
would fill the side next the slate back nearly to the
top with pieces of rock, gradually reducing their
height, till, at the other side, they should hardly rise
above the floor of sand and pebbles,        leaving,   at
last, a flat portion of the pebbly or sandy bottom
quite level.
    When this form of rock-work is decided upon,
the Aquarium should be of rather wider propor
tions than usual, in order to allow of the slope
being pretty gradual. Supposing the tank to fill
entirely  the recess of a spare window, which is
a position in which it looks exceedingly well, a
solid slate back may be found to darken the ves
sel or the room      too much    ; in such   a  case,  a
glass back must be preferred, which can be shaded
from the direct influence of the light by a blue
or green shade of calico neatly fitted to the frame;
and it must be borne in mind, as essential, that
the Aquarium must be so placed as to receive the
direct rays of light during some part of the day,
being screened by a white blind when the sun may
be too powerful; as should the water become tepid,
it would be fatal to many of the inhabitants of the
miniature   sea.
    With due observance of these precautions, the
amateur    may hope to frame         and  establish   an

   THE VEGETATION           OF THE MARINE              AQUARIUM.
As the forest must be planted before its denizens
can luxuriate in its shades, so the submarine
shrubbery of the Aquarium must be perfected before
the aquatic animals can be introduced.  For it has
been shown, in tracing the history of the experi
ments which resulted in the establishment of the
principles that regulate the formation of Aquaria,
that it is by plants only that a supply of oxygen
can be kept up, sufficient for the health and
existence        of all forms of animal life beneath the
water.”          It
             is necessary, also, that the rays of sun
light should fall upon the foliage directly through
the surface of the water; and when an Aquarium,
        in its
with     plants,   placed
                      is        position
                                     in   areceive the to

appearance.

marine tanks of the Zoological Gardens, were at
first those of the Chlorospermatous order, but
others have since succeeded nearly as well. Plants
of Ulva and Conferva have done very well, but the
most successful growth has been that of a plant of
the genus Bryopsis, which, entirely enveloping a
large stone in its mossy and almost feather
like foliage, produces a very beautiful appearance.
Those unlearned in scientific names will be glad,
perhaps, to learn that these beautiful Algae derive
their title from two Greek words, Bryon (8pwov) a
moss, and opsis (orts), a resemblance, from their like
ness to some of the most delicate and feather-like
mosses of our woods.      The delineation of Bryopsis
plumosa in Plate II., on the extreme left near the
lower part of the Plate, will convey some idea of
these elegant sea-weeds.         -
     Chondrus crispus is a beautiful plant, and well
 suited to the Aquarium.       It will often be found
 under ledges of rock, completely concealed by a
 pendant veil of Fucus, commonly known as the
 olive-weed; and, on lifting the tangled mass of
 its rank growth, many beautiful and unexpected
 plants are frequently found, but none strike the
 explorer more than the Chondrus. Its nacreous
 tints, like those of a pearl shell, varying wonder

fully according to situation, being very remarkable.
It is the Carrageen Moss of the herb market.
This plant forms the principal object in the lower
part of Plate       IV.,      to the right.
   Laurencia pinnatifolia is a pretty branching
plant, also varying in hue according to the aspect
in which it grows.               In
                         the shade it is purple, but
when receiving the full influence of the sun's rays,
it   assumes a light-yellow tone; just as the                       Lyco
podium, known as Fortune's Moss, is purple when
grown in the darkest part of a room, but becomes
of an ordinary green tone when placed for some
time near the light.                  The Laurencia is shown at
the upper part of Plate V., coloured pale-violet.
    The splendid plant Rhodymenia palmata, with
its finely-coloured, semi-transparent fronds, is also
recommended.             It
                    is the Dulse, or Dellis, eaten by
the inhabitants of our northern coasts as a delicacy.
Another species of R. lacinata is represented to the
left of Plate V., the transparent light-crimson fronds
of which are excessively beautiful.                       Mr. Gosse tells
us that the Rhodymenia palmata is not suited to an
Aquarium, because it appears to require the motion
of the   sea, and soon begins to decay in                     still water.
If   that be the case,          let   us    provide   a   remedy, for the
plant    is   one   of   the most beautiful among all                   its

of the Amazon river was first introduced, it refused
to flower in the tank provided for      northern                        its
home,      at

trived that        a       small but continuous stream should
enter    at   one end           of   the tank, and,          asit      entered, turn
a   small paddle-wheel, the action  which imparted        of
a    gentle, undulating motion to the water of the
whole tank.   The device was triumphant, and the
glorious Victoria regia formed and expanded its
giant flowers              in   the house which its curator had
constructed            for      it,the plan    which eventually

and when they begin to exhibit spots of orange—a
vegetable plague-spot not to be mistaken—it is a
symptom of decay which should at once cause their
removal from the Aquarium, before their decompo
sition leads to further mischief.
   The common Coralline, Corallina officinalis, of
which a small spray is represented in the extreme
lower part of Plate V., near the centre, is the
“arboret of jointed stone” alluded to by the poet,
and is well suited to Aquaria, thriving with little
trouble.  The smaller and slenderer kind is also
suitable; but care must be taken, in collecting,
not to choose the detached white fragments, which
are washed up with every tide, for they are only
the skeletons of the plant.   It is the rosy-tinted
specimens, verging to violet and purple, and still
attached to pieces of rock, that are alone                fit   to      re
move    to   the Aquarium.
    The Cladophorae are also stated             to   be   very    suit

     In  Plate V. the violet-toned Laurencia pinnati
folia is grouped behind the solid, deep-crimson fronds
 of Iridaea edulis, which are often perfectly Pear
 shaped, like pieces of crimson leather neatly cut in
that form; but the action of tides in rough weather
 often tears the edges, and wears holes through the
 texture of the plant, as shown in the principal
 frond.    To the left is the bright-crimson Rhody
 menia lacinata—one of our most exquisitely beau
 tiful marine Algae. The fronds are as thin as the
 finest conceivable tissue, and beautifully trans
 parent, which is shown wherever the lacinations of
 the edge overlap each other, in which places the
 double thickness of the texture doubles, at the same
 time, the intensity of the colour, as indicated in the
 representation.    On the same level, to the right, is
 a small group  of the delicate green Ulva   latissima
 a plant which has proved useful beyond all others
 in Aquaria, as throwing off, under the action of the

   The best time for making collections at the sea
side is a day or two after the full moon, when the
tide recedes to its greatest extent, and parts of the
shore    become exposed, where some of the finest
species grow,  which cannot be conveniently ap
proached at any other time.     It must be borne in
mind, also, that few of the floating pieces will
grow, however fresh and seemingly washed off with
their root. Certain success is only to be secured by
chiselling off a portion of the substance on which
the weed is growing—thus transplanting it with     its

strange instincts              and anomalous forms have been
mainly instrumental                   in        attracting          the attention
of      many classes       of    the public             to  that curious in

     First, of the Actiniae, or Sea-Anemonies.     These
flower-formed animals were once thought to form a
curious and astonishing link between the animal and
vegetable world; and many curious speculations,
based upon that idea, were put forth, among which
the links between man and the inferior animals,
 and between quadrupeds        and fishes, were asserted
 in further illustration of the theory.    But the decep
tiveness of superficial knowledge, based upon imper
fect observations, was never more strikingly exem
plified than in the present instance.     It was thought
 that, because these creatures were found attached
 to rocks, they necessarily drew their nourishment
 principally through the medium of roots, as all true
 plants do; more accurate observation, however, has
 shown that they are not permanently fixed to the
 rocks, and that they have the power of moving from
 one place to another, and attaching themselves anew,
 whenever a sufficiently      disturbing   cause renders
 such removal     desirable.   Again, oysters and mus
 sels remain fixed to rocks without being considered
 allied to plants on that account; and even some fish
 have the power of attaching themselves to such and
  other substances by means of curiously-formed
                             52

            OR, GLIMPSES BENEATH THE WATERS.
ventral fins, peculiarly fitted for the purpose.    The
pretty little two-spotted sucker, Lepidogaster bima
culatus, possesses this faculty.
     But the flower-like form into which the arms,
or food-seizers, of the Actiniae are spread, radiating
from a centre like the petals of a flower, was the
main reason for supposing a close analogy between
these strange creatures      and plants—a   fancy   now
utterly abandoned, as it is quite evident that they
are furnished with a mouth and stomach, like all
true animals, and with a set of arms called tenta
cles for seizing their prey;     and, perhaps,   at the
same time, through       the medium of delicate ciliae
with which       the tentacles are connected, with a
breathing apparatus, through       which a current of
water is taken in, and discharged after its oxygen
has been abstracted.
     The discovery of the true nature of these singu
 lar creatures has not, however, changed their flower
 like appearance, which to a superficial observer is as
 deceptive as ever; and few (not professed naturalists),
 observing these singular Zoºphytes for the first time,
 would hesitate to pronounce them       a kind of sea
 plant.
     Let us turn, for example, to Plate      VIII.,  and
 note the appearance of the two varieties of Actinia

imports—and we shall easily excuse our early natu
ralists their pretty but erroneous fancies concerning
them.   This species is more subject than many
others to vary in colour, even like the flower after
which it is named, being found of every tone be
tweensnow-white, orange, pale scarlet, and blood
red—while some specimens take duskier tints, from
a dull brown to a kind of Orange green.                               But   we
will   describe our illustrations of this genus in                      regu
lar succession, noting what is most peculiar in the
subjects of each Plate.
    Plate VI. contains a representation of one of the
last-discovered species of Actinia—one which dis
plays a habit that distinguishes it from         con            all   its
geners hitherto described               by   naturalists, and which
has entitled    it    to    be   classed
                                               as

isfrom that     well-known naturalist, and the
                     ofa

yet they no doubt exist in all, as they are not merely
ornamental, but essential organs, peculiar to this
class of creatures; being reservoirs from which they
can shoot forth a thread, furnished with a barbed
and poisoned dart, by means of which they are able
to attain an enemy, or victim, far beyond the reach
of their tentacles.     Mr. Gosse very graphically de
scribes the death of a small fish struck by one of
these thread-borne poisoned arrows, at some dis
tance from the offended Actinia, who launched his
dart, as it seemed, for no greater provocation than a
slight disturbance of the water rather nearer to his
retreat than was agreeable.
    The Actinia gemmacea,       it would  appear,   is a
more voracious creature than most of his congeners,
for Dr. Johnston, in his splendid work on the British
Zoëphytes,    describes  one of this species that had
managed     to swallow a shell of Pecten      maarimus
as large as a common      saucer, its own natural   dia
meter   not exceeding two inches.        It managed,
however, to distend its elastic form sufficiently to
receive  the enormous     prey; but the shell divided
the stomach into two completely separate depart
ments,   the   lower one being thus perfectly shut
off from its usual supplies.    To meet this difficulty,
the organic economy of the creature adapted itself

 a miniature     purple    Pine, though it is capable of
 motion through the water from place to place, by
 some action of its organs which has not been accu
 rately detected.    It is one of the handsomest of our
 British Zoophytes.       The polypidom, or trunk, is
three or four inches long, fleshy, and of a purplish
red.    It is naked at the lower end, and feathered
above with long, closely-set pinnae, along the mar
gins of     which the polyp-cells are placed.        The
pinnae are curved backward, and capable of either
separate or united motion. They are supposed by
some to be capable of the action of regular oars;
but this is very doubtful, though their bearing on
the polypidom, which is strengthened by an internal
column of calcareous or bony matter, would give
them considerable power for that purpose.            The
creature's specific name, phosphorea, must not lead
to the supposition that it always emits a phospho
rescent light, for it is only when irritated that this is
produced.     If  plunged into fresh-water, it scatters
a shower of phosphoric sparks in all directions,
which forms a magnificent and curious spectacle,
far more brilliant, no doubt, than the fabled hues
of the dying dolphin.
    The Wirgularia mirabilis is another of this class
of creatures, almost     as elegant as the Sea-Pen, but

THE curious floral forms of the Zoophytes        have,
as yet, attracted the greatest   degree of attention
among the constructors of marine Aquaria; yet other
forms of ocean life offer equal, if not superior,
opportunities for curious observation, and are equally
well calculated to bear the confinement of the tank.
Among them all, none more than the Molluscs,
especially  the  shell-bearing division, which merits
the careful attention of the student of Nature, as
forming some of her most singular manifestations.
    The knowledge of the nature and structure of
many of the most curious shell-bearing Molluscs is of
very recent date, with the exception of those which
possess obvious qualities which have fitted them for
articles of diet or commerce; such as the Oyster,
Mussel,    Cockle, &c., as eatable species—a<U+017F>      the
Purples, Sepias, and Cuttle-fish, as containing n   <U+017F>u
able dyes.   With the exception of such as these, the
pearl-yielding   Bivalves, and a few others, nothing
was known, with a few remarkable exceptions,         of

the animals that create and inhabit the beautiful
shells that have so long been ranked among the
most elegant objects of the cabinets of the curious.
Many of these were, in fact, scientifically classified
by learned naturalists before the nature of the
animal, of which they formed the mere senseless
husk, was even guessed at.          The ordinary col
lector    did not even desire to know anything of
the creature which produced the shell he most
prized; it was sufficient for him that it was esti
mated as “rare” by his brother collectors—rarity
being a quality more highly prized than even beauty.
 With this feeling, prices as great were given for
 single shells as ever enthusiastic Hollander paid
 for a coveted bulb during the height of the Tulipo
 mania.      No amount of guineas was too much, at
  a sale of shells, for such a contested prize as a
  Many-ribbed harp, a Gloria maris, a Cedo mulli, or
  a <U+017F>oluta Junonia.       But that race of idle shell
 fanciers has given place to a race of true concholo
  gists, who are investigators as well as collectors, and
  w        abours are daily developing unexpected and
  valu   ole knowledge from those long obscure      pages
  of the great book of Nature.

curious fleshy forms. The term was invented                                    by
the illustrious Cuvier, but      objectionable

When, however, the application                      of   a   term      is   well
understood, its inner signification                   becomes          unim
portant;    it   is,   therefore, now too late           to   criticise the
one invented and applied                   by   the prince     of     modern
naturalists.
     Among the interesting facts detected                         by   recent
science,   has been shown that many
           it                             the seem           of
ingly shapeless masses              of
                         soft substance, scarcely                              to
be   termed flesh, possess           all
                                  the senses   the higherof
animals.        In   the Cephalopoda, the organs     sight            of
and hearing are both well developed;                     and Professor
Owen considers that the Nautilus possesses even
an  organ     passive smell. The Gasteropoda too,
                of
are, according    Siebold, nearly all furnished with
                       to
ears and eyes, the former organs being                            described

as forming round capsules, conspicuously        visible
near the roots of the tentacles.
    Some of the Conchi<U+017F>era, also, are furnished with
numerous eyes, which, like those of the Scallops and
Clams of our own shores, are also placed among
their tentacula.
    It  appears   probable, says Dr. Johnston, that
many have also the sense of taste, as they are
observed to select particular articles of food in pre
ference to others, and there is no other sense that
appears fitted to regulate the choice.     The mouth,
as it is termed, of many of the molluscous tribe is
furnished, as among the Gasteropoda, with a fringe
formed of filaments, which may be organs of touch,
and they have also a complicated breathing appa
ratus.
    The strength of these boneless creatures is some
thing very extraordinary, and almost incomprehen
sible. The Strombus gigas, a soft, snail-like creature,
carries a shell which often weighs more than five
pounds; the Cassis tuberosa supports one nearly as
heavy, and the naked Molluscs, that have no shell
to carry, have other modes of exhibiting strength
of a very extraordinary character.
    The shells of the clothed Molluscs are senseless,
being permeated by no vessels, and are formed by
                            67

 the animal itself from a secretion        with which its
 outer integuments are invested, and which may be
 described as lime in a state of solution.      The thick
 ened edge of the mantle, by means of which the form
 is given to the shell, and the general manipulation
 effected, is furnished, as may be seen with the aid of
a moderate lens, with a minute and highly sensitive
fringe, the cilia of which are of various colours,
corresponding in tone and position to the tints which
decorate    the exterior of the shell. The coloured
cilia or fringes have doubtless a dyeing power,
which colours the calcareous solution at the time it
is added to the shell    by their plastic instinct.    The
solution    becomes a hard testaceous        substance  so
soon as it leaves the body of the animal, and is
deposited in architectural layers upon the beautiful
structure     of the   shell,   by  the   “trowel” and
“brushes” of the     edge  of the mantle.
     This process is beautifully described in Jones's
“Animal Kingdom,” with all the details relating
to the successive ridges on the shell, which mark
the age of the animal; it having been ascertained
what time is required for the completion of each
story of the edifice.
     The power of locomotion is one of the most
curious subjects for observation      in the structure of

the water.         But if any agitation of the water wet
this floating apparatus, or the animal withdraw it
voluntarily beneath the water for that purpose, the
creature immediately sinks to the bottom.
      The swimming power of this race of creatures
is equally curious. The Cephalopoda, by the ejec
tion of a jet of water, propel themselves rapidly in
the opposite direction, and by the repetition of the
jet at regular intervals, a beautiful power of mo
tion is obtained, as regular, and with less labour
than that of ordinary swimming by means of the
 action of fins or other oar-like limbs adapted
 to the purpose.”             The Pteropoda, however, in
 their little shells, translucent as glass, swim by
 the action of small fin-like paddles placed near the
 head.
       The Bivalves       do not      make so clever a use of
 their single foot      as the Univalves.        The foot in this
 tribe appears to be furnished with a terminal
 hook, which, when the foot is protruded, clings to
 some substance, and the animal is drawn up to that
 point, when the operation has to be repeated; this
      * Some species effect leaps by an analogous contrivance—col
 lecting water within the closed mouth, and then emitting it at a
 gush from a small portion of the aperture, suddenly opened, which
 propels   the creature to a considerable distance, as it were, at a
  single bound.

appears likely to produce but a slow rate of pro
gress, yet some of the sand-boring Bivalves manage,
when alarmed, to conceal themselves with great
rapidity by that means.
     The Mollusca, as feeders, are divided into three
classes—those which take only liquid food, the
vegetable feeders, and the carnivorous species.
     Those which are only able to take food in a
liquid form, are such as have no means of seizing
prey, their food consisting of the countless myriads
of infusorial animalcules which float in the sea-water,
and which are carried into the orifice of the stomach
or mouth by the current.       Of these, the Dunica<U+021B>a,
 Brachiopoda, and Conchi<U+017F>era, are examples.
     The liquid feeders exhibit a very low form of
molluscous life, but other classes are furnished with
means of defence and aggression, equal to those of
terrestrial quadrupeds, and much more extraordinary
in their form. Some of the carnivorous Univalves,
for instance,   feed upon the Bivalves by    drilling a
hole through the solid shell, and withdrawing the
 animal piecemeal, as required.
     The Eolis papillosa has been observed tearing
 away the tentacles of different species of Sea
 Anemone with extraordinary voracity, and the
 tribe must therefore very evidently be excluded

avoided from the same cause; they are fierce tyrants
of the      deep, that would             make sad havoc among the
delicate      creatures with which we delight to furnish
our tanks of glass.                 The curious substance termed
Sea-Grapes,         are the eggs of this creature,
                       which
might, however, be placed in the tank, and the pro
gress of development watched, without fear of injury
to the other inmates.

Molluscs were also much sought as a table delicacy,
a species of the large Garden-Snail being bred for
that purpose, and fed upon      a prepared  paste, which
so accelerated   their growth that we learn, from the
industrious Pliny, of their attaining to enormous
dimensions; the shells of some of the finest being
capable of holding eighty measures of water, called
quadrants.     But in speaking of Molluscs, I must
principally confine myself to such as are suitable
for an Aquarium.
     Among the Sea-Snails of our own coast, which
are still eaten by the lower orders, is the Periwinkle,
considered    by  some   superior    in flavour to the
Oyster or Shrimp.        This creature, the Littorina
littorea, is one of the most useful creatures in an
Aquarium, cleansing it from all decaying vegeta
tion, which is its natural food. The Periwinkle varies
much both in size and colour, the ground tone of
the shell being sometimes red, orange, or even scarlet,
sometimes with and sometimes          without handsome
black bands.     Such as are coloured in this attrac
tive manner should obviously be selected as inmates
of the Aquarium, in preference to the dull-coloured
varieties; and a few of the small yellow kind,
 Littorina littoralis, may be added by way of

variety, though they do not succeed so well in con
finement as the other species.
   The Whelk, Buccinum undatum, another of the
snail-like Molluscs of our coasts, which is considered
good eating by the lower orders, and often seen on
fish-stalls at particular seasons, is well worthy a
place in our miniature sea; especially under cer
tain circumstances, when the shell of this creature
assumes a most singular aspect, well calculated to
excite the wonder of the young naturalist.                         It   is
sometimes found surmounted by a mass of living
substance, which might be taken for the body of the
creature, residing in preference on the roof of
dwelling during the summer months,              may     as  it          be its

those claws and mouth, and, snatching away the rich
morsel, disappears as suddenly as it came, leaving
the expectant mouth and astonished claws both
empty. The mystery of this seemingly compound
creature having, as it were, a first-self living outside
the house and getting a separate living, a second
self located in the front parlour, and prevented from
eating its own dinner by a third-self residing in the
back parlour, may be easily explained, now that
the persevering observations of our naturalists have
solved it.    It   is as      follows:–
    The internal dweller in the front parlour is the
Hermit Crab (Paguras Prideaua'ii), a creature seldom
contented with its own pretty solid habitation, but
ever seeking some further protection, which it gene
rally finds in an empty. Whelk-shell. It   moreover,          is,
very particular         as   to   fit, and other details; for                    has
been observed, when looking out for                      a    house,     to it   try

the Crab himself (generally Paguras Bernhardus),
 and in that position is hurried along, in the sidling
gallop of his steed, in a way that must often prove
inconvenient; for in passing under ledges of rock,
the Crab, doubtless, only takes his own measure.
Yet, in such cases, the Anemone probably knows
how to take care of himself; and when Bernhardus
becomes skittish and adventurous, “draws in his
horns,” as many other bold spirits are obliged to do
at certain crises of their career ; and in this state,
presenting only a semi-spherical mass of tough
leathery substance,    he can fearlessly allow himself
to be driven beneath stony archways, or under
impending branches of the marine forests, by his
ferocious Jehu, with less chance of injury than the
outside passenger of a terrestrial stage-coach pass
ing beneath the low gateway of some inn-yard.
    Our largest native shell of the Whelk tribe is
the   Fusus   antiquus,   often  used by  the Shetland
islanders as a lamp ; for which purpose it is sus
pended horizontally, the cavity holding the oil, and
the wick projecting from the canal.
    The Whelks belong to the interesting family
 Muricidae, some of which, natives of our own coasts,
 are very pretty objects for the Aquarium.      It was
the   Murea     trunculus    which yielded the Tyrian

purple, different species affording distinct tones of
colour.  In form, these shells are somewhat like
our common Whelk, but finely marked with broad,
dark, spiral stripes.         The ancient mode of extract
ing the dye,      as   described by Pliny, was verified by
Mr. Wild, in 1838, in a very interesting manner.
In the neighbourhood of the site of the ancient
Tyre, he found, in the rocks on the sea-shore, a vast
number of round cavities, evidently the work of the
hammers and chisels of long ages past.                       These   cavi
ties varied in size, from that of a small flower-pot to
that of a cauldron, and round about them still lay
scattered immense masses of the remains of the
shells and bodies of the Murea, in many instances
aggluminated together.   They had evidently been
pounded in those cavities, exactly as described by
Pliny, and the dye extracted according to the formulae
so graphically detailed by the ancient naturalist.
    The Purpura lapillus of our own shores yields a
similar dye, and may be kept in our Aquaria as a
reserve bottle of “marking-ink;” for the ingenious
Mr. Gosse has shown how                its   dye may         bethus used
for household purposes.            The shell           isa   small white
univalve, with one       or   more bands           of   pale brown.    It
perishes   on   being immersed               in   fresh-water;       and   a
thick vein   of yellowish white, near the head, contains

the dye, which is a liquid of a creamy thickness and
of pale, indistinct colour. But if it be painted in the
forms required, as a cipher, or any other ornament,
on linen, or any other textile fabric, with a camel's
hair pencil, and exposed to the air, it rapidly assumes
a yellow tone; which first changes to green, then
blue,     till at last it     becomes a       full strong indigo,
exhibiting plainly all the forms that have been
traced. A crimson-red change next ensues, and the
final colour, which is indelibly permanent, is a red
dish purple.                             -
    There is also a large naked Mollusc, one of the

  The means of movement of the common Scallop,
or Cockle, and other bivalves, by means of a single
fleshy “foot,” have been described in speaking of
Molluscs in general; but the spinous Cockles,
 Cordium aculeatum and C. tubercutum, have been
termed the aristocracy of the Scallop tribe. The
valves of the largest open three-quarters of an
inch, and the visible portion of the spongy-looking
fleshy mantle is of a pellucid orange colour; at the
end is protruded a double tube, thick and short,
enveloped   in a fringe of cirrhi or tentacles.    The
foot, which has been compared to a tongue, is
smooth, glossy, and semi-transparent, like scarlet
cornelian, and enables the creature to move about
with great activity in an Aquarium; some that
were sent, by the Rev. C. Kingsley, to Mr. Gosse,
having startled that gentleman by the noise they
were creating among the pebbles and other objects
of his tank, by their rapid movements.

    THE ASCIDIANS, BARNACLES, SEA-CUCUMBERS,
         NAKED MOLLUSCS, SEA-WORMS, ETC.
A  GROUP  of Ascidians forms a very curious object for
the Aquarium, their forms being singular, and some
times delicate as  a transparent egg-shell. The group
delineated in Plate VII. will convey some idea of
the general appearance of these creatures, whose
habitations might be taken for a store of fairy
pitchers, placed snugly in their submarine china
closet for extra safety, and partially covered with
sea-weed as a further means of concealment.
There are above fifty native species, varying greatly
in appearance. They may be found at the extreme
verge of low water, many having the aspect of
 pellucid bags, formed of a substance between jelly
 and leather ; while others present a far more robust
 and rugged appearance, both in form and texture.
 Some are very dingy in colour, but a few species—
 more rarely found—are very attractive, and some
 times brilliant, in their hues.
     The Barnacles must not be omitted in furnishing
 an Aquarium, nor the fable connected with the

    The tube-like cells of the Serpula have some
resemblance to the cells of the Common Barnacle,
but that of the solitary Serpula, Serpula tubularia,
is much taller, often rising a foot from the substance

feeding, and, perhaps, also the breathing apparatus,
of Serpula contortuplicata, are exceedingly rich                          in

fibres. The Sabella, an allied tribe, forms its tube
of mud; while that of the Serpºla is always of hard
shell. The golden-combed worm, Amphitrite auri
coma, another singular creature of this class, may be
best alluded to in this place. Just below the cork
like head, when it leaves its tubular shell, are the
scarlet gills, slightly resembling those of fishes, and
across the head the golden comb-like appendage is

mals being generally white. One of the species,
 Hyalina,    has   a  case   which    seems  formed   of
crisp rice-paper, and is covered with spines of the
the same colour and texture.           The tentacula, or
breathing apparatus, eight in number, are curiously
branched, and, when expanded, have the appearance
of a skeleton flower, of which the figure in Plate
IX. will convey a tolerable idea. The functions of
this flower-like set of organs are probably the same
as those of the Nudibranch class of Molluscs, which,
though generally considered as being a breathing
apparatus, are, probably, at the same time food
collecting organs, as all the creatures thus furnished
are liquid feeders.
     Thyone papillosa, one species of Sea-Cucumber,
has ten branches to this set of organs, which it sel
dom displays when in captivity; but a little gentle
motion artificially imparted to the water, as sug
gested in another place, would probably produce the
kind of excitement requisite for their expansion,     as
the introduction of fresh water to the tank seldom
fails to produce this effect for a time. When irritated,

which the infamous Locasta destroyed the enemies

   THE FISH AND CRUSTACEANS OF THE AQUARIUM.
A   MARINE Aquarium may be rendered very interest
ing without the introduction of fish, and as their
presence requires that the water should be once each
day aerated by means of additional water, introduced
by the syringe or by a drip, continuing for some
time from another vessel, many may            prefer the
lovely Sea-Weeds, curious Zoëphytes, and beautiful
 Molluscs, alone;    as, if   the balance between the
 amount of animal and vegetable life be felicitously
 balanced, and the natural scavengers, in the shape
 of Periwinkles and other Sea-Snails, for the con
  sumption of decaying vegetable matter, and a few
  Prawns to perform a similar office for perishing    In
 fusoriae, or any other animal       matter, be properly
  supplied—the tank may remain for a long time un
  disturbed, the supply of oxygen being ample for the
  lower classes of animal life alluded to. The beautiful
  Actiniae, indeed, will exist in apparent health for a
  considerable time in water in which no vegetable
  growth has been introduced.       Mr. Gosse describes
                              95

                             OCEAN GARDENS:
instances in which the water in glass Aquaria, con
taining Sea-Anemonies, has remained perfectly pure
for more than a year.
    The addition of fish, however, undoubtedly en
livens the general aspect of an Aquarium very con
siderably   ;    and many        may not grudge the task of
daily aerating the water, in order to enjoy the cheerful
spectacle of their agreeable and ever-active move
ments. One or two young Flounders, very small,
and the young of other species of flat fish, add much
interest to an Aquarium, in consequence of their
mode of swimming being so different to that of the
class of fishes with whose movements the eye is
more familiar.
    Among the fish mentioned by the most expe
rienced in the keeping of Sea Aquaria as best
suited to that purpose, the first is the pretty little
Tansy, Blennius pholis, with its bright scarlet eyes,
and the many changing hues of                its
                                    body. This little
fellow will live and flourish     tank with poorer
                                        in   a          a
supply   of     oxygen than any other fish yet tried.
   The fifteen-spined Stickleback, Gasterosteus spi
machia, does well, and      very cheerful and brisk
                                  is
in his movements.    Three or four would be an im
provement                any tank.
   Young         of to    the gray Mullet, too,    do   well; for
                                   96

           OR, GLIMPSES BENEATH THE WATERS.
if the supply of oxygen be rather inadequate, they
are observed to put their heads partly above the
surface of the water, and obtain an artificial supply
in that surreptitious manner.       The black Goby,
 Gobius niger, has also been tried with success; but
his voracious character—devouring without scruple
even his own congeners—renders him on the whole
not a very desirable tenant; and yet it is a fine
sight to see the little warrior turn black when he
seizes his prey, his turquois-coloured eyes dilating
with fury.
     Several other kinds are mentioned, in a previous
page, in the list of animals placed by    Mr. Gosse in
his first experimental Aquarium.
     The Pogge, Aspidophorus cataphractus, is a
singularly formed fish that might be added by way
of experiment.      The plate-armour in which his
body is clothed runs in regular longitudinal lines,
showing eight sharp ridges, running from head to
tail, that have a singular and unfish-like appearance.
In  confinement, however, he does not display him
self to advantage, generally lying near the bottom
of the Aquarium.
     The beautiful crimson maculations of the Ancient
Wrasse, Labrus maculatus,      render him   a very de
sirable tenant; but his size—small specimens being
                           97                 H

                       OCEAN GARDENS;
eight or nine inches long—causes him to be incon
venient; and, moreover, he his difficult to manage,
and would probably require altogether a special
treatment. One of the smaller Wrasses, however,
 Cremilabrus    cornubicus,    is a desirable guest ; his
minute size, and varying and often gay colours,
rendering him very attractive.        He is an active and
eager searcher for food, but never takes any loosely
floating object, only darting at and detaching such
atoms as are attached        to the   different species of
Algae.                                           -
     The Pipe-Fish, Syngnathus acus, is interesting
in the tank, and also the two-spotted sucker, Zepi
dogaster bimaculatus, a prettily coloured and curious
little fish, which has the faculty of attaching itself
to the side of the tank, or any other hard flat surface,
by means of two singularly-formedventral fins, which
act like the leather suckers by means of which boys
enjoy the sport of lifting heavy stones at the end
of a string. The spawn of this fish is like tiny
amber beads, and is attached to shells and other
substances.
     Among the Crustacea fitted for an Aquarium, the
common Prawn, Palaemon serratus, holds the first
rank.     In the first place, his cleansing properties, in
devouring all decaying animal matter, are most im
                              98

           OR,   GLIMPSES BENEATH THE WATERS.
portant. But not less interesting are his graceful
movements: Now, he steals stealthily over the
pebbles or the fronds of the Algae, with his long,
slender, hair-like horns in gentle motion, with all
the seeming wariness of a cat (the resemblance
being increased by candle-light by the fiery glare of
the eye); next, leaving his walking apparatus, or
legs, inactive, he uses only the swimming members,
which are larger and flatter, and bordered with a
compact fringe; agitating these instruments with
beautiful regularity, he rises in the water with
graceful ease (see Plate VI.), his semi-transparent
body, as he rises, giving to his appearance a strange
and somewhat apparition-like                aspect,    which     has
caused him to be compared to a marine spectre.
   The Prawn takes its food with its second feet,
two-fingered   hands or claws, and carries it to                  its
mouth.     The hands   the first pair
                           of          legs are only
                                                of
rudimental      in   appearance, but are precisely fitted         to
their special purpose. They are his cleansing appa
ratus; and       it most interesting
                      is                 watch theto
operations   of   his toilet when      he   uses these fringes    as
brushes, with which      cleanses his whole person
                             he
most thoroughly, being almost unmerciful        the         in
amount      severe scrubbing
           of                    which to  subjects    he

                     OCEAN GARDENS   ;
    An allied   species,   P. squilla, is scarcely distin
guishable from P. serratus ; but the handsome
scarlet-striped Prawn, Pardulus annuticornis, about
the size of a Shrimp, is quite distinct, and would
make a valuable addition to the collection.           The
Lobster Prawn, also, Athanas         milescens,  has like
wise been tried.
    Some kinds    of Crabs may be admitted, but not
many;     for several    are  extremely voracious, and
would soon clear off all the naked Zoëphytes and
most of the Molluscs.
    The Climbing Crab, Eurynome aspera, is inte
resting in a tank from his habits. His climbing is
as graceful and   skilful as that of a monkey, and when
he has succeeded in perching himself upon the highest
 object in the tank, he forms a picturesque object.
     Crabs, like Prawns, are sea-scavengers, and the
 kinds that do not attack living creatures as well as
 dead are consequently useful in a tank.        The great
 Fiddler Crab, Portunus puber, is remarkably hand
 some.     He is clothed, in part, with a velvety brown
 fur, and the bare places of his shell are of a shining
 black.    His eyes are marked with scarlet, and there
 are a few touches of bright blue about the head.
 If  introduced, his proceedings should be carefully
 watched.
                              100

              OR, GLIMPSES BENEATH THE WATERS.
    There should certainly be a specimen of the
Hermit Crab in a Whelk-shell; and the Cleanser
Crab, Portunus depurator, has been tried, but these
active and greedy Sea-Spiders must be closely looked
after.
    It  remains to speak of the Star-Fish tribe, which
affords some of the most beautiful and easily ma
naged subjects for the Aquarium.
    In the centre of the lower part of Plate VI. are
a large and a small specimen of the beautiful scarlet
species,      Geniaster equestres; just above, to the
right, the graceful pink Cribella oculata ; further
to the right, Asteria gibbosa ; and immediately
above the Cribella, the thin, leathery species, the
bird’s foot Sea-Star, Palmipes membranaceus.         All
these species are small, easily managed, and especially
suited to the Aquarium; as is also the finely-marked
and long-rayed Ophicoma rosula, his deep scarlet,
with bright black marks, and his slender limbs or
rays, rendering him a conspicuous object.          These
 Star-Fish glide round the Aquarium, by the aid of
their thousand sucker-like feet, in a very interesting
Iºlº Ile12.
     All    the true Star-Fishes, the Asteriae, have the
 body divided into rays, like a star, and are furnished
 with sucking feet, or cirrhi, which are tubular,
                              101

                     OCEAN  GARDENS  ;
and filled with water.       The internal structure of
these creatures is very intricate and beautiful,     and
the skeleton of almost any kind offers the appear
ance of that of some exquisitely symmetrical flower.
There are fourteen British species of Star-Fish, the
finest being the Sun-Star, Solaster papposa, the
disk, surrounded with twelve or thirteen rays, vary
ing in colour from scarlet to     deep purple,  the rays
being sometimes of    a different colour.
    The Luidia fragilissima       is also  a large kind,
sometimes two feet across, which is peculiar to the
British shores. It possesses the peculiar faculty of
breaking itself into fragments when enraged or
captured; and, in a work by the lamented Professor
Forbes, there is a very graphic and facetious account
of a specimen that escaped him in a very deter
mined way by a suicide of this kind.
    Stars of this class, having the power to dislocate
their structure, are popularly known as brittle Stars.
Some affect to    consider    this faculty not so very
wonderful; but let such suppose for a moment some
higher animal—a man, for instance—gifted with a
capacity for exploding his trunk and limbs into
moderately-sized fragments—into joints, as a butcher
would say—at any slight provocation, and then the
character of such a power would appear very         suf

ficiently    extraordinary.           It     is possible that         the
fragments     of the disruptured    Star-Fish have the
power, in each       separate fragment, of renewing the
absent portions, and that each portion thus becomes
a perfect fish, the dissevered portions having been
noticed to retain their vitality long after their sepa
ration. We know that the little Garden Lizard has
the power of dislocating his tail without effort, and
leaving it between the thumb and finger, when he
is playfully caught by that appendage; and, also,
that he has the power of renewing his caudal extre
mity within a very short period. It is thought,
therefore,    not impossible,          reasoning by analogy,
that the Star-Fish may possess powers of a similar
kind, of a somewhat more extensive character.
   The Amnion Star-Fish, called sometimes Five
fingered (Asterias rubens), belongs to the division
Echinodermata, that         is,
                          skinned like the Hedge                 -

suitable objects for an Aquarium, may mention the
“Red-noses,” as they are graphically termed (Saari
cava    rugosa), a colony of which, peeping out of
their holes in the rock, would form a very striking
object; and      if a piece   of their native rock could
be detached      sufficiently deep not to disturb them
in the recesses of their tube-like burrows, their
removal “en bloque” would not be difficult. When
touched, the Red-nose squirts a stream of water at
you in defiance, and darts back into his cavern.
 He is  a small bivalve, having his inner or immediate
home within two rough brown shells.          The double
tubed proboscis with which he is furnished is ex
tended, when in search of food, to the mouth of his
cave, in which position the appearance of its ruddy
terminus has given to this tribe the characteristic
 name of “Red-noses.” How he contrives to bore a
 hole in the solid rock, with any of the soft pulpy
members with which he is furnished, appears a mys
 tery. Other Conchifers have, however, similar capa
 bilities, their ingenuity not being confined to rocks,
 and their industry not being always harmless.
 Such, for instance, is that of the Teredo, or Ship
 worm, a species of which has long proved so in
 imical to the formation of a Russian fleet in the
                              104.

Black Sea—the late war having, however, proved a
far more serious impediment to the development of
that portion of the Russian navy.
     The Sea-Leaf, formed of twenty thousand or
more cradles for young Polypes, is also a curious
object.    It is the Polyzoön, sometimes called the
Hornwrack.
     A  few of the translucent Medusae, in a young
stage of their existence, might be procured and
tried, though their transport would be difficult; and
a group of creatures, of the genus Zoºthamnium,
 forming, as they do, an object like a little tree of
 glass, covered with trumpet-shaped     bells, of the
 same crystalline aspect, each exhibiting its rotating
 circle of minute cilia in rapid motion within, would
 form a singular and beautiful complement to the
 wonders of the Aquarium, if its removal from its
 native depths, and its location in its new home,
 could be successfully managed.

                          CHAPTER IX.
                             CONCLUSION.
IN conclusion,       a fewgeneral remarks may be made,
the observance        of which will usually ensure suc
cess in the formation       of an Aquarium. In the first
place,    if   the vessel in which the Aquarium is to be
established be home-made, care must be taken not
to use any cement that has a disagreeable smell—
which would be very soon fatal to creatures accus
tomed to the pure waters of the ocean. Scott's
cement is said to be better than putty, for fixing in
the glass to the columns at the angles.
     Ifcement be used to fix the rock-work of the
miniature marine landscape, let it be the best                  Port
land cement, which, when dry, must be soaked by
filling the vessel with water, and the water changed
several times before the tank will be fit for use.
    The best sand for the artificial beach, or bottom,
is the Thames' sand, used by builders; but this
must      be    washed       several     times,    till   the   water
runs off quite clear, before it is                fitfor use—any
other kind    sand,
                of    that cannot
                          if                  be   procured, must
be   submitted       to   similar washings,         Sea-water can

be procured by furnishing the steward or captain of
any Thames steamer, or the guard of a railway in
connection with the coast, with a clean barrel; the
charge, in either             case,            for carriage and trouble,
would not exceed two or three shillings.
   The artificial salt water has been found sufficient
for Zoophytes, but not for fish and other of the
higher class of marine animals, except for a certain
given time.
    The composition                     for artificial sea-water                  is as
follows:–
       Common salt                  .     .         .      .    34 oz.
       Epsom salts        .         .     .         .      .        4    oz.
       Chloride of magnesium                               .   200 grs.
                                          roy
       Chloride of potassium . . 40 grs.
      To these are added four quarts of water, and
when the salts are thoroughly dissolved, say on the
following day, the liquid must be filtered through a
sponge;    it is   then       fit   for use.
      Care must be taken                        to      observe whether, when

    With regard to sea-weed, he observes, do not
take Oar-weeds or Tangle; all the Fuci are of a slimy

their absence is not to be regretted.

curious discoveries of recent investigators, the depths
of the ocean are as yet, comparatively speaking, one
of the untrodden fields of science; and a glorious
arena it presents—the Aquarium being one of the
fairest channels for the detection of its myriads of

gleaming   with unusual dyes–metallic azure, and
silvery crimson—will dart and glide in our tropic
tempered tanks, as in their own tropic ocean, for
our delight and gratification.    We are now entitled
to expect from science, that it shall exhibit to us the
wonders of the tropic deeps, as it has shown us the
glorious plumage and velvet-spotted                             furs of the
denizens of its terrestrial forests.
     This       is,        fact, the only thing that remains for
                        in in

the wonders                     Nature,    in   order that we may surpass
the doings                 the ancients          in   that field   of   popular
instruction and gratification.
    Even     the days
                in         Cyrus, we learn from the
                                        of
graphic Xenophon and other sources, that every
eastern satrap had his “paradises,”  which the most       in
curious animals                  of   distant regions were preserved
ina   state     of    liberty, and          in   a   manner suited      to   their
natures, either for the sport    hunting  for the    of            or
curious gratification   the eye.      of
    The Romans, long before they had attained                                   to
the material wealth of the modern nations of
Europe, had exhibited    the people   their capital
                                        to                 of

great modern nations of the west, the sight of these
wonderful creatures is but quite a recent gratifica
tion.     It   only remained to the ancients to have                  ex
hibited   Titanic Aquarium, to render our triumph
          a
over their labours in the field of popular natural
history impossible. Had but a Roman Warrington
or Gosse developed the germ of such an idea, and
an Osler existed to furnish the glass—the Pompey,
or Caesar, or Crassus, would not have been wanting
to feast the eyes, both of patrician and plebeian
Rome, with an Aquarium measuring hundreds of
feet in length, in which the monsters of the deep
would have been exhibited in deadly conflict, and
human divers, armed with net and trident, like the
retiariae of their gladiatorial combats, would have
encountered, beneath the waters, the Shark, the
Whale, or the Torpedo, to the shouts of crowded
circuses, the centre of which would have been a
glass-walled ocean.
    But a gigantic Aquarium             is,   fortunately,      a   feat
that yet remains for modern               science      to     achieve,
and which      will doubtless accomplish. The day
                 it
will arrive when we shall see the living Behemoth—
the Titan    the deep—rolling majestic
               of
                                                      by in   waves   of
his native element, perhaps pursued                       his cruel

the origin of Yarmouth bloaters. Or we may see the
dreaded Shark float round and round the vast glass
prison seeking his prey, and the Shark-hunter of
the south seas may be imported to exhibit his skill
in a bloodless conflict—mocking the attempts of the
sea monster       to seize him, as the Spanish matador
plays long with the infuriated bull; but without
necessitating the same catastrophe to the animal,
defenceless against the specially-trained skill of his
human antagonist. We have already had our crys
tal palaces, covering their acres, and filled with
objects of art and wealth from every quarter of the
globe; it is not impossible, therefore, that we may
have crystal-walled seas, in which aquatic mena
geries will form the last new object of fashion and
wonder.                                                                              -
   For the present, however, the Aquarium                                      is,   as  I
have said, but   toy, yet one full    pleasant              of                           in
