the name of pearl white, is used as a cosmetic by those
of the fair sex who wish to become fairer. A lady thus
painted was sitting in a lecture room, where chemistry
being the subject, water impregnated with sulphuretted
hydrogen gas (Harrogate water) was handed round for
inspection. On smelling this liquid, the lady in ques
tion became suddenly black in theface I Every one was
of course alarmed at this sudden chemical change ; but
the lecturer explaining the cause of the phenomenon,
the lady received no further injury, than a salutary
practical lesson to rely more on mental than personal
and artificial beauty in future.
               Red Fire of the Theatres,
   The beautiful red fire, which is now so frequently
used in the theatres, is composed ofthe following ingre
dients : forty parts of dry nitrate of strontian, thirteen
parts of finely powdered sulphur, five parts of chlorate
of potash, and four parts of sulphuretof antimony. The
chlorate of potash, and sulphurct of antimony, should

   14             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
  be powdered separately in a mortar, and then mixed to
  gether on paper ; after which they may be added to the
  other ingredients, previously powdered and mixed.
                         Green Fire.
     Green fire has long been a desideratum in pyro-
 techny, and when burned in a reflector, sheds a beauti
  ful green light upon all surrounding objects. Take of
 flowers of sulphur thirteen parts, of nitrate of baryta
 seventy- seven, of oxymuriate of potassa five, of metallic
 arsenic two, of charcoal three. The nitrate of baryta
 should be well dried and powdered : it should then be
 mixed with the other ingredients, all finely pulverised,
 and the whole triturated until perfectly blended toge
 ther. A little calamine may be occasionally added, in
 order to make the compound slower of combustion ; and
 it is above all things requisite that the rubbing together
 of the materials should be continued until they are com
 pletely mixed.
                Improved Copal Varnish.
    It appears from actual experiment, that the solution
of gum copal, in spirits of wine, or alcohol, an opera
tion usually attended with considerable difficulty, may
readily be performed by the following simple pro
cess. Dissolve one ounce of camphor, in aquart of alco
hol ; put it in a circular glass, and add eight ounces of
copal in small pieces ; set it in a sand heat, so regu
lated, that the bubbles may be counted, as they rise
from the bottom, and continue the same heat, till the
solution is completed. Camphor acts more powerfully
upon copal than any substance yet tried. If copal be
finely powdered, and a small quantity of dry camphor
rubbed with it in the mortar, the whole becomes, in a
few minutes, a tough coherent mass. The process
above d escribed will dissolve more copal than the men
struum will retain when cold ; the most economical
method will therefore be to set the vessel which contains

               ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                       15

settled, to pour off the clear varnish, and leave the re
siduum for a future operation.
        To illuminate the Surface of the Water.
   Wet a lump of fine loaf sugar with phosphorized ether,
and throw it into a basin of water : the surface of the
water will become luminous in the dark, and, by gently
blowing upon it, phosphorescent undulations will be
formed, which illuminate the air above the fluid to a
considerable distance. In winter, the water must be
rendered blood-warm. If the phosphorized ether be
applied to the hand, or other warm objects (which
may be done with safety) it renders them luminous
in the dark.

                          ********
     Perfumes, a Preventive against Mouldiness.
    Dr. Mac Culloch, of Edinburgh, has published a pa
 per, in which he points out that all essential oils pos
 sess the property of preventing the growth of mouldiness.
 Ink, leather, paste, and seeds, are among the com
 mon articles which suffer from this cause, and to which
 the remedy is easily applicable. With respect to arti
 cles of food, such as bread, cold meats, or dried fish,
 it is less easy to apply a remedy, on account of the
 taste. Cloves, however, and otherspices, whose flavours
 are grateful, may sometimes be used for this end ; and
 that they may act in consequence of this principle, and
 not by any particular antiseptic virtue, seems plain, by
 their preventing equally the growth of those minute
 plants on ink, and other substances not of an animal
 nature. He observes :
     " The effect of cloves in preventing the mouldiness
 in ink, is indeed generally known : and it is obtained in
 the same way by oil of lavender, in a very minute quan
 tity, or by any other of the perfumed oils. To preserve
 leather in the same manner from this effect, is a matter
 of great importance, particularly in military store
 houses, where the labour employed in cleaning harness
 and shoes occasions considerable expense, and where
  much injury is occasionally sustained from this cause.
 The same essential oils answer the purpose, as far as
 I have had an opportunity of trying effectually. The
 cheapest of course, should be selected ; and it would be
  necessary to try oil of turpentine for this reason. It is
  a remarkable confirmation of this circumstance, that

Rus3ialeather,which is perfumed with the tnr ofthe birch-
tree, is not subject to moulilincss,nsmust be well known
to all who possess books thus bound. They even prevent
it from taking place in those books bound in calf, near
to which they happen to Ke. This fact is particularly
well known to Russia merchants, as they suffer bales of
this article to lie in the London Docks in the most care
less manner, for a great length of time, knowing well
that they can sustain no injury of this nature from
dampness, whereas common curried leather requires to
be opened, cleaned, and ventilated. Collectors of books
will not be sorry to learn, that a few drops of any per
fumed oil will ensure their libraries from this pest."
Dr. M. began some experiments with the same agents on
 wood, to prevent the dry rot, but not having time to
carry them on, he recommends the important investiga
 tion to others. With regard to paste, he prefers rosin
 to alum as a preservative ; but lavender, or any other
 strong perfume, such as peppermint, anise, bergamot,
 are perfectly effectual for years, however the paste be
 composed. That which the Dr. himself employs in la
 belling, &c. is made of flour in the usual way, but rather
 thick, with a proportion of brown sugar, and a small
 quantity of corrosive sublimate. The use of the sugar
 is to keep it flexible, so as to prevent its scaling off from
 smooth surfaces : and that of the corrosive sublimate,
 independently of preserving it from insects, is an effec
 tual check against its fermentation. This salt, however,
 does not prevent the formation of mouldiness. But as
 a drop or two of the essential oils above mentioned is a
 complete security againt this, all the causes of destruc
 tion are effectually guarded against. Paste made in this
 manner, and exposed to the air, dries without change to
 a state resembling horn ; so that it may at any time be
 wetted again, and applied to use. When left in a
 close covered pot, it may be preserved in a state for use
 at all times. This principle seems also applicable to the
 preservation of seeds, particularly in cases where they
 are sent from distant countries by sea, when, it is well
known, they often perish from this cause. Dampness,
 ofcourse, will perform its office at any rate, if moisture

18               ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
is not excluded ; yet it is certain, that the growth of the
vegetables which constitute mouldiness, accelerate the
evil ; whether by retainingmoisture, or by what means, is
very apparent. This, in fact, happens equally in the
case of dry rot in wood, and indeed in all others where
this cause operates. It is a curious illustration of the
truth of this view of a remedy, that the aromatic seeds
of all kinds are not subject to mouldiness, and that their
vicinity prevents it in others with which they are packed.
They also produce the same effect daily, even in animal
matters, without its being suspected. Not to repeatany
thing on the subject of cookery, we need only remark,
that it is common to put pepper into collections of in
 sects or birds, without its having been remarked, that it
 had the same power of keeping off mould, as of discou
 raging or killing the ptinna omnivorus, or other insects
 that commit ravages in these cases.
   Method of giving a fine Black Colour to Wood,
    Steep the wood for two or three days in lukewarm
 water, in which a little alum has been dissolved ; then
 put a handful of logwood, cut small into a pint of water,
 and boil it down to less than half a pint. If you then
 add a little indigo, the colour will be more beautiful.
 Spread a layer of this liquor quite hot on your wood,
with a pencil, which will give it a violet colour. When
 it is dry, spread on another layer; dry it again, and
 give it a third ; then boil verdigris at discretion, in its
own vinegar, and spread a layer of it on the wood ;
when it is dry, rub it with a brush, and then with oiled
chamois skin. This gives a fine black, and imitates per
fectly the colour of ebony.
                     The Well of fire.
    Add gradually one ounce, by measure, of sulphuric
 acid, to five or six ounces of water in an earthenware

basin ; and add to it also, gradually, about three quar
ters of an ounce of granulated zinc. A rapid production
of hydrogen gas will instantly take place. Then add,
from time to time, a few pieces of phosphorus of the
size of a pea. A multitude of gas bubbles will be pro
duced, which will fire ou the surface of the effervescing
liquid ; the whole surface of the liquid will become lu
minous, and fire-balls, with jets of fire, will dart from
the bottom through the fluid with great rapidity, and a
hissing noise.
             Test of Poison in Confectionery.
    Many of the preparations of sugar and flour are co
loured with red lead, and preparations of copper and
 pipe-clay are sometimes employed.
    The presence of red lead may be detected by pouring
 a little water, saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
 on the article. If it contain lead, the liquid will become
 of a blackish colour. Copper may be discovered by
 pouring on it liquid ammonia, which soon acquires a
 blue colour, if this metal be present. Clay may be de
 tected in articles composed of sugar, such as comfits, by
 dissolving them in a large quantity of boiling water, and
 letting the mixture stand for twenty-four hours ; if clay
 be present it will fall to the bottom, and when the clear
 liquid is poured off, it may be had in a separate state ;
 expose it to a strong heat, and if it contract and be
 come hard, the adulteration with clay is proved.
 Luminous Characters on Walls coated with Lime.
    Take a piece of phosphorus from the bottle in which
 it is kept, and, during candle-light, write upon a white
 washed wall, any sentence or word ; or draw any figure,
 according to fancy. Withdraw the candle from the
 room, and direct the attention of the spectators to the
 writing, Whatever part tfce phosphorus has touched,

will be rendered quite luminous, emitting a whitish
smoke or vapour. Care must be taken, whilst using
the pencil of phosphorus, to dip it frequently in a basin
of cold water ; or the repeated friction will throw it into
a state of the most active combustion, to the manifest
detriment of the operator.
    To give a Person a supernatural Appearance.
    Put one part of phosphorus into six of olive oil, and
digest them in a sand heat. Rub this on the face (taking
care to shut the eyes) and the appearance in the dark will
be supernaturally frightful ; all the parts which have
been rubbed appearing to be covered by a luminous lam
bent flame of a bluish colour, whilst the eyes and mouth
appear like black spots. No danger whatever attends
this experiment.
                  Fulminating Powder.
    Mix together one dram of sulphur, three drams of
nitrate of potass, and two drams of carbonate of potass,
 (all previously powdered) in a sheet of writing-paper.
When properly mixed, put them into a small stoppered
phial. An eighth or a sixteenth part of this, put into a
fire-shovel, or tin plate, held over the fire for a few mi
nutes, will explode ; immediately before the explosion,
a violet-coloured flame will be seen to hover over it.

flame be vivid, then immerse it once more. Instead of
extinction, the flame will be now kept up with great
splendour. It will be of a delicate red colour.

on the upper part of the piece a thin"plate of metal,
which has been detached from it.

    Fill a quill with quicksilver, seal it at both ends with
 good hard wax ; then have an egg boiled, take a small
 piece of the shell off the small end, and thrust in the
 quill with the quicksilver ; lay it on the ground, and it
 will not cease tumbling about so long as any heat re
 mains in it : or if you put quicksilver into a small blad
 der, and blow it up, then warm the bladder, it will skip
 about so long as heat remains in it.

             Easy method of gilding Steel.
   Immerse a piece of highly polished steel, in a solution
of nitro-muriate of gold, which will leave a coat of gold
upon the steel, which must be immersed in water the
moment it is gilt. The adhesion and appearance of the
gold are considerably improved by the use of the bur
nisher. All kinds of figures may be delineated on
highly polished steel instruments, by applying a fine
brush or pen dipped in the above solution.
  A Green Colour extracted from Coffee-Berries.
  At Venice a method has been lately discover
ed for composing a fine unchangeable emerald -green
colour. A certain quantity of coffee is boiled in river-
water; spoiled coffee (cafe ovarii) is preferable. By
means of a proportional quantity of pure soda, a green
precipitate is obtained, which is suffered to dry for six
or seven days, upon polished marble, stirring it about
occasionally, in order that every part of it may be in
contact with atmospheric air, from which it receives a
new vivacity of tint. The green lake obtained by this
process has resisted the action of the acids, and even the
influence of light and moisture.
                   Water-proof Cloth.
   An able practical chemist of Glasgow has discovered
a simple and most efficacious method of rendering wool
len, silk, or cotton cloth, completely water-proof. The
mode adopted is to dissolve caoutchouc (India rubber)

                  ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                      23
in mineral oil, which is procured in abundance at the
 gas works : by a brush to put five or six coatings of this
 mixture on one side of the cloth or silk, on which ano
 ther piece of cloth is laid, and the whole passed between
 two rollers. The adhesion is most complete ; so much
 so, that it is easier to tear the cloth than to separate
 either piece from the caoutchouc.
                   Cementfor Glass, fyc.
    It has been erroneously stated that India rubber will
make good glue : it will never set or harden. For a
strong, firm, cheap glue, nothing has yet been discover
ed superior to the best kind of that which is in genoral
use ; and for a fine, clear, and transparent kind, which
will even unite glass so as to render the fracture almost
imperceptible, nothing is equal to isinglass boiled in spi
rits of wine.
                    The Three Haloes.
   The following experiment, which illustrates in a pleas
ing manner the actual formation of haloes, has been
given by Dr. Brewster :—" Take a saturated solution of
alum, and having spread a few drops of it over a plate of
glass, it will rapidly crystalize in small fiat octoLadrons,
scarcely visible to the eye. When this plate is held be
tween the observer and the sun, or a candle, with the eye
very close to the smooth side of the glass-plate, there
will be seen three beautiful haloes of light, at different
distances from the luminous body. The innermost halo,
which is the whitest, is formed by the images refracted
by a pair of faces of the octohedral crystals, not much
inclined to each other ; the second halo, which is more
coloured, with the blue rays outwards, is formed by a
pair of faces more inclined ; and the third halo, which is
very large and highly coloured, is formed by a still more
inclined pair of faces. Each separate crystal forms

24               ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
three images of the luminous body, placed at points 120
degrees distant from each other, in all the three haloes ;
and as the numerous small crystals have their refracting
faces tamed in every possible direction, the whole circum
ference of the haloes will be completely filled up. The
same effects may be obtained with other crystals ; and
when they have the property of double refraction, each
halo will be either doubled, when the double refraction
is considerable, or rendered broader, and otherwise mo
dified in point of colour, when the double refraction is
small. The effects may be curiously varied, by crysta-
lizing upon the same plate of glass, crystals of a decided
colour, by which means we should have white and co
loured haloes succeeding each other.
Application of the Moire Metallique to Tin-Foil.
   All leaves of beaten tin are susceptible of crytalizing,
because the hammer has only broken, more or less, the
tin crystals ; and, without any other preparation, they
give a larger or smaller grain. It is not the same with
laminated tin : the crystals are so exceedingly broken,
that on being taken out of the acid-bath, the leaves of
tin shew only an oxidized surface, proving that the po
rosity is not the same as that of beaten leaves. The
means employed for moiring tin-plates become im
practicable on leaves of tin in complete fusion;
thus there was no need of employing a blast of air or
water. Tin has so strong an attachment to the surface
of iron, as to facilitate crystalization by the different
means employed, and under different forms. It was re
quisite to make these leaves of tin undergo partial fusion,
more or less extensive, but not general. Therefore
take a leaf of brass, what is called in commerce yellow
tinsel (a very fine piece of woven wire would pro
duce the same effect) : after it is heated red-hot, to
anneal it, nail it on a frame, mounted on four feet,
about eight inches long, to stand level on a table. Take
a leaf of tin, which extend upon the brass by rubbing

                 ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                       25
 It with a brush ; afterwards pass a small spirit-lamp un
 der it, in different places, to fuse the tin, which will
 produce a very fine moire. The ground will be in grains,
 in a natural crystalization. To produce grounds filled
 with flowers, take round and flat irons ; after having
 heated them red-hot, and pressed them beneath the foil
without friction, the contact will melt the tin to the width
 Of the iron. But care must be taken to withdraw the
iron as soon as the tin appears to be melted, and not to
replace it but at a certain distance from the part first
Brought into fusion, in order that the latter may have
time to solidify, and not be confounded with the other.
Afterward we may follow the same process between
them. By running leaves of tin upon fine cambric, or
upon stone, different moire's may be formed in succes
 sion, at pleasure. It now remains only to subject these
leaves to the action of the acid, in order to develope the
moire produced by the heat. For this purpose, pass the
composition over the foil with a sponge, or rather dip
the foil into the liquid, and draw it out again, as soon as
it has acquired its brilliancy, to rince it in pure water,
and wipe it dry. But in the latter case, care must be
taken to coat the back of the foil with varnish, that the
acid may not penetrate through it by acting on both
sides. The varnish should be composed of Jews' pitch
(asphaltum) dissolved in oil of turpentine. The nitro-
muriatic composition is made of two parts of nitric
acid and one part of muriatic acid, diluted with ten parts
of water.
      To obtain very large ornamental Crystals.
    To obtain large artificial crystals of a regular shape,
requires considerable address, and much patient atten
tion ; but the result fully recompenses the trouble. The
method of M. Leblanc is as follows :—The salt to be
erystalized is to be dissolved in water, and evaporated
to such a consistency that it shall crystalize on cooling.
Set it by, and when quite cold, pour the liquid part off

26                 ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
the mass of crystals at the bottom, and put it into a flat-
bottomed vessel. Solitary crystals form at some distance
from each other, and these may be observed gradually
increasing. Pick out the most regular of these, put them
into a flat-bottomed vessel at some distance from each
other, and pour over' them a quantity of liquid obtained
in the same way, by evaporating a solution of the salt,
till it crystalizes on cooling. Alter the position of every
crystal, once at least every day, with a glass rod, that
all the faces may be alternately exposed to the action of
the liquid ; for the face on which the crystal rests, never
receives any increase. By this process, the crystals gra
dually increase in size. When they have acquired such
a magnitude that their forms can easily be distinguished,
the most regular are to be chosen, or those which have
the exact shape which we wish to obtain ; and each of
them is to be put separately into a vessel filled with a
portion of the same liquid, and turned in the same man
ner several times a day. By this treatment, they may
 be obtained of almost any size we think proper. When
 ever it is observed that the angles and edges of the crys
tal become blunted, the liquid must immediately be
 poured off, and a portion of new liquid put in its place ;
 otherwse the crystal is infallibly destroyed.
               Beautiful Star-like Crystals.
    Four three ounces of diluted nitric acid into a glass
 vessel, and add gradually to it two ounces of bismuth,
 broken by a hammer into small pieces. The metal will
 be attacked with great energy, and nitrate of bismuth
 will be formed. Crystalize the solution by a gentle
 heat, and preserve the crystals, which possess great
 beauty, under a glass.
                 Distillation of Sea Water.
    A most successful experiment on this subject was
 lately tried on board the Aguilar, lying in the Lon
 don Docks. The apparatus consists of a fire-place in

                  ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                       27
 front, having underneath a large oven. In the upper
 part is a tank, into which the sea-water is pnt ; and
 well fitted over this are two coppers for boiling broth
 or meat. Between this tank and the oven below,
 the flame of fire is carried with great but equal strength
 to the flue behind; from which, however, but little
 smoke is discharged, the apparatus acting as an almost
perfect fumivore. From the tank proceeds a bent
tube, which conducts the steam into the refrigera
tory, where it is condensed into a quadrangular box,
which is hollow in the middle : this box is surrounded
by another tank, into which cold salt water is poured,
which, when heated, is let in by a pipe and cock to the
tank below the cooking coppers, there to be converted
into steam, and condensed as before mentioned. With
this apparatus a piece of beef was roasted in the
oven ; about 3J gallons of excellent soup made, where
only two gallons of water had originally been put in ; a
leg of mutton boiled, with turnips, in a copper, into
which not a drop of water had been poured ; a quantity
of pure fresh, almost tasteless, water produced, equal to
a quart of beer measure, in the short space of five mi
nutes.
                        Silver Tree.
   The method of forming this beautiful precipitation of
silver, was originally given by Lemery :—Dissolve one
part of silver in dilute nitric acid ; dilute the solution
with twenty parts of distilled water, and add to it two
 parts of mercury. This process requires about forty
 days for the formation of the metallic tree. Homberg
 gives a shorter process. It consists in making an amal
 gam in the cold, of four parts of silver leaf and two of
 mercury. This amalgam is to be dissolved in a sufficient
 quantity of nitric acid, and the solution to be diluted with
 water equal to thirty-two times the weight of the metal
 employed. By introducing into this liquid a lump of
 soft amalgam of silver, the formation of the tree speedily

amalgam of silver into six parts of a solution of nitrate
of silver, and four of a solution of nitrate of mercury.
          Easy Method of extinguishing Fire.
   A new mode of extinguishing fire in chimneys by
throwing sulphur on the fire below, has been tried with
great success, and recent experiments have fully con
firmed the valuable result of the method, which is in fact
perfectly consonant with the received theory of combus
tion ; only, the person using it must take care not to
throw on too large a quantity of sulphur, otherwise he
might be exposed to inhale the noxious effluvia, which
destroy animal life on the same principle that they ex
tinguish fire.
 To set a combustible Body on Fire, by the Contact
                        of Water.
   Fill a saucer with water, and let fall into it a piece of
potassium the size of a pepper corn, which is about two
grains. The potassium will instantly burst into flame,
with a slight explosion, and burn vividly on the surface
of the water, darting at the same time from one side of
the vessel to the other, with great violence, in the form
of a beautiful red-hot fire-ball.
To separate Two Liquors which have been mixed
                        together.
   If you wish to separate, for example, water from oil
with which it has been mixed, take a bit of cloth or
sponge, well moistened in water, and place it, immersing -
it by one end, in the vessel containing the liquors to be
separated ; the other end must be made to pass over the

edge of the vessel, and to hang down much lower than
the liquor : this end will soon begin to drop, and in this
manner will attract and separate all the water mixed with
oil. If it be required to draw off the oil, the rag or
sponge must be first immersed in that liquid.
        Seautiful Compoundfor Ornamental
                      Medallions, Sfc.
   Put into a crucible an ounce of copper, and an ounce
of antimony ; fuse them by a strong heat, and pour the
alloy into a mould. The compound will be very hard
and of a most beautiful violet hue ; and admirably
adapted for works of taste, as medallions, seals, &c.
               The Magical Tea-Spoon.
   Put into a crucible four ounces of bismuth, and when
in a state of fusion, throw in two ounces and a half of
lead, and one ounce and a half of tin : these metals will
combine, forming an alloy fusible in boiling water.
Mould the alloy into bars, and take them to a silver
smith's to be made into tea-spoons. Give one to a stran
ger to stir his tea, as soon as it is poured from the tea
pot ; he will not be a little surprised to find it melt in
his tea-cup.
             Alloyfor varnishing Figures.
   Fuse half an ounce of tin with the same quantity of
bismuth in a crucible ; when melted, add half an ounce of
mercury. When perfectly combined, take the mixture
from the fire and cool it. This substance mixed with
the white of an egg forms a beautiful varnish, for plaster
figures, &c.

30              ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
                   Sympathetic Ink.
     (See also Endless Amusement, First Series, p. 22)
   The most curious of all kinds of sympathetic ink, is that
from cobalt. It is a very singular phenomenon, that
the characters or figures traced out with this ink, may
be made to disappear and re-appear at pleasure ; this
property is peculiar to ink obtained from cobalt ; for all
the other kinds are at first invisible, until some substance
has been applied to make them appear; but when once
they have appeared they remain. To prepare this ink,
take zaffre, and dissolve it in nitro-muriatic-acid, till the
acid extracts from it the metallic part or the cobalt
which comunicates to the zaffre its blue colour ; then
dilute the solution, which is very acrid, with cemmon
water. If you write with this liquor on paper, the cha
racters will be invisible ; but when exposed to a suffi
cient degree of heat, they will become green. When
the paper has cooled they will disappear. Observe, if
the paper be too much heated, they will not disappear
at all.
                   The Magic Oracle.
   With the above kind of ink, the following amusing
trick may be performed :—write on several leaves of
paper, with common ink, a certain number o( ques
tions, and between each question write the answer
with the above kind of ink, The same question
 must be written on several pieces of paper, but with
different answers, that the artifice may be better
concealed. Then provide a box, to which you may give
the name of the Sybil's cave, containing in the lid a plate
of iron made very hot, in order that the inside of it may be
heated to a certain degree. Having selected some of the
questions, take the bits of paper containing them, and
tell the company you are going to send them to the Sybil
or oracle, to obtain an answer ; introduce them into the
heated box, and when they have remained in it some
minutes take them out, and shew the answers which have
been written. Take care, soon to lay aside the bits of

paper ; for if they remain long in the hands of those
to whom the trick is exhibited, they would see the an
swers gradually disappear, as the paper beeame cold.
                Another Sympathetic Ink.
    Write with the nitro-muriate of gold, and brush the
letters over with muriate of tin in a diluted state. The
writing, before invisibie,will now appear of an exquisitely
beautiful purple colour.
    To ascertain if Linen be bleached with Lime.
    Every body knows the injury which is done to linen
by bleaching it with lime. It is easy to detect linens
which have been so bleached, in the following manner :—
 Cut off a piece of the new linen which you wish to exa
mine, put it into a glass, and pour upon it several spoon
fuls of good vinegar. If the linen contain lime, the acid
 will excite considerable effervescence, accompanied with
 a slight noise. Otherwise no effect is produced.
           Brilliant Experiment with Platina.
    Platina, (the heaviest of all elementary substances)
 when reduced into very small particles, produces, by
 simple contact with hydrogen gas, (the lightest of ele
 mentary substances,) an electrical or dynamic combina
 tion, which if brought into contact with hydrogen gas or
 with atmospheric air, instantly dissolves itself, yielding
 fire and water. To prove this important fact by a bril
 liant experiment, the hydrogen gas is made to pass from
 a reservoir, by a capillary tube, curved below, upon pure
  platina in powder, which is contained in a glass tunnel,
  hermetically sealed at the point, so that the gas mingles
 with the air before it touches the platina. The moment
 that the current of gas reaches the surface of the platina,
 the powder of that metal becomes red and burning, and
 this phenomenon continues as long as the stream of gas
 is directed upon it.

 32              ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
               Effect of Heat on the Ruby.
    In subjecting rubies to a high degree of heat, Dr.
 Brewster observed a very singular effect produced by
 their cooling. At a high temperature, the red ruby be
 comes green ; as the cooling advances, this green tint
 gradually fades and becomes brown, and the redness of
 this brown tint gradually increases till the mineral has
 recovered its primitive brilliant red colour. A green
 ruby suffered no change of colour from heat, and a bluish
 green sapphire became much paler at a high heat, but
 resumed its original colour by cooling.
 Composition of Tutanag, or Chinese White Copper.
   This celebrated alloy has been analyzed by Dr. Fyfe,
who gives the following as its composition :—

   Simple immersion in oxygenated muriatic acid, letting
the article remain in it, a longer or shorter space of time,
according to the strength of the liquor, will be sufficient
to whiten an engraving : if it be required to whiten the
paper of a bound book, as it is necessary that all the
leaves should be moistened by the acid, care must be
taken to open the book well, and to make the boards rest
on the edge of the vessel, in such a manner that the paper
alone shall be dipped in the liquid; the leaves must be
separated from each other, in order that they may be

yellow tint, and the paper becomes white in the same
proportion ; at the end of two or three hours, the book
may be taken from the acid liquor, and plunged into pure
water with the same care and precaution as recommended
in regard to the acid liquor, that the water may touch
both sides of each leaf. The water must be renewed every
hour, to extract the acid remaining in the paper, and to
 dissipate the disagreeable smell.
               To remove the Stains of Ink.
    The stains of ink, on cloth, paper, or wood, may be re
 moved by all acids ; but those acids are to be preferred,
 which are least likely to injure the texture of the stained
 substance. The muriatic acid, diluted with five or six
  times its weight of water, may be applied to the spot, and
 after a minute or two washed off; repeating the applica
  tion as often as maybe found necessary. Less risk attends
  the use of vegetable acids. A solution of the oxalic, cit
  ric, (acid of lemons,) or tartareous acids, in water, may
  be applied to the most delicate fabrics without danger of
  injuring them ; and the same solution will discharge
  writing but not printing ink. Henee it may be employed
  in cleaning books, which have been defaced by writing on
  the margin, without impairing the text.

   Two cold Liquids when mixed become boiling hot.
    Put into a thin phial two parts (by measure) of sul

                  To make Fire Bottles.
    The phosphoric fire bottles maybe prepared in the fol
 lowing manner :—Take a small phial of very thin glass,
 heat it gradually in a ladle-full of sand, and introduce
into it a few grains of phosphorus ; let the phial be then
left undisturbed for a few minutes, and proceed in this
 manner till the phial is full. Another method of prepar
ing this phosphoric bottle, consists in heating two parts
of phosphorus and one of lime, placed in layers, in a
loosely stopped phial for about half an hour ; or pat a
little phosphorus into a small phial, beat the phial in a
ladle-full of sand ; and when the phosphorus is melted,
turn it round, so that the phosphorus may adhere to the
sides of the phial; and then cork it closely. To use this
bottle, take a common brimstone match, introduce its
point into the bottle, so as to cause a minute quantity of
its contents to adhere to it : if the match be rubbed on

 should be taken not to use the same match a second time
 immediately, or while it is hot, as it would infallibly
 set fire to the phosphorus in the bottle.
            Dr. Wollaston'a lee Apparatus.
                   (See Frontispiece, Fig. 12.)
    The cold produced by evaporation is under certain
 circumstances, very great. Spirit of wine, and ether,
 which readily evaporate, produce considerable cold
 during that process. Upon this principle, wine-coolers,
 and similar porous vessels, refrigerate the fluids they
 contain ; and thus, by accelerating the evaporation of
 water, by exposing it under an exhausted receiver, con
 taining bodies that quickly absorb its vapour, Professor
 Leslie bas contrived to effect its congelation ; the heat
 required for the conversion of one portion of the water
into vapour being taken from the other portion, which
is thus reduced to ice. The instrument invented by Dr.
Wollaston, and called by him the cryophorus, acts upon
a similar principle. It consists of a glass tube with a
bulb at each extremity, of the shape of figure 12. One
of the bulbs is about half filled with water, and a good
vacuum is produced in the other by boiling the water
and sealing the tube whilst full of steam. On immers
ing the empty bulb in a freezing mixture, the water soon
congeals in the other, although the intervening tube
be two or three feet long. The vapour in the empty
bulb is condensed by the cold, and a fresh quantity of
vapour arises successively from the water in the other,
by which so much heat is carried off as to cause it to
congeal.

          Beautiful Metallic Cryttalization.
   Melt a ladle-full of bismuth, and allow it to cool
slowly and gently, till a thin crust has formed on the
surface ; and then, by means of a pointed iron, make
two small opposite apertures through the crust, and
quickly pour out by one the fluid portion, as carefully
and with as little motion of the mass as possible, whilst
the air enters by the other aperture : there will appear,
on removing the upper crust by means of a chisel, when
the vessel has become cold, a cup-shaped concavity,
studded with very brilliant crystals, and more or less
regular, according to the magnitude of the quantity of
mass employed, the tranquillity and slowness with
which it has cooled, and the dexterity with which the
fluid portion, at the moment before it commenced to so
lidity, was decanted from the crystalized part. The
same effect will be produced by fusing the substance in
a crucible which has a hole at its bottom, lightly closed
by an iron rod or stopper, which is to be drawn out
when the mass begins to congeal : by this means the
superior portion, which is fluid, is made to run off, and
a cake studded over with crystals is obtained.

    To convert a Green-coloured Liquid to White. .
   Four a little of the solution of nickel into a glass, and
add to it a few drops of the infusion of galls, which will

ammonia be added to this solution of nickel, it will
convert it to a deep-blue ; in the course of an hour or
two it will change to red, and violet ; if a drop of sul

property of different colours, according to the quantity
of water that is added to it. A small quantity gives a
green solution, a greater quantity changes it to blue ;
more still, to a purple, and a still larger quantity, to a
beautiful deep purple. The last experiment may be va
ried by putting equal quantities of this substance into
separate glasses, and pouring hot water on the one, and

 duces. The sensations produced by breathing this gas,
 are not the same in all persons, but they are always of
 an agreeable nature, and not followed by any depression

         To detect Adulteration in Champagne.
         ft i
    This celebrated wine is indebted for its characteristic
properties to the presence of carbonic acid. It produces
rapid intoxication, in consequence of the alcohol, which
is suspended in, or combined with, this gas, being thus
applied in a sudden and very divided state to a larger
extent of nervous surface : for the same reason its effects
are as transitory as it is sudden. The following simple
test invented by Dr. Hahnemann, may be relied upon in
all cases when an adulteration of lead is suspected :—
Expose equal parts of sulphur and powdered oyster-
shells to a white heat for fifteen minutes, and, when
cold, add an equal quantity of cream of tartar : these are
to be put into a strong bottle with common water, to
boil for an hour; and the solution is afterwards to be
decanted into ounce phials, adding twenty drops of mu
riatic acid to each. This liquor will precipitate the least
possible quantity of lead in the most rapid manner ; the
muriatic acid being added to prevent a precipitation of
iron, which is innoxious, and might accidentally be con
tained in the wine.

when affected by sulphureous vapours. M. Thenard, of
Paris, has restored a painting of Raphael's, thus injured,
by means of oxygenated water, applied with a pencil,
which instantly took out the spots and restored the
white. The fluid was so weak, as to contain not more
than five or six times its volume of oxygen, and had no
taste.

 discovery of Mr. Braconnot, of Nancy, of the effects of

 other similar vegetable substances, such as old paper,
 both printed and written upon, and cut straw. By di
 luting the sulphuric acid with a due addition Of water,
 sawdust, cut linen, paper, &c. were converted into gum

 stance, like the filaments of wood, converted, by che

 thus exercise a power, which, till lately, appeared to

 these two substances from bodies in which they already
 existed, a process which has been known from time im

          Rosin Bubbles, a curious Experiment.
   We can recommend to the attention of our readers the
following simple and curious experiment : we have not
tried it ourselves, but have no doubt of its success. It
is an extract of a letter from Mr. Morey, of Oxford, New
 Hampshire, to Dr. Silliman, the editor of the American
Journal of Science and Arts. If the end of a copper tube,
 or of a tobacco-pipe be dipped in melted rosin, at a tem
perature a little above that of boiling water, taken out and
held nearly in a vertical position, and blown through,
bubbles will be formed of all possible sizes, from that of
a hen's egg down to sizes which can hardly be discerned
by the naked eye ; and from their silvery lustre, and re
flection of the different rays of light, they have a pleasing
appearance. Some, that, have been formed these eight

  months, are as perfect as when first made. They gene
  rally assume the form of a string of beads, many of them
  perfectly regular, and connected by a very fine fibre ;
  but the production is never twice alike. If expanded by
  hydrogen gas, they would probably occupy the upper
  part of the room. The formation of these bubbles is
  ascribed to the common cause, viz. the distention of a
  viscous fluid by one that is aenform ; and their perma
 nency, to the sudden congelation of the rosin, thus im
 prisoning the air by a thin film of solid matter, and pre
 venting its escape."                      •   i.
        Pleasing Experiments with Glass Tubes.             r
    A most remarkable phenomenon is produced in glass
 tubes, placed in certain circumstances. When these are
 laid before a fire in an horizontal position, having their
 extremities properly supported, they acquire a rotary
motion round their axis, and also a progressive motion
 towards the fire, even when their supports are declining
from the fire, so that the tubes will move a little way up
wards to the fire. When the progressive motion of the
tubes towards the fire is stopped by any obstacle, their
rotation still continues. When the tubes are placed in a
nearly upright posture, leaning to the right hand, the
motion will be from east to west ; but if they lean to the
left hand, the motion will be from west to east ; and the
nearer they are placed to the upright posture, the less will
the motion be either way. If the tube be placed horizon
tally on a glass plane, the fragment for instance of coach
window glass, instead of moving towards the fire, it will
move from it, and about its axis in a contrary direction
to what it had done before ; nay, it will recede from the
fire, and move a little upwards when the plane inclines
towards the fire.—These experiments succeed best with
tubes about 20 to 22 inches long, which have in each end
;i pretty strong pin fixed in cork for their axis.

   M. Gay Lussac has proposed a means of rendering the
various tissues of cloths, stuffs, &c. incombustible ; and
the means he recommends appear superior to those which
as yet hare been proposed. That the combustibility of
these substances is diminished by their having been im
mersed in solution of certain salts, as of alum, muriate
of soda, &c. has been long known. M. Gay Lussac con
sidered that those salts should possess this property most
 eminently which entered most readily into fusion, being
enabled by that means to cover perfectly the fibre of the
substances, and preserve them from the contact of the
air. Guided by this thought, he substituted phosphate
of ammonia and borate of soda for alum, ike. and he
 found that muslins thus treated could be placed in con

 their length, conclude that the weather will be serene,
and continue so at least for ten or twelve days. But if
 the spiders be totally indolent, rain generally succeeds ;
 though, on the other hand, their activity during rain is
 the most certain proof that it will be only of short dura
 tion, and followed with fair and very constant weather.
 According to further observations, the spiders regularly
 make some alterations in their webs or nets every twen
 ty-four hours ; if these changes take place between the
 hours of six and seven in the evening, they indicate a
clear and pleasant night.
    Preserving Power of the Pyroliyneovs Acid.
   In the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, some curious
experiments relative to the antiseptic power of pyrolig-
neous acid are detailed by Mr. Ramsey. The following
are some of the principal results : A number of had
docks were cleaned, split, and slightly sprinkled with
salt, for six hours ; then being drained, they were dip
ped for about three seconds iu pyroligncous acid, and

                 ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                      57
hung in the shade for eight days. On being broiled, they
were of an uncommonly fine flavour, deliriously white,
and equal to the highly-esteemed Finnan haddock. Her
rings were cured in the same way as the haddocks. Af
ter being dried in the shade for two months, they were
equal in quality and flavour to the best red herrings.
The fish retained the shining and fresh appearance they had
when taken from the sea. A piece of fresh beef was dip
ped for one minute in pyroligncous acid of specific gravity
1012, in July, 1819. On March 4, 1820, it was as free
from taint as when first immersed. No salt was used in
this experiment. A piece of beef was dipped at the same
time in pure vinegar, of specific gravity 1009. It was per
fectly free from taint on the 18th of November. This
experiment indicates antiseptic powers in pure vinegar ;
some haddocks were cured with it, which remained free
from taint, but when cooked had an insipid taste. When,
beef is partially salted, and then steeped for a short time
in the pyroligneous acid after being drained and cooked,
it has the same flavour as Hamburgh beef. Mr. Ramsey
has no doubt, that with proper modifications, the use
of the acid may be extended to the preservation of every
species of animal food. The Journal of Science and the
Arts states, that the experiments relating to the had
docks had been repeated with entire success in London,
by Mr. Stodart.
                    Metallic Vegetation.
   Place a few filings of copper and iron on a glass plate
at a certain distance one from another. Then drop a lit
tle nitrate of silver on each parcel ; the silver will soon
begin to precipitate whilst the iron and the copper oxi
dize, and become coloured ; then, by a small wooden
point, the ramications may be arranged at will, whilst
the flame of a taper being placed under a plate, will in
crease the evaporation, facilitate the re-action of the
substances, blacken the lower side of the plate, and thus
form as it were a design.

58                ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
                  To destroy Caterpillars.
   A mode of destroying caterpillars, has been discovered
by accident. A piece of woollen rag had been blown by
the wind into a currant-bush, and when taken out was
found covered by these leaf-devouring insects. Pieces
of woollen cloth were immediately placed on every bush
inth i garden, and next day the caterpillars had univer
sally taken to them for shelter. In this way thousands
were destroyed every morning.
              To Bronze Plaster Figures.
   The figure is to be first painted dark green, then lay it
over with isinglass-size, until no part of its surface be
comes dry, then with a brush, technically termed a sash-
tool, go over the whole, taking care to remove, while it
is yet soft, any of the size that may lodge on the deli
cate parts of the figure. When it is dry, take a very
little thin oil gold size, and with as much as just damps
the brush, go over the figure with it, allowing no more
to remain than causes it to shine ; set it in a dry place,
free from smoke, and in two days the figure is fit to re
ceive the bronze, which is an almost impalpable pow
der, to be had at the colour shops, and is to be dabbed
on with a piece of cotton wool. Having touched Over
the whole figure, let it stand a day, then with a soft, dry
brush, rub off all the loose powder, particularly from
 the more prominent parts; it will then resemble the
metal intended, and resist all injury from weather.

and then dispose the third stick E, F, in such a manner,
that while the end E rests on the table, it shall pass be
low the stick A, B, towards the upper end B, and rest
on the stick C, D. These three sticks, by this arrange
ment, will be so connected with each other, that the ends
D, B, and F, will necessarily remain suspended, each
supporting the other.
    To make the end of a Candle pierce a Board.
    Load a musket with powder, and instead of a ball', put
 in the end of a candle ; if you then fire it against a
 board, not very thick, the latter will be pierced by the
 candle end, as if by a ball. The rapid motion with which
the candle-end is impelled, does not allow it time to be
flattened, and therefore it acts as a hard body
        Method of rendering Glass less brittle.
    Let the glass vessel be put into a vessel of cold water,
 and let this water be heated boiling hot, and then allow
 ed to cool slowly of itself, without taking out the glass.
 Glasses treated in this way may, while cold, be suddenly
 filled with boiling hot water, without any risk of their
 cracking. If the glasses are to be exposed to a higher
 temperature than that of boiling water, boil them in oil.
                      Animated Fire.
    When small pieces of camphor are placed in a basin
 of pure water, a very peculiar motion commences, some
 of the pieces turn as if on an axis, others go steadily
 round the vessel, some seem to be pursuing others, and
 thus they continue forming a very curious and pleasing
  appearance ; but if a single drop of sulphuric acid be

put into the water, the motion of the camphor instantly
 stops. If a piece of camphor be lighted, and then care
fully placed on the water, it burns with a bright flame,
moving about with great rapidity, as if in search of
 something, but is instantly stopped by a drop of sulphu
 ric acid.
               Quadrature of the Circle :
       Simple Method of solving this Problem.
    Let a sphere be made, likewise a perfect hollow cube,
one of the internal sides of which must be equal to the
diameter of the sphere ; then let the sphere be placed in
the hollow cube, and pour water into the vacant space
around the sphere, until the water is exactly level with
the edge of the cube, and consequently with the top of
the sphere, after which, take the sphere carefully out,
and measure the proportion which the depth of water
left in the cube bears, to the vacant space lately occu
pied by the sphere ; deduct the quantity of space occu
pied by the water, from the entire space contained by
the cube, and the remainder will be the solid contents of
the sphere. In order to find the proportion between the
circle and the superficial square, let a cylinder be made
of the same diameter as the sphere abovementioned, and
equal in height to one of the internal sides of the cube,
place the cylinder in the cube, pour water around it,
until the water is level with the edge of the cube, then
carefully take out the cylinder, find the proportion as
previously directed for the sphere ; and as the propor
tion of the cylinder is to the cube, so will the proportion
of the circle be to the square.

 basest metal. The comparison of silver, with lead,
 however, would be at variance with this otherwise un
 erring test ; but lien the sound, the feel, and indeed the

         Curioui Method offorming Pictures.
   Cover white paper, or leather, with a solution of ni
 trate of silver, and place it behind a painting on glass,
which is cxposad to the rays of the sun. The rays that
 come througk will blacken the paper ; the shades will
be more or loss deep, in proportion to the quantities of
light transmitted through the different parts of the glass.
Where the gass is transparent, and all the light comes
through, the paper will be quite black ; where the glass
is quite opafue, and does not transmit any light, the
paper will bt quite white ; and there will be degrees of
intensity of Ihc shadow, of every variety between these.
The picture is not sensibly affected by tho light of can
dles or lamps; but . day-light destroys it very soon,
causing all the paper to become black.

 Art of Gilding Writings, Drawings, fyc. on Paper
                       and Parchment.
    Letters written on vellum or paper are gilded in three
 ways ; in the first, a little size is mixed with the ink,
 and the letters are written as usual ; when they are dry,
 a slight degree of stickiness is produced by breathing
 upon them, upon which the gold leaf is immediately ap
 plied ; and by a little pressure may be made to adhere
 with sufficient firmness. In the second method, some
 white lead or chalk is ground up with strong size, and

the letters are made with this by means of a brush ;
when the mixture is almost dry, the gold leaf may be
laid on, and afterwards burnished. The last method is
to mix up some gold powder with size, and to form tlu
letters of this by means of a brush. It is supposed thit
this latter method was that used by the monks in illi-
minating their missals, &c.

             M. RUnssec's Chronograph.
    This hronograph has the form and size of a large
 pocket chonometer. The dial is moveable, and turns
 round anixis, passing through its centre perpendicular
 to its plat. When the chronograph is in motion, this
 dial turrisround once in a minute; and as its circum-
"fercnee bers sixty divisions, the angular motion of one
 division ccresponds to one second of time. The mi
 nutes are Hrked separately. The chronograph being in
 motion, thobserver who wishes to mark the instant of
 a phenomenn presses a stud, and that very instant a
 pen or metaic point passing through the open summit
 of a cone, lied with oil-black, and placed opposite to
 the fixed zeo, from which the dial begins to move,
 marks on te circumference bearing the divisions for
 seconds, a pint,' which serves'to shew with what second

that one-fourth of the interval between two consecutive

            To preserve Fresco Paintings.
   Frequent attempts hare been made to separate fresco
paintings from the walls on which they are executed, in
order to rescue them from the destructive effects of time
and weather, but all have been unsuccessful. Antonio
 Contri, of Ferrara, was the first who made a public at
tempt in the beginning of the 18th century, at Mantua.
He succeeded in taking several heads of Giulio Romano
from the wall, and transferring them to canvas ; but
this work required long and difficult preparations, which
were besides only calculated for even walls, and for
taking off smaller painting!. Later trials in France and
other countries, were confined, with more or less success
to transferring paintings, piece by piece, from walls or
 linen to new linens,) but never to panned. Subse
quently, the mode of sawing the paintings Mm the wall
was adopted ; this method, however, wb*h was always
attended with danger, was only applicable to pictures of
a small size. Steffano Barezzi, a nasive of Milan, has
the honour of having been the first to render an essen
tial service to the arts, in transferring to pannels, by a
most simple, expeditious, ind safe process, fresco paint
ings, of whatsoever size, fiom the wall, whether level or
not, without doing the least damage to the original
design. His method consists in laying a piece of pre
pared linen against the will, which extracts the painting
in such a manner, that the artist, with a sure and uni
form motion, can draw oft' the linen in a perfect state
with the painting, so that the wall itself remains quite
white. This linen is then stretched upon a pannel, and

again drawn from this, so that the painting itself re
mains fixed upon the pannel without sustaining the
smallest injury.                                              I

          Working and joining of Tortoise-shell. ....
    Tortoise-ihell and horn become soft in a moderate
 heat, as that t>f boiling water, so as to be pressed, in a
 mould, into anj form, the shell or horn being previously
 cut into plates ol a proper size. Plumier informs us,
 in his Art de Tovrner, thrt two plates are likewise
 united into one by heating aid pressing them ; the edges
 being thoroughly cleaned, ard made to fit close to" one
 another. The tortoise-shell s conveniently heated for
 this purpose by applying a hct iron above and beneath
 the juncture, with the interposition of a wet cloth to
 prevent the shell from being scorched by the irons ;
 these irons should be pretty duck, that they may not
lose their heat, before the union is effected. Both tor
toise-shell and horn may be stained of a variety of co
lours, by means of the colouring drags commonly used
in dyeing, and by certain metiilic solutions.

                     The Magic Cask.
  To construct a cask into which if three different kinds of
liquor be poured, they shall be drawn off at pleasure by
the same cock,without being mixed :—The cask must be
divided into three partitions, A, B, C, (see frontispiece,
fig. 11) intended to contain the three different liquors, such
nsred wine, white wine, and water; which may be intro
duced each into its proper partition, by the same bung, in
the following manner : in constructing the cask, a funnel
3D, with three pipes E, F, G, each conveyed into its parti
tion, must be fitted with the bung ; and within this fun
nel must be placed another, H, pierced with three holes,
which may be made to correspond with the apertures of
each pipe. If each hole, in the interior funnel H, be
made to correspond, in succession, by turning it with the
aperture of the pipe to which it belongs, the liquor
poured into the funnel H, will pass into that pipe. In
this manner each partition may be filled with the liquor
intended for it, without their being able to mix ; because,
when one pipe is open, the other two are shut. But to
draw off each liquor also, without confusion, at the bot
tom of the cask, there must be three other pipes K,L,M,
each corresponding toa partition, and a kind of cock I,N,
pierced with three holes, each corresponding to its pipe,
that by turning the stopper of the cock I, until one of
these holes is brought opposite to its pipe, the liquor of
the partition, to which that pipe belongs, will issue
alone through it.

                        Rice Glue.
   An elegant cement may be made from rice-flour,
which is at present used for that purpose in China and
Japan. It is only necessary to mix the rice-flour inti
mately with cold water, and gently simmer it over the
fire, when it readily forms a delicate and durable cement,
not only answering all the purposes of common paste,
but admirably adapted for joining together paper,
card, &c. in forming the various beautiful and tasteful
ornaments which afford so much employment and
amusement to the ladies. When made of the consist
ence of plastic clay, models, busts, basso-relievos, &c.
may be formed ; and the articles, when dry, are suscep
tible of a high polish, and are very durable.]
                          Cement.
   The following is a very excellent cement for the use
of turners and artisans in general :—Sixteen parts of
whiting are to be finely powdered and heated to red
ness, to drive off all the water. When cold, it is to be
mixed with sixteen parts of black resin, and one part of
bees-wax ; the latter having been previously melted to
gether, and the whole stirred till of an uniform consis
tence.
To give Plaster Figures the appearance of Marble.
   Put into fonr pounds of clear water, one ounce of pure
curd-soap grated, and dissolved in a well glazed earthen
vessel. Then add one ounce of white bees-wax, cut into
thin slices ; as soon as the whole is incorporated it is fit
for use. Having well dried the figure before the fire,
suspend it by a twine, and dip it once in the varnish ;
upon taking it out the moisture will appear to have been
absorbed ; in two minutes' times, stir the compost, and

dip it a second time, and this generally suffices. Cover
 it carefully from the dust for a week ; then with soft
muslin rag, or cotton wool, rub the figure gently, when
 a most brilliant gloss will be produced.
   To break a Stick, placed on two Glasses, without
                   breaking the Glasses.
    The stick, intended to be broken, must neither be
 thick, nor rest with any great hold on the two glasses.
 Both its extremities must taper to a point, and should be
 of as uniform a size as possible, in order that the centre
 of gravity may be more easily known. The stick must
 be placed resting on the edges of the glasses, which
 ought to be perfectly level, that the stick may remain
 horizontal, and not inclined to one side more than ano
 ther. Care also must be taken that the points only shall
 rest lightly on the edge of each glass. If a speedy and
 smart blow, but proportioned, as far as can be judged,
 to the size of the stick and the distance of the glasses,
 be then given to it in the middle, it will break in two,
 without either of the glasses being injured.

in bread, every hundred pounds weight are found to con
tain eighty pounds of nutritious matter ; butchers' meat,
averaging the various sorts, contains only thirty-five
pounds in one hundred ; French beans, (in the grain)
ninety-two in one hundred, broad beans, eighty-nine ;
peas, ninety-three ; lentiles, (a kind of half pea, but lit
tle known in England) ninety-four pounds in one hun
dred ; greens and turnips, which are the most aqueous
of all vegetables used for domestic purposes, furnish
only eight pounds of solid nutritious substance in one
hundred ; carrots, fourteen pounds : and what is very
remarkable, as being in opposition to the hitherto ac
knowledged theory, one hundred pounds of potatoes
only yield twenty-five pounds of substance, valuable as
nutrition. One pound of good bread is equal to two
pounds and a half or three pounds of the best potatoes ;
and seventy-five pounds of bread, and thirty pounds of
meat, are equal to three hundred pounds of potatoes ; or
to go more into detail, three quarters of a pound of
bread and five ounces of meat are equal to three pounds
of potatoes ; one pound of potatoes is equal to four
pounds of cabbage and three of turnips; but one pound
of rice, broad beans, or French beans, (in grain) is
equal to three pounds of potatoes.

across with a black lead-pencil from side to side, and
from top to bottom. Then, having your paper of the
size intended, divide it into the same number of squares,
either larger or smaller, as you would enlarge or con
tract it. Then placing the original before you, draw
square by square the several parts, observing to make
the part of the figure you are drawing fall in the same
part of the square in the copy as it does in the original.

 To prevent mistakes number the squares both of the
 original and the copy. To avoid the necessity of ruling
 across the original, which in some cases may injure it,
 take an open frame, with threads stretched across,
 placing the picture in the middle, and taking care to
 number the extremity of each square.
       Preservation ofFlowersfor Distillation.
   Rub three pounds of rose-leaves for two or three mi
 nutes with a pound of common salt. The flowers being
 bruised by the friction of the salt, form a paste which is
 to be put into an earthen jar, or a water-tight barrel.
The same process is to be repeated until the vessel is filled,
 so that the roses may be equally salted. The vessel is
then to be shut up and kept in a cool place until wanted.
 For distillation, this aromatic paste is, at any season,
 to be put into the body of the still with twice its weight
of water; and when heat is applied, the oil, or essential
water, is to be obtained in the common way. Boththe
oil and the water are in this way produced in greater
quantity, than by using the leaves without the salt : be
sides, the preserved paste will keep its flavour and
strength unimpaired for several years. Other flowers
capable of affording essential oils may also be treated in
the above way, with economy and advantage.

   The ash-tree will be found wortny the attention of
those who are fond of the curiosities of nature. The pod
of the fruit is in shape like a bird's tongue, having only
one cell that contains a seed of the same shape. By
opening the pod carefully with a pen-knife, the umbilical
cord will be found running from the stalk to the upper
end of the fruit, where it enters to convey the nourish
ment to the germ, in which (on opening from the reverse
end) will be found the future tree, so formed, both in

of magnifiers to see the perfect plant. We are not aware
of any other kernel that affords so distinct a resemblance
of its parent.
      £To make artificial Coralfor Grottoes.
   To two drams of fine Vermillion add one ounce of
clear resin, and melt them together. Having the
branches of twigs peeled and dried, paint them over
with this mixture while hot. The black thorn is the best
branch for it. Hold them over a gentle fire, turning
them round till they are perfectly covered and smooth.
White coral may be made with white lead, and black
with lamp black.
          To melt Lead in a Piece of Paper.
   Wrap up a very smooth ball of lead in a piece of paper,
taking care that there be no wrinkles in it, and that it be
every where in contact with the ball ; if it be held in
this state, over the flame of a taper, the lead will be
melted without the paper being burnt. The lead, indeed,
when once fused, will not fail in a short time to pierce
the paper, and run through.
 To preserve the Colour of Red Cabbage as a Test.
   Digest the leaves of the cabbage in warm alcohol ;
 when all the colouring matter is extracted, distil off a
 portion of the alcohol, and evaporate the remainder by
 a very gentle heat to the consistence of a syrup. This
 extract, if kept in closely stopped phials, will remain
 unimpaired for years. When used, a small portion of
 water should be added to it, in which it is readily solu
 ble, when the addition of the acid or the alkali will pro
 duce its peculiar effect. When this test is employed to
 discover small quantities of carbonic acid, it should be'

also be prepared with the alcoholic tincture of the cab
bage, which, when rendered green by immersion in a
diluted alkaline solution, may be used in the same cases
in which litmus papers are commonly employed.
Singular Experiment with the Snuff of a Candle.
    When a candle is burnt so low as to leave a tolerably
large wick, blow it out ; a dense smoke will arise ; if
another candle be applied to the utmost verge of this
 smoke, a very strange phenomenon will take place : the
 flame of the lighted candle will be carried to the one just
 blown out, as if it were borne on a cloud ; or, more
 properly speaking, like a flash of lightning, proceeding
 at a slow rate. The experiment may be performed by
 blowing oot the candle as often as it is lighted.
       To lift a Flint-glass Bottle with a Straw.
    Take a straw which is not broken or bruised, bend
 one end of it into a sharp angle, and put it into the bot
 tle, so that the bent part of it may rest against its side,
 and you may take the other end in your hand, and lift
 up the bottle by it, without breaking the straw ; and
 this will be more readily accomplished, as the angular
 part of the straw approaches to that which comes out of
the bottle.
               To beautify the Complexion.
    Take a few nut-galls, bruise them to a very fine pow
 der, and strew it nicely upon a towel ; then put a little
  ground copperas into a basin of water, which will soon
  dissolve and leave the water perfectly transparent. It
 would be unfair to trick a fair friend ; but after any per
  son has washed in this water, and wiped with the towel

en which the galls were strewed, the hands and face will
immediately become black ; and will not resume their
natural appearance for a few days.
  The method by which Watch-glasses areformed.
  The art of making watch-glasses depends upon the em
ployment of caloric, as a power which expands glass un
equally. A glass globe is blown of sufficient size to per
mit five glasses being cut from it. When the globe is cold,
a red-hot tobacco-pipe, or iron-wire, is run round the
model of the watch-glass drawn upon it ; the crack fol
lows the point of the heated wire or pipe, until the circle
is described, and the watch-glass drops out of its place.
The other four are done in the same way. This con
trivance is admirable, considering that it arose from
what is generally supposed to be a bad property of glass,
viz. fracture by heat too suddenly applied.
How Two Men may be barn on the same Day, die
   at the same Moment, and yet one may have lived
   a Day, or even two Days more than the other.
   It is well known, that if a ship sail round the world,
going from east to west, those on board, when they re
turn, will count a day less than the inhabitants of the
country. The cause of this is, that the vessel, following
the course of the sun, has the days longer, and in the
whole number of the days reckoned, during the voyage,
there is necessarily one revolution of the sun less. On
the other hand, if the ship proceed round the world
from west to east, as it goes to meet the sun, the days
are shorter, and during the whole circumnavigation, the
people on board necessarily count one revolution of the
sun more. Suppose that one of twins embark on
board a vessel which sails round the world from east to
west, and that the other remain at home. When the

                  ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                     75
ship returns, the inhabitants will reckon Thursday,
while those on board the vessel will reckon only Wed
nesday ; and the twin who embarked will have a day
less in his life. Consequently, if they should die the same
day, one of them would count a day older than the other,
though they were both born at the same hour. Let us
next suppose that,while the one circumnavigates the globe
from east to west, the other goes round from west
to east, and that on the same day they return to port,
where the inhabitants reckon Thursday, for example :
in this case, the former will count Wednesday, and the
latter Friday, so that there will be two days diiFerence
in their ages. If the latter returned on a Wednesday
and the former on a Friday, the former would count
the day of his arrival Thursday: next day would be
Thursday to the inhabitants, and the day after would be
Thursday to those who arrived in the second vessel ;
which, notwithstanding the popular proverb, would give
three Thursdays in one week.
To set fire to Spirits of Wine by tJie Rays ofthe Sun.
   Put a small quantity of spirits of wine into a glass,
and put a halfpenny or shilling in with it, then direct
the rays of the sun, by means of a burning-glass, upon the
coin, and in a short time it will become so hot as to in
flame the spirits.
           Manufacture ofMosaic at Rome.
   It is well known that mosaic-work consists of vari
ously shaped pieces of coloured glass enamel ; and that
when these pieces are cemented together, they form
those regular and beautiful figures which constitute
tessellated pavements. These pavements, the work of
the ancient Romans, have frequently been dug up in
 England and other countries. The principal manufac
tory of mosaic pictures in the present day, is at Rome,

76               ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
and belongs to his Holiness the Pope. The building in
which the establishment is situated is large, and contains
a collection of enamels drawn into the form of sticks.
These are arranged, according to their colours, in an ex
tensive suit of rooms. Tlie number of shades of colour
is 17,000. The enamel, consisting of glass mixed with
metallic colouring matter, is heated for eight days in a
glass-house, each colour in a separate pot. The melted
enamel is taken out with an iron spoon, and poured on
polished marble placed horizontally; and another flat
marble-slab is laid upon the surface, so that the enamel
cools into the form of a round cake, of the thickness of
three-tenths of an inch. In order to divide the cake
into smaller pieces, it is placed on a sharp steel anvil,
 called tagliulo, which has the edge uppermost ; and the
stroke of an edged-hammer is given on the upper sur
face of the cake, which is thus divided into long prisms,
whose bases are three-tenths of an inch square ; these
prisms are again divided across their length by the tag
liulo and hammer into pieces of the length of eight-
tenths of an inch, to be used in the mosaic pictures.
 Sometimes the cakes are made thicker and the pieces
larger. For smaller pictures, the enamel, whilst fused,
is drawn into quadrangular sticks, and these are divided
 across by the tagliulo and hammer, or by a file ; some
 times also, these pieces are divided by a saw without
 teeth, consisting of a copper blade and emery ; and the
 pieces are sometimes polished on a horizontal wheel of
 lead with emery. Gilded mosaic is formed by applying
 the gold leaf on the hot surface of a brown enamel, im
 mediately after the enamel is taken from the furnace ;
 the whole is put into the furnace again for a short time,
 and when it is taken out, the gold is firmly fixed on the
 surface. In the gilded enamel, used in mosaic at Rome,
 there is a thin coat of transparent glass over the gold.

         Substitute for a Copying Machine.
   Write with common writing ink in which lump sugar
has been dissolved, in the proportion of four scruples, or
a drachm and a half of sugar to one ounce of ink. Mois
ten copying paper, (a paper which is sold at the stati
oners at Is. lOd. per quire, for the use of copying ma
chines) by passing a wet soft brush over it, then press it
gently between soft cap paper, so as to smoothen it, and
absorb the superabundant moisture. Put the paper so
moistened upon the writing, and both between cap or
other smooth soft paper, placing the whole on the carpet
or hearth-rug, one end of which is to be folded over.
By standing and treading upon this, an impression
will be taken, equal, if not superior, to what would have
been taken by a copying machine.
                   Artificial Jewels.
  The base of all these imitations is strass, or white
crystal. The materials employed are melted in Hessian
crucibles, and a porcelain furnace, or what is preferable,
a potter's furnace is afterwards used. The more tran
quil and prolonged the fusion is, the more hardness and
beauty does the strass acquire.
  The following three mixtures give a very fine strass :
     Rock Crystal . . .   0,318. ... 0,31 70. .. . 0,300

   M. Lancon recommends the following mixture for a
pure strass :

              White Lead                  0,406

                          TOPAZ.
   The imitation of topaz is difficult. It passes from the
white of strass, to sulphur-yellow, violet, and red pur
ple, according to circumstances which are not deter
mined. The following are two of M. Wieland's re
cipes :
        White Strass              0,95816.. 0,99
        Glass of Antimony .. 0,04089

                                  1,00000        1,00
   These mixtures sometimes yield an opaque mass,
translucent at the edges, and of a red colour in thin
plates. By mixing it with eight times its weight of
strass, and keeping the mixture in fusion for thirty hours
in a potter's furnace, the result is a fine yellowish crys
tal. This crystal re-melted by the blow-pipe, produces
the finest imitation of eastern ruby.
                           RUBY.
   A ruby less beautiful, and of a different tint, may be
made thus :

   This paste is very easily made ; and that which ap
proaches the nearest to the mineral, is the following :
           Strass                         0,98743

  The following is M. Langon's recipe for emerald :
          Stress                        0,9905
          Acetate of Copper             0,0080

                                        1,0000
  By augmenting the proportion of oxide of chrome
and oxide of copper in the first composition of emerald,
and adding oxide of iron, we may vary the green shades,
and imitate the peridot and deep coloured emerald.
                       SAPPHIRE.
  The composition for this paste is,
        Strass, very white                 0,9855

                                            1,0000
   This mixture must be put into a Hessian crucible,
carefully luted, and remain thirty hours in the fire. If
the process be well conducted, the result will be a very
hard glass, without bubbles.
                       AMETHYST.

    In the fabrication of these pastes, many precautions
 are necessary, which can only be learned by experience.
The materials should in general be carefully pulverised.
The mixtures should be properly sifted, and the same
sieve should not be used for different compositions. In
order to obtain the glass well melted, and homogenous,
and without striae or bubbles, materials of great purity
must be employed ; they must be mixed in a state of
extreme tenuity ; the best crucibles must be used ; the
fire must be graduated, and kept equal to the maximum
temperature, and the mass must be left in the fire from
24 to 30 hours, and allowed to cool very slowly.

   An ounce of gold is a cube of 5£ lines on each side ;
 so that one of its faces will cover about 27 square lines.
 This cube, a gold-beater reduces into leaves, which al
together would cover 146 square feet. But 27 square
lines are contained 1 1 1 ,980 times in 1 46 square feet, con
sequently the thickness of this gold leaf is the 1 1 1 ,i)80th
part of 5f lines, or the 21,534th part of a line.—A cylin
drical ingot of silver, weighing 45 marcs, about 22
inches in length, and 15 in breadth, is covered with sis

  ounces of gold reduced to gold leaf. The thickness of
   the gold in this state, called gilding, is about the 15th
  part of a line. But only an ounce of gold may be em
  ployed ; and in this case the thickness of the gilding will
  be only the 90th part of a line.—This ingot thus gilt is
  made to pass through several holes in succession, each
  smaller than the other, till it is reduced to a wire of the
  thickness of a hair. M.Reaumur took a wire of gilt silver,
  drawn out in this manner, and having weighed halfa gross
  of it, with the greatest nicety, measured its length, which
  he found to be 202 feet, whence he learned the gross was
  404 feet in length,;the ounce 2232, the marc 23,856, and
  the marcs 1,163,520 or 9G leagues of 2000 toises each.—
  As the ductility of gold is far greater than that of silver,
  a much longer wire might be made with an ingot of gold
. of the same weight. Mnscheubroek says, that an artist
  of Augsbourg made a gold wire, weighing only a grain,
  which was 500 feet io length. A wire of this size, capa
 ble of encompassing the earth would have weighed only
  about 50 pounds.—But we can shew that the work of
  an insect surpasses the above. A single thread of silk,
 360 feet in length weighs a grain, 24 grains 1440 toises,
  and 36 grains a league of 2160 toises ; an ounce of this
  thread will extend 16 leagues, and a pound 128 : in
  short, a thread of this kind capable of encompassing the
  earth, would weigh no more than 35 pounds. We shall
 here add, that the thread of a spider's webb, which is
  much finer and lighter than the thread of the silk-worm,
  of the same length as above, would weigh only one
  pound ! —A grain of musk is capable of perfuming, for
 several years, a room 12 feet in every direction, without
 sustaining any sensible dimunition of its volume or weight.
 But a space such as the above contains 1728 cubic feet
 each of which contains 1728 cubic inches, and each of
 these 1728 cubic lines; so that the number of cubic lines
 is the third power of 1 728.—It is probable, that every one
  of these cubic lines contains some of the odorous parti
  cles ; the air of the chamber may in the course of several
  years be renewed 1000 times ; and the grain of musk,
 without sensible alteration, may furnish new odorous
 particles. In calculating the tenuity of each of these,
 the imagination is lost.

             To make a Bird seem as dead.
   Take any bird out of a cage, and lay it on a table ;
then wave a small feather over its eyes, and it will ap
 pear as dead ; but directly you take the feather away it

the feather with its feet, and it will twist and turn about
just like a parrot ; you may also roll it about on the table
any way you like.
 To describe a Vertical Dial on a Pane of Glass,
    which will shew the Hours without a Style, by
    means of the solar Rays.
    Detach a pane of glass from the window frame on
 the outside, and describe upon it a vertical dial accord
ing to the declination of the window and the height of
 the pole above the horizon : taking as the height of the
 style the thickness of the window frame. Then fix the
 pane of glass against the frame in the inside ; giving to
 the meridian line a situation perpendicular to the hori
 zon, as it ought to have in vertical dials. Then cement
 to the window frame on the outside, opposite to the
 dial, a piece of strong paper, not oiled, in order that the
 surface of the dial may be more obscure. And to know
the hours without the Shadow ef a style, make a small
 hole in the paper with a pin, opposite to the bottom of
 the style, which is marked out. As this represents the
 extremity of the style, the rays of the sun passing
 through it form on the glass a luminous point, which, as
 the rest of the dial is obscure, indicate the hours very
agreeably.

vide for it an hemispherical base of some very heavy
substance, such as the half of a leaden bullet, made very
smooth on the convex part. Cement the figure to the plane
part of the hemisphere ; and in whatever position it is
placed, when left to itself it will rise upright. In this
manner were constructed those small figures called Prus
sians, sold at Paris. They were formed into battalions,
and being made to fall down by drawing a rod over them,
they immediately started up again as soon as it was re
moved.
                 The Unsinkable Dress.
   Between the cloth and lining of a jacket, without
arms, place small pieces of cork, an inch and a half
square, and about half or three-quarters of an inch in
thickness. They must be arranged very near to each
other, that as little space as possible may be lost ; but
yet not so close as to affect in any great degree the flex
ibility of the jacket, which must be quilted to prevent
the corks moving from their places. The jacket must be
made to button round the body, by means of strong but
tons, well sewed on ; and to prevent its slipping off,
should be furnished with a kind of girdle, to pass be
tween the legs and fasten before. By means of such a
jacket, which will occasion as little embarrassment as a
common dress, people may throw themselves into the
water with the greatest safety ; for if it be properly made,
the water will not rise over the shoulders. The wearers
need make no effort to support themselves ; they may
 read or write, and even load a pistol and fire it.
                      Tracing Desk.
   Let a frame be made sufficiently large for a square of
 crown glass to rest upon it, supported by a ledge at the
 bottom part ; where, by two hinges, it may be fastened
 to a drawer of the same dimension, which may be di

vided to serve for paper, pencils, &c. To the top of
the frame, fix two stays, by which the frame may be
raised or depressed, as occasion may require. The
frame is to be used thus :—lay the subject you intend
to copy on the glass, and fasten a sheet of fine white
|>aper upon it, with some wafers or paste. If you work
in the day-time, place the back, after you have raised
the frame to a proper height, against the window; but
if by night, put a lamp behind it, and you will see every
line, which you may copy accurately, and finish as you
think proper. If it be a solid piece you intend to copy,
then place it behind the desk, and having fastened your
 paper to the frame, put the lamp so as to produce a strong
 shade on the object you have before you to draw, and
 you will plainly see to trace the outlines with a black lead
 pencil : after which, fill up the shades in the manner it
 appears without the desk.
               To etch Designs on Glass.
   Cover the glass all over with a thin coat of bees-wax,
 and trace the design with an etching needle ; then spread
the whole over as uniformly as possible with fluor spar
 (Derbyshire spar) to the depth of an eighth of an inch,
and when this is done, pour sulphuric acid, diluted with
 three times its weight of water, upon the spar. After
 the acid has remained upon it three or four hours, it is
 to be poured off, and the glass washed with oil of tur
 pentine ; the etching will then appear, and the parts that
 were covered with the wax will have remained untouched.
 Two Liquids token mixedform almost a solid Mass.
   Put into a wine glass a few tea-apoonsfulof a concent

 certed into an opaque white and almost solid mass.

         Simple Method of Preserving Fruit.
   The following simple method of effecting this desira
ble object has been successfully practised. The fruit, being'
picked clean, and not too ripe, is to be put into common
bottles, which must be filled quite full. These bottles,
having corks stuck lightly in them, are to be placed up
right in a pan of water, which is to be heated gradually to
160° or 170° Fahrenheit, or until the water feete hot to
the finger, but not so hot as to scald. This degree of heat
is to be kept up for half an hour,and then the bottles being
taken out, one by one, they are to be filled up to within
one inch of the cork, with boiling water, the cork fitted
very close and tight, and the bottle laid on its side, that
the cork may be kept moist. To prevent fermentation
and mould, the bottles are to be turned once or twice a
week for the first month or two, and once or twice a
month afterwards. Fruit treated in this way will keep,
two years or more. Care must be taken that it be not
 cracked by the heat.
    Excellent method of taking off Impressions of
                     Leaves, Plants, Sfc.
    Take fine wove paper, which oil well with sweet oil ;
 let it stand a minute or two to soak through, then re
 move the superfluous oil with a piece of paper, and hang
 it in the air to dry ; when the oil is pretty well dried in,
 take alighted candle or lamp, and move the paper slowly
 over it in an horizontal direction, so as to touch the
 flame, till it is perfectly black. When you wish to take
 off impressions of plants, lay your plant carefully on the
  oiled paper, and a piece of clean paper over it, and rub
 it with your finger equally in all parts for about half a
  minute ; then take up your plant, and be careful not to
 disturb the order of the leaves, and place it on the paper
  on which you wish to have the impression ; cover it
  with a piece of blotting paper, and rub it with your
  finger for a short time, and you will have an impression
  superior to the finest' engraving. The same piece of
  black paper will serve to take off a great number of im
  pressions ; so that when you have once gone through the

                  ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                       87
process of blacking it, you may make several impres
sions in a very short time. The principal excellence of
this method is, that the paper receives the impression of
the most minute veins and fibres, so that you may ob
tain the general character of most flowers, superior to
any engraving. The impressions may afterwards be co
loured according to nature.
        A Lantern, to give Light under Water.
   The lantern must be made of leather, which will re
sist the waves better than any other substance, and must
be furnished with two tubes, having a communication
with the air above. One of these tubes is to admit fresh
air for maintaining the combustion of the candle ; and
the other to serve as a chimney, by affording a passage
to the smoke ; both must rise above the surface of the
water. The tube, which serves to admit fresh air, must
communicate with the lantern at the bottom, and that
which serves as a chimney, must be connected with it at
the top. Any number of holes may be made in the lea
ther, of which the lantern is constructed, into which
glasses are fitted ; by these means, the light will be dif
fused on all sides. In the last place, the lantern must
be suspended from a piece of cork, that it may rise and
fall with the waves.
     To Paint the Glassesfor a Magic Lantern.
        (See also Endless Amusement, First Series, p. 65.)
   The glasses for a magic lantern are painted in oil,
with carmine, lake, Prussian blue, and other transpa
rent colours ; they are laid on as thinly and clearly as
possible, and in their use require no other direction
than such as are familiar to all persons acquainted with
drawing. Should change or motion be required, two
glasses must be employed ; on the front glass should be
painted the correct design that is first to be exhibited,

with blank spaces left upon it, for the arms, legs, or
head, in which the alteration is to take place : on the
back glass, which should slide in a groove, must be de
lineated those parts only, with outlines or dots, which
may be necessary to prevent the appearance of both at
the same time. For instance, if a figure be wished to
appear on a column, pyramid, or tomb, either of these
should be painted on the front glass, with sufficient
room left for the display of the statue : this is to be de
picted on the back glass, and the space on which it is to
be shewn, must also be darkened as directed, before it
is permitted to appear. The same rules are observable
in all other devices, with which experience will soon be
come acquainted.
                   The Magic Telescope.
          (See Endless Amusement, First Series, p. 129.)
    To construct a magic telescope, by means of whictt
 we pretend to see through opaque bodies, provide a
 tube of ivory, wider towards the end where the ob
ject glass is placed ; but the ivory must be of suf
 ficient thinness to admit the light through the inside.
 The narrow end is furnished with an eye glass, which
 serves to shew more distinctly the inside of it. The
 other end also is furnished with a glass, which has the
 appearance only of an object glass, the posterior surface
 of it being opaque, so as to serve for the base or bottom
 of a sort of compass or magnetic needle, which turns on
 a pivot fixed in its centre. When the telescope rests on
 the end containing the object glass, this needle assumes
 a horizontal position, and points towards the north, or
 towards a magnetic needle in the neighbourhood. It is
 necessary also to have a real telescope, similar in ap
 pearance to the other, to shew instead of it, which may
be done by dexterously substituting the one for the
 other. When you wish to employ the magic telescope,
place it with the object glass downwards upon the thing
you intend to examine, and if there be a magnet or
piece of magnetized iron below it, the needle will turn
 to that side.                                           •

      Trick to be done by the Magic Telescope.
   Several figures being given, which a person has ar
ranged close to each other in a box, to tell through the
lid what number they form. If you intend to employ
the ten cyphers, take ten small squares, of an inch and a
half on each side, and on the upper face of each make a
groove, but let these grooves be in different directions ;
that is to say, the first intended for the number 1 must
proceed directly from the top to the bottom ; the second
must deviate to the right, so as to form an angle equal
to a tenth part of the circumference ; the third an angle
of two-tenths ; and so of the rest, which will give ten
different positions. Then introduce into these grooves
small bars of steel well magnetized, taking care to turn
their north poles to the proper direction ; cover these
grooves and the face of the squares with strong paper,
in order to conceal the bars. You must also provide a
narrow box, capable of containing in its breadth one of
these squares, and of such a length that they can all be
arranged in it. Then desire a person in your absence to
take several of these squares, and arrange them in the
box in any manner, at pleasure, so as to form any num
ber whatever, and to shut the box ; after which you are
to tell the number which has been formed. Deposit
your pretended telescope on the place of the first square
that is on the left ; if the figure below it be 1 , the needle
will turn in such a manner that the north pole will be
before you. If the figure be 4, it will turn to the fourth
division of the circle, which is equally divided into ten
parts ; and so of the rest. It will thence be easy to dis
cover and tell the figure in each place. A word written
in secret, with given characters, may be discovered in
the same manner; also an anagram, formed of a pro
posed word, as Roma, which gives amor, mora, orma,
maro, Sfc; or a question which has been selected from
several persons and put into the box. In short, this
trick may be varied in a great many ways, exceedingly
amusing. The box of metals, for instance, is a variation
of the same trick :—You put six plates of different me
tals in a box, and bid a person take any one of them,

                 ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
and put it into another box, and shut it ; you may then
easily tell which one he has taken. These plates are of
such a form, that they can occupy in the small box but
one position : each of them, that of iron excepted, con
tains in its thickness a magnetic bar, arranged in situa
tions which are known, and these situations are disco
vered by means of the pretended magic telescope ; con
sequently the nature of the metal must be known. No
magnetic bar is placed in the plate of iron, because this
would be useless; but one side of the plate may be mag
netized, or if it be not, the indeterminate direction of
the needle will announce that it is iron.
                   Simple Microscope.
   The most powerful single microscopes are very small
globules of glass, which any curious person may make
for himself, by melting the ends of fine threads of glass
in the flame of a candle, or by taking a little fine pow
dered glass on the point of a very small needle, and
melting it into a globule in that way. It was with such
microscopes as these that Lewenhoeck made all his won
derful discoveries, most of which are deposited in the
British Museum.
               Curious Optical Deception.
   Provide a sufficient number of small equilateral
prisms, a few lines only in breadth, and in length equal
to the height of the painting which you intend to make,
and place them all close to each other on the ground to
be occupied by the painting. Then cut the painting into
bands equal to each of the faces of the prisms, and ce
ment them, in order, to the faces of the same side.
When this is done, take a painting quite different from
the former, and having divided it into bands in the same
manner, cement them to the faces of the opposite side.
It is hence evident, that when on one side you can see

                   ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                        91
only the faces of the prism turned towards that side, one
of the paintings will be seen ; and if the picture be
looked at on the opposite side, the first will disappear,
and the second only will be seen. A painting may even
be made, which, when seen in front, and on the sides,
shall exhibit three different subjects. For this purpose,
the picture of the ground must be cut into bands, and be
cemented to that ground in such a manner, that a space
shall be left between them, equal to the thickness of a
very fine card. On these intervals raise, in a direction
perpendicular to the ground, bands of the same card,
nearly equal in height to the interval between them ; and
on the right faces of these pieces of card, cement the
parts of a second painting, also cut into bands. In the
last place, cement the parts of a third picture, cut in the
same manner, on the left faces of the pieces of card. It
is evident, that when this picture is viewed in front,
 at a certain distance, the bottom painting only will be
 seen ; but if you stand on one side, in such a manner
that the height of the slips of card conceals from you the
bottom, you will see only the picture cemented in de
 tached portions to the faces turned towards that side ; if
 you move on the other side a third painting will be seen.

     The very easiest method of performing this experi
 ment, is to fill a transparent cylindric glass bottle
 with water, and place it on a table in an upright posi
 tion ; place a lighted candle at the same height, and at
 the distance from it of ten or twelve feet, and then walk
 in a transversal direction between the light and the bot
 tle, keeping your eye at the same elevation. When you
 have reached a certain point, you will see bundles of
 coloured rays issuing from one of the sides of the bottle,
 in the following order : —violet, blue, yellow, red; and
  if you continue to walk transversely, you will see a se
  cond series, in a contrary order, namely, red, yellow,

blue and violet, proceeding from the other side of the
bottle. To imitate the phenomenon completely, seven
similar bottles might be arranged in such a manner, that
the eye being placed at a proper point, one of the seven
colours should be seen in each ; and seven others might
be arranged at some distance, so as to exhibit the same
colours in an inverted order.

    Extraordinary Effects of Burning Mirrors. '
        (See also Endless Amusement, First Series, p. 32.)
   We cannot omit to mention some mirrors celebrated
 on account of their si»e, and the effects they produced ;
one of them was the work of Settala, a canon of Milan :
it Was parabolic, and inflamed wood at the distance of
fifteen or sixteen paces. Villette, an artist and optician
of Lyons, constructed three, about the year 1670, one
of which was purchased by Tavernier, and presented to
the King of Persia ; the second was purchased by the:
King of Denmark, and the third by the King of France.

The one last mentioned was thirty inches in diameter,
and of about three feet focus. The rays of the sun were
collected by it into the space of about half-a-guinea.
It immediately set fire to the greenest wood : it fused
silver and copper in a few seconds ; and in one minute,
more or less, vitrified brick, flint, and other verifiable
substances. A mirror, superior even to these, was con
structed by Baron Von Ichivnhausen, about 1687 : it
consisted of a metal plate, twice as thick as the blade of
a common knife ; it was five feetthree inches in breadth,
and its focal distance was three feet six inches : it pro
duced the following effects :—wood, exposed to its focus,
immediately took fire, which the most violent wind
could not extinguish. Water, contained in an earthen
vessel, was instantly thrown into a state of ebullition ;
so that eggs were boiled in a moment, and soon after,
the whole water was evaporated. Copper and silver
passed into fusion in a few minutes, and slate was
transformed into a kind of black glass, which, when
laid hold of with a pair of pincers, could he drawn out
into filaments. Brick was fused into a kind of yellow
glass; pumice stone and fragments of crucibles, which
had withstood the most violent furnaces, were also vi
trified, &c. But metal is not the only substance of
which burning mirrors are made ; they may be con
structed of wood and leaf gold ; nothing is necessary but
to turn a piece of exceedingly dry and very hard wood
into the form of the segment of a concave sphere ; to
 cover it in a uniform manner with a mixture of pitch
and wax, and then apply bits of gold leaf, about three
or four inches in breadth. Instead of gold leaf, small
plane mirrors might be adapted to the concavity, and
the effect would be little inferior to that of a mirror
made entirely of metal. Father Zahn mentions a mir
ror made of paste-board, covered on the inside with
 straw cemented to it, which was so powerful as to fuse
 all metals.

the thumb terminates at the line of life, marked C. If
the wrist or bottom of the hand be then turned towards
the sun, the fingers being kept equally extended, the sha
dow of the bit of straw or stick will indicate the hour.
When the shadow falls on the tip of the fore finger, it
denotes five in the morning or seven in the evening ; at
the end of the middle finger, it denotes six in the morn
ing and evening ; at the end of the next finger, seven in
the morning and five in the evening ; at the end of the
little finger, eight in the morning and four in the after
noon ; at the nearest joint of the little finger, nine in
the morning and three in the afternoon ; at the next
joint of the little finger, ten in the morning and two in
the afternoon ; at the root of the little finger, eleven in

when the shadow falls on that line of the hand marked
D, which is called the table line, it will indicate twelve
o'clock at noon.
                 Beauty and Deformity.
                  (See Frontispiece, Fig. 6.)
    Having drawn, in its just proportions, the figure you
 intend to disguise, draw a square round it as A,B,C,D,
 which divide into several other small squares. Then
 describe on the proposed plane a parallelogram E,B,F,G,
 and divide one of the two shorter sides, as E, 6, into as
 many equal parts as D, C, one of the sides of the square
 A, B, C, D, which in this case are seven. Divide the
 other side B, F, into two equal parts, in the point H,
 and draw from it to the points of division of the oppo
 site side E, 6, as many straight lines, the two last of
 which will be H, E, and H, G. Having then assumed
 in the side B, F, the point I, above the point H, as the
 height of the eye above the plane of the picture, draw
 from I, to the point E, the straight line E,I, which will cut
 those lines proceeding from the point H, in the points
  1, 2, 3, 4; 5, 6, 7. Through these points of intersection
  draw straight lines parallel to each other, and to the base
  E, G, of the triangle E,G,H, which will thus be divided
  into as many trapeziums as there are little squares in
  A, B, C, D. Hence, if the figure in the square A,B,C,D,
  be transferred to the triangle E, G, H, by making these
  parts of the outline contained in the different natural
  squares A, B, C, D, to pass through the corresponding
  trapeziums or perspective squares, the figure will be
  found to be distorted. But it may be seen exactly like its
  prototype, if it be viewed through a hole K, which
  ought to be small towards the eye, and wide towards the
  object, made in a small board L, placed perpendicularly
  in H, so that the height L, K, shall be equal to H, I,
  which must never be very great, in order that the figure
  may be more distorted in the picture.

Two Experiments to hemade with aconcave Mirror,
                which may be easily tried.
   If a fire be made in a large room, and a smooth well-
polished mahogany table be placed at a good distance near
the wall, before a large concave mirror, so that the light
of the fire may be reflected from the mirror to its focus
on the table, and you stand by the table, you will see no
thing but a long beam of light ; but if you stand at
some distance, as towards the fire, you will see, on the
table, an image of the fire, large and erect ; if another
person, knowing nothing of the matter, enters the room, -
he will be startled at the appearance, for the table will
seem to be on fire, and, being near the wainscot, to en
danger the whole room. There should be no other light
than the fire in the room. If the fire be darkened by
a screen, and a large candle be placed at the back of the
screen, a person standing by the candle will see the ap
pearance of a fine large star, or rather planet, on the
table, as large as Jupiter or Venus ; and if the paper be
moved round the candle, the satellite will be seen to go
round the planet.
To fire a Pistol over your Shoulder, and hit a
   Mark, with as much Certainty as if you took aim
   at it in the usual Manner.
   To perform this trick, place before you a plane mir
ror, so disposed, that you can see in it the object you
propose to hit ; then rest the barrel of the pistol on
your shoulder and take aim, looking at the image of the
pistol in the glass as if it were the pistol itself; that is,
in such a manner, that the image of the object may be
concealed by the barrel of the pistol:—it is evident you
must hit the mark.

         Wonderful Apparitions of various Objects.
          1          (See Frontispiece, Fig, 5.)
      A, B, C, is a thin partition of a room, down to the
  floor, with an aperture for a good convex lens turned
  outwards into the room, nearly in a horizontal direc
   tion, proper for viewing by the eye of a person standing
   upright from the floor or footstool. D, is a large con
  cave mirror, supported at a proper angle, to reflect up
  wards through the glass in the partition B, images of
. objects at E, presented towards the mirror below. A
  strong light from a lamp, &c. being directed on the ob
  ject E, and no where else ; then to the eye of a specta
  tor at F, in a darkened room, it is truly surprising to
  what effect the images are reflected up in the air at G.
  To make an Object which is too near the Eye to be
      distinctly perceived, to be seen in a distinct man
     ner, without the interposition of arty Glass.
     Make a hole in a card with a needle, and without
 changing the place of the eye or of the object, look at
 the latter through the hole ; the object will then be seen.
  distinctly, and even considerably magnified.
                  The Water Microscope.
     Provide a plate of lead, one-third of a line in thick
 ness, and make a round hole in it with a large pin ; pare
 the edges of this hole, and put into it, with the point of
 a feather, a small drop of water : the anterior and pos
 terior surfaces of the Water will assume a convex sphe
 rical form, and thus you will have a microscope;
                   iVeio Camera Lucida.
    Take a piece of looking glass ; rest it on a table in
 any angle in front of the object to be copied ; then,

 looking into it from the- upper part of the glass, with

one eye, and with the other making the axis of vision
meet in the focus point of both, any object may be seen
and sketched with singular beauty and accuracy.
 - Curious Phenomena in regard to Colours and
                          Vision.
    If you look steadily for some time at a luminous;
body, the sun for instance, when you direct your sight
to other objects in a place very much illuminated, you
will observe there a black spot ; a little less light will
make the spot appear blue, and a degree still less will
make it become purple ; in a place absolutely dark, this
spot, which you have at the bottom of your eye, will be
come luminous. Or, if you look with attention at a
bright red spot on a white ground, as a red wafer on a
 piece of white paper, you will see, after some time, a
 blue border round the wafer ; if you then turn your eye
 from the wafer to the white paper, you will see a round
 spot of delicate green inclining to blue, which will con
 tinue longer, according to the time you have looked at
 the red object. If, instead of a red wafer, you look at a
 yellow one, on turning your eye to the paper you will
 observe a blue spot. A green wafer on a white ground,
 will produce in the eye a spot of pale purple colour, a
 blue one will produce a spot of a pale red. In the last
 place, if a black wafer on a white ground be viewed in
 the same manner, after looking at it some time with at
 tention, you will observe a white border form itself
 around the wafer ; and if you then turn your eye to the
 white ground, you will observe a spot of a brighter
 white than the ground, and well defined. When yon
 look at a white spot on a black ground, the case will be
  reversed. In these experiments, red is opposed to
  green, and produces it, as green produces red ; blue and
  yellow are also opposed, and produce each other ; and
  the case is the same with black and white, which evi
  dently indicates a constant effect depending on the orga
  nization of the eye.

                  The real Apparition.
                   (See Frontispiece, Fig. 3.)
   Behind a partition A, B, place, somewhat in
clined, a concave mirror E, F, which must be at
least ten inches in diameter, and its distance equal to
three-fourths from its centre. In the partition is cut
a square or circular opening, of seven or eight inches
in diameter, directly opposite to the mirror. Behind
this a strong light is so disposed as to illuminate strongly
an object placed at C, without shining on the mirror,
or being seen at the opening. Beneath the aperture,
and behind the screen, is placed any object at C, which
is intended to be represented, a flower, figure, or pic
ture, &c. but in an inverted position. Before the parti
tion, and below the aperture, place a flower-pot D, or
other pedestal suited to the object C, so as the top may
be even with the bottom of the aperture, and that the
eye placed at G, may see the flower in the same posi
tion as if it came out of the pet ; the space between
the mirror and the back part of the partition being
painted black, to prevent any extraneous light being re
flected on the mirror. Then a person, placed at G, will
perceive the flower, or other object placed behind the
partition, as if standing in the flower-pot or pedestal ;
but on putting forth his hand to pluck it, he will find
he grasps at a phantom.
         Singular effect on the visual Organs.
   Affix to a dark wall a round piece of paper, an inch
or two in diameter; and a little lower, at the distance of
 two feet on each side, make two marks ; then place
 yourself directly opposite to the paper, and hold the
 end of your finger before your face in such a manner,
 that when the right eye is open, it shall conceal the
 mark on the left, and when the left eye is open, the mark
 onihe right : if you then look with both eyes to the end o f

100              ENDLESS AHUSEMENT.
your finger, the paper, which is not at all concealed by
it from either of your eyes, will nevertheless disap
pear.
             Another singular Experiment.
    Fix, at the height of the eye, on a dark ground, a
small round piece of white paper, and a little lower, at
the distance of two feet to the right, fix up another, of
about three inches in diameter; then place yourself op
posite to the first piece of paper, and, having shut the
left eye, retire buckwards, keeping your eye still fixed
 on the first object ; when you are at the distance of nine
 or ten feet, the second will entirely disappear from
 your sight.
                           ********
                     Solar Microscope.
    Make a round hole in the window-shutter, about
 three inches in.diameter, and place in it a glass lens of
 about twelve inches focal distance. To the inside of
 the hole adapt a tube, having at a small distance from
 the lens, a slit, capable of receiving one or two very
 thin plates of glass, to which the object to be viewed
 must be affixed by means of a little gum water, exceed
 ingly transparent. Into this tube fit another, furnished
 at its anterior extremity with a lens half an inch focal
  distance. Place a mirror before the hole of the window
  shutter on the outside, in such a manner as to throw
  the light of the sun into the tube, and you will have a
  solar magic lantern. The method of employing it is as
  follows : having darkened the room, and by means of
  the mirror reflected the sun's rays on the glasses in a
  direction parallel to their axis, place some small object be
  tween the two moveable plates ofglass, or affix it to one of
  them with very transparent gum water, and bring it ex
  actly into the axis of the tube ; if the moveable tube be
  then pushed in or drawn out till the object be a little
   beyond the focus, it will be seen painted very distinctly

on a card or piece of white paper, held at a proper dis
tance ; and will appear to be greatly magnified. A small
insect will appear a large animal, or a hair as big as a
walking-stick ; the eels in vinegar, or flour paste will
look like small serpents.
                      An Optical Game.
  Present to any one a ring, or place it at some distance,
and in such a manner that the plane of it shall be turned
towards the person's face ; then bid him shut one of his
eyes, and try to push through it a crooked stick, of suf
ficient length to reach it : he will very seldom succeed.
A person with one eye would not experience the same
difficulty ; being accustomed to make use of only one
eye, he acquires the habit of judging of distances with
great correctness.
     To tell the Number thought ofby a Person.
         (See also Endless Amusement, First Series, p. 46.)
   Desire the person, who has thought of a number, to
triple it, and to take the exact half of that triple, if it be
even ; or the greater half, if it be odd. Then desire him to
triple that half.and ask him how many times it will contain
nine ; for the number thought of will contain the double
of that number of nines, and one more, if it be odd.
Thus if 5 has been the number thought of, its triple
will be fifteen, which cannot be divided by 2 without
a remainder. The greater half of 15 is 8 ; and if this
be multiplied by 3, we shall have 24, which contains 9
twice: the number thought of will be 4 + 1, that is
to say 5.
                  To procure Oxygen Gas.
   Put a small quantity of the black oxide of manganese
into a tubulated retort, and pour upon it as much
strong sulphuric acid as will convert it into a thin paste.

102             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
Support the retort upon a wire stand, and let the open
end of it dip under the edge of the glass vessel which is
placed on the shelf of the pneumatic-trough full of wa
ter to receive the gas ; then apply the heat of a lamp
to the retort, and the gas will continue to form as long
as the manganese contains any of it.
To shew that a Candle burns'with more brilliancy
   and much longer in Oxygen Gas than in Atmos
   pherical Air.
   Procure two short candlesticks, of tin, and put a
piece of candle of the same size in each. When the can
dles are lighted and burning with equal brightness, put
one of them in a jar of oxygen gas, and the other in a
jar of equal size, containing atmospherical air ; and the
one in the oxygen gas will not only far surpass the
other in brilliancy, but will burn more than double the
time.
To shew that a Candle just put out may be lighted
                  again in Oxygen Gas.
   Take a jar, six or eight inches deep, and fill it with
 oxygen gas, then turn its mouth upwards, and let a can
 dle down in it (by means of a piece of wire) which
 has just been put out, and still retains part of the
 wick red-hot ; it will immediately be lighted with a
 slight explosion. The candle may even be put out
 again, and re-kindled by the same jar of gas.
 To exhibit the Combustion of Charcoal in Oxygen
                            Gas.
    Take a small piece of red-hot charcoal, and fasten it
 to the end of a copper wire, then let it down in a jar of

                ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                     103
oxygen gas, and the appearance will be very beautiful ;
for the charcoal burns with great splendour, and throws
out sparks in all directions.
To exhibit the Combustion of Iron-wire in Oxygen
                            Gas.
   Take a piece of fine iron wire, and coil it up in a spi
ral form. Fasten a little flax, or cotton, to one end of
it, which must be dipped in sulphur. The other end of
the wire is to be fixed to a cork, so that the spiral end
may bang straight down. Fill a bottle capable of holding
about a quart, with oxygen gas, and set its mouth up
wards ; then light the sulphur, and introduce the wire
into the bottle of gas, suspending it by the cork, which
is simply to be laid on the mouth of the bottle. The
iron will immediately begin to burn with a most brilli
ant light, throwing out a number of sparks which fall to
the bottom, and generally break it. This may, how
ever, be prevented, by pouring sand into the bottle.
To exhibit the Combustion of Phosphorus in Oxy
                         gen Gas.
   Place a piece of phosphorus about the size of a small
pea in a copper cup, about the size of a button, fas
tened to a thick iron wire, the other end of which is
fastened to a cork. Take a bottle of the same kind as em
ployed in last experiment, and after having filled it with
oxygen gas, set fire to the phosphorus, and immedi
ately plunge it into the jar, suspending it by the cork;
the light will be so excessively brilliant, that it will
be impossible to look at it. This is one of the most
beautiful experiments it is possible to exhibit, and the
light is the most brilliant that can be produced Dy art.

  104             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
    To produce Heat by adding Water to another
                          Liquid.
    Put a small quantity of sulphuric acid into a glass or
 tea-cup, then add to it about one fourth of its bulk of
 cold water, and upon stirring it, the temperature will
 immediately rise to 250 or 300 degrees of Fahrenheits'
 thermometer. In mixing sulphuric acid with water,
 great care should be taken not to do it too suddenly, as
 the glass or vessel containing it may break, and the acid
 be thrown about.
 To produce great Heat by presenting' two Solids to
                         each ot/ter.
    Take a crystal or two of the nitrate of copper, and
 bruise them, then moisten them with water, and roll
 them up quickly in a piece of tin-foil, and in half a mi
 nute, or little more, the tin-foil will begin to smoke,
 and soon after take fire and explode with a slight noise. .
 Except the crystals of the nitrate of copper are mois
 tened, no heat will be produced.
       To render the Shin and Flesh Fire-proof.
   Take juice of marshmallow, white of egg, flea-cane .
 seed, and lime ; powder and mix them with juice of ra
dish, and the white of egg ; mix all thoroughly, and with
this composition anoint your body or hand, and allow
it to dry, afterwards anoint again, and you may then
boldly take up hot-iron without hurt. Spirits of sul
phur, sal ammonia, essence of rosemary, and onion
juice is another excellent receipt. Half an ounce of
camphor dissolved in two ounces of aqua-vitae ; add one
ounce of quicksilver, one ounce of liquid storax, which

                   ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                     106
is the droppings of myrrh, and hinders the camphor
from firing;. Take also two ounces of hematatis, which
 is a red stone to be had at the druggists, which, being
put to the above composition, anoint well your feet
 with it, and you may walk over a red-hot iron bar with
 out the least inconvenience. Diluted sulphuric, nitric,
 or muriatic acid, or a saturated solution of burnt alum
 being repeatedly rubbed on the skin, will render it less
 sensible to the action of caloric Hard soap, or a soap
 paste rubbed over the tongue, will preserve it from be
 ing burnt by a hot iron rapidly passed over it. Mois
 ture too, skilfully employed, will do much, in preserv
 ing the flesh from danger. A wet finger may be safely
 dipped into a pan of boiling sugar, and even without be
 ing wet, if instantly withdrawn and plunged in water, a
 thin crust of sugar may be thus obtained without danger.
       To construct and Inflate a small Balloon.
    It is an interesting and amusing experiment to inflate
a small balloon made of gold-beaters' skin (using a lit
tle gum-arabic to elose up any holes or fissures) filling
it from a bladder or jar, and tying a thread round the
mouth of it to prevent the escape of the gas. When
fully blown, attach a fanciful car of coloured paper, or
very thin pasteboard to it, and let it float in a large room ;
it will soon gain the ceiling where it will remain for any
length ef time ; if it be let off in the open air it will as
cend out of sight. This experiment may be varied, by
putting small grains of shot into the car, in order to as
certain the difference between the weight of hydrogen
gas and atmospheric air.
To find the least Number of Weights that will weigh
              from One Pound to Forty.
   This problem may be resolved by means of the geo
metrical progression 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, &c. the property

  106           ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
 of which is such, that the last number is twice the sum
 of all the rest, and one more ; so that the number of
 pounds being forty, which is also the sum of 1,3, 9, 27,
 these four weights will answer the purpose required.
 Suppose it be required, for example, to weigh eleven
 pounds by those weights, you must put into one scale
 the one pound weight, and mto the other the three and
 nine pound weights, which, in this case, will weigh
 eleven pounds, in consequence of the one pound weight
 being in the other scale; and therefore, if you put any
 substance into the first scale, along with the one pound
 weight, and it stand at equilibrio with the 3 and 9 in
 the other scale, you may conclude it weighs eleven
 pounds. In like manner, to find a fourteen pound
 weight, put into one of the scales, the one, three, and
 nine pound weights, and into the other that of twenty-
 seven pounds, and it will evidently outweigh the other
 three by fourteen pounds ; and so on of any other weight.
A Person striking a Figure out of the sum of Two
  given Numbers, to tell him what that Figure was.
   Arbitrarily command those numbers only, as are di
visible by 9, such as 36, 63, 117, 126, 162, &c. Then
let a person choose any of these two numbers ; and,
after adding them together in his mind, strike out from
the sum any one of the figures he pleases. After he has
done this, desire him to tell you the sum of the remain
ing figures; and it follows that the number you are ob
liged to add to this amount, n order to make it 9, or 18,
is the one he struck out. Suppose, for example, he
choose the numbers 126, and 252, whose sum is 378.
Then, if he strike out 7 from this amount, the remain
ing figures, 3 and 8, will make 1 1 ; to which 7 must be
added, to make 18. If he strike out the 3, the sum of
the remaining figures, 7 and 8, will be IS ; to which, 3
must be added, to make 18 ; and so, in like manner, for
the 8

 To tell Two or more Numbers which a Person has
                         thought of.
    When each of the numbers thought of does not ex
 ceed 9, they may be found in the following manner :—
 Having made the person add 1 to the double of the first
 number thought of, desire him to multiply the whole by
 5, and to add to the product the second number. If
 there be a third, make him double this first sum, and
 add 1 to it ; then desire him to multiply the new sum
 by 5, and to add to it the third number. If there be a
 fourth, you must proceed in the same manner, desiring
 him to double the preceding sum ; to add 1 to it, to mul
 tiply by 5, and then to add the fourth number, and so on.
 Then ask the number arising from the addition of the
 last number thought of, and if there were two numbers,
 subtract 5 from it ; if three, 55, if four 555, and so on,
 for the remainder will be composed of figures of which
 the first on the left will be the first number thought of,
 the next the second, and so of the rest. Suppose the
 numbers thought of to be 3, 4, 6 ; by adding 1 to 6, the
 double of the first, we have 7, which being multiplied by
5, gives 35 ; if 4, the second number thought of, be then
added, we shall have 39, which doubled gives 78, and if
 we add 1, and multiply 79 by 5, the result will be 395.
Lastly, if we add 6, the third number thought of, the
 sum will be 401, and if 55 be deducted from it, we shall
have for remainder 346 ; the figures of which, 3, 4, 6,
indicate in order the three numbers thought of.
    To use the Sun-dial by Night as a Moon-dial.
   If any one wishes, out of curiosity or necessity, to
learn what o'clock it is by the moon, he may calculate
it by the shadow which the moon casts upon the snn-
dial; only it is necessary to know the moon's age,
which may be found in the almanack. Ifthe new moon
happens in the morning, this day is taken into the ac
count ; but if it happens after noon, the following day

108               ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
is counted the first. The moou's age is to be multiplied
by 4 and divided by 5. The quotient must either be
added to the hours which the shadow indicates on the
sun-dial, and the sum gives the time sought ; or the
hour shewn by the moon upon the dial is subtracted
from the quotient, and the remainder gives the hour
sought. The first is to be done when the shadow falls
on an hour of the afternoon, and the latter when it falls
upon an hour of the forenoon. The following examples
will illustrate this:—1st. Suppose a countryman re
turns home in the evening, the moon being ten days
old, and finds that the shade cast by the moon on the
sun-dial is at half-past two ; or that the shadow cast by
the moon falls on the place at which the shadow cast by
the sun stands at half-past two. The question is, what
o'clock was it when the peasant came home ? The an
swer is calculated as follows :—The moon's age, Iff
days + 4=40y =8.': 8, therefore is the time when the
moon was in the meridian, and 8 + 2§ = 1 0j, or half-past
ten, the hour sought. 2nd. Suppose the moon to have
been 18 days old, and the shadow cast by it on the sun
dial to have marked 11. Tins time is subtracted from
the hour when the moon was in the meridian ; thus :—
moon's age, 18 days + 4 = 72 ; y =14-f-, or 2 hours 24
minutes past midnight, at which time the moon was in
the meridian on that day, and from which the hour
marked by the shadow -must be deducted. The shadow
shews here 1 1 o'clock in the forenoon, or one hour be
fore noon, which deducted from 2 hours 24 minutes,
gives 1 hour 24 minutes ; 2g.—1 = 1.J-, or 24 minutes
past 1 o'clock.
            Curiam Arithmetical Question.
   In what manner can counters be disposed in the.
eight external cells of a square, so that there may be al
ways 9 in each row, and yet the whole number shall
vary from 20 to 32 ? Inspect the four following figures ;
the first of which represents the original disposition. of'

 of the same counters when 4 are taken away ; the third
 the manner in which they must be disposed when these
 4 are brought back with 4 others ; and the fourth, with
 the addition of 4 more. There are always 9 in each
 external row ; and yet, in the first case, the whole num

 the fourth 32.

                  Of odd Magto Squares.
   There are several rules for the construction of these
 squares, but the simplest and most convenient is that
which follows :

   Suppose an odd square, the root of which is 5, and
that it is required to fill it up with the first 25 of the na
tural numbers. In this case, begin by placing 1 in the
middle cell of the horizontal band at the top ; then pro
ceed from left to right, ascending diagonally, and when
you go beyond the square,transport the next number 2 to
the lowest cell of that vertical band to which it belongs ;
set 3 in the next cell, ascending diagonally from left to

right, and as 4 would go beyond the square, transport
it to the most distant cell of the horizontal band to which
it belongs : set 5 in the next cell, ascending diagonally
from left to right, and as the following ceil, where 6
would fall, is already occupied by 1, place 6 imme
diately below 5 ; place 7 and 8 in the two next cells, as
cending diagonally, as seen in the figure ; and then, in
consequence of the first rule of transposition, set 9 at
the bottom of the last vertical band ; then 10, in conse
quence of the second, in the last cell on the left of the
second horizontal band ; then 11 below it, according to
the third rule : after which, continue to fill up the dia
gonal with the numbers 12, 13, 14, 15, and as you can
ascend no farther, place the following number 16 below
15; if you then proceed in the same manner, the re
maining cells of the square may be filled up without any
difficulty, as seen in the above figure. The following
are the squares of 3 and 7 filled up by the same method.

 Another kind of Magic Square in Compartments.
   Another property, of which most magic squares are
susceptible is, that they are not magic when entire, but
that, when divided into those squares into which they

                  ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                   HI
 can be resolved, these portions of the original square are
 themselves magic. A square of 8 cells on a side, for
example, formed of four squares, each having 4 for its
root, being proposed, it is required that not only the
 square of 64 shall be disposed magically, but each of
those of 16, and that the latter even, however arranged,
 shall still compose a magic square. This is the simplest
method of all for constructing squares that are evenly
even, as will appear from what follows j
             1   63   62   4     9   55   54   12

            46   19   18  48    37   27   26   40
   To construct a square of 64, in this manner, take the
first 8 numbers of the natural progression, from 1 to 64,
and the 8 last and arrange them magically in a square
of 16 cells ; do the same thing with the 8 terms which fo-
low, the first 8 and the 8 which precede the last 8, and
by these means you will have a second magic square ;
form a similar square of the 8 following numbers with
their corresponding ones, and another with the 16
terms : the result will be four squares of 16 cells, the
numbers in which will be equal when added together,
either in bands or diagonally ; for they will every where
be 130. It is therefore evident, that if these squares be
arranged side by side, in any order whatever, the square

resulting from them will be magic, and the sum in every
direction will be 260.
  Easy Method of finding the Circumference of a
                           Circle.
   When moderate exactness only is required, we may
employ the proportion of Archimedes, who has demon"
strated that the diameter to the circumference, is nearly
as 1 to 3.i , or as 7 to 22. If we therefore make this
proportion as 7 is to 22, so is the given diameter to a
fourth term ; or if we triple the diameter and add to it
a seventh, we shall have the circumference very nearly.
The circumference of a circle, the diameter of which is
equal to 100 feet, will be found therefore to be 314 feet
3 inch 5-)- lines : the error in this case is about 1
inch 6 lines. If we desire to approach still nearer to
the truth, we must employ the proportion of Metins,
which is that of 113 to 355 ; we must therefore say as
113 to 355, so is the given diameter to the required cir
cumference. The same diameter as before being sup
posed, we shall find the circumference to be 314 feet 1
inch 10 ; ;» lines; the difference between which and
the real circumference is less than a line. If still
greater exactness be required, we have only to employ
the proportion of 10,000,000,000 to 31,415,926,535 ; he
error in this case, if the circumference were a great
circle, such as the equator of the earth, would be, at
most, half a line. To find the diameter, the circumfer
ence being! given, the inverse proportion must be em
ployed. We must, therefore, say as 22 is to 7 , or as 355
to 113, oras314,159istol00,000,oras31,415,926,535
to 10,000,000,000, so is the given circumference to a
fourth term, which will be the diameter required.

 The Diameter of a Circle being given, to find the
                          Area.
   Archimedes has demonstrated, that a circle is equal
to the rectangle of half a radios by the circumfer
ence. Find therefore, the circumference by the pre
ceding article, and multiply it by half the radius, or the
fourth part of the diameter : the product will be the area .
of the circle, and the more exact, the nearer to truth the
circumference has been found. By employing the pro
portion of Archimedes, the error, in a circle of 100 feet
diameter, will be about 3$ square feet. That of Metins
would give an error less than 25 square inches, or about
a'sixth of a square foot. As the circle in question would
contain about 7,854 square feet, the error, at most,
would be only one 47,124th part of the whole area. But
the area of a circle may be found, without determining
the circumference ; for it follows, from the proportion
of Archimedes, that the square of the diameter is to the
area, as 14 to 1 1 ; from that of Metins, that it is as 452
to 355 ; from the proportion of 100,000 to 314,159, that
it is as 100,000 to 78,539, or with still greater exactness
asl,000,000 to 785,398. The area of the circle therefore
will be found by making this proportion, as 14 is to 11,
or as 452 to 355, or as 1,000,000 is to 785,398, so is the
square of the given diameter, to a fourth proportional,
which, if the last proportion has been employed, will be
very near the truth.
A Person having made Choice of several Numbers, .
   to tell what Number will exactly divide the Sum
   of those which he has chosen.
   Provide a small bag, divided into two parts ; into one
of which put several tickets, numbered 6, 9, 15, 36, 63,
120, 213,309, &c. and in the other part put as many dif
ferent tickets marked with the number 3 only. Draw a
handful of tickets from the first part, and, after shewing
them to the company, put them into the bag again ; and

114              ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
having opened it a second time, desire any one to take
out as many tickets as he thinks proper. When he has
done this, open privately the other part of the bag, and
tell him to take out of it one ticket only. You may then
pronounce, that this ticket shall contain the number by
which the amount of the other numbers is divisible ; for,
as each of these numbers are some multiple of 3, their
sum must evidently be divisible by that number. This
recreation may be diversified, by marking the tickets in
one part of the bag with any figures that are divisible
by 9, and those in the other part of the bag with the
number 9 only, the properties of both 9 and 3 being the
same.
By knowing the last Figure of the Product of any
       Two Numbers, to tell the other Figures.
   If the number 73 be multiplied by each of the num
bers in the following arithmetical progression, 3, 6, 9,
12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, the products will terminate with
the nine digits, in this order : 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ; the
numbers themselves being as follows, 219, 438, 657,
876, 1095, 1314, 1533, and 1971. Let therefore a little
bag be provided, consisting of two partitions, into one
of which put several tickets, marked with the num
ber 73 ; and into the other part, aa many tickets
numbered 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27.
Then open that part of the bag which contains the
number 73, and desire a person to take out one ticket
only; after which, dexterously change the opening,
 and desire another person to take a ticket from the
 other part. Let them now multiply their two numbers
 together, and tell you the last figure of the product, and
 you will readily determine, from the foregoing series,
 what the remaining figures must be. Suppose, for ex
 ample, the numbers taken out of the bag were 73 and
 12; then as the product of these two numbers, which is
 876, has 6 for its last figure, you will readily know that
 is the fourth in the series, and that the remaining figures
  are 87.

Three things being privately distributed to three
      Persons, to guess that which each has got.
   Let the three things, for instance, be a ring, a guinea,
and a shillinor, and let them be known privately to your
self by the vowels a, e, i; of such a signifies one, r,two,
i, three. Then take 24 counters, and give the first
person 1, which signifies a, the second 2, which repre
sents c, and the third 3. which stands for i; then, leav
ing the other counters upon the table, retire into ano
ther room, and bid him who has the ring take as many
counters from the table as you gave him ; he that has
the guinea, twice as many, and he that has the shilling,
twice as many. This being done, consider to whom you
gave one counter, to whom two, and to whom three ;
and as there were but twenty-four counters at first, there
must necessarily remain either 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7, on the
table. If these numbers remain, as they ought, the
question may be resolved by retaining in your memory
the six following words :—
Salve,     certa,     anima,     gemita,      vita, quies.
   1.         2.         3.         5.         6.       7.
As, for instance, suppose the number that remained was
5 ; then the word belonging to it is semita ; and as the
vowels in the first two syllables of this word are e and i,
it shews, according to the former directions, that he to
whom you gave two counters has the ring, he to whom
you gave three counters the gold, and the other person,
of course, the silver ; it being the second vowel which
 represents 2, and the third which represents 3.
 If a hundred Stones are placed in a straight line, at
    the distance of a yardfrom each other, how many
    yards must the Person walk who undertakes to
   pick them up, one by one, and to put them into a
    basket a yard distancefrom the first Stone T
    It is evident that, to pick up the first stone, and put
 it into a basket, the person must walk two yards, one

 110            ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
in going and another in returning ; that for the second
he must walk four yards, and so on, increasing by two,
as far as the hundredth, which will oblige him to walk
two hundred yards, one hundred in going, and one hun
dred in returning. It will be perceived also, that these
numbers form an arithmetical progression, in which the
number of terms is one hundred, the first term two, and
the last two hundred. The sum total, therefore, will be
the product of two hundred and two, by fifty, or 10,100
yards, which amount to more than five miles and a half.
    Tofind whether any given Year is Leap Year,
                            or not.
   Divide the given year by 4, if nothing remain, it is
leap year ; but if 1 , 2, or 3 remain, it shews the number
of years after leap year. This rule may be committed
 to memory in the following lines t—
           Divide by 4 : what's left shall be, .
           For leap year, 0 : past, 1, 2, 3.
                          Example.
   Was the year 1819 leap year ?—Rejecting the centu
ries, 19 divided by 4, and 3 remain; therefore, the
year 1819 was the third year after leap year. .

what number is at the bottom, and add all together ;
then let him cast the dice again, and add the points cast
to the former sum : let the dice stand, being seven with

             New Mode of Multiplication.
   The following new method ofmultiplication, it is said,
was discovered by a midshipman, while doing penance at
the mast head.
        Old method.       -               New method.

   The first line of the new method is produced by be
ginning in the unit's place, as usual : each upper figure,
is multiplied by that immediately under it, and the
whole product is set down without carrying. Thus :
2X6 = 12, 3X4=12, 4X5=20, and 5X3 = 15. For
the second line multiply second figure at bottom with
first at top: 3X6 = 18; and second at top with first
at bottom, 4X2=8; and these products, 18 + 8=26,
which is written one place farther to the left. Then
third at bottom with second at top: 4X4 = 16; and
third at top with second at bottom, 5X3 = 15 ; and the
products, 16 + 15 =31, which is set down. Then fourth
figure at bottom with third at top: 5X5=25; and
fourth at top with third at bottom, 3X4 = 12; and
their products, 25 + 12 =37, which is set down, and the
second line is completed. For the third line take third
figure at bottom with first at top: 4X6=24; and third
at top with first at bottom, 5X2 = 10; and 24 + 10 =34,
which is set down. Then fourth at bottom with second
at top: 5X4=20; and fourth at top with second
at bottom, 3X3=9; and 20 + 9=29, which is set down,
and completes the third line. The fourth line is com

odd number given by 2; write the greater half in the top
corner on the right hand ; increase it by the given num

     Hie effect of Galvanism ore Living Animals.
   The following experiments, which are not attended
with any circumstances that can wound the feelings of
humanity, may be easily made to shew the action of
voltaic electricity on living animals.
   1. Place a living frog upon "a plate of zinc wetted
with water, and paste a slip of tin-foil, or a shilling,
also wetted with water, upon the back of a frog. If
now a communication be formed between the zinc and
the tin-foil, by means of a wire, or other piece of metal,
the frog will be violently convulsed, and jump off the
plate.
   2. Take a live flounder, and put it on a pewter plate,
or upon a large piece of zinc, wetted with water, upon
its back ; or place the fish upon its back, and1 apply
the coin to its cheek or breast, then touch the plate or
zinc with a wire, and apply the other extremity of the
wire to a piece of silver, violent contractions will be
immediately excited in the fish, which may be renewed
at pleasure by forming a connexion between the two
metals. The animal, therefore, is quiet, until a com
munication be made between the silver and the zinc, by
 means of a third metal, to the edges of the others.
 The galvanic agency then takes place, because a gal
 vanic circle is formed.
   3. Besides these effects produced by the influence on
 the muscles, the sensations which it excites in some of
the organs of sense are equally evinced in the following
 manner : place a thin plate of zinc upon the upper sur
face of the tongue, and half a crown, or piece of silver
 or tea-spoon, on the under surface. The metals ought
 to be allowed to remain for a little time in contact with
 the tongue before they are made to touch each other, that
 the taste of the metals themselves may not be con
 founded with the sensation produced by their contact.
 When the edges which project beyond the tongue are
 then made to touch, a sensation is produced which it ia
 difficult accurately to describe. It takes place suddenly,
 like a slight electrical shock, and asubacid taste .somewhat

                  ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                    13d
resembling dilute nitric acid, is perceived, confounded
with an evident metallic taste.
   4. Or place a silver tea-spoon as high as possible
between the gums and the upper lip, and a bar of zinc
between the under lip : on bringing the extremities
into contact, a very vivid sensation, resembling a flash
of light, will be perceived. It is singular, that this light
is equally vivid in the dark with the strongest light, and
whether the eyes be shut or open.
   5. Place a cup of silver, filled with water, on a plate
of zinc, standing upon a table, and touch the water
with the tip of the tongue, it will be tasteless as long as
the zinc plate is not touched, for the body does not form
a voltaic circle with the metals. Moisten well the hands,
and lay hold of the plate of zinc, whilst the tongue is
brought to touch the water, a peculiar sensation, and
an acid taste will be immediately experienced.
                    Galvanic Battery.
              (Refer to Frontispiece, Fig. 22.)
   The zinc plates are made by casting that metal
in an iron or brass mould; they may be about an
eighth of an inch thick. The copper need not exceed
twelve or fourteen ounces to the square foot, and may
be soldered to the zinc at one edge only, the other three
being secured by cement in the trough. The trough
must have as many grooves in its sides as the number
of plates it is intended to contain, which should be fewer
in proportion to their size, otherwise the apparatus
will be inconvenient from its weight. When the plates
are not more than three inches square, their number in
one trough may be fifty, and the distance of the grooves
from three- eighths to half an inch. The trough must
be made of very dry wood, and put together with white
lead or cement. The plates being placed to the fire, the
trough is to be well warmed, and placed horizontally on
a level table, with its bottom downwards, very hot ce

ment is then to be poured into it, until the bottom is co
vered to the depth of a quarter of an inch. During this
process the plates will have become warm, and they are
then to be quickly slided into the grooves and pushed
firmly to the bottom, so as to bed themselves securely
in the cement. In this way the plates are very per
fectly cemented at the bottom, and when this cement is
sufficiently cool, a slip of thin deal is to be slightly
nailed on the top edge of one of the sides of the trough^
so as to over-hang the inner surface about a quarter of
an inch. The trough being about three quarters or an
inch deeper than the diameter of the plates, there will
be an interval between their top edges and the deal
slip ; and when the side of the trough to which the slip
is attached is laid flat on the table, this interval forms
» channel into which very hot cement is to be poured,
and it will flow between each pair of plates, so as to ce
ment one side of all the cells perfectly. As soon as the
 channel is quite full of fluid cement, the strip of deal is
to be torn off, and the trough inclined so as to admit of
the superfluous cement to run out. When this is ef
fected and the cement cool, a slip of deal is to be nailed
 on the opposite side, and the same process pursued with
 that. The instrument will then be cemented in the
 most perfect manner, and it may be cleaned off and var
 nished.                                          . .. . .
Astonishing Heat ofthe Flame ofOxy-hydroits Gas.
    On projecting the flame issuing from the compound
blow-pipe, against the outside of a small tinned iron cup,
full of cold water, the outside of the cup will become
red hot, and at length assume a white heat, not only on
its outside, but within, in contact with the water ; and
in an instant afterwards the flame will break through
the side of the cup, and enter the water without being
 extinguished. The jet-pipe and flame are plunged under
water ; with due precautions, the flame will continue to
burn with undiminished energy, in actual contact with

the water, which latter, in a tumbler holding about half-
a-pint, will quickly become heated from about 56 de
grees to 170 degrees of Fahrenheit.
      Interesting Experiment on Glow-Wormi.
   Place a glow-worm within a jar of oxygen gas in a
dark room. The insect will shine with much greater
brilliancy than it does in atmospheric air. As the lumi
nous appearance depends on the will of the animal, this
experiment probably affords an instance of the stimulus
which this gas gives to the animal system.
                Inflamed Soap-bubbles.
   With a pair of bellows, half fill a bladder, having a
stop-cock, with common air, and fill the other half with
hydrogen gas : screw a brass tobacco-pipe to the stop-
dock, and dip it into a basin on soap-lather. When
the bladder is pressed, bubbles will rush out, to which
apply the flame of a candle ; and they will explode with
great violence. Let the bubbles be detached from the
bowl of the pipe, before they are inflamed, or else the
flame may rush into the pipe and burst the bladder.
                   Violet coloured Gas.
   Put three or four grains of iodine into a small test
tube, and seal the other end of the tube hermetically.
If the tube be gently warmed, by holding it over a can
dle, the iodine becomes converted into a beautiful vio
let-coloured gas, or vapour, which condenses again into
minute brilliant metalic crystals, of a blueish-black co
lour, when the tube is suffered to grow cold ; and this
experiment may be repeated with the same tube for any
number of times.

                  Lamp without Flame.
    If a heated wire of platinum be introduced into any
inflammable or explosive mixture, it will become. ig
nited, and continue so till the gas is consumed ; but in
flammation will, in most cases, only take place when
the wire becomes white hot. This experiment is easily
made by pouring a small quantity of ether into the bot
tom of a beer glass, and holding a piece of heated pla
tinum wire a little above its surface ; the wire becomes
red hot, but does not inflame the vapour of the ether
till it acquires an intense white heat.
                     Musical Flame.
   A current of hydrogen may be inflamed when issuing
from a small aperture, and if a tube of eighteen or
twenty inches in length be held over the flame, a pecu
liar musical tone is produced. This effect is not pecu
liar to hydrogen, but is produced by a variety of other
flames, and is referable to the succession of explosions
produced by the combustion of the gas in the tube. Re
ference to fig. 14, will explain the arrangement of the
apparatus.
                      Gatfor Steam.
   Sir Humphrey Davy has discovered that the applica
tion of a certain gas, fifteen times heavier than the at
mosphere, to the mechanism of a steam-engine, will
produce a power fully equal to that which now results
from the application of steam. The great obstacle winch
stands in the way of a general and immediate introduc
tion into use of this gas, is the difficulty of confining it.
The task of constructing convenient vessels, sufficiently
strong for that purpose, Sir Humphrey proposes as a
problem, the solution of which must be attended with
inestimable benefit to this country.

     Singular effect of Platina, in contact with
                      Hydrogen Gas.
    M. Dobereiner, professor of chemistry in the Univer
 sity of Jena, gives an account of a discovery of the
 greatest importance. By a series of entirely new expe
 riments, he has ascertained that platina, the heaviest of
all elementary substances, when reduced into very fine
particles, produces, by simple contact with hydrogen
gas, (the lightest of elementary substances,) an electri
cal or dynamic combination, which, if brought into con
tact with hydrogen gas or with atmospheric air, instantly
dissolves itself, yielding fire and water. To prove this
 important fact by a brilliant experiment, M. Dobereiner
 makes hydrogen pass from a reservoir, by a capil
lary tube, curved below, upon pure platina in powder,
 which is contained in a glass tunnel, hermetically sealed
 at the point, so that the gas mingles with the atmosphe
ric air before it touches the platina. The moment that
 the current of gas reaches the surface of the platina, the
 powder of that metal becomes red and burning, and this
 phenomenon continues as long as the stream of gas is
 directed upon it.

beautiful scintillations, and a greenish flame.
                         Another.

 To make Water ascend between two Pieces ofGlass,
                andform a regular Figure.
    Procure two pieces of glass, about six inches square,
 join any two of their sides, and separate the opposite
 sides with a piece of wax, so that their surfaces may
 form an angle of about two or three degrees ; immerse
 this apparatus about an inch in a basin of water, and
 the water will rise between the plates, and form a beau
 tiful geometrical figure, called an hyperbola.

advantageously used to decant wine, as the wine may be
raised from the most turbid ground without mixing
with the sediment beneath. To make this instrument
it is merely necessary to bend a glass tube by the appli
cation of heat ; and if a second tube be attached and the
air sucked out, the fluid will continue to flow as long as
any water remains in the upper vessel.
                    Hydraulic Orrery.
    A Terr curious piece of mechanism under this name
has lately been exhibited, highly deserving of scientific
notice ; not so much for its astronomical display, as for
its developement of great effects produced by very small
mechanic force ; a very small syphon, in the first in
 stance, setting the whole machine in motion, whilst new
 forces are generated by that motion, to an extent that
 may render the principle one of high importance in the
 useful arts. As an orrery, it shews, by a very ingenious
 adjustment, the exact motion of the moon through her
nodes, and the relative motions of Jupiter's moons in a
diminishing ratio of force and motion, on a very simple
principle, but which seems capable of more extensive
application.
    How to work a Pump without manual Labour.
    Captain Leslie, of the American vessel the George
and Susan, invented, in his voyage from North America
to Stockholm, the following simple method of keeping
the ship's pumps at work, when the sea runs high, and
when the crew are not sufficient, or are already fa
tigued : —About ten or twelve feet above the pump, he
fixed a spar, or small mast, one end of which projected
overboard, while the other was fastened as a lever to
the machinery of the pump. To the end which project
ed overboard, was suspended a water butt, half full. By
this simple contrivance, every coming wave, as it raised

 132             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
 the water butt sunk with it, raised the piston again ;
 and thus, without the aid of the crew, the ship was
 cleared of water in four hours time.
 Method of constructing an Hydraulic Machine
    where a Bird drinks up all the Water, that spouts
    up through a Pipe, andfalls into a Basin.
              (Refer to Frontispiece, Fig. 8.)
    Let A, B, C, be a vessel, divided into two parts
by a horizontal partition E, F; and let the upper
 cavity be divided into two parts also, by a vertical par
 tition G, H. A communication is formed between the
 upper cavity B, F, and the lower One E, C, by a tube
 L, M, which proceeds from the lower partition, and de
 scends almost to the bottom D, C : a similar communi
cation is formed between the lower cavity E, C, and the
 upper one A, 6, by the tube I, K, which, rising from
the horizontal partition E, F, proceeds nearly to the top
of A, B : a third tube, terminating at the upper extre
mity of a very small aperture, descends nearly to the
partition E, F, and passes through the centre of a basin
R, S, intended to receive the water which issues from
it. Near the edge of this basin is a bird, with its bill
immersed in it ; and through the body of the bird passes
a bent syphon Q, P, the aperture of which P is much
lower than the aperture Q. Such is the construction of
this machine, the use of which is as follows :—Fill the
two upper cavities with water through two holes, made
for the purpose, in the sides of the vessel, and Which
must be afterwards shut. The water in the cavity A, G
must not rise above the orifice K of the pipe K, I. If
the cock adapted to the pipe L, M, be then opened, the
water of the upper cavity H, F, will flow into the lower
cavity, where it will compress the air, and make it pass
through the pipe K, I, into the cavity A, G ; in this ca
vity it will compress the air which is above it, and the
air, pressing upon it, will force it to spout up through
the pipe N, O, from whence it will fall down into the
basin. But at the same time that the water flows from

                  ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                    133
  the cavity B, G into the lower one, the air will become
  rarefied in the upper part of that cavity : hence, as the
  weight of the atmosphere will act on the water, already
  poured into the basin through the orifice O of the as
  cending pipe N, O, the water will flow through the bent
  pipe Q, S, P, it(to the same cavity B, G, and this mo
  tion, when once established, will continue as long as
  there is any water in the cavity A, G.
   A Fountain, to play by the Pressure of the Air.
    To produce a fountain in vacuo, it is merely neces
 sary to exhaust a glass receiver by means of an air-
  pump, and when that is effected, to place the lower end
 of the stop-cock in a basin of water, which will be dri
 ven up in a continuous jet by the pressure of the air.
 The apparatus is represented at fig. 17.
                  The Aquatic Dancers.
    Construct two small hollow figures of enamel ; but in
 the lower part, representing the feet, leave a small hole,
 through which a drop of water can be introduced, or
 apply to the back part of each a sort of appendage in the
form of a tail, pierced at the end, so that a portion of
 water may be made to enter this tube. Then bring the
figure into equilibrium in such a manner, that with this
small drop of water, it shall keep itself upright,' and re
main suspended in the fluid. Fill the bottle with water
to the orifice, and cover it with parchment, which must
be closely tied round the neck, see fig. 23. To put the
figures in motion, press the parchment over the orifice
with your finger, and the figures will descend, remove
your finger they will rise ; apply and remove your fingers
alternately, the figures will be agitated in the middle of
the fluid, in such a manner, as to excite the astonish
ment of those unacquainted with the cause.

134              ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
                  Gallileo's Experiment.
   This distinguished philosopher constructed the appa
ratus (6g. 15) by which he was enabled to resist the ac
tion often strong coach-horses. The two hemispheres
A and B are made to fit air-tight, and a stop-cock C be
ing applied to the lower hemisphere, the air may be
readily withdrawn by the action of an air-pump. When
a vacuum is produced, the stop-cock should be turned,
and they will be held together with a force proportion
ed to the area of the hemispheres.
                   Feather and Guinea.
   It is sometimes imagined that mass for mass, a pound
of gold would be heavier than a pound of feathers ;
and hence the paradoxical experiment of "which is
heaviest .'" And yet we may place a guinea and fea
ther under such circumstances that they will both arrive
at the ground at the same instant of time when dis
charged from a proper apparatus. Fig. 19 shews the
glass receiver and plate of the air-pump by which the
air must be withdrawn, and it will then be seen, that
it is the air alone which makes the difference in their de
scent.
                    The Shower of Fire.
   Place on the top of the air-pump a small circular
plate, pierced with holes, and supporting a small cylin-
dric receiver, terminating in a hemisphere, and cover
the whole with a larger receiver, having a hole in its
 summit, to admit a glass funnel filled with mercury.
The funnel must shut with a stopper, so as to open
 when necessary. Then exhaust the air from the re
ceiver, and open the funnel which contains the mer
cury, which will run down, and falling on the convex
 summit of the interior receiver, will be thrown up in
 small luminous drops, so as to resembles shower of fire.

                     The Air Pump.
   Having had occasion to speak of the air-pump, it
may be advisable to describe the way in which it is usu
ally constructed. Fig. 20 represents the cheapest form,
and in its action it exactly resembles the common suck
ing-pump—with this difference, that the valves are made
of moistened bladder instead of leather.
  The Made of Constructing and Filling Balloons.
   The best forms for balloons, are those of a globe,
and an egg-like figure. Fire-balloons, or those raised
by heated air, if very large, may be made of linen, or
silk, and must be open at bottom, having a hoop round
the opening, from which is suspended the grate for the
fuel, which is best of straw, or other light combustibles.
Small balloons of this kind may be made oftissue paper,
having a wire round the bottom. Two cross wires
may support in the centre of the opening a little cup,
with some cotton and spirits of wine, the flame of which
 will rarefy the air, and raise the machine. Large bal
 loons for inflammable air, must be made of silk, and
 varnished over, so as to be air-tight. To the upper part
 of the balloon there should be fitted a valve, opening
 inwards, to which a string should be fastened, passing
 through a hole made in a small piece of wood, fixed in
 the lower part of the balloon ; so that the aeronaut may
 open the valve when he wishes to descend. The action
 of the valve is effected by a round brass plate, having a
 hole about two or three inches diameter, covered on
 both sides with strong smooth leather : on the inside
 there is a shutter of brass, covered also with leather,
 which serves to close the hole ; it is fastened to the lea
 ther of the plate, and kept against the hole by a spring.
 To the lower part of the balloon a pipe is fixed, made of
 the same materials with the balloon, which serves to fill
 it by. The car, or boat, is made of wicker work, co
 vered with leather, and well varnished, or painted, and
 is suspended by ropes proceeding from the net, which
 goes over the balloon. This netting should cover the

136               ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
upper part, and come down to the middle, with various
cords proceeding from it to the circumference of a cir
cle, about two feet below the balloon. From that
circle other ropes go to the edge of the boat. This
circle may be made of wood, or of several pieces
of slender cane bound together. The meshes of the
net should be small at top (against which part of
the balloon the inflammable air exerts the greatest
force) and increase in size as they recede from the top.
The inflammable air for filling the balloon, is procured
by putting a quantity of iron-filings, or turnings, with
some oil of vitriol diluted with water, into casks lined
with lead. From the top of these casks tin tubes pro
ceed which unite into one that is connected with the
silk tube of the balloon. Balloons cannot be made
smaller than six feet in diameter, of oiled silk, as the
weight of the material is too great for the air to buoy
it up. They may be made smaller, of thin strips of
bladder, or other membrane, glued together. The best
for this purpose is the allantois of a calf, which is the
membrane inclosing the foetus in the womb. With this
they may be made eighteen inches in diameter. Fig. 1
represents the present improved form of the hydrogen
gas balloon ; and fig. 2 that of the parachute employed
by M. Garnerin.
                  Atmospheric Engine.
   A curious apparatus, tending to illustrate some of the
largest steam-engines, may be constructed by reference
to the diagram fig. 9. The tube a, furnished with a
bulb 4, is first heated with a spirit lamp, and as soon as
the air is expelled by the formation of steam, the piston-
rod c may be introduced. On withdrawing the flame
the steam will rapidly condense, and the pressure of the
air above the piston being unbalanced by any resistance
beneath it, will immediately be driven to the bottom of
the tube. Should the piston be but three inches in dia
meter, it will be driven down with a force equal to about
one hundred pounds.

          The Hydro-pneumatic Apparatus.
   Consists of a japanned iron or copper vessel, of dif
ferent shape and size according to the particular pur
poses for which it is intended, and containing a shelf
perforated with holes through which the gas may pass
into inverted vessels properly placed for its reception.
Fig. 13, letter A represents the hydropneumatic trough :
B, B, inverted glasses for the reception of gas; C, a
wrought-iron tube placed in a pan of charcoal for the
evolution of gases requiring a red heat ; and D, a retort
heated by the spirit-lamp E.
              Pressure of the Atmosphere.
   The great force with which the air that surround us
presses upon the earth's surface may be shewn by a very
simple experiment. Take a glass tube, fig. 18, and af
ter tying a wet bladder over one of the ends, expose it
to the action of the air-pump. The pressure of the super
incumbent atmosphere will speedily crush the bladder
with a very loud report.
      Fffeet ofthe Air respiredfrom the Lungs.
   Half fill a wine glass with fresh prepared lime water,
or barytic water, and breathe into the fluid for a few
minutes, by means of a tobacco pipe or glass tube, air
from the lungs. The lime water will speedily become
turbid, and a white precipitate fall to the bottom of the
glass.
  To exhibit the Effect of the Magnetic Fluid by
                 by means of a Balance.
   Suspend a magnet in one of the scales of a delicate
balance, and counterpoise it by putting weights into the
other scale ; when thus adjusted, hold a piece of iron
under the magnet, and the scale to which it is attached
                            M 2

 133             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
will instantly descend. If a piece of iron be suspended
from the scale instead of the magnet, and the magnet
then held under the iron, the scale to which it is attach
ed will descend in the same manner as the magnet did
before.
   To suspend a Needle in the Air by means of tie
                     Magnetic Fluid.
   Place a magnet on a stand to raise it a little above the
table, then bring a small sewing-needle, containing a
thread, within a little of the magnet, keeping hold of the
thread to prevent the needle from attaching itself to the
magnet. The needle, in endeavouring to fly to the mag
net, and being prevented by the thread, will remain cu
riously suspended in the air.
                  The Learned Swan,
   Have a large marble or china howl, painted inside the
rim with the letters of the alphabet: a small swan, in
which is concealed a steel or iron pin, is set to swim in
the bowl, and on being desired, will select any letters,
say those which compose your name—to effect this, the
performer of the trick must have a magnet in his pocket,
by means of which, as he mores round the table, the
swan will be attracted to every letter at which it is re
quired to stop.
                    Concealed Money,
   May be discovered by means of the magnetic com
pass, if it be previously loaded with a touched needle.
This may be effected by boring a hole in the edge of the
money, and having driven in the needle, let the hole be
filled with a bit of pewter, or silver, to hide the head of
it. Next take a needle that is balanced on a pivot, in
the same manner as the mariner's compass, and this
will turn towards the needle inclosed in the money.

                ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                     139
Desire any person to lend you a crown, or other piece of
money, and having dexterously changed it, let him, at
his option, secretly place the piece in a snuff-box, or
not, as he thinks lit, and it then becomes your task to
say whether he has or has not done so, without touch
ing the box. Your own compass, or needle upon a pi
vot, enables you to do this, by placing it near the box :
if the needle maintains its northerly direction, unaltera
bly, be assured the money is not contained in the box,
unless the north-pole of the needle, (which lies bid
within the money) happens to be placed in a northerly
direction—a thing not very likely to happen. However,
to be quite sure, find fault with the position of the snuff
box—contrive to move it—and if the needle does not
vibrate one way or other, the loaded money is not in the
box. Two points remain, upon which you may deceive
yourself, viz. first, your needle must be very sensible, or
the influence will be too inconsiderable to effect any
change in it ; second, take good care that your adver
sary (or person acted upon) does not change your piece
for another, and thus defeat the accomplishment of your
purpose.
            To find the Poles ofa Magnet.
    Immerse a magnet in iron filings, and when drawn out,
it will be found covered all over with them ; but it will
be observed that there are two places, diametrically op
posite to each other, which are the poles, where the fil
ings are closer, and where the small oblong fragments
stand as it were upright, while in other parts they lie
flat.
                       Another Way.
   Inclose a small needle in a glass ball, then move it
over a magnetic bar, and the needle will be found to
stand perpendicular to the bar, when it is over either of
the poles of the magnet.

140             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
 To shew the effect of the Magnetic Poke on each
                          other.
   Fix two touched needles horizontally on two separate
pieces of cork floating in water ; then place the pieces
of cork beside each other, the needle bemg in a parallel
position, with the poles of the same name together,
(north or south) and they will mutually repel each
other ; but if the poles of contrary name be placed to
gether, they will each other still nearer.
   To ascertain the course of the Magnetic Fluid
     from one Pole of the Magnet to the other.
   Place a pane of glass, covered with writing, over a
magnetic bar, and strew a few steel filings on the paper :
on striking the glass gently the filings will dispose
themselves in such a manner as to represent the exact
course of the magnetic fluid.
                 The Magnetical Table.
   Under the top of a common table, place a magnet
that turns on a pivot, fix a board to cover it, so that it
may not be discovered. At one end of the table, secretly
place a pin, that communicates with the magnet, and by
which it may be placed in several different positions.
Strew some steel filings, or very small nails, over that
part of the table where the magnet is, and requesting
the loan of a knife or key, apply it to the filings, and it
will have the same effect on the larger ends of these as
a magnet would. Then placing your hand as if care
lessly on the pin at the bottom of the table, alter the po
sition of the magnet, and giving the key or knife to any
one you would disappoint, he will be unable to perform
the experiment as you have done ; changing the pin's
influence again, you may shew that you have these
things at command.

   If a metal plate be attached to the prime conductor of
the electrical machine, and a similar plate be supported
by a foot beneath, small figures, made of pith (Jr paper,
will readily leap from the one to the other continuously ;
and to effect this amusing dance, it will only be neces
sary to turn the cylinder of the electrical machine ra

                  The Electrifying Cane.
   Charge a glass rod, by holding it in a perpendicular
position, the head touching either of the conductors of
an electrical machine, so that the sliding wire may be
against the head ; when it is charged, it may be used as
a cane (only remember it is glass), with being entirely
discharged, for the space of a whole day : if you meet a
friend whom you wish to surprise, offer your hand, as
if you only intended to shake hands with him, hold
your cane so that the sliding wire may fall to the head,
and touch his leg with it, your friend will be surprised
by an electrical shock. If the cane should not con
tain the charge long enough, take the head off, let the
sliding wire fall out, and clean the inside of the small
tube with a piecti of cotton or leather tied to one end of
the wire.
                       Electric Eel.
   An elecric eel (gymnotus electricus) was lately brought
to Paris from America, and, in trying upon it the expe
riments of M. Humboldt, a very singular occurrence
took place. Several naturalists had already subjected
themselves to electric shocks, more or less violent, by
touching the fish, which is of the size of a large eel,
when Dr. Janin de Saint Jusk seized it with both his
hands, and was rewarded with a succession of shocks
more severe than' Volta's pile would have given. In
deed, he was exposed to real danger, in consequence of

 142            ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
 finding it impossible to loose his hold of the animal,
 notwithstanding its every motion agitated his whole
 frame to an excessive degree. An involuntary contrac
 tion forced him to grasp it with supernatural strength,
 and the more he grasped, the more dreadful did the
 electrical shocks become. They extorted from him the
 most agonizing cries, which alarmed all present, who
 were even afraid for his life, as it is probable, had he
 continued long in the situation, that death must have
 ensued. Happily it occurred to him, to replunge the eel
 into its tube, and scarcely were his hands wetted, when
 the contact of the water (acting as a conductor) enabled
 him to let his enemy slip.
                   The Electrical Star.
   Introduce the blunt end of a wire, furnished with pro
jecting points, into the hole of the prime conductor ;
turn the machine, and the flames of electricity will fly
from each point resembling a star. If it is turned round
upon its centre, the flames will appear as one continued
circle of fire.
                  The Electrical Coin.
   Let a person, standing upon the insulated stool, take
a piece of money between his teeth ; and if a person,
standing upon the ground, touch it, the spark will be so
painful to the person who holds the money, that he
seldom fails to let it drop, provided his lips do not touch
it at the same time.
                   The Leyden Phial.
    The Leyden phial (see fig. 25.) consists of a thin glass
jar, coated internally and externally with tinfoil, to
within a short distance of its mouth. When the inner
surface is rendered positive by union with the conductor
of the electrical machine, the exterior, being connected

                 ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                     143
with the ground, becomes negative by induction. When
the inner and outer surfaces are united by a conductor,
all electrical accumulation is annihilated by a powerful
spark, and the two opposite states are found to have
been precisely equivalent. If tha communication be
tween the opposite surfaces of the Leyden phial be made
by the bands, a painful jarring sensation is felt at the
joints of the fingers, the elbows, shoulders, and chest,
commonly called the electrical shock. Metallic wires,
with balls at their ends, bent, or jointed and fixed to a
glass handle, are generally used to transfer the electric
charge, and these instruments are called dischargers.

                   Electrical Machine.
   The best electrical machine for experimental pur
poses is represented at fig. 29. It consists of a glass
cylinder, A, about ten or twelve inches in diameter,
and fifteen or twenty inches In length, turning
between two upright pieces of wood, fixed to a
stout mahogany base. Two smooth metal conductors,
equal in length to the cylinder, and about one-third of
its diameter, are placed parallel to it upon two glass pil
lars B B, wbich are cemented into two sliding pieces of
wood, by which their distance from the cylinder may be
adjusted. One of the conductors has a cushion, F, at
tached to it by a bent metallic spring, nearly as long as
the cylinder, and about one inch, or an inch and half
wide, to the upper part of which is sewed a flap of oil-
silk, which should reach from the cushion over the up
per surface of the glass cylinder, to within about an inch
of a row of points attached to the side of the opposite
conductor. The conductor to which the cushion is at
tached, is called the negative conductor ; the other col

144              ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
lects the electricity of the glass, and is called the posi
tive conductor. H, is an adjusting screw to regulate
the pressure of the cushion upon the cylinder. The
motion of the cylinder is in the direction of the silk
flap, and may be communicated by a handle attached
at I. To put this electrical machine into good action,
every part should be made perfectly clean and dry. The
cushion is then anointed with amalgam, and applied by
a gentle pressure to the cylinder. If positive electricity
is required, it may be received from the conductor bear
ing the points, that supporting the cushion being unin
sulated by a wire passing from it to the stand ; if, on the
contrary, negative electricity is required, it may be ob
tained from the insulated cushion cylinder, the other

                 Electrical Air Cannon.
    Hydrogen is inflammable, and extinguishes flame.
 When pure, it burns quietly with a lambent blue flame
 at the surface, in contact with air ; but, if mixed with
 thrice its volume of air, it burns rapidly, and with deto
 nation. In making this experiment, a strong phial, ca
 pable of holding about six ounces of water, may be em
 ployed ; or the inflammable air cannon, which admits of
 the mixture being fired by the electric spark. This in
 strument, for a representation of which refer to fig. 4,
 consists of a cylinder of brass, about three-fourths of an
 inch diameter, and six inches long, in the form of a
 3mall cannon or pistol-barrel, properly mounted, and
 having a wire, A, passing through a tube of ivory, B,
 and not quite touching the interior of the cylinder, at
 the part usually occupied by the touch-hole, an electric
  spark communicated to this wire inflames the mixture
 of hydrogen and atmospheric air in its interior. It may
 be charged by previously filling it with dry sand, and
 emptying it out into a phial of hydrogen, which rises
 into the gun sufficiently mixed with air ; the muzzle
 may be secured by a cork, which is expelled with much
 violence and a loud report, upon the inflammation of.
 the gas.

                     Thunder House.
   This interesting piece of electrical apparatus is shewn
at fig. 21. A is a rod intended to represent a thunder
cloud, and furnished with a ball at B. On charging the
Leyden jar C, a small brick is readily driven from the
building, by the shock which follows the discharge. If
the ball be withdrawn, the advantage of a pointed
lightning rod will then become apparent, as the brick
will not be driven out by the explosion, but quietly pass
down to the ground.
    Method of receiving the Electrical Shockfrom
                           a Cat.
    Place the left hand under the throat, with the middle
fmger and thumb slightly pressing the bones of the ani
mal's shoulder, then gently passing the right hand along
the back, sensible electrical shocks will be felt in the
 left hand, and very distinct discharges may be obtained
by touching the tips of the ears, after applying friction
 to the back : the same may be obtained from the foot.
            Another Electrical Experiment.
    Place a thin piece of tin-foil vertically, between two
horizontal and insulated rods of brass, each terminated
by a knob, and distant from each other between one and
two inches, then pass from one to the other a strong
charge of a large electrical battery : the plate of tin will
be found pierced by two holes, with their burs in oppo
site directions. That the experiment may succeed, the
tin-foil should be thin, and the charge strong, otherwise
only two impressions will be seen on the plate.
             Electric Magnetic Experiment.
    A truly singular experiment has been repeated in the
Academy of Sciences, with complete success, for the

146              ENDLESS AMUSEMENT
purpose of demonstrating the influence of galvanic or
rather voltaic electricity, on the magnetic needle. If the
wire, made to communicate with the two poles of the
pile of volta, is held over the needle at a small distance,
and in a situation parallel to its direction, the needle in
stantly quits the magnetic meridian, where it is sup
posed to have remained in equilibrium and at rest. This
deviation may extend to 45. If you place the wire be
low the needle, a similar deviation is observed, but in a
contrary direction, that is from north to east, if the first
has been from north to west, and vice versa.
  To exhibit Electrical Attraction on a Number of
                      Objects at once.
   Take a dry glass tumbler, and hold it over a brass
wire fixed in the prime conductor of an electrical ma
chine: the tumbler will soon become electrified; and
if, in this state, it be inverted over a number of pith
balls placed on a table, they will all leap and dance
about in the tumbler for a considerable time ; first re
ceiving electricity from the sides of the tumbler, and
then imparting it to the table.
                        Voltaic Pile.
    The voltaic pile was invented towards the close of the
 last century, and since that period, the science of Vol
 taic electricity has done more towards the progress of
 chemical research, than any other apparatus yet disco
 vered. The voltaic pile, fig. 24, consists of a series of
 plates composed of zinc and copper, in alternate layers :
 it is found that when a pile is thus raised, each alternate
 pair of plates being separated by a piece of moistened
 flannel, that smart shocks will be received by any per
 son who may make a communication between the top
 and bottom of the pile. An electrical arrangement of
 this kind usually consists of about fifty pair of plates.

  To illuminate a Piece of Sugar by an Electrical
                       Explosion.
   Place a piece of sugar on the top of a Leyden jar,
and bring the discharging rod in contact with it,
so that an explosion will take place ; if the room be
darkened, the light will be seen upon its surface; con
tinuing some time after the explosion. If chalk be
used, it will also retain the light after the explosion,
which will be of a different colour.
                 The Electrical Kit:
   A lady may challenge any gentleman, not acquainted
with the experiment, that he will not be able to kiss her,
although she may incline to meet him. If he accepts
the challenge, and the machine turn while they are in
clining their heads to kiss each other, provided their
clothes do not touch before their lips meet, a spark of
fire will fly from the lady to the gentleman, which will
be sure to make him draw back, without accomplishing
his design.
    To kill an Animal by means of Electricity.
   Affix the chain which communicates with the outside
of the battery, to one of the animal's feet ; and then
with the discharging rod, form a communication be

municates with the inside ; the animal (even an ox) will
be struck dead.
                      Diving Bell.
   The mode of constructing a diving bell may readily
be shewn.—Fig. 7, represents one of the most improv
ed form ; and it has been selected from the facility with
which an apparatus of this description may be con
structed on a small scale. If a tall vessel of water be

 148             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
 employed, the bell A may be lowered, and combustion
 supported as long as oxygen gas is driven down by the
 forcing pump B.
    Descent in a Diving Bell, curefor Deufness.
   From observations which have recently been made it
 has been suggested, that in cases of deafness, where the
disorder is occasioned by the eustrachian tube being
stopped up, the patient might be cured by descending
in a diving bell. Dr. Hamel, who descended in one at
Howth, in the vicinity of Dublin, informs us that he
suffered, during his re-ascent, a violent sensation of
pain within his ear, in consequence of the expansion of
air in the exterior cavities; yet, as the air escaped much,
easier than it entered, owing to the nearly conical form
of that duct, he felt at almost every foot of his ascentan
air bubble, that passed from his ear into his mouth, and
each time afforded him considerable relief. The orifice
which connects the eustrachian tube with the mouth,
forms a kind of valve ; it is therefore exceedingly diffi
cult to admit a passage here to the atmospheric air ; but
within a diving bell this is effected merely by swallow
ing the saliva ; and occasionally a violent report is
heard nearly like that of a pistol, which is immediately
succeeded by a cessation of the pain.
          New method of Congealing Water.
' Mr. T. Grothus gives the following account of his in
teresting experiment on this subject : into a* metal vase
half filled with water, I poured very gently au equal
quantity of ether, so that no mixture might take place
in the two liquids. The vase was placed under the re
ceiver of an air-pump, which was so fixed upon its sup
port, as to remain quite steady when the air was pump
ed out. At the first stroke of the piston, the ether be
came in a state of ebullition, it was evaporated totally
in less than a minute, and the water remained, convert

            Shortening Ropes by wetting them.
    Ifwe suspend perpendicularly a rope ten or twelve
  feet long, and affix to its lower extremity a heavy
  weight to stretch it as much as possible ; the rope,
 when wetted, will be shortened ; and if its length be
 such only as to allow the weight to touch the ground,
 the weight will be raised from the ground when the
  rope is wetted with water.
      To cause a Stone to be in perpetual Motion.
    Put very small filings of iron into aqua-fortis, and
 let them remain there until the water take off the iron
 requisite, which it will do in seven or eight hours. Then
 take the water and put it into a phial an inch wide, with
 a large mouth, and put in a stone of lapis calaminaries,
 and stop it up close ; the stone will then keep in perpe
 tual motion.
                Barometical Automaton.
    The principles on which this small, curious baro
 meter is constructed, have been explained at p. 133 ;
 for, since the pressure of the finger on the water, which
 contains the small figures, makes it descend, and as it
rises again when the pressure is removed, it may be ima
gined that the weight of the atmosphere must produce
the same effect. Hence, if the small figure be equipois
ed in such a manner as to remain suspended during va
riable weather, it will sink to the bottom when the wea
ther is fine, because the weight of the atmosphere is
then more considerable. The contrary will be the case
when it threatens rain, and when the mercury in the ba
rometer falls ; for the weight of the atmosphere, which

rests on the orifice of the bottle, being lessened, the
small figure must of course rise.
           .... A simple Barometer.
   Take a common phial bottle, and cut off the rim and
part of the neck. This may be done by a piece of string,
or rather whipcord, twisted round it, and pulled strongly
in a sawing position by two persons ; one of whom holds
the bottle firmly in his left hand. Heated in a few mi
nutes by the friction of the string, and then dipped sud
denly into cold water, the bottle will be decapitated
more easily than by any other means. Let the phial be
now nearly filled with common pump-water, and, apply
ing the finger to its mouth, turn it quickly upside down :
on removing the finger, it will be found that only a few
drops will escape. Without cork or stopper of any kind,
the water will be retained within the bottle by the pres
sure of the external air ; the weight of air without the
phial being so much greater than that of the small quan
tity within it. Now let a bit of tape be tied round the
middle of the bottle, to which the two ends of a string
may be attached, so as to form a loop to hang on a nail :
let it be thus suspended, in a perpendicular manner, with
the mouth downwards ; and this is the barometer. When
the weather is fair, and inclined to be so, the water will
be level with the section of the neck, or rather elevated
above it, and forming a concave surface. When dis
posed to be wet, a drop will appear at the mouth, which
will enlarge till it falls, and then another drop, while
the humidity of the atmosphere continues.
                New Compound of Iodine.
   Heat an ounce of iodine, with a little water, on a sand
bath, and add to it, by degrees, about two ounces of
potash, when the two salts above mentioned will be form
ed. In order to saturate the excess of alkali, pour in,
by degrees, a tincture composed of one ounce of iodine

                    ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                   151
  to six ounces of alcohol, specific gravity 837. When
  the re-action of the tincture on the potash is finished,
  pour the hot liquor on a filter, and the liquid which
  passes through will, as it cools, deposit"yellov? crystals,
  of the substance; they should be carefully washed in
  cold water, to remove all the iodatc and hydriodate of
  potash. Another method is, to take the alcoholic solution
  of the two salts, prepared as above, and distil it; and
  when- the fluid which comes over ceases to be coloured,
  to change the receiver ; the colourless liquor then ob
  tained, upon cooling, deposits very pure crystals, of the
  subtance in question. If the distillation be suspended
   from time to time, and the retort allowed to cool, beau
  tiful crystals of the substance form in it. If strong al
  cohol be used in the above operations, and but little wa
  ter, then, upon adding water to the filtered liquor, the
  substance is precipitated in abundance. This substance
  is solid, of a lemon yellow colour, tastes like nitric
  ether, and has an odour like that of saffron. Its form
  is a compressed hexahedron (esaedro schiacciato) . It is
  insoluble in water, alkalies, or acids, but soluble in al
  cohol and ether. It fuses and sublimes by a gentle heat,
  but at a higher temperature becomes discoloured, is
  decomposed, and evolves vapours of iodine, leaving be
  hind a mere trace of carbon.
    Vegetation in Atmospheres of different Densities.
     The following experiments have been made by pro
  fessor Dobereiner, of Jena :—Two glass vessels were
  procured, each of the capacity of 320 cubic inches, two
  portions of barley were sown in portions of the same
  earth, and moistened in the same degree, and then
  placed one in each vessel. The air was now exhausted
s in one, till reduced to the pressure of fourteen inches of
  mercury, and condensed in the other, until the pressure
  equalled fifty-six inches. Germination took place in
  both, nearly at the same time, and the leaflets appeared
  of the same green tint ; but at the end of fifteen days the
  following differences existed :—The shoots in the rare

 fied air were six inches in length, and from nine to ten
inches in the condensed air. The first were expanded
and soft ; the last rolled round the stem and solid. The
first were wet on their surface, and especially towards
the extremities ; the last were nearly dry.
       To break a Stone with a Blow of the Fist.
    Select two stones from three to six inches long, and
about half as thick; lay one flat on the ground, on
which place one end of the other, raising the reverse
end to an angle of forty-fire degrees, and just over the
centre of the stone (with which it must form a T,) sup
porting it in that position by a piece of thin twig or
stick, one, or one and a half inch long ; if the raised
stone be now smartly struck about the centre, with the
little finger side of the fist, the stick will give way,
and the stone will be broken to pieces : the stones must
be laid so as not to slip, otherwise the experiment will
fail.
                The Mercurial Mallet.
   To construct the water mallet, provide a long glass
flask, pretty strong, and terminating in a neck that can
be hermetically sealed ; fill one-fourth or one-fifth of it
with water ; exhaust the air from it by means of an air
pump, and then close the mouth of the flask hermeti
cally. When the flask is taken out , if you fuse the neck
of it gently at an enameller's lamp, in order to shut it
more securely, the instrument will be completed : and
when the water in it is shaken, it strikes it with a noise,
like that occasioned by a blow of a mallet. If mercury
be inclosed in the flask, instead of water, it will make a
much greater noise, or smarter blow ; you will be asto
nished that it does not break the flask. If the mercury
be well purified, it will be luminous ; so that when made
to run from one end to the other, a beautiful stream of
light will be seen in the dark.

  To boil Water by the application of a Cold Fluid.
   The following apparently paradoxical experiment, il
lustrates the influence of diminished pressure in facili
tating ehullition. Insert a stop-cock securely into the
neck of a Florence flask, containing a little water, and
heat it over a lamp till the water boils, and the steam
freely escapes by the open stop-cock ; then suddenly re
move the lamp and close the cock. The water will soon
cease to boil ; but if plunged into a vessel of cold water,
ebullition instantly recommences, but ceases, if the
flask be held near the fire : the vacuum, in this case,
being produced by the condensation of steam.
      To take a Shilling out of a Handkerchief.
   Yon must have a curtain-ring, the size of a shilling.
At first, you put the shilling into the handkerchief ; but
when you take it out to shew there is no deception, you
slip the ring into its stead, and while the person is
eagerly holding the handkerchief, and the company's
eyes are fixed upon the form of the shilling, you seize
the opportunity of conveying it secretly away. When
you have possession of the handkerchief again, you slip
away the curtain ring.
               Atar (or Otto) of Roses.
   This precious essence is easily obtained, provided the
material is supplied in quantities sufficient for the pur
pose. One hundred weight of roses generally yield
from two to three ounces of atar. The roses, with their
calyxes, are to be immersed in double their weight of wa
ter, and to be distilled by a very gentle heat, from which
will be obtained a strongly-scented rose wine. This to
be cooled as quickly as possible, by the night air, and
the globular particles found upon its surface are to be
carefully gathered the next morning, which are more or
less abundant, ' according to the quality of the roses.

 154            ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
It is said that a peculiar fragrant grass is employed
abroad, along with the roses, besides other odorous ve
getable substances ; but although the quantity of essence
is thereby increased, its quality is considered to be de
teriorated. After the atar has been gathered, the rose-
water that remains is powerfully scented. There is no
necessity for distilling the roses immediately after they
are gathered, as that may be inconvenient, particularly
on account of the heat of the weather when the flower is
produced. Rose leaves, as well as other flowers capa
ble of affording fragrant essential oils, may be preserv
ed for a long period, without losing any of their odour
by being well rubbed and mixed into a paste with com
mon salt. It is even said that the quantity of oil
and water is greatly increased by the salting process,
which is indeed very probable. The proportion of salt
is one pound to three pounds of leaves. The flowers
being bruised by the friction of the grains of salt forms
a paste, which is to be preserved in an earthen jar form
water-tight barrel; continuing the process uniformly
until the barrel or jar is filled, which may be kept in a
cool place for several years, without impairing its fla
vour or strength. This aromatic paste may be distilled
at any season of the year, mixing it with about twice its
weight of water before it is put into the still.
Method of Reading the Inscriptions on Coins and
                 Medah in the Dark.
   During the experiments on the revival of the inscrip
tions on coins by unequal oxidation, mentioned in the
first number of the Edinburgh Journal of Science, Dr.
Brewster had occasion to expose to a high degree of
heat, a coin on which the inscription had been rendered
black by oxidation. Upon taking the coin, while in a
state of bright red heat, into a dark room, Dr. B. was
surprised to observe that the letters of the inscription
were more luminous than the rest of the coin, in conse
quence of their oxidated surface radiating the red light
more copiously than the other parts. Though the effect

                 ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                     156
in this case was not sufficiently striking to make the in
scription legible.'it occurred to Dr. B. that if, by the ac
tion of an acid or any mechanical means, the general
surface of the coin could be made rough or have its po
lished removed, while the raised points which constitu
ted the inscription and the figures were polished, an ef
fect opposite to that in the preceding experiment should
be produced. He accordingly took a French shilling of
Louis XV. and having roughened the depressed parts
of the surface, and heightened the polish of the inscrip
tion, he placed it upon a red-hot mass of iron, and re
moved it into a dark room. When the shilling began
to radiate light, the inscription Benediclum Sit Nornen
Dei appeared in obscure letters, while the ground on
which they stood shone with a bi illiant light. By polish
ing the depressed parts of the surface and roughening the
letters, Dr. B. obtained, as might have been expected,
the opposite effect, the inscriptions being now legible,
from it throwing off more light than the surrounding sur
face. In order to perform this experiment with most
success, it is desirable to conceal from the observer's eye
the mass of red hot iron on which the coin is placed.
                       Indelible Ink.
   Dr. Maculloch recommends bistre as an indelible ink.
Bistre consists chiefly of charcoal and hydrogen, and is
analogous to the bitumens. It is most conveniently
procured from destructive distillation of wood ; and can
be obtained gratis, and in any quantities, from the
distillers of charcoal, from the gunpowder manufac
tories, and from the manufacturers of new vinegar.
Thus obtained, it is a liquid resembling common tar in
consistence. On being subjected to evaporation or dis
tillation, it gives out an essential oil, and ultimately be
comes a powder ; in a hard state it is the bistre of the
artists. It is soluble in the pure alkalies, both potash
and soda. The combination with potash remains liquid,
if not too far evaporated ; that with soda gelatinizes.
The process is very simple, consisting merely in boil

ing the bistre in the alkaline solutions, taking care that
they are fully saturated. In this state it becomes an inde
lible ink, and remains unchanged in a bottle, never
changing its colour like common ink. It flows freely
through the pen, and can be used to write as rapidly as
ordinary ink. It is so incapable of change as to resist
even oxymuriate acid gas ; nor is it affected by exposure
to damp. One of its chief defects is its colour, which
is not black but brown. This solution of bistre is also
well adapted for water-colour painting.
  A method oftaking Casts of Leaves and Foliage.
   The leaf as soon as convenient after being gathered,
is to be laid on fme-grained moist sand in a perfectly
natural position, having that surface uppermost which is
to forms the cast, and being banked up by the sand, in
order that it may be perfectly supported. It is then, by
means of a broad camel-hair brush, to be 'covered over
with a thin coating of wax and Burgundy pitch, rendered
fluid by heat. The leaf being now removed from the
sand and dipped in cold water, the wax becomes hard,
and at the same time sufficiently tough to allow the leaf
to be ripped off without altering its form. This being
done, the wax mould is placed on moist sand, and
banked up as the leaf itself was, it is then covered with
plaster of Paris made thin, care being taken that the
plaster is accurately forced into all the interstices of the
mould by means of a camel-hair brush. As soon as the
plaster has set, the warmth thus produced softens the
wax, which in consequence of the moisture of the plas
ter is prevented from adhering thereto, and with a little
dexterity it may be rolled up, parting completely from
the cast, without injuring it in the smallest degree.
 Casts thus obtained are very perfect, having a high re
lief, and are excellent models either for the draughts
man or for the moulder of architectural ornaments.

                    River Spectacles.
   This useful instrument is a tube which may be varied
 in length as occasion requires. The diameter at top,
 where the eye is applied, is about an inch. There is a
gradual enlargement of tube to the centre, where the di
ameter is ten times that ofthe other extremity. There is
a glass at each end. The tube is intended to examine the
bottoms of rivers, lakes, &c. The great reason why we
cannot see with the naked eye through the water, is the
effect of reflection and refraction at the moment light
falls on the surface. This glass overcomes the difficulty
of transporting the sight as it were to the dense centre
of the water, where it takes advantage of the light in
the water, and it is carried in a straight line, as it is ia
the air. To make use of this apparatus during the night,
lights are placed all round the centre of the cylinder,
which are shorter as they descend to the base of the
tube. These lights throw a strong light around, and
enable the inspector to see distinctly the bottom of the
river.

   Mr.Ternminck, director of the Dutch Museum, has,

effectual than either camphor or Russia leather.

     Dissolve a small quantity of isinglass, and dilute it
  with warm water, till so thin that when spread upon
  paper, and dry, it shall be free from those sparkling
 particles which never fail to appear, if too thick. Take
 a broad flat camel-hair pencil, set in tin, and fill it
 plentifully with the solution, and draw it slightly over
 the work intended to be fixed, once or twice, or accord
 ing as the size of the picture may require : it must be
 very carefully done, to prevent disturbing the sharpness
 of the pencil work : when dry, it will be found to resist
 the effect of Indian rubber. It is advantageous to
 sponge the back of the paper or Bristol-board before
 applying the solution, in order that the paper may dry
 level, as it is apt to contract round the edges when only
 one side is wet. If there be a margin round the draw
 ing, it is not requisite to Sponge the back.
                  The Philosophical Phial
    Is a small vessel of glass, which has been suddenly
 cooled,open at the upper end, and rounded at the bottom.
 It is made so thick at the bottom, that it will bear a
 smart blow against a hard body without breaking : but
if a little pebble, or piece of flint, is let fall into it, it
immediately cracks, and the bottom falls into pieces :
but unless the pebble or flint is large and angular
enough to scratch the surface of the glass, it will not
break.
                 Blue Iris, a Test colour.
    Professor Ormstead recommends the tincture of the
petals of the garden iris, or blue lily, as superior to
every other test liquor known. It is reddened as litmus

is, by blowing through it, or by a stream of carbonic
acid gas. It is more convenient than violets, from the
abundance of colouring matter contained in the petals :
and it is said to be superior to red cabbage tincture, as
well from its permanency as its delicacy. Of the
former cause of superiority there may be doubts. This
application of the petals of the blue iris has long been
known to us ; by rubbing them upon paper, we form a
very convenient test either for acids or alkalies.

            Imitation of Mother-of- Pearl.
   The imitation of mother-of-pearl is produced by a
preparation of sea-shells, reduced to powder, and form
ed into a paste. The Chinese are said to form their
imitations of mother-of-pearl from rice glue, which is
nothing more than rice ground to an impalpable pow
der, intimately mixed with cold water, and then gently
boiled : a paste is thus produced which may be formed
into moulds or figures.

     Easy Mode of imitating Chalybeate Waters.
   If a few pieces of silver coin be alternated with
pieces of sheet iron, on placing the pile in water, it
soon acquires a yellowish hue and chalybeate taste,
and in twenty-four hours flocks of oxide of iron appear.
Hence, by replenishing with water, a vessel in which
such pile is placed, after each draught, we may have a
sufficient substitute for a chalybeate spring. Clean
copper-plates alternating with iron, would answer, or a
clean copper-wire, entwined on an iron rod ; but as the
copper when oxidated yields an oxide, it is safer to
employ silver.
          Method 'of cleaning Playing Cards.
   Nothing soils sooner than playing-cards, and they are
an expensive article to replace, owing to the high duty

they pay. The following method will be found to re
 move every thing from them but a stain, and will give
 the dirtiest pack possible the appearance of being new.
 Rub the soiled card with a piece of flannel and some
 good fresh butter, until the butter shall have cleaned off
 all the dirt. So soon as the dirt is removed, wipe off
 the butter with a clean rag ; and to restore the card to
 its former gloss, rub the surface sharply with a piece of
 flannel and some flour : cut the edges neatly with a pair
 of scissars, and the operation is completed.
                             Sound.
     The French academicians made, in 1738, some expe
  riments for measuring the velocity of sound: the
  Board of longitude renewed them in the month of June
  last, with all possible precision, when they found that
  the velocity of sound in the air, at the temperature of
  55 degrees, Fahrenheit, differs very little from 1044 feet
  per second.
                    Speaking Automata.
     The Egyptian idols are of this class. Memnon, the

  Darwin in his Temple of Nature lays down a process
  for forming an automatical speech. Bacon in his Natural
   History, experiment 139, notes the trembling of water
   resembles the letter h ,. the quenching of hot things, the
   letter z ; the sound of strings, the letters « and u ; and

                        Music of Light.
      Dr. Buchanan, of Kentucky, conceives that he has
   found some affinity between the different rays of light,
   as presented in a rainbow, and the notes of music.
   Following up this theory, real or imaginary, he pro
   poses to furnish a concert for the eye ; tbat is, that the

eye shall experience the same pleasure by an harmonic
rise and fall of the different rays of light, as the ear does
by the accordance of sweet sounds. How far this plan
is practicable, is a thing resting on experiment. Some
thing analagous to this may have given birth to the fa
ble of Memnon's harp, which was said to have uttered
delightful strains of melody when touched by the solar
rays.                                                        ;
                       Ventriloquism.
    It seems that the factitious voice produced by a ven
triloquist, does not (as the etymology of the word im
parts) proceed from the belly, but is formed in the inner
parts of the mouth and throat. The art does not de
pend on a particular structure or organization of these
parts, but may be acquired by almost any person ar
dently desirous of attaining it, and determined to perse
vere in repeated trials. A sudden change of direction in
sound, our knowledge of which does not depend on the
impulse of the ear, but on other facts, will be perceived,
when the original communication is interrupted, pro
vided there be a sensible echo. This will be perceived
by any person who walks along a valley intercepted with
buildiugs, at a time that a peal of bells is ringing ; for
the sound of the bells, instead of arriving constantly at
the ears of the person, in its true direction, is frequently
reflected in a short time from two or three different
places, and the steeple appears, in the hearer's judg
ment, to perform the part of an expert ventriloquist,
that which is occasioned by accident in the case of the
bells, being performed by art in the case of the ventri
loquist. The following curious facts, tending to illus
 trate a professional display of the art, may now be in
troduced :—The audience were arranged in two opposite
 lines, corresponding to the two sides of a long narrow
 room. The benches on which they were seated, reached
 from one end of the place to the middle of it, the other
 part remaining unoccupied. The feats exhibited by bim
 were the three following :—First ; he made his voice
 come from behind his audience, but it never seemed to
                              02

162             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
proceed from any part of the wall, near the heads of the
people present ; on the contrary, it was always heard
resembling the voice of a child, who seemed to be under
the benches. He stood during the time of speaking in
a stooping posture, having his mouth turned towards
the place from which the sound issued ; so that the line,
loining his lips and the reflecting object, did not ap
proach the ears of the company. Second ; advancing
into the vacant part of the room, and turning his back
to the audience, he made a variety of noises, that seem
ed to proceed from an open cupboard which stood di
rectly before lum, at the distance of two or three yards.
Third ; he placed an inverted glass cup on the hands of
his hearers, and then imitated the cries of a child con
fined in it. His method of doing it was this : the upper
part of the hearer's arm laid close along his side ; then
the part below the elbow was kept in a horizontal posi
tion, with the hand turned downwards, which was done
by the operator himself. After taking these prepara
tory steps, the man bent his body forwards in a situa
tion whUh presented the profile of his face nearly to the
front of his bearers, whilst his mouth pointed to the
cup ; in which posture he copied the voice of a confined
child so completely that three positions of the glass
were easily distinguished by as many different, tones,
viz. when he pressed the mouth of the cup close against
the palm, when one edge of it was elevated, and when
the vessel was held near the hand, but did not touch it.
The second and third instances of ventriloquism afford
strong proofs, that this delusive talent is nothing more
than the art of substituting an echo for the primary
sound; for, besides the change perceivable in the direc
tion of the voice, it was found to be blended with a va
riety of secondary sounds ; such as we know by expe
rience are produced, as often as a noise of any kind issues
froin a cavity. The responses of many of the ancient
oracles were delivered by persons possessing this qua
lity, so very capable of being applied to the purposes of
prjestcraft and delusion.

                    The Invisible Girl.
   This mystery is managed better in France than in this
country. They have a communication by tin pipes,
which end in a clear horn trumpet, inserted in an iso
lated glass chest or barrel, which is attached to the
ceiling only by coloured ribbons, twined round a small
gilt chain. In the inside of these pipes, at right angles,
are placed small mirrors, which reflect and contract
 every object in the exhibition room, so that the respon-
 ser can see as well as hear, all that occurs, even to ob
jects held in the hands of the visitors, such as watches,
 money, &c.
                            Bees.
    Our cruel mode of taking honey by destroying the
 innocent and beautiful insects that produce it, can no
 longer be defended by the plea of necessity. A late tra
 veller in the northern part of India, describes the follow
 ing easy method by which the honey-gatherers there
 effect their purpose. A hollow tree, or an earthen pot, is
 built in the wall of a house, or out-house, with apertures
 externally, through which the bees enter and go out.
 The internal end of this hive can be opened or shut at
 pleasure by various simple contrivances ; a sliding door
 is one. In the centre of the hive there is a valve.
 When the hive is full, and the honey is to be taken, a
 great noise is made at the inner extremity. Thi3 drives
 the bees out ; the valve is then closed, and the honey is
 taken out by the sliding-door. The superior part of our
 readers will doubtless take a pleasure in communicating
 this easy mode of avoiding cruelty, to those whom the
 information might not otherwise reach.
              To make Roses blow very late.
    First cut off the tops of the rose-trees immediately
 after they have done bearing, and then they will flower
 again in November ; but they will not come just on the

tops where they have been cut, but on the side shoots.
Second, pull off the buds of the roses when they are
newly knotted ; for then the side branches will bear in
the autumn : in both these cases the effect is the same,
the sap is restrained for a time, and diverted into new
channels. Third, lay the roots bare for some days,
about Christmas ; by this means the sap is stopped in its
progress upwards. Cover the roots again with earth,
and it will ascend, but slower and later. Fourth ; gird
the body or stem of the rose-tree with packthread, and
that will restrain the sap from rising through the bark,
which is full of sap-vessels, and cause it to leaf and
flower late.
        To wash Chintz so as to preserve its Gloss
                          and Beauty.
    Take two pounds of rice, and boil it in two gallons of
 water till soft ; when done, pour the whole into a tub ;
 let it stand till about the warmth you in general use for
 coloured linens ; then put the chintz in, and use the rice
 instead of soap ; wash it in this, till the dirt appears to
 be out ; then boil the same quantity as above, but strain
 the rice from the water, and mix it in warm clear water.
 Wash it in this till quite clean ; afterwards rinse it in
 the water the rice was boiled in, and this will answer
 the end of starch, and no dew will affect it, as it will be
  stiff as long as it is worn. If a gown, it must be taken
  to pieces ; and when dried, be careful to hang it as
  smooth as possible ; after it is dry, rub it with a sleek
  stone, but use no iron.
                     Musical Barometer.
     A gentleman in Switzerland, invented some years ago
     sort of musical barometer, which has been called in
  the German wetter harfe (weather harp,) or reisen harfe,
   (giant harp,) which possesses the singular property of
   indicating changes of the weather by musical tones.
   This gentleman was in the habit of amusing himself by

                ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                     166
shooting at a mark from his window ; and that he might
not be obliged to go after the mark at every shot, he
fixed a piece of iron wire to it, so as to be able to draw
it to him at pleasure. He frequently remarked that this
wire gave musical tones, sounding exactly an octave, and
 he found that an iron wire extended in a direction paral
lel to the meridian, gave this tone every time the wea
ther changed. A piece of brass wire gave no sound, nor
 did an iron wire extended east and west. In conse
 quence of these observations, a: musical barometer was
 constructed. In the year 1787, Captain Hans, of Basle,
 made one in the following manner :—Thirteen pieces of
 iron wire, each 320 feet long, were extended from his
 summer-house to the outer court, crossing a garden.
 They were placed about two inches apart, the largest
 were two lines in diameter, the smallest only one, and
 the others about one and a half : they were on the side
 of the house, and made an angle of twenty or thirty de
 grees with the horizon ; they were stretched and kept
 tight by wheels for the purpose. Every time the wea
  ther changes, 'these wires make so much noise, that It
 is impossible to continue concerts in the parlour, and
 the sound resembles that of a tea-urn when boiling;
 sometimes that of an harmonicon, a distant bell, or en
  organ. In the opinion of the celebrated chemist, M.
  Dobereiner, this is an electro-magnetical phenomenon.
           Method of Painting Japan Work.
    Japan work ought properly to be painted with colours
 in varnish ; though for the greater dispatch, and in some
  very small works, for the freer use of the pencil, the co
 lours are sometimes tempered in oil, which should pre
  viously have a fourth part of its weight of gum animi
  dissolved in it ; or, in default of that, gum sandarach,
  or gum mastich. When the oil-is thus used, it should be
  well diluted with oil of turpentine, that the colours may
  lay more evenly and thin, by which means, fewer of the
  polishing or upper coats of varnishing will be necessary.
  In some instances, water colours are laid on grounds of

gold, in the manner of other paintings, and are best
when so used in their proper appearance, without any
varnish over them ; and they are also sometimes so ma
naged as to have the effect of embossed work. The co
lours employed in this way, for painting, are best pre
pared by means of isinglass size, corrected by honey or
sugar-candy. The body of which the embossed work
is raised, need not, however, be tinged with the exterior
colour, but may be best formed of very strong gum
water, thickened to a proper consistence by bole arme-
nian and whiting in equal parts, which being laid on the
proper figure, and repaired when dry, may be then
painted the proper colours, tempered with the isinglass
size, or, in the usual manner, with shell-lac varnish.
         Manner of Varnishing Japan-work.
   The finishing of japan-work lies in the laying on, and
polishing the outer coats of varnish which are necessary,
which is generally done with the best common seed lac
varrlish, which is thus applied :—The work to be var
nished should be placed near a fire, and made perfectly
dry ; then the varnish rubbed over, beginning in the
middle and passing to one end, again from the middle
passing to the other, avoiding to go twice over the same
place in forming one coat, when one coat is dry, lay
on another, till you have a sufficient thickness to bear
the polish, which must be done by rubbing it with a
rag dipped in tripoli, or rotten-stone, finely powdered ;
but towards the end of the rubbing, a little oil of any
kind should be used along with the powder ; and when
the work appears sufficiently bright and glossy, it should
be well rubbed with the oil alone to clean it from the
powder, and give it a still brighter lustre. In case of
white grounds, fine putty or whiting must be used.

                      Chinese Paints.
   The peculiar beauty of Chinese drawings is owing,
not to the particular nature of the colouring substances,
but merely to their being mixed with glue or size, in
stead of gum-water, as is the common practice in Eu
rope. In regard to the preparation, two things must be
observed ; first, that the beauty depends, in a very great
measure, upon the fineness of its particles, the finest
being always the most beautiful. A Chinese painter em
ploys a man for three or four days to grind a small
quantity of Vermillion in a porcelain mortar, and it is
from this they derive their fine reds. Secondly, it must
be considered, that most mineral colours are prepared
with acids, alkalies, or other salts, and that a small su
perabundance of those saline substances generally re
mains with them, which, after a shorter or longer time,
produces considerable alteration in their brilliancy, and
often entirely changes their colour. In order to obviate
this inconvenience, the paint, after having been levi
gated, must be repeatedly washed in clean water : dis
tilled water is the fittest. In order to effect this pro
perly, put half an ounce of the paint in a half pint glass
phial, and fill the rest of the phial almost entitely with
water ; shake it well ; then let it stand for a while, and
the coloured powder will soon fall to the bottom ; then
pour off the water, by inclining the phial gently, so as
not to disturb the sediment, and fill it again with clean
water, and so on for five or six times ; after which, the
colour being gently dried, must be ground a little longer,
and then it is fit for use. The glue or size to be mixed
with the paints is extracted from parchment in the fol
lowing manner:—Take about four ounces of clean
parchment, cut it into bits, and put it to soak in a quart
of clean water for about twelve hours ; then boil the
whole on a gentle fire, and in the beginning take off the
scum with a spoon. The vessel must remain always
uncovered, and the liquor must be stirred occasionally.
After boiling about an hour, take off the pot from the
fire, and strain the liquor while hot, through a coarse
sieve. The liquor must be again put over the fire in a

168               ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
clean pot, and gently boiled till half is evaporated ; the
remainder is then spread very thinly upon panes of
glass, which being kept in a worm place for a day or
two, the size will dry, and become very hard. When
it is wanted for use, put a small quantity of it in a cup
of luke-warm water, and dip the hair pencil in it. The
properties of this glue, which render it much superior
to gum-water, are the following :—It does not deaden,
nor otherwise alter the colours with which it is mixed :
it does not crack like gum ; and it becomes so soon hard,
as not only to defend the colours from being affected by
smoke and other vapours, but even to bear the surface
of the drawing, being cleaned by means of a wet
sponge.
      How to prepare Parchment for Painting.
   Take about a yard and half of list, and roll it up very
tight in a circular form ; then take some finely pow
dered white pumice-stone, put the list in it, and rub it
over the parchment. This plan, which is simple and very
common, answers the best of any. If you wish it to
take water colours without sinking, choose that which
is not spongy and soft, and use alum-water with the co
lours when you mix them for use.

                    Painting in Milk.
   Fainting in milk may be used in place of distemper or
oil painting, by means of a composition made with two
pints of skimmed milk, eight ounces of slaked lime, six
ounces of linseed or nut oil, five pounds of Spanish
white, and two ounces of Burgundy pitch: the pitch is
to be slowly melted in the oil, by a gentle heat ; then
add to it the mixture of milk and lime, being careful
that it be previously heated, so as to prevent the too

sudden cooling of the pitch. A substitute for this resin
ous milk may be made by mixing 144 parts of very dry
powdered skimmed-milk cheese, seven parts of slaked
lime, 240 parts of Spanish white, and two parts of finely
powdered charcoal, with eighty parts by weight of
water.
                A new Stain for Wood.
   A beautiful new stain for wood, consists of a de
coction of walnut or hiccory bark, with a small quantity
of alum dissolved in it, to give permanency to the
colour. Wood of a white colour receives from the
application of this liquid a beautiful yellow tinge, which
is not liable to fade. It is particularly adapted for fur
niture made of maple, particularly that kind of it called
birds'-eye. The application of the walnut dye gives a
lustre even to the darkest shades, while to the paler and
fainter ones it adds a somewhat greenish hue, and to the
whiter parts various tints of yellow. After applying
this stain to cherry and apple wood, the wood should be
slightly reddened with a tincture of some red dye whose
colour is not liable to fade. A handsome dye is thus
given, which becomes more beautiful as the wood grows
darker by age.
 To place a lighted Candle under Water, without

 be seen burning under the water, and may be brought
 up again a-light. In the same manner a handkerchief
 may be immersed without being wetted, if rolled very
 tightly together. The principal art consists in the nicety
 of bringing the mouth of the glass exactly level with the

        Optical Experiment with Butterflies.
   On a fine sunshiny day, when butterflies are about,
(with a hat lightly put upon the head to screen the eyes
from the sun) place one angle of a prism a little below
the eyes, and move it up and down, until you see the
prismatic colours. The butterflies within fifty yards or
more, will be seen moving about, not in their insect
form, but as a vibrating, tremulous flame of perpendi
cular fire, which, by the movement of the prism, will
appear from two to four inches in length. This experi
ment is best made in a garden of flowers.

you hold your hand over, round about the stick.
         To take Three Balls off two Strings.
   While the balls are examining, you double each
string, and each appears to have two even ends ; you
twist the double end of each together, and putting on
one of the balls which has a bole smaller than the others
over the place that is joined, the strings remain firm,
and can bear to be pulled. Each person that holds,
thinks that he has the extremities of two strings, while
in fact he has only the ends of one. By a jerk the mid
dle ball comes off, followed by the rest ; you then slip
them into the hands of one of the persons who holds
the strings ; he of course lets go his hold, and you then
take care to put the strings lengthways. This is a cle
ver feat when performed adroitly, but it requires no
slight degree of dexterity to conceal the deception.
Formerly the feat was performed with three button
moulds on two small whip cords of about two feet each,
and with three rings upon two ribbons, but the balls and
tapes are preferable.
To cut and tear into Pieces a Handkerchief, and
                 to make it whole again.
   This feat, strange as it appears, is very simple : the
performer must have a confederate, who has two hand
kerchiefs of the same quality, and with the same mark,
one of which he throws upon the stage to perform the
feat with. The performer takes care to put this hand
kerchief uppermost in making the bundle, though he
affects to mix them together promiscuously. The per
son whom he desires to draw one of the handkerchiefs,
naturally takes that which comes first to his hand. He
desires to shake them again to embellish the operation,

but, in so doing, takes care to bring the right handker
chief uppermost, and carefully fixes upon some sim
pleton to draw ; and if he find that he is not likely to
take the first that comes to his hand, he prevents him
from drawing by fixing upon another, under pretence of
his having a more sagacious look. When the handker
chief is torn and carefully folded up, it is put under a
glass upon a table placed near a partition. On that part
of the table on which it is deposited is a little trap,
which opens and lets it fall into a drawer. The confe
derate, concealed behind the curtain, passes his hand
within the table, opens the trap, and substitutes the se
 cond handkerchief instead of the first ; then shuts the
 trap, which fits so exactly the hole it closes, as to de
 ceive the eyes of the most incredulous. If the perform
 er be not possessed of such a table, (which is absolutely
 necessary for other feats as well as this) he must have
 the second handkerchief in his pocket, and by slight of
 hand change it for the pieces, which must be instanta
 neously concealed.
 To make a Sheep-pen which contains an Hundred

    In the original pen, or that which holds the hundred

  be but one at the top or bottom thereof. Then it is ob
  vious, that if one hurdle more be placed at each end,
  the place enclosed must necessarily be double that of
  the first pen, and consequently it will hold twice the
  number of sheep.

                 The Nocturnal Reveilleur.
    Against the wall of a room, near the ceiling, fix a
 wheel of 12 or 18 inches diameter, on the rim of which
place a number of bells in tune, and if you please, of
 different sizes. To the axis of this wheel there should
be fixed a fly to regulate its motion, and round the cir
cumference there must be wound a rope, to the end of
which is suspended a weight. Near to the wheel let a
stand be fixed, on which is an upright piece that holds a
balance or moveable lever, on one end of which rests the
weightjust mentioned, and to the other end must hang an
inverted hollow or cone funnel, the aperture of which is
very small. This cone must be graduated on the' inside,
that the sand put in may answer to the number of hours
it is to run. Against the upright piece, on,the side next
the cone, there must be fixed a check, to prevent it
from descending. This stand, together with the wheel,
may be enclosed in a case, and so contrived, as to be
moved from one room to another with very little trou
ble. It is evident, from the construction of this ma
chine, that when a certain quantity of the Band is run
out, the weight will descend, and put the wheel in mo
tion, which motion will continue till the weight comes to
the ground. If the wheel be required to continue longer
in motion, two or more pullies' may be added, over
 which the rope may run. The size of the bells should
be adapted to the somniferous disposition of the party
intended to be roused ; or if you please, a drum or ta
bor may be added, the stick to which may be fixed in
 the side of the room, by a swivel that goes through the
middle of it, and one end of it being lifted up by the
teeth placed upon the circumference of the wheel, the
other end will alternately strike the drum.

                   The HorizonCorium.
    The horizontorium, on which the sketch (fig. 31) in the
 frontispiece is founded, is an ingenious recreation, which
 was introduced to the public about three years since,
 and is one of the most amusing optical deceptions ever
 witnessed. When viewed at any other but the correct
 point of sight, the designs appear a mere groupe of
 distorted objects, but when looked at correctly, has all
 the appearance of reality. As the effect depends entirely
upon correctly placing the sight-piece, through which
 it is to be viewed, we have adopted a mode of describing
it, which can be hardly be misunderstood.-*—A piece of
paper, or card (which is better) must he cut out, of the
precise shape and height of the piece ABC; a aper
ture for the eye, about the size of a pea (A) must be
 made, precisely on the spot shewn in the sight-piece.
The shaded part of the sight-piece must be folded back
 at a right angle, so as to form a kind of foot to stand
upon. The sight-piece must then be placed perpen
dicularly, exactly, over the place D." Then keeping
the paper perfectly 'horizontal, and placing the eye
close to the aperture A, there may be seen a perfect
representation Of a castle, surrounded by scenery.
A very little experience will give the image or model
very exactly; if not, the person who makes the trial
may depend upon it that he has not placed the sight-
piece correctly. The light ought to fall on the side of
the figure opposite the shadow. If the representation
of the sight-piece A B C is found to interfere with the
picture, it may be covered with a small piece of paper.
Especial care shouldbe taken that the paper be perfectly
smooth, as the slightest wrinkle will distort the figure
materially. The eye must also be placed as close as
possible to the sight-hole.

liancy in the light which is emitted. If the globule
thus melted is allowed to drop into a basin of water, it
remains for some time red-hot at the bottom ; and such
is the intensity of the heat, that it melts and carries off
the glaze of the basin from the part on which it happens
to fall.
                    The Chick in Ovo.
   Mr. David Ritchie says, he has heard of a mode of
discovering the sex of the chick in ovo, differing from
any which have been proposed by naturalists. The fol-
liculus aeris, or air-cell, which is to furnish oxygen to
the future chick, is situated at the larger end of the egg.
It has not in all eggs the same position at the larger
end ; and in various districts of Scotland, it is believed
that eggs bearing the air-cell only near the top of the
larger end produce females. To ascertain this Mr. R.
instituted a series of experiments. These experiments
go very far to prove that the opinion which has been
stated is correct, and so to determine what naturalists
of Germany, France, and England, have endeavoured
in vain to discover.

the surface covered with weak dilute nitric acid, make
the connexion with the battery at i and D ; and the

    The suspension of the wheel is shewn in fig 2 ; and
it may be proper to add, that in order to ensure a
complete contact, the two sockets and the ends of the
spindle should be amalgamated, as also the tops of the
points of the wheel.
    If the contact be changed, or if the magnet be re
 versed, the motion of the wheel will be reversed also ;

     RECREATIONS WITH CARDS.
 Three Cards being presented to Three Persons, to
             guess that which each has chosen.
   As it is necessary that the cards presented to the
three persons should be distinguished, we shall call the
first A, the second B, and the third C ; but the three
persons may be at liberty to choose any of them they
please . This choice, which is susceptible of six different
varieties, having been made, give to the first person
twelve counters, to the second twenty-four, and to the
third thirty-six ; then desire the first person to add to
gether the half of the counters of the person who has
chosen the card A, the third of those of the person who
has chosen B, and the fourth part of those the person
who has chosen C, and ask the sum, which must be
either 23 or 24 ; 25 or 27 ; 28 or 29, as in the following
table:—

the first person must have chosen the card B, the second

   any Two Partners ?
   De Moivre, in his Doctrine ofChances, shews that the
chance is nearly 27 to 2 that the partners, one of whom
deals, will not have the four honours. That it is about
23 to 1 that the other two partners will not have them.
That it is nearly 8 to 1 that they will not be found on
any one side. That one may. bet about 13 to 7, without
disadvantage, that the partners who are first in hand
will not count honours. That about 20 to 7 may be
betted, that the other two will not count them. And in
the last place, that it is- 25 to 16, that one of the two
sides will count honours, or that they will not be
equally divided.

second of the row A, the first of the row D ; the third of

again in vertical rows, in which row, C or D, the card
thought of is. Suppose it to be in C ; take up that row
as well as the row D, putting the last at the end of the
first, without deranging the order of the cards, and ob
serving the rule already given, form them into two other
rows, as seen at E and F ; then ask, as before, in which
row the card thought of is. Let us suppose it to be m
E ; take up this row, and the row F, as above directed,
and form them into two new rows, on the right and left
of B ; after these operations, the card thought of must
be the first of one of the perpendicular rows, H and I;
if you therefore ask in which row it is, you may easily
 point it out ; having desired them to be shuffled, the bet
 ter to conceal the artifice.
 A certain Number of Cards being skewnto a Person,
             to guess that which he thought of.
    To perform this trick, the number of the cards must be
 divisible by 3 ; and it is more convenient that the num
 ber should be odd. Desire the person to think of a card ;
 then place the cards on the table with their faces down
 ward ; and, taking them up in order, arrange them in
 three heaps, with their faces upward, and in such a
  manner, that the first card of the packet shall be first of
 the first heap ; the second the first of the second, and
 the third the first of the third ; the fourth, the second
  of the first, and so on. When the heaps are completed,
  ask the person in which heap is the card thought of, and
  when told, place that containing the card thought of in
  the middle; then turning up the packet, form three
  heaps, as before, and again ask in which is the card
  thought of. Place the heap containing the card thought
  of still in the middle, and, having formed three new
  heaps, ask which of them contains the card thought of.
  When this is known, pjace it as before between the
                               9

182             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
other two, and again form three heaps, asking the same
question. Then take up the heaps for the last time ; put
that containing the card thought of in the middle, and
placing the packet on the table, with the faces down
ward, turn up the cards till you count half the number
of those contained in the packet; 12, for example, if
there be 24, in which case the 12th card will be the one
 the person thought of. If the number of the cards be,
 at the same time, odd, and divisible by 3, as 15, 21, 27,
 &c. the trick will become much easier, for the card
thought of will always be that in the middle of the heap
in which it is found the third time ; so that it may be
easily distinguished without counting the cards : nothing
will be necessary but to remember, while you are
forming the heaps the third time, the card which is the
middle one of each. Suppose, for example, that the
middle card of the first heap is the ace of spades ; that
the second is the king of hearts, and that the third is the
knave of hearts : if you are told that the heap containing
the required card is the third, that card must be the
knave of hearts. You may therefore have the cards
shuffled, without touching them any more, and then,
looking them over for form sake, may name the knave
of hearts when it occurs.
To guess the Number of Spots on any Card, which a
           Person has drawn from a Pack.
   Take the pack of 52 cards, and desire some person to
draw out one, without shewing it. Call the knave 1 1 ,
the queen 12, the king 13. Then add the spots of the
first card to those of the second ; the last sum to the
spots of the third, and so on, always rejecting 13, and
keeping the remainder to add to the following card. It
is needless to reckon the kings which are counted 13.
If any spots remain at the last card, subtract them from
13, and the remainder will indicate the spots of the card
which has been drawn : if the remainder be 11, it has

                  ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                      183
been a knave ; if 12 a queen, but if nothing remains it
has been a king. The colour of the king may be known
by examining which one among the cards is wanting.
The trick may be thus explained. In the pack of cards
are 13 of each suit, the sum of all the spots of each
suit, calling the knave 11, the queen 12, and the king
 13, is seven times 13, or 91, which is a multiple of 13 ;
consequently, the quadruple of this sum is a multiple of
13 also : if the spots then of all the cards be added to
gether, always rejecting 13, we must at last find the re
mainder equal to nothing. If a card, the spots of which
are less than 13, has been drawn from the pack, the dif
ference between these spots and 13, will be what is
wanting to complete that number : if at the end, then,
instead of reaching 13, we reach only 10, for example,
it is evident that the card wanting is a three, and if we
reach 13, it is also evident that the card wanting is equi
valent to 13, or a king.
Several Cards being presented in succession to se
    veral Persons, to guess that which each luis
   thought of.
    Shew as many cards to each person as there are per
sons to choose ; that is to say three to each, if there are
three persons. When the first has thought of one, lay
aside the three cards in which he has made his choice.
Present the same number to the second person, to think
of one, and lay aside those three cards also. Having
done the same with the third person, spread out the
three first cards with their faces upwards, and place
above them the next three cards, and above these the
last three, that all the cards may thus be disposed in
three heaps, each consisting of three cards. Then ask
each person in which heap the card is which he thought
of; that being known, it will be easy to tell these cards,
for that of the first person will be the first in the heap to
which it belongs ; that of the second will be the second

184             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
of the next heap, and that of the third will be third of
the last heap.
     To produce a Mouse from a Pack of Cards.
   Have a pack of cards fastened together at the edges,
but open in the middle like a box, a whole card being
glued on as a cover, and many loose ones placed above
it, which require to be dexterously shuffled, so that the
entire may seem a real pack of cards. The bottom
must likewise be a whole card, glued to the box on one
side only, yielding immediately to interior pressure, and
serving as a door by which you convey the mouse into
the box. Being thus prepared, and holding the bot
tom tight with your band, require one ofthe company to
place his open hands together, and tell him you mean
to produce something very marvellous from this pack of
cards ; place the cards then in his hands, and while you
engage his attention in conversation, affect to want
something out of your bag, and at the same moment
take the pack by the middle, and throw it into the bag,
when the mouse will remain in the hands of the person
who held the cards.
A Person having drawn any number of Cardsfrom
    a Pack, to guess the whole number of Spots that
    they contain.
   Assume any number, (say 15, for example) greater
than the number of the spots of the highest card, count
ing the knave 11, the queen 12, the king 13, and desire
the person to add as many cards from the pack, to the
first card he has chosen, as will make up 15, counting
the spots of that card ; let him do the same in regard to
the second, third, fourth, &c; and then desire him to
tell how many cards remain in the pack. Then proceed
 as follows :—Multiply the above number 15, (or any

                 ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                   185
other that may be assumed) by the number of cards
drawn from the pack, which we will suppose to be 3 ;
to the product 45, add the number of these cards, which
will give 48, subtract the 48 from 52, and take the re
mainder 4 from the cards left in the pack ; the result
will be the number of spots required. Let us suppose,
for example, that the person has drawn from the pack a
7, a 10, and a knave, which is equal to 11 ; to make
up the number of 15 with a 7, eight cards will be re
quired; to make up the same number with a 10, will re
quire five ; and with the knave, which is equal to 11,
four will be necessary. The sum of these three num
bers, with the three cards, makes 20, consequently 32
cards remain in the pack. To find the sum of the num
bers 7, 10, 11, multiply 15 by 3, which will give 45 ;
and if the number of the cards drawn from the pack be
added, the sum will be 48, which taken from 52, leaves
4. If 4 then be subtracted from 32, the remainder, 28,
will be the sum of the spots contained on the three cards
drawn from the pack.
 To holdfour Kings, orfour Knaves, in your Hand,
    and to change them suddenly into blank Cards,
    then intofour Aces.
    You must have cards made for the purpose of this
 feat ; half cards, as they may be properly termed ; that
is, one half kings or knaves, and the other half aces.
When you lay the aces one over the other, nothing but
the king or knaves will be seen. Then turning the
the kings or knaves downwards, the four aces will be
seen. You must have two perfect cards, one a king or
knave to cover one of the aces, or else it will be seen ;
and the other an ace to lay over the kings or knaves.
When you wish to make them all appear blank cards, lay
the cards a little lower, and by hiding the aces they will
all appear white on both sides. You may then ask the
company which they choose, and exhibit the kings, aces,
or blanks, as required.

Several Numbers being disposed in a circular Form-
   according to their natural Series, to tell tha*
   which any one has thought of.
   The first ten cards of any suit, disposed in a circular
form, as seen in the figure below, may be employed for
performing this trick. The ace is here represented by
the letter A annexed to 1, and the 10 by the letter K
joined to 10.

    Having desired the person who has thought of a num
 ber or card, to touch also any other number or card,
 bid him add to the number of the card touched, the
 number of the cards employed, which in this case is 10.
 Then desire him to count that sum in an order contrary
-to that of the natural numbers, beginning at the card he
 touched, and assigning to that card the number of the
 one which he thought of ; for, by counting in this man
 ner, he will end at the number or card which he thought
 of, and consequently you will easily know it. Thus,
 for example, if the person has thought of the number 3,
 marked C, and has touched 6, :marked F ; if 10 be
 added to 6, it will make 16 ; if 16 be then counted from
 T, the number touched, towards E, D, C, B, A, and so
  on in the retrograde order, counting 3, the number

thought of, on F, 4 on E, 5 on D, 6 on C, and so
round to 16, the number 16 will terminate on C, shewing
that the person thought of 3, which corresponds to C.
Of course, the person must not count the sum aloud.
To alter a Card to another which has been secured
                   in a loched-up Box.
   A box must be made on purpose, with a double bot
tom ; upon the false one is laid the card which the first
person chooses. In locking the box by a secret spring,
the false bottom is raised with the card, and firmly united
with that part where the hinges are. On the real bot
tom lies another card, which had been previously and
secretly deposited there. In making a person draw a
card, a duplicate of this is forced upon him ; for if he
attempt to draw another, under some pretence you
shuffle the cards again, till at last he takes the very card
you intend him. This card you know by feeling it, it
being purposely longer than any of the rest, and is, in
fact, a conjuror's secret card. You must never let one
of those particular or brief cards remain in a pack when
you give it to be examined. Note.—This feat may be
varied. A five pound note may be changed into a ten,
&c. but it ought to Be something which will lie in a
narrow compass, in order that the false bottom may fall
closely into its place. Formerly bird-seed was con
verted into a living bird, by false . lids, but these are
more liable to detection than false bottoms to the lid ;
bird-seed was glued, and the box, when shewn to the
company, appeared to be full of it. By drawing up the
false lid close to the real one, a bird, which had been
previously placed there, was then discovered. The false
bottoms are certainly preferable.

breaking any ? The possibility of it however will be
evident when it is considered, that by taking the
greater half of an odd number, we take the exact

ing, for by selling 37 of them at that guard which is
the half +.4, she would have 36 remaining. In like

   The Puzzling Rings.—The inventor of this perplexing
toy is unknown, but the invention is of considerable

                   KNDLESS AMUSEMENT.                      205
  antiquity : for Cardan, who began to write early in the
   sixteenth century, makes mention of the instrument
  called Complicate Annulli, or Puzzling Rings, and has
  left a very obscure description of the construction and
  the art of managing the toy. The annexed diagram
  will show the reader the construction of the rings and
  their necessary accompaniment, the staple. After this
  part is properly comprehended, the method of managing
  the instrument will soon be acquired, from the direc
  tions for working it which conclude this essay. The
  instrument may be thus described:—A thin plate of
  metal, 1, 5, has any number of holes drilled through it
  at equal distances ; they are five in the figure, and are
  marked by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. These holes,
  besides being at equal distances, are round, equal in
  diameter, and placed in a right line. To each of these
  holes a metal pin is properly adjusted ; that is, it is fur
  nished with a broad head, to prevent it from slipping
  through the hole; the upper part of the pin is consider
 ably less in diameter than the perforation which it occu
 pies. This circumstance is necessary, because the pin is
 to move with ease, not only up and down, but also in all
 directions. The top of this pin is bent into a loop, for
 the reception of a ring, which moves easily in the loop,
 but cannot be taken out of it. The diameter of these
 rings is less than the length of the pins, but greater
than the distance of two adjacent holes. These parts
are thus put together, and implicated one with another,
 viz. let its proper pin pass through the hole 1 , and after
 the pin is so placed, let the upper end of it be so bent
into a loop as to receive and retain the ring I. In like
manner let the pin 2 H pass through the hole 2, and
also through the ring I ; after which, let the upper end
of it be bent into a loop, as above described, for the
reception of the ring H. In the same way, let the re
maining holes, 3, 4, 5, be furnished with moveable
pins, each of which passes through the ring attached to
the preceding pin, and is afterwards bent into a loop, to
receive and retain a ring ; thus, pin 3 G passes through
the ring H, and holds the ring G ; in like manner the
pin 4 F passes through the ring G, and holds the ring
                             s

206             ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.
F ; and also the pin 5 E passes through the ring F, and
is furnished with the ring E, as in the figure.
   The figure marked O represents an essential part of
the instrument; it is called the staple or needle. It
should he made a little longer than the plate 1, 5, but
not of a breadth which would prevent it from passing
easily through the rings; and the hollow part of the
staple should be of a dimension to permit two rings,
-with their respective loops, to pass easily at the same
time through the cavity, when they are turned down
with their edges.
   When the instrument is finished, pursuant to the
preceding directions, the staple maybe passed, with
proper management, through all the rings from E to I,
and when this is done, it may be again extricated by an
 inverse process. It is here intended that the staple
should not only pass through the rings, bnt that it
should also contain, in its oblong cavity, all the pins
 attached to the rings.
    The method of performing the direct and inverse
 operations is as follows :—1st. Introduce the ring E
 through the staple O, by two motions, viz. E through O
    O through E. This being done, the staple will pass
 through E, and include the pin 5 E within the cavity.
 2d. Introduce F into O bv these four motions ; take E
 from the end of O—put "F through O—O through F
 and E. 3d. Introduce G by eight motions, viz. 1st. Let
 E down by these two motions : take O from E—Efrom
 O ; then take F from the end of O—introduce G through
 O—O through G and F; put E through O and O
 through E. By this last operation, the staple passes
 through the three first rings, E, F, G, and includes
 their respective pins, 5 E, 4 F, 3 G. In like manner,
  the ring H, with the three preceding, G, F, E, may be
  introduced with their pins into the staple, by sixteen
  motions; also the ring I maybe introduced with all the
  preceding rings, by thirty-two motions, &c.
     The converse of the preceding operation, or that by
  which the staple is again extricated from the rings,
  wants but little explanation, when the former process
  is understood. It is only necessary to remark on this

                 ENDLESS AMUSEMENT.                   207
subject, that the first business is to take down the ring
I, which is done thus :—Take down the three first,
E, F, G, by inverting the operation by which the staple
was introduced through them ; then I may be taken
down, and H will remain upon O. Introduce the staple
again through E, F, G, and take down E, F ; then H
may be removed, and G will remain upon O. Again,
introduce the staple through E, F, and take down E ;
then G may be removed. Lastly, put up E, and. let
down E, F, by which motion the staple will be freed
from all the rings.

which it is placed is headed by the letter F, all the num
bers in that column wc know will stand second in
whichever of the columns of the second table they may

in the foregoing figure : the two halves (A and B) may
then be put together so as to form an exact square, by
raising the part B one step.

   An oblong piece of paper, (say about the size and
shape of a common card) may be folded in such a
manner, that, by one cut of the scissors, several pieces
may be produced, bearing considerable resemblance to
 the following things : —The cross, upon which Christ
suffered, which, from its perfect form, may be called the
crucifix ; two imperfect crosses, which may be consi
dered the thieves' crosses ; two pieces forming a pedes
tal for the principal cross; a piece for the scroll or
inscription over it; the spear with which Christ was
pierced; and two cubes, representing the dice with
which the soldiers cast lots for his garments.

                      Let a piece of paper, of the form and
                   size of the preceding engraving, (or
                   any oblong, twice as long as broad) be
                   marked with the letters, a to g, (bb
                   precisely half way down the paper.)
                   The capital letters J and H should be
                   marked so strongly as to show through
                   the paper, or should be marked on the
                   back of it in their precise situations.
                   Then bend down the top of the paper,
                   so that the corners a a will touch b b,
                   the crease being in the direction of the
                   line c c. Then turn down the two
                   corners c c, so as to meet at the centre
                   d; then double the left-hand side lon
                  gitudinally, so that the edge e will
                  touch the centre at /; and in like
                   manner, the right-hand side, so that
                   the edge g will also touch the centre at
                  f. Then, by closing the two sides to
                  gether, so that J and H will touch each
                   other, the paper will be as in the mar
                  gin, and must be cut through in the
                   direction of the dotted line.
                      On unfolding the pieces, the perfect
                   cross c e df will appear; lay it upon
                   a table. Put the two imperfect crosses
                  J H on the right and left. The two
                   dice, o a, will be found folded under
the corners b b ; the pieces b e and b g may represent,
one the inscription, being opened out and placed above
the cross ; the other the spear, the point remaining
folded and reared towards the cross. The two un
marked pieces will be the foundations of the cross, as
they may be placed together, and the foot of the cross
will fit the two chasms. Thus a complete picture will
be formed, and not an atom of the paper will be wasted.
The thick black lines in the large engraving will show
where the scissors will cut ; the thin lines merely denote
the creases made in folding.

                    PROBLEM XXXVII.
                  Given five squares, much larger than
               that in the margin, each divided into two
               parts, by a line from one angle bisecting
               the opposite side. Divide each of these
               five squares into two parts, by cutting
               along the diagonal line ; there will then
be ten pieces. Required so to arrange these ten pieces,
that they shall form one square.
  The solution to the above may be readily found by
exercising a little ingenuity; but it would require a
very complex figure to explain it.
