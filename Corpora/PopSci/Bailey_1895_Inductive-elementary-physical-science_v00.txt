                                               PREFACE.
     The    course     in Elementary       Physical  Science, of which these sheets form the first
instalment, is the outgrowth            of various experiments made first in the public schools of
Michigan,      later in Dr. Felix Adler's Workingmen's              School in New York City, and
finally, during the past four years, in the private school of Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw in
Boston — a school founded by Mrs. Shaw, the daughter of the great naturalist, Prof.
Louis Agassiz, for         the    purpose    of developing    methods    of nature    study   that   will
secure    to the young student           the  best preparation    for holding  through life intimate
converse     with nature.
     The endless source of happiness            which this gives is a heritage that Mrs. Shaw has
believed     will   come always to        all students who     are introduced   to  the study     of the
earth by the natural method.              The author's educational views were so fully in accord
with her own, that        she gave him perfect liberty in laying out the work in the Physical
Science branches of nature study for pupils from twelve to eighteen years of age.
The results reached          have    been such that many of the best educators of Boston             and
vicinity    have    recommended and urged that              the   course be given    a wider    field of
usefulness.
     While this work       has been largely the result of class-room        experiment, indebtedness
is freely acknowledged           to various sources,    especially to the excellent little manual on
 " Home-made        Apparatus,"      by Prof. John F. Woodhull, of the New York Teachers'
 College.

                                    TO     THE TEACHER.
    No previous knowledge of physics            is absolutely necessary,        but a clear conception of
the   object aimed at is       imperative, in order that the            work    may   be  done in a     truly
scientific manner, and the highest success attained.                   That object is not primarily to
give the pupil a few physical facts out of the great abundance of truth,                   a few essentials
of which is all that is possible in any course, but to cultivate his powers of observation
and independent thought.            Every young child       possesses these powers and is eager             to
use them, but a system exclusively           of book-education tends to destroy them.             Some one
has   truthfully    said   — "No injustice would       be   done     to a teacher   if his skill and      the
educative value of his lessons were measured              by his success in making children           reason
                                                            "      and we may add that for the best
out conclusions from observed            or stated facts       ;
discipline    those    facts should be observed, not stated.             That education is of the most
value in every walk of life which not only enables its possessor to reason correctly upon
facts   possessed,    but which gives him the power of keen and accurate                    observation by
means     of which to collect the facts for himself, and prevent imposition from others.
Seeing is not       so   simple an act    as  many suppose.           Every scientist knows that it          is
one    thing to turn the eyes towards an object, but quite another thing to                     see  what is
there.     Every one's observational powers need cultivating, and "Observation                    Lessons"
are of value for this purpose, but doubly valuable when                    so arranged as to become an
incentive to logical reasoning.
     In planning this        course   these two     objects    have      been   kept in view,     and they
should     be  continually    before the teacher in charge.           If  the course   is properly taught,
pupils who have been in the habit of learning, or trying to learn, without                     independent
thought, find that it is impossible to do so in this work.                     They  are compelled to use
their eyes in collecting facts, to put these facts together, and to draw conclusions from
them.       These processes      at  their command,       they are        then   prepared for the       great
school of life, but without having acquired these processes no amount of accumulated
facts are of much value.         Teachers who have never tried this method will be astonished
by the ease with which children adopt it.           At  first,   if their previous instruction      has been
entirely by the memory method, this one seems to fail completely.                      The pupils can use
neither hands, eyes, nor minds.            They cannot experiment successfully nor see more

than a small part of what happens when the experiment is done, to say nothing of
thinking out what it all         means.       But    I  have not yet had a pupil whose habit of lean
ing upon book or teacher          was so strong that           it did not give way, within a brief space
of time, and let some       degree of self-activity show itself.              In training the pupil to self-
reliance, it is at the      very beginning that the skilful teacher has the opportunity of
doing    his best work.       I  have     tried several methods; one                extreme      is   to  assist   the
pupils in every step at the beginning, and wean                     them     gradually     ;  the other, to throw
them entirely upon their own resources                from the very beginning.               Of   the two extreme
methods the latter is the better, provided the pupil can                        be   prevented from becoming
discouraged before he gets        a  start.
     The particular method in which you conduct your class will, of course, depend upon
circumstances.      Only general directions            can be given.        Though you          have     no teaching
to do, that being done by Nature, the best of all teachers,                    nevertheless you should teach
(if  we may use the paradox) by the most successful method                         — that of example.            Be a
student of nature with your class, and acknowledge yourself such.                              Have a set of the
apparatus, try the experiments, and write your inferences just                        as  your pupils do, either
at the same time or previously.               You will       become interested in the work, and that
interest will spread      to every pupil.        That, at least, has been my experience.                   Children
are imitative, and when they see you doing and enjoying                         interesting experiments they
will wish   to do them also.        At    the same time you can easily appeal to another clement
which is still stronger in most children — that of emulation; not an unworthy incentive
to appeal to, especially     if it  is done with        skill.    They will compare their inferences one
 with   another.     Get them to compare               with yours.         You should        also    examine their
 written   work, and commend           all of it that shows independent effort.                    Frequently      you
 can commend      pupils for their discoveries, at the                 same time that you criticise their
 statements   of facts.     Always     commend         when you can, and criticise with moderation.
      There is no better way to become acquainted with your pupils, and no better oppor
 tunity for doing individual work.                It   is sometimes       claimed that it is impossible to
 individualize  with the pupils in our public schools when the classes are large                             ;  but by
 this method it becomes         comparatively easy.             After school you        have in your possession
 the notes   written     during    experiment hour, and through                   them you rapidly             become
 acquainted with your pupils, and             see   just how you can best help them.                     Frequently
 they need no help, with         the exception          of some brief marks agreed              upon to indicate
 the mistakes you wish them to correct.                  Some     pupils may need          a word of encourage
 ment   or direction, and this is usually more valuable if given in writing, though some
 times  it is better    to speak     to them       privately.        I  seldom     speak     to a pupil     in class,
 unless it is in a whisper, for the class              hour should        be   a   silent one       on the part of
 teacher as well as pupils.       If  you would have it quiet, keep quiet yourself.
     For suggestion for correcting             books     or paper's,    see  note     to  " Author's      Letter     to
 Pupils" (Lesson Sheet No. 1).                  This     method      of studying         science     furnishes     one

 of the    best    opportunities      for discipline     in   English composition         ;   for pupils        have
something to write about,             consequently      essay-writing becomes easy and pleasurable,
and pupils form the             invaluable     habits of writing upon subjects about which they
know something, and of expressing their own thoughts and discoveries.                                In fact, the
 many incidental         benefits   derived from the        course     are of more      value than even the
 physical knowledge gained.                Moreover, aside from the particular            physical facts that
 the    pupil    discovers, there        are   general   ones     of   much     greater     value      which     can
 neither   be   understood nor appreciated unless reached                  through the individual experi
 mental method        ;  such  as the    fact that the answers obtained from nature depend upon
 the questioner     ,   that they approach the truth in proportion              as  the question is properly
 put, and the answer carefully read              ;  the immutability        of the operation of nature            —
 the   fact that exactly the same cause3 always produce exactly the same results                              ;  the
 fact that there is no such thing as chance, every effect having its cause                       ;  the fact that
 the so-called    "natural laws"        are simply our explanation of Nature's uniform operations.
 By this method of study,            as   one of our critics      has put     it, " the pupil      comes    to see
 things   as  they are, and not       as he   thinks they ought to be."
                                                   APPARATUS.
      Of  no less importance than            the outline    of the course       in physics is the apparatus
 with which      the experiments are performed.               To   meet the wants of grammar schools,
 the apparatus should be neither extensive nor expensive, but                     it should   be sufficient and
of   an interesting       character.      In order    to obtain from      it  the best discipline,        not only
should the apparatus itself           be   carefully considered, but the means by which it is pro
vided.       Theoretically,      the plan for using home-made             apparatus is the best, but this
plan has usually failed to           be    very satisfactory     in practice, because of the crudeness
of the method by which it was attempted.                  Pupils will     do much in the line of making
their own apparatus after they have                   become    interested in the work, but generally
not at first.
     We     have    found    it   the   best   plan to provide the          pupil    at the    beginning with
simple apparatus for trying interesting experiments                  ; then to lead him, after his interest
in experimental science is aroused, to increase               his stock by such pieces         as he can     easily
make for himself.          No matter how simple it is, he takes more interest in experiment
ing with apparatus provided for the purpose, especially if it is of his own make, than
in using articles not set apart or especially fitted up for his purpose.                            Just    as   the
little girl    loves    her corner play-house,        with its miniature tea-set or shelves of broken
crockery, so the older child loves a little work-shop or laboratory, with                             its supplies
of his own making.
     Interest the pupil in experimental science             ;  then provide him with files and a little
glass and rubber tubing, and he             will find his own        cans and bottles, and make his own

apparatus.         We     have seen this method produce such excellent results that we cannot
too earnestly recommend it.
      In order, however,          to adapt this work        to the widest possible      range   of conditions,
it is published in two             courses, one within        the other.   The briefer one, given on the
second page of each sheet, is complete in that it brings out every essential principle
of the subjects treated.             The course, together with the apparatus which we provide, is
adapted to such schools            as, for any reason, cannot adopt the home-made              apparatus plan.
      On the fourth page of each sheet, running                  parallel with the briefer course, is given
auxiliary work         ;  this consists of clearly illustrated         directions for making extra appa
ratus for experiments which will be found useful, either to bring out the principle
sought in a different and more striking manner, or to furnish interesting applications
 of laws already learned.
      To     make    applications is      as  essential in the study of physics       as   in arithmetic, and
 for that purpose          a variety     of experiments is better, and far more interesting to the
 child, than a number of problems.                    In   a very few cases (two      or three only, in this
 first course), where applications by experiment are not practical, problems are given.
      Another benefit afforded by              the  " Auxiliary     Work "    is that  it furnishes     an easy
 entering wedge          for manual training-work,          the great intellectual    and moral,     as  well  as
 material value of which is now conceded by our best educators.                               Whenever     it   is
 possible, pupils should be permitted, or even required to make their own apparatus.
 Except        the  drilling of    holes   in glass bottles, it can be readily done        — even this is not
 so difficult as at first       it seems; it     has been repeatedly done        by the younger pupils of
 the author's classes.           Not only     does   the   pupil take more interest in performing             the
 experiments, with apparatus of his own making, but he is at the same time training the
 hands      as  well as the   mind.      Moreover, there is a fascination in the endeavor to acquire
 precision in either wood or in metal working — there is an especial                        fascination in the
  manipulation       of glass designed for apparatus.              Pupils  have  willingly devoted      most of
 their leisure time to          such work — with         the broken ends of three-cornered files, drilling
 holes     in  thick glass bottles     —   making   them     true with rat-tail files — bending and blow
 ing glass tubing        — in fact,    themselves     making from beginning to end, apparatus capable
 of use for fairly precise          quantitative results.        They did not always exactly reproduce
 things they had seen, but exercised their inventive powers, and occasionally produced
 something new.            Thus    these young pupils became           not only discoverers     in the field of
 physics, but genuine           inventors,   and they obtained a better education by such efforts
 than book study alone could ever have given them.
             DIRECTIONS        FOR OBTAINING MATERIAL                 AND MAKING APPARATUS.
       Illustrated    instructions in glass-working that will           be useful to all, whether provided
 with the regular apparatus or not, are given on early lesson sheets, under the heading

of   "Auxiliary Work"; but                 a  few preliminary directions will be especially helpful                 to
those    who make           all their own apparatus.               The body of the "100 in            1" apparatus
 (which, together with the lever, is all that is absolutely necessary for this first course)
may be made of almost any wide-mouthed bottle.                            The most difficult part of the work
lies in making the holes.                I know of but one way that is generally practicable for the
student, and that is the one mentioned above                        as used     by my own pupils.        Holes may
be made        with    a   hard steel drill held in a carpenter's brace, but the drill requires
frequent sharpening, and the novice will break more bottles than when using a broken
fde held in the hand.               In   some localities machinists can be found who                will drill  them.
It  is claimed that glass is more easily drilled when wet with turpentine, but                           I  find that
water does just          as  well either with file or drill, and            I  have  frequently made the holes
with    files without        using any liquid.          If  a file is used (and an old worn-out one is just
as  good    as  any), when the corners become dull lay the end on a piece of iron and break
off the end with a hammer.                  After   a   little practice     a very small bit at a time can be
broken off, and so the file can             be used      for drilling many holes.         Hold    the bottle firmly,
and   be satisfied     with slow progress,         especially when the hole is nearly through.
     It  is advisable to obtain the             rubber tubing first, then to make               the holes just the
size for    it  to fit snugly.         The tubing, obtained from druggists, school-supply, or rubber
dealers, should be of the best quality.                    Nothing     is more unsatisfactory than         £>oor  rub
ber for the short pieces            that unite glass tubes and bottle.                For that    purpose   even the
best quality,      if  very thin-walled, does not work well.                    Each set of apparatus requires
about three feet, and,           if  the best is obtained, the short pieces can be cut from the long
one, and,      if lost, easily replaced.          One inch, however, of the best quality and thick
ness, together       with     three    feet of cheaper        tubing   (if it is not    the poor, half-clay stuff,
which you can detect by rubbing with the fingers), will answer very well.                                   The soft
glass tubing should be of medium thickness, for,                        if thin, it breaks      too easily for chil
dren's use.         A     good quality       is  furnished        by school-supply       dealers,   at  prices from
fifty to seventy-five cents per pound.                    The glass tubing should be a very little larger
than the hole in the rubber, so that it will make the connection with the bottle not only
water- but air-tight, even under the pressure of two or three atmospheres.                             As   the glass
tubing is sure to vary somewhat in size, select carefully that which fits best for pieces
that are used         in    bottle holes.        Other sizes        may be used for Pressure Gage,             Equal
Armed Siphon, Siphon Fountain, etc.                   ;   even    the pieces     to be used in the stopper may
vary more than those in bottle holes.                    The latter should not vary         a  thirty-second of an
inch in order to work well.                 The variation        may be greater, however, with thick             than
with thin rubber connectors or packing.
     Corks, if of the best quality, may be used quite successfully for most of the experi
ments, though rubber stoppers                 are much better.           If   corks are used, soften      by rolling
them on the floor with the foot, using considerable pressure,                        after which make the holes
with a rat-tail file,          if not provided with regular cork-borers.                  If  rubber stoppers are

used, get the best    ;   though the difference in price of rubber stoppers is considerable,
it is not comparable with the difference in satisfaction            afforded, and the best will last
much longer without          becoming hard.       We   have   been using some     for four years that
are yet excellent;      and others that were very good at first are now so hard                as  to be
utterly worthless.      The difference in the length of wear of rubber tubing is even greater
than that of stoppers.           We    have four-holed stoppers of the best shape         and   material
made on purpose      for the work       ; but the best quality with two holes, always to       be found
on the market, do just as well for nearly every experiment, provided they fit the bottles
perfectly.     They should       enter but a very short distance, and should not flare enough to
prevent being crowded in, nearly their entire length.                 Most stoppers    flare too much
to  work well in    some experiments, unless          the neck of the bottle flares nearly as much.
The holes should admit          the glass tubes easily, when the stopper is not inserted in the
bottle.    For  these    reasons,    stoppers   and rubber tubing should first       be selected,   then
glass tubing obtained, and the holes in the bottle made to correspond.                 Stoppers of the
same make aud number are of the same size, but not so are the mouths of bottles of the
same    " batch."   They vary more than most dealers will admit.              Hence the stopper and
the   bottle should     be seen     to fit perfectly before  labor is expended in hole-making.
     If  you collect pickle or similar bottles (which can usually be done cheaper than
 buying from dealers) and order stoppers and tubing by mail, specify that the outside
 diameter of the glass tubing must            be the same as that of the hole in stopper,       and the
 diameter of hole in rubber tubing a very little less.
     We give below the price and number of the best two-holed stoppers furnished by
 the  Franklin Educational          Company of Boston (as satisfactory a company as we have
 ever dealt with), for the smallest-mouthed bottles that are convenient both to obtain
 and to use.
     No. 10, price 45 cents, is a trifle too large and No.         9 is  not large enough for a 1\-
 inch hole, but just right for sizes between \\ and 1| inches.             From 1| to lyff, No. 11,
 price 50 cents.     From 1| to 1|, No. 12, price 55 cents.             No. 12 is exactly     \\  inches
 diameter at the smaller end, hence will not work well for all experiments in a 1-J-inch
 mouth, but will for one a trifle more or less than 1|.               These stoppers have holes the
 same size, namely,        \  inch diameter ; No. 9 has smaller holes.          Price of an excellent
 rubber tubing to fit     -^-inch  glass is 8 cents per foot   ; of the very best (the same we use
 and furnish), 10 cents.         The same size tubing (half clay) can be bought for 4 cents.
                      THE      "100   IN  1"  PHYSICAL SCIENCE       APPARATUS.
     In order  to meet the wants of such as cannot make             all their apparatus,    we furnish
 sets for the first course (the qualitative          study of water and air), at the lowest price
 consistent with    the best material and workmanship.              These sets include everything
 needed    by each pupil,       with the exception of a tin spice, or baking-powder             can and

cover, which he can usually bring from home.                                          Instead of bottles with drilled                                 holes
we have             devised a glass cylinder,                     the    " Apparatus,''             which        is much better.                       This

                                                       cylinder is made of clear pressed glass,                                    consequently

each pupil, from which to supply the bottle, and in which many of the experiments are
performed,              is   the only one           absolutely necessary               under all conditions.                        We mention
several used for that purpose,                         that choice may be made according to circumstances.
A somewhat expensive thing, but                             the best,     is   the glass battery jar,                 6   inches in diameter
and     7   inches deep, illustrated                  in   Exp.    8    and    9.    A     cheap substitute which does very
well, in fact just                as    well in most experiments,               is   a   certain make of fruit jar,                       5]         inches

   A        wide-mouthed               battle,   holding   a   pint or more, and            a     small towel are very convenient,
since with the bottle, on many days the large dish of water                                           is   not needed.
      If    work     is      done on sloping          desks with lids, blocks to level the lids are better than
books      ;   if   desk       tops are stationary and slope,                   blocks are necessary                      to level       a      tray on
which to experiment.
   A        tray or shallow                 pan.     As    some       water     is   unavoidably                spilled,         even     the         most
careful pupil will usually need                        a    pan, unless working on specially prepared laboratory
table       or where          a   little water        is   not objectionable.

     Every class should have a rat-tail file for common use, unless each pupil provides his
own tools       ;    with this, an awl, or nail, each one can make for himself several valuable
additional          pieces of apparatus,              at no expense        in money and but little in time.                             Corks
for extra bottles           are easily perforated with                the file, so that tubes               of the regular sets
will fit.      Small tin cans, such              as those       for baking-powder, spices, etc., are easily obtain
able, and can be punched with the                         awl or nail         ;   then    the hole can be easily enlarged
with the file until the tubes fit.   With the rat-tail file holes are easily made through

                                                        THE LABORATORY.
     It   is   now conceded that the laboratory                       is   one of the first essentials                   of every well-
equipped school, outranking                       in    importance even             the library.         The education there
obtained       is    more   practical and of the kind to which civilization                                  is       chiefly indebted.
That      the laboratory has not found its way into every school                                   is    due, in part at least,
to the usually great expense of its equipment                              and maintenance.                 It   is    believed that in
this course, for one so valuable, the laboratory expense                                   has been reduced                  to the mini
mum, and that in no school are                          the    difficulties       in the way of its introduction                        insur
mountable.            Not only     the apparatus itself, but the other provisions for the work, may
be more or less extensive, according                            to conditions.            Pupils   can do all their experi
menting at home on the kitchen table, or wherever convenient.                                                    It    can be done           on
ordinary school-desks,            in trays, or shallow pans, leveled with blocks                             if       the desks slope         ;
the apparatus when                not in         use being         kept in the            boxes    stacked in the corner of
the room, or on shelves.                    In    most school-rooms               there    are one or more               walls against
which narrow tables can be fastened                             with hinges and,           if   in the way, let down when
not in use      ;    the cupboards or shelves for apparatus being placed                                above.          If   there      is   not
table     room       for an entire class, the class                  may work in sections at different hours,                                 in
which case sets of ajmaratus for one section                               is     all that will be needed.                    It   is   advis
able, however, when               convenient, that               a   room,        even    though small, be set apart for
laboratory work.             Its fittings         need        not be elaborate,           tables   being the only absolute
necessity,          though water and gas are exceedingly convenient.                               Water must                be    provided
in some way, even            if   it   is   brought in pails.              Gas also       is
                                                                                          a     necessity        if    glass apparatus
is   to be      manufactured.               A jet for         each one or two pupils               of   a   section          is    very con
venient, though much may                         be    done with      but one jet in the room, by using rubber
tubing long enough to bring the gas to the table. where                                   it   may be connected with either

a common     or a Bunsen burner, or the glass-cutter, according to the work for which it is
desired.
    Appliances for the second course, which continues the study of air and water, but in
a more   decidedly quantitative    manner,  differ but little from those used for the first,
some additional     apparatus being required and furnished, though most of it is easily
made by the pupil.        But for the third subject —-Heat — gas is necessary for experi
menting,   as well  as for constructing apparatus.
    The study of heat should follow, and constitute        a part of that of air and water, and
so fit the pupil    for the study, either in or out of school, of the constantly varying
phenomena     of the seasons, and such practical subjects     as house heating, ventilating, etc.
    Where    a room   with tables and gas is not available for grammar schools, but is for
the high school, the first, or first and second courses, may profitably be given in the last
year of the former, and heat in the first year of the latter.
    The   teacher will perceive, by examination         of the material selected   and method
employed, what the author has learned by experience, that this course is just            as avail
able for high- as for gram mar-school   pupils.    It is for the beginner in physics, whatever
his age or advancement in other studies      ;  the older or abler pupils    can do more com
plete  work, and perhaps       accomplish in one      or two    months what would      profitably
occupy others for a year.       This great elasticity   to adaptability is one of the strongest
features of the course.

           DIRECTIONS            FOR ADJUSTING THE "100 IN 1" PHYSICAL
                                       SCIENCE APPARATUS.
      Before attempting         to perform any experiment, read these         direction* carefully     and,
follow    them closely.
      In every experiment, unless otherwise directed,            the holes   in the bottle (see illus
 tration, Exp. 2) or " 100 in        I Apparatus"     should  be plugged.
      To plug    the hole in the bottom, stand the bottle or Apparatus           bottom upwards, wet
 thoroughly a ^-inch piece of rubber tubing or "packing"; insert a shot large enough
 to slightly stretch the tubing just barely into one end; thrust the free end into the
 hole until the shot-loaded end is even with the outer surface               ; then, with the thumb
 push the shot well into the packing.            The holes may also be plugged with small corks,
 or with rubber stoppers.          The shot-loaded piece of rubber tubing, however, makes by
 far the best plug.       The side holes may be plugged in the same manner.               To   remove      a
 plug, push the shot through with a nail           ; then remove the packing.
      The side holes may        be plugged with the small glass jet-tubes (see Exp. 2) as fol
 lows: wet     a  "cap"     or |-inch piece of rubber tubing with a shot in the end, and push
 it over   the small end of the jet-tube      ; put a piece of packing just barely over the other
 end; then seizing that part of the packing stretched by the glass, push it into the hole,
 and then with a twisting motion thrust the tube in until it is held firmly.
      To connect any      glass tube with the bottle or apparatus, put a piece of packing             over
 the end of the tube      ;  grasp it at the place where the rubber is distended          by the glass      ;
 insert the packing into the hole, and then push in the tube until it is held firmly.                     If
 the rubber packing is pushed clear through the hole — which may happen                     if the glass
 tube is the least particle smaller than         it should  be — thrust  the end of the glass     tube a
 little further into    the packing, wipe the latter dry, and try again.
      To   remove a jet-tube or other glass tube from a hole, seize        it firmly  near the packing
 and draw     it out with    a twisting  movement.
      Never leave wet packing, caps, or other rubber on a glass tube               ; after drying they
 are apt to stick to each other so firmly that the glass            may be broken in removing            it.
 The glass      tubes  are not easily broken, but         they are not intended for rough usage             ;
 with decent      care they   will last a lifetime.
      If a long piece of rubber tubing has been used with water, blow the latter out before
 putting the tubing away.           Sheet rubber should be dried with a cloth.
      Do not attempt to perform any experiment in a careless, slipshod manner.                    If  you
 are not careful and orderly, you cannot hope for success in any pursuit.                Begin now by
 being careful of your apparatus.           Try  to be exact   ; always do your work neatly         ; and
 always put your apparatus away in good order when you have finished your work.

and weigh or heft again.
      Inferences. 1. What does this experiment teach about water ?
 2. Would it have weight if there were no force pulling or pushing
 it towards the earth ? 3. Is it the same force that causes a ball
thrown upward to fall back to the earth? 4. Dtt you know its
name ?      [It has a name, but we do not know much about it.]                           Exp. 6.
5.  Towards what point in the earth does this force pull every
thing on the earth ? 6. Draw a circle to represent the earth, and illustrate the direction
objects fall on different sides of the earth, showing where they would meet if they could fall
through the earth as easily as through air.
     Exp. 5. Cap        the small ends of the jet-tubes, and insert them             in the side holes, as
in Exps.     2   and   3,   fill   the Apparatus    with water, and
remove     the cap from lower jet-tube.
     Inference. In         what other direction     than downwards
does water press ?
     Exp. 6. Upon           three     marbles,  touching each other
on a smooth surface, place a fourth.
     Inference. What causes the three                 to roll    apart?
Now explain why water presses sideways.
     Exp.    7.   Fill   the      Apparatus    with   water, hold it
                                                                                              Exp. 7.

     To break     the   tubing   squarely, scratch it with the           file,  then    hold  it with     the
                                                   thumbs opposite the scratch, and break            as  you

                                                   melted smooth in the Bunsen burner.              To  close
                                                   the end, or to partly close       it  so that  it may   be
                                                   used as a jet, hold     it in  the hottest part of the
Bunsen blaze, and keep turning it             till   the hole is small enough.          To bend it,    use a
common gas jet, not very large, and                 turn it while heating.         A little   practice will
enable    you to do it neatly.          The    cut below shows how to make                 a small   funnel
from a glass tube, by using the Bunsen burner and                a piece   of charcoal sharpened like a
pencil.
     If  not supplied      with    gas,  you     can
shape    thin glass tubing with an alcohol or
a common     flat-wick oil lamp, but it is very
difficult work.     Skillful glass-blowers       can
work     with   crude     apparatus     and     poor
materials, but pupils not accustomed to the
manipulation     of glass require the best of
appliances.      Do    not try    to  hurry    your
work.      When    the   glass  begins    to   yield
under the action of the heat, do not bend or shape it too rapidly.                   Unless necessary, do
not bend a tube at too sharp an angle.               In the above cut the tube is bent at a sharper
angle than is usually        desired.

      Aux.     2.    Though         most pupils         see    the principle      in Exp. 14 without             extra dishes,
better have two additional pieces, a beer bottle and a lamp chimney or tin funnel, the
latter corked and standing in                     a   bottle.     Being needed but once, and for only half                       a
minute, one set will do for                 a class     if   placed where the pupils can use              it in turn —       each
using his own pressure gage                  if   the work is all done at school               ;   all with   the same gage,
if regular experiments                  are done at home, and only the auxiliaries at school.                            A   very
neat funnel-dish is made by cutting                          a beer    bottle, corking and standing the neck part
inverted in         the"   lower.

                                                                         With thin     glass, the crack        will follow the
gas jet quite steadily without much heating ahead                                 ;   but thick glass         cracks by " fits
and starts."           After      some practice you can dispense with the scratch,                        except an inch or
two where the crack is to be started.      Sharp edges are smoothed with a wet file. A
" half-round " file, one that is flat on one side and curved on the other, is best for this
purpose, especially for the inner edge.                         Thin    bottles may be cut with a flat-wick oil lamp,
but the line must            be scratched         entirely around, and even then the glass will not always
crack where desired.
      With little           practice bottles          may be cut
into spirals from end                   to end,       after which
they can           be stretched         considerably without
breaking; when released the glass will resume
its original length with                a sharp   click, showing
its great elasticity.                  Test-tubes,      lamp chimneys,            thin glass tumblers, and beakers
are very easily spiraled.
      The latter the author has so cut                       as to be    stretched to twice their original length.
The smaller part of               a chimney,       like the one used for Aux.             1, on sheet         III.,   the author
cut into       a    spiral of     60   coils within      a    length of   8 inches.      The diameter of the chimney
was    1-|   inches.        If you     can estimate the present length of that 8-inch piece of glass, you
will   find that       it   is   more than three times that of your height.

     A mercury air-pump             may     be   constructed        with   parts     of    three   pupils'  sets  of
apparatus.      With this pump nearly all                 the   air may     be    taken from a bottle.          The
apparatus    itself is very cheap, but its use requires
considerable     mercury       (none of which           need      be
wasted, however), time, and attention.                 It   is well
worth    constructing,      if only for        the   purpose      of
studying its operation.          If   provided with     a    retort-
stand and   a glass    funnel, they may         be used    instead
of Apparatus       a,   and its supporting           blocks.      A
screw-clamp for regulating the flow of mercury, is
better than the clothespin.           In  place of Apparatus
b,  one may use a small inverted               bottle with the
bottom cut off.         A single       tube    (represented       as
broken) reaches from b to c. If the pump is used
for practical purposes, and a nearly perfect vacuum
is desired, this tube should be about two and a half
feet long, with a thicker wall and smaller hole than
those commonly used.            If  used only for the pur
                                                                                                      Exp. 77.
pose of study, two or three pieces well connected
with short pieces         of rubber tubing         will answer very well. If a small amount of
mercury is used, the experimenter is              kept busy pouring it back into a. Two tumblers
should be used; then by tipping              c a little  to empty it, time        enough during which there
is no flow from       it  is obtained      in which to change dishes.               If  the glass tubes between,
b  and d do not nearly or quite touch each other, the rubber tube will be compressed (as
shown in picture) so much as to prevent getting a free flow of the air from d.                                    If
they do touch, by keeping the rubber attached                        to d, with a       little  care they   can  be
disconnected without allowing any air to enter.                    In order    to secure the largest number
of observations,    tube    e, in which they are made, should              be a   long one.

     To study       the operation of this pump, use        it first with water, without      the long delivery,
having in its place a short rubber tube hanging in a dish to catch the water.                         With  the
hand, alternately compress              and release the bulb; note what happens.                By experiment
find how to hold the pump to deliver a stream of water, and retain considerable air in
 each bottle     ;  how to retain air in one bottle only             ; and how to fill both with water.
 Explain    the working of the pump, naming each force in order, beginning with the force
 that compresses         the bulb.        Be particularly   careful about the second and third forces,
 for very likely you will overlook one of them.                   Does the pump act differently with air
 than with water?             Try     each,  and devise    your own means for determining              whether
 there  is any difference in principle.              The apparatus with delivery tube, shown in the
 picture, is used to illustrate the circulation of blood.               The pump represents the heart          ;
 the tube, between         the pump and the rattan, an artery           ;  the rattan, the capillaries    ; the
 tube beyond, which should rest in the tumbler of water, represents                       a vein.
     Every time you          squeeze      the bulb, the water spurting        from the notch in the glass
 tube at the right of the rattan illustrates the manner in which one loses blood when an
artery is severed.          Slip   the rubber tube over that hole and work               the pump   ; the slow
 but steady leaking from the rattan and the other glass notch illustrates                        how a wound
 bleeds when capillaries or a vein is cut.             With    the tube   lying    on the table while working
 the pump, press upon the tube, or bend                 it sharply beyond        the rattan  ; the extra spurt
of water from the jet-tube illustrates how the circulation of blood is increased by exercise.
     Aux. 19. An intermittent                spring is one that does not flow all the time, but has
alternate periods of flow and rest.               The periods of rest come generally after a long dry
spell, and sometimes             not  till
the dry spell has ended and             it
is again rainy weather.             This
picture    illustrates       the     con
ditions of a hill from which
there issued such a spring, un
til a railway was cut through
it  and   the      spring     was     de
stroyed.      In     the   hill   was    a
cavern seamed           with     numer
ous    small       cracks       through                                   Aux. li).
which ran the water that filled it.             The water flowed out through         a single arched opening.
     Inferences.         1. Explain how the flow       became    intermittent under varying conditions of
weather.      2.   Under what conditions might         a drought come and go        without the flow of water
ceasing ? 3.       If  it stopped flowing, how much rain or melted snow would have to find its way
into the cave before it started again ?

                                Aux. 29.       This  is a student lamp, the operation of which is
                           easily studied, as with the exception of a cork and two nails,                it  is
                           made entirely        of glass.    The cork tightly fits the inverted half
                           bottle, and is perforated for        a tube     through which the oil reaches
                           the wick.      Two nails     are driven into the cork and, with the tube,
                           form the support for the lamp.              The chimney rests on the tube
                           and two bits of wood, which are separated                just enough    to allow
                           sufficient draft, the latter        being easily adjusted        by experiment.
                           This    piece, which is easily made, furnishes also a valuable aux-
          Aux. 29.         iliary experiment in        the study of combustion.
     Aux. 30. This is        an easily made and a very serviceable force-pump for use with
either   liquids    or gases.     With    a single piece      of rubber tubing in place of the long
sectional    one    shown in the picture, it may be used                 for pumping      air wherever      in
previous lessons       the  "atomizer      bulb" is     recommended.          It works    equally    well   in
pumping or forcing a stream             of water.      The rubber bulb, which           contains no valve,
should    be as   heavy and elastic      as possi
ble.    One end of a bent tube is fitted
tightly into it by       means   of a piece of
rubber     tubing,    the   other    end    passes
through a stopper containing           two holes
                                                                               Aux. 30.
into   one   of    the   small   bottles.      The
bottles are connected by a piece of glass tubing which has upon one end a valve like
those   in the apparatus for pumping water (Exp. 42). A similar valve is placed upon
the end of the tube passing through the edge of the other bottle.                        The holes in the
bottles may be drilled each in the center of the bottom              ;  if  done with a file they are more
easily made in the edges.         Glass tubes are fastened in tightly with bits of rubber tubing.
The glass tube with the valve on the end should be longer than the bottle.                        It  is first
inserted through the neck        ;  then   if desired,   it may  be shortened.       The long   tube shown
in the picture is made of rubber, glass tubes, and a short piece of rattan.                       The glass
tube   in the outer end is a jet-tube          ; each of the other two has a        small notch filed in it,
and is of such size        as  to allow      the  rubber tube     to slide over the       notch to prevent
leakage.     The piece of rattan also has a small notch cut in it.                   A  glass tube bent at
a sharp angle, inserted in the end of a rubber tube                  and hung upon the edge of the
tumbler, keeps in place better than rubber tubing.                (Continued       on sheet  XV.)

    Exp. 35.     Fill the Apparatus       with water and place a piece of card over the mouth.
With    one hand hold the card       in place, while inverting          the   Apparatus  with the other
over a dish, to catch the water        if  the experiment should          fail.
Remove your hand from the card.               In   the same way repeat
with disc of wood, metal (iron, zinc, or lead), and glass.                 Re
peat, using a piece of wet cheese-cloth,            silk veiling, or wire
netting.      Repeat    again, and uncap the            jet-tube    near the
bottom     of the Apparatus.
     Inference.    See  Aux.  13.
    Exp. 36. Tie       sheet rubber over the mouth of the Appa
ratus,   and   attach the long rubber tube to either side hole.                   Suck a little air from
the Apparatus and pinch the rubber tube                to prevent its returning.        Turn    the mouth
of the Apparatus in every direction.
     Inferences.     1.  What more about air pressure does this teach you than did Exps.            34 and
35 ?    2.  Compare with water pressure.         3. What force causes it ?
                                  Exp. 37. Use your hand instead of the sheet rubber, and
                             suck out all the air you can. Turn your hand over and in every
                             direction.      If  the experiment is well done,        the Apparatus     will
                             not fall off.      You   can hardly     pull it off.
                                   Inference. Why           ?
                                  Exp. 38. Suck          the air from the small bottle, and stick     it  to

   Aux. lO. The rubber bulb of                      an atomizer, found at drug or rubber stores, makes                           a
valuable addition         to your          apparatus, increasing              the     beauty and instructiveness                of
several    experiments in air.              Attach it    to the rubber tube in               Exp.    32, and   it   represents
the pump on the deck of a wrecking                       vessel, pumping              air down to the workmen in a.
diving-bell.

not necessary      to take for granted that air has weight.                            If   you have strong lungs, the
following Apparatus will show it clearly                  ;   and   if you     have not, you should practice               until

which a jet of water rises higher than its source.                                                The upper part is the top of a
                     large bottle          ;    the central piece is the longer part of a lamp chimney,                                like the
                     one used in            Aux.          1 ;    the lower part is the            Apparatus.        The lamp chimney
                     is easily cut at the narrow place by the aid of a triangular                                      file and the gas

                     this apparatus never needs taking apart                                ;   for, by inverting     it,   the reservoir       is
                     filled and the surplus of water in the bottle                                is   discharged through the jet-tube.
                     If   the tubes do not discharge freely,                          a    little careful shaking of         the apparatus

than its source, some of                        it    passing several times from one bottle to the other before the
action finally ceases.                         If   the apparatus be carefully constructed, the water strikes the

difference between solids (such as glass, wood, iron, etc.) and liquids, (such as water, oil,
etc.).    8. When water becomes              a solid, or ice, has it more or less cohesion ?             9. What

     Aux. 27. This           is an intermittent fountain made of an ordinarily shaped quart bottle,
the top of another used            simply      as   a stand for the first, the bottom            of a
larger bottle, a glass fruit jar, and pieces of tubing and corks.                        For greater
stability,    the   apparatus-tube         <?, which       is bevelled at both ends, should
touch the dish at its lower, and the cork at its upper end.                         It needs not be
so long as      shown in the cut       ;  it would better         be  short enough to allow the
bottle to rest upon its stand, into which it is firmly fitted with a cork.
Tube a is the one that furnishes the intermittent stream, and                           if the appa
ratus be adjusted with care, another tube                        like it    may    be fitted to the
opposite     side of the bottle.         Without very careful adjustment, however, air
will enter     one    tube, and thus prevent              an intermittent        flow from either    ;
hence you would better make the fountain                      with    a single tube at first, then
add the second         if desired.    A    cap is placed upon this tube while the bottle
is being filled and corked.           Tube      b  leading from the large dish to the jar
below furnishes a steady stream,                  and    has a smaller opening than             a; if
small    enough, the          fountain will run for            an hour or more,         intermitting
perhaps      every other minute.              If  the holes in the bottles used must be
drilled, have the one in this dish at or near the center, but                          if you   make
                                                                                                          Aux. 27.
them with files, the easiest way is to make the hole in this dish at the edge
like  the one for tube a, and make               b   with a double bend leading into the jar through
a notch filed in the edge of its mouth.                  If  large, the stand may also need notching.
     Aux. 28. This might            be called a fountain sponge.               The principle of its action is the
                   same as that of the         common fountain ink-well. The lower halves of two
                   bottles are connected by              a  short piece of tubing.           In  one of the bottle-
                   bottoms is placed the sponge; the other is placed like a cap over the mouth
                   of a bottle filled with water, which is then inverted.                       The sponge    keeps
                   moist for weeks or months, according to size of bottle and condition of
                   the atmosphere.           The water escapes only by evaporation from the sponge,

about the so-called physical properties of water.               You   can also mention one force that
has a great deal to do with these           properties.     There are other forces always operating
which you will       discover    in connection with         the   study of the      next subject — Air.
Before beginning the study of air it would be advisable that you state again, clearly
and briefly   as  possible,   all you have discovered about water.

     Exp. 21. Lower and            raise the stopper alternately,
and   see   if you  can   tell with your eyes shut when it
enters or leaves the water.             Try  also the wooden ball.
     Inference. Explain          as   fully and carefully       as you
can why the stopper when under water seems                    to weigh
less, and why the ball floats.
     Note. — Later in     our course we shall have         several very
interesting experiments      similar to this one; but you ought to
see clearly now what causes this buoyant force of water, as it is
called.   Is a fish or a stone as heavy in water as it is out?
Explain.
     Exp. 22. Push          the    Apparatus      along the       table
with your pencil.                                                               Exp. 21.
     Inference. In       what one direction only is the pressure which your hand applies               to the
                                                   pencil transmitted to the Apparatus ?
                                                        Exp. 23. With       the  Apparatus   full of water,

                                                   with your fingers.
                                                        Inference.     Compare with Exp. 22, and explain the
                                                   difference   between solids and liquids in transmitting

     Aux.   7.  A   fine auxiliary    piece   may be made        by tying sheet rubber over the large
end of a lamp chimney.             Fill  the latter     with water, and insert the stopper or a cork
with tubes,    as  illustrated, and press on the rubber.
     Aux. 8. (Study this figure, if not provided with the
apparatus.)       Connect a tube with piston to two others
of the same size,      as  illustrated.    With     the water at equal
depth in each, insert the piston in the middle one, and
transfer the water to the other two.
     Inference. How much pressure on the surface of the
water in each    will balance one unit on the surface of water
in middle tube    ?    Does the amount of pressure transferred to
each side tube bear the same relation         to that on the piston, as
the amount of water transferred bears to that at first in the
middle   tube ? What things are in the same relation to each                   Aux. 7.                Aux. 8.
other as applied and transmitted pressure ? Did you make
them so in inferences to Exp. 27 ?
     Aux. 9. This picture illustrates           the   " hydrostatic " or
water press, a machine which enables               one with but     little
force to exert great pressure.          A pump       stands in an open
tank of water.          In  the   pump, a little     above the level of
the water in the tank, is a closed door-shaped valve, which
opens    upward      when the      piston   is pulled up, allowing
                                                                                         Aux. 9.
water to enter and fill the pump.                Why it     does so, you
probably cannot        see   at present, but you will when you study the next subject                 — Air.
In  the   pipe connecting the pump and the press is a valve opening towards the latter.
When the piston of the pump is pushed down, of course the pump-valve closes, and                           as
the water cannot be pushed out the way                 it came in,    it goes through the other door to
the press.
     Inferences.       1. Upon what fact about liquids does the great power of this press depend ?
2.  Compare it with the lever, and point out all the resemblances you can.                   3.  If the force
exerted by the press is one hundred times as great as that applied to the pump, what two
measurements are to each other as 100 to 1 ? 4.              If you consider this a "water lever," which
of the measurements must         be considered as the long arm,       which the short  ?

18 and 19 with it.      The Apparatus is not tall enough to make Exp. 18 very striking, but
for 19 it does very well.        Suspend the Apparatus full of water just above a window-sill,

of a pan under that of Apparatus.                Steadying it with one hand, carefully remove the
jetaube from the lower side hole, and let it go at the same time.
     Inference. Why        does the Apparatus swing away from the jet of water ?
     Exp. 19. With       the Apparatus        still hanging in   the window, place the elbow tube in
the lower side hole and fill with water.
     Inference. At exactly          what   point is the pres
sure that causes   it to rotate   applied ?
     Exp. 20.      Fill  the Apparatus and rubber tube
with water.     To fill  the latter, let    it lie on the table,
and pour water into the Apparatus;              then, when the
water begins to run out of the tube, plug the end
with capped jet-tube.          When     the Apparatus      is as
full  as possible, tie the piece of sheet rubber over the
mouth, and place a weight of a pound or more
upon it.     Insert    a funnel      in place of the       plug.
Pour water into      the funnel (see       note    to Aux. 6),
and raise it to the length of the tube.
     Inference. Explain        why so little water raises so
heavy a weight       See  Aux.   6.                                             Exp. 20.

                                                                           VI.
      Aux. 5. (See cut                on sheet            V.)        Exps. 18 and 19 are much better performed with                               a
tall bottle.         A quart ink or wine bottle                            does very well            ;   a hole is much more             easily
made with a file in the edge than in the side of a bottle, and does just as well for these
experiments.               Still better and               cheaper is a tin tube               a   foot or more long, corked at the
bottom,          and provided with a wire bail.                           Make the holes just above the cork, and insert
tubes       from the pupils' sets.                 If       the class      is large,        it    is better to have a piece           for each
experiment and but one piece in a window to which pupils go in turn to inspect it.
Exp.    19        may be done in a variety of ways, thus                                      :   with both tubes horizontal              in      a
large tin pan to catch the water                              ;     with the pan nearly full of water, the tubes sub
merged       ;    with    one tube       horizontal, the other at any
angle   ;    with both tubes at different angles, imitating
a lawn fountain.
      No other auxiliary                apparatus is worth so much
in proportion to its cost              as   this      ;   while performing Exp.
19,   Aux. apparatus              4 may be combined                            with Aux.
apparatus 5 by holding its jet-tube so that                                    it will play
into the top of it, thus prolonging the experiment.
      Aux. 6. Procure                a three or            four quart hot-water
bag.*        Attach to it            several       feet of rubber tubing by
means of a perforated cork and a short piece of glass
tube.        Place the bag upon the floor with a piece of
board over          it,   on which stand or place heavy weights                              ;
then pour water into the funnel at the end of the tube.

firmly against the Apparatus             till immersed two or       three inches.     If  your jar is not large
enough to admit the hand, keep the disc in place by means of a string or wire passed
under it, the ends being held in the hand.                  As   the water leaks in      until  the disc finally
falls, compare its height inside and outside of the Apparatus.

NOTES.
                  AUXILIARY APPARATUS AND EXPERIMENTS.
                                                    III.
     It is very desirable that you make the auxiliary pieces of apparatus, or at least some
of them, and perform the experiments.               But if you        do not, a careful study of them
when ever they are referred to in your regular                  lessons,   will doubtless    be   more    or
less helpful.
     Auxiliary    1.  This apparatus is      more easily made with a tin tube than with a lamp
chimney.       Obtain a tube of any size or length       ; a piece of speaking tube about 15 inches
long will answer.       Cork    the lower eud, and stick        it in  a hole bored in a block of wood.
                          The latter    serves as a stand.       With    an awl or a sharp     nail, punch
                          three holes equally distant from each other, as in the              illustration.
                          Enlarge     them   with rat-tail file, twisting it and pushing the edge
                          of the   tin inwards, so as to make a lip or " burr." Make the holes
                          equal in size to those in the "100 in          1 Apparatus."
                               If desired,  repeat   Exp.   7, using jet-tubes from pupils' set.        For
                          showing steady side pressure and its exact law, insert the U-tubes
                          with bends each half full of mercury             ; then fill tube with water,
                          and observe      not only the general effect upon the mercury, but
                          measure the amount raised           in  each tube and compare         with corre
                          sponding depths of water.
                               Infer exact law of side pressure. 1. Can you see a lever and its
                          weights inside each tube ? 2. What constitutes the lever and what the
                          weight upon each arm ? 3. At what point in each tube is the fulcrum ?
         Aux. 1.
                               Note. — To avoid confining air in the tubes, pour in water until it runs into
                          first tube, then carefully pour a little mercury into tube funnel. Treat the
second tube the same way, then pour more mercury into first if necessary, etc. To make this experi
ment of some aid to those not provided with the apparatus we have violated our general rule, which is
to show the apparatus in condition for the experiment, and not during it.             In this case we have
shown it in progress, as the pupil should, whenever he makes a drawing to illustrate an experiment.
     Caution. — When handling       mercury, be careful not to allow it to come in contact with a gold
ring, for the two metals will amalgamate, giving the ring the appearance of silver.         Should such an
accident happen, heating the ring cautiously will drive off the mercury, but the gold will need

My Dear Young Friend:
      I want to talk with you a little before we begin work — or play — - 1 may                  as  well call
it, for  tops, balls, and marbles    are by no means the most interesting things we use in this
fascinating     scientific game.     That it is    as   enjoyable    as  play to children of twelve to
fourteen years      I  know, because    the pupils     in my Boston school, of their own accord,
frequently     use their recess hour     for it, and often     come before school and on Saturdays
in order to    do more experimenting        than their regular horn's permit.           That it   is the very
 best way to learn about the world we live in, all the best teachers believe, because each
 pupil is learning directly from        a better teacher than any          living, — Nature.          Do you
 remember how Longfellow says that the                 great and good Professor            Agassiz learned
 his lessons?
                                " And Nature, the old nurse, took
                                     The child upon her knee,
                                           ' Here Ls a
                                  Saying,              story-book
                                     Thy Father has written for thee.'
                                " And he wandered away and away,
                                     With Nature, the dear old nurse,
                                  Who sang to him night and day
                                     The rhymes of the universe.
                                " And whenever the way seemed long,
                                     Or his heart began to fail,
                                  She would sing a more wonderful song,
                                     Or tell a more marvellous tale."
      Now   I  am going to ask you to adopt a motto that                  I   write upon my blackboard
 the first day of every school year, viz.       :
                                                  " Nature      is our teacher     ; all the knowledge we
 possess has come through        the patient study         of her laws."        Then, whenever you are
 tempted to ask your school teacher anything about Physical                    Science,   I  would ask you
 to stop   and think, " Why, Nature           is my teacher     ;  I must ask her."        " But,"   say you,
 "  I  don't know how."       That is true, and that       is the reason     I have arranged this series
 of questions (experiments) for you in order to tell you how to ask them.                     If  you do  as I
  direct, you will not only       be  greatly interested and instructed               by the answers      you
 obtain, but what is far better, you will learn how to put questions yourself.                      Then you
 will continue through life studying Nature wherever you                      are.    You will     become   an
 original investigator, and possibly         a  discoverer and an inventor.              All  the great dis
 coveries    and inventions     were     made     by men      who first learned         how    to   put  their
 questions to this      Great Teacher and interpret               the   answers.

     Apparatus. A             foot rule or similar stick; a dozen button dress-weights, nickels, cents, iron-washers,
or anything convenient                for weights; a small piece of wood for a fulcrum. To economize time, the upper
surface of the fulcrum should not be less than J inch wide, especially for young experimenters.                                                                         There is
on the market a small rubber eraser of excellent size and shape for a fulcrum.                                                                It is a little more than an
inch long, with each side \ inch wide.                                     "Button dress-weights," though a trifle more expensive than
iron-washers, are more uniform in weight, and being of lead, may be easily trimmed.                                                                       Exact uniformity,
though desirable, is not essential.
     Directions. The                          best way to experiment                                 with your lever                      is to balance              it on the
fulcrum, with its central mark over the center of the block.                                                                               Hold it with your left
hand near the end of its left arm,                                              while placing, — first,                        the weights               as     indicated in
diagram, then the balancing weights.                                                  If     you make               no mistake, and place the centers
of the weights          as     nearly              as     you can over the correct lines, the lever                                                will      balance      after
your hand is removed.
     Diagram       1     (on page opposite) represents the lever, as illustrated above, with one
weight on each arm 6 inches from the fulcrum. Find by experiment how many weights
on right     arm       3 inches                from fulcrum will balance                                     one at the end of                      left     arm, and put
the number in the proper place on diagram 2.
     Continue in the same way                                      till you learn how to determine without experiment, then
write the answers                   and test by experiments afterwards.                                                         If, after doing                 the first six
or seven experiments, you cannot determine, make up some of your own                                                                                          till you    can   ;
then finish the ones given.                                      If     you have              studied algebra, express each experiment in
form of an equation with the sign = in place of the fulcrum.                                                                           Express in writing what
you have discovered to be the principle of the lever.
     Where should you place 4 weights on diagram 11 ? Where                                                                     3 more on diagram 12 ?
     Problem       1.        Two boys are playing sea-saw on a plank balanced across a log. One is
twice as heavy as the other.                                   Which should sit nearer the log, and how much ? Illustrate
with picture or diagram.
     Problem       2.        A      man uses a crowbar                            G feet long, and places a stone for a fulcrum 6 inches
from the lower end. With                                100        pounds' pressure at the upper end, how much can he lift at
the lower ? Illustrate.
     Make up a few lever problems of your own and illustrate them.                                                                                  Mention           as many
objects as you can                think of that illustrate                                  the principle of the lever.

      Now let me tell you how to study this course,                                    that it may afford you the most
pleasure and profit.                    First. Perform every experiment in order.    Do not omit one
because      it looks        so simple that you      think you know all about it. None of us knows all
about anything.             Always experiment carefully and thoughtfully.
                              Second.                                       If you work
hurriedly, carelessly, or without watching to see everything that happens, and without
thinking out for yourself the reason for         will do you little or no good. And of
                                                                      it,   it
course,     if   you must not            be      told ivhy anything happens, you should not tell your class
mate and so deprive him of the pleasure and benefit of discovering for himself.                                                      Possibly
you may perform                   an experiment              and not     see     the why of       it   at first;       if    so, give    it   a
little careful thought, remember                          the what, and perhaps           the very next experiment will
show you the why.                    If, however, two or            three experiments do not help you out of your
difficulty, probably you have not done the previous work well enough, and would better
review it. Third. When you see what an experiment teaches, you must tell   in your                                              it
own language on paj)er. It will not do you half the good to give in spoken words                             it                                ;
you must write it.                   For this purpose         we provide you with blank leaves.                              Number each
inference       — that        is, what the experiment teaches you                       — and write          it    directly opposite,
at the time you do the experiment.                            Your thought being chiefly on                    the experiment and
what       it   teaches,         you will not express               it   in the very best language, now, without
mistakes     ;    therefore          you should rewrite it.               Let    me    tell you our method, for                   it   is    the
best we have               yet discovered.           After experimental work our pupils                            have        an hour for
writing         the    lesson    ;   this they do on ruled note-books                     in the         form of         a     chapter on
science.         Each       lesson     is   dated   ;   it   begins    at the top of         a   page and         is   written only on
the    right or        else the        left hand        side (always the same), the other being                          left for correc
tions.      The        experiment, observation, and inference                           are      given   ;   the       first    is   usually
illustrated       with       a   small drawing.1
      The pupils preserve                their books and at the end of the year                     it   is
                                                                                                         a        good plan to have
them bound.                Pupils prize       these books more           highly than any            others        in their libraries,
for they are entirely of their own making.                               What     ask you
                                                                                  I                    to do    is      one thing        that
did       much towards the discipline                      of George Washington,                 for we are told upon good
authority that "             he made his own school-books."
      Hoping that you will                    do likewise          and meet with success through life,                       I    am your
true friend and fellow-student,
