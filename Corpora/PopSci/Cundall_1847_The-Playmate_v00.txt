                  THE PLAYMATE'S ADDRESS.
    It  is a holiday.   Come, then, let us take a quiet stroll along
the meadow, and up by yon fragrant hedge-row, and let us sit
together on that mossy bank beneath the shade of those over
hanging trees, and look upon the far-extending landscape, and      I
will tell you tales that will keep you listening there for hours
together ; for this is summer-time, and it is very pleasant to be in
the clear air, and hear the birds singing
                                        " through the woods.

    But when the winter evenings         bring their cheerful fireside
gatherings,   and  boys and  girls crowd  round the blazing hearth at
home, and enjoy it the more because of the cold nights at school,
I will beg for a snug seat in the corner, and will tell you elder ones
long tales of wars and travels, of famous men, of knight-errantry,
and of days of the olden time; to the gentle girls, your sisters,
I  will sing sweet ballads, and read poetry and pleasant stories,
full of charming adventures ; and to you, youngsters,       will unfold I
the wondrous marvels that are found in faerie land and ancient
fable, and the greater marvels still that are discovered in the wide
domains of Nature.       And though you shall all be merry and
laugh heartily at my humorous histories, and though you shall
all be sad, and almost weep at my pathetic ballads ; yet withal
will we be wise, and ever will we bear in mind our motto, "Inter
folia fructus."    There shall be fruit among these leaves, not such
sour-flavoured windfalls as you too often pick up, but fruit that is
ripe and good, and that will be pleasant as well as profitable.
     Do you love pictures ?        I
                                will give you such as a playmate has
seldom offered you before.     Pictures by artists well known to fame.
Pictures that will serve for copies to the cleverest of you ; that will
not only please, but will teach you, and lead you to an early
knowledge of all the best principles of art.
     In conclusion, my only desire          is,
                                         that you may all, young and
old, consider me what         wish to he,

                                  I
every  fresh visit to your homes.
                                                              Your Playmate.

To Artois forest prancing forth            A   golden mantle wrapt him round,
  In all his princely pride.                   Pinn'd with a silver pin.
To grace his sports a courtly train        The sudden sight surprised them all      ;
  Of gallant peers attend  ;                 The courtiers gather"d round       ;
And with their loud and cheerful cries     They look, they call, the mother seek        ;
  The hills and valleys rend.                No mother could be found.

    And stretch'd his little hands.               His cruel rage to still :"
Now, by the rood, king Pepin says,            Up then rose sir Valentine,
   This child is passing fair :                   And claim' d that arduous deed.
I  wot he is of gentle Mood ;
                                              " Go forth and conquer," said the king,
                                                  " And great shall be thy meed."
   Perhaps some prince's heir.
Go hear him home unto my court                To Artois forest he repairs
   With all the care ye may :                     With all the haste he may     ;
Let him be christen'd Yalentine,              And soon he spies the savage youth
    In honour of this day :                       A rending of his prey.
And look me out some cunning nurse          ; His unkempt hair all       matted hung
    Well nurtur'd let him he ;                    His shaggy shoulders round :
Nor aught be wanting that becomes             His eager eye all fiery glow'd :
    A bairn of high    degree.                    His  face with fury frown'd.
Thus     grew the little Valentine,            Like   eagles' talons grew his nails :
    Belov'd of king and peers ;                   His limbs    were thick and strong    ;
And shew'd in all he spake or did              And dreadful was the knotted oak
    A wit beyond his years.                       He bare with him along.
But chief in gallant feats of arms             Soon as sir Valentine approach'd,
    He did himself advance,                       He starts with sudden spring ;
That ere he grew to man's estate               And yelling forth a hideous howl,
    He had no peer in France.                     He made the forests ring.
And now the early down began                   As when     a tiger fierce and fell
    To shade his youthful chin ;                  Hath   spied a passing roe,
When Valentine was duhb'd a knight,            And leaps at once upon his throat      ;
    That he might glory win.                       So sprung the savage foe ;
"A     boon, a boon, my gracious liege,         So lightly leap'd with furious force
     I beg a boon of thee !                        The gentle knight to seize :
                                                But met his tall uplifted spear.
 The first adventure'that befalls,
     May be reserv'd for me."                      Which sunk him on his knees.
 " The first   adventure   shall be thine ;"    A  second stroke so stiff and stern
     The king did smiling say :                    Had laid the savage low ;
 Nor many days, when lo ! there came            But springing up, he rais'd his club,
     Three palmers clad in gray.                   And aim'd a dreadful blow.
 " Help,graciouslord," theyweepingsaid;         The watchful warrior bent his head,       ,
     And knelt, as it was meet :                   And shunn'd the coming stroke ;>
  " From Artois forest we are come,             Upon his taper spear it fell,
     With weak and weary feet.                     And all to shivers broke.
  "Within    those deep and dreary woods        Then lighting nimbly from his steed.
      There dwells a savage boy;                   He drew his burnish'd brand :
  Whose fierce and mortal rage doth yield       The savage quick as lightning flew
      Thy subjects dire annoy.                     To wrest it from his hand.

      He lurks within their den ;                  Three times he felt the blade ;
  With bears he lives ; with bears he feeds,    Three times it fell with furious force ;
      And drinks the blood of men.                  Three ghastly wounds ibmade.

Then closing fast with furious gripe          Then binding strait his conquer'd foe
   He clasp'd the champion round,                Fast with an iron chain,
And with a strong and sudden twist            He ties him to his horse's tail,
  He laid him on the ground.                     And leads him o'er the plain.
But  soon the knight, with active spring,     To court his hairy captive soon
   O'erturn'd his hairy foe :                    Sir Valentine doth bring ;
And now between their sturdy fists            And kneeling down upon his knee,
  Pass'd many a bruising blow.                   Presents him to the king.
They roll'd and grappled on the ground,       With   loss of blood and loss of strength
  And there they struggled long :                The savage tamer grew ;
Skilful and active was the knight ;           And to Sir Valentine became

                    By B. Beinick.    Translated  by  Alfred Sothern.
     A brave old       soldier, after having fought nobly in many battles,
returned home from the wars poor and weary.                         When he came
back to his village, he found that the enemy had killed all the
women and children, and had burnt his house to the ground, toge
ther with all the property he had possessed.                  He went from house
to house begging his neighbours to give him some bread, or work

                            THE PLAYMATE,
by which he might gain his living ; but some said,
                                                         " We cannot
give you work, you are too old and weak ;" and others,
                                                           " We can
not give you bread, go and work for it ;" generally they said, " We
want bread for ourselves, and have none to spare."
     At length the old soldier became so averse to mankind, that he
resolved to become a hermit.     And he procured a cowl and a prayer-
book, and an axe and a spade, and with these he went out into the
mountains.
     A large wood extended over hills and valleys, and in the midst
of it there rose a higher and more extensive chain of rocks, covered
with grass and flowers, and shaded by beautiful old trees. Beneath
these trees the old soldier built a wooden hut, and there he hung up
his sword; and he carefully inclosed the surrounding spot, so that
no wild beast could break through; and he felt more happy among
the rocks and wilds than amongst mankind.
     The wood beneath was generally reported to be haunted, and

6                             THE PLAYMATE.
the people of the surrounding country feared to walk there.            But
 the hermit thought that he could not be worse off than he had
 been in his village, and he was not afraid.           The whole place was
full  of  beautiful animals,   —  stags, hares, rabbits, and many others ;
they were tame and docile, and often surrounded him in his walks,
 looking earnestly, as if they had something important to tell him.
     In one of his wanderings the old man met with a white roe, of
slender and beautiful shape, and with gentle and intelligent eyes.
No sooner did it perceive the hermit than it walked gracefully up
to him and licked his hand, while he, in return, stroked and caressed
it. The animal followed him to his hut, and from that time never
left his side. On the same evening the other animals also approached
nearer to him, and wild cats, pigeons, and all singing birds now
built their nests in the neighbourhood of the hermitage.           The old
man seemed to have obtained the love of all the animals, particularly
of the beautiful roe, which he cherished and nursed as if a little
child. Near to his own couch he made it a bed of moss and rushes,
he fed it out of his own hand with the sweetest herbs, and often
conversed with it for hours together, for the animal always seemed
to understand him and sympathise with his fate.              Wherever the
roe appeared it was greeted with joy and reverence by the other
animals, who eagerly vied with each other in serving it.           When it
passed through the wood, spotted butterflies surrounded it in the
same manner that footmen would wait upon the coach of some
great lady.      Proud stags made way respectfully before   it,   and bent
back with their horns the thickets and branches that obstructed the
way.     The birds plucked all kinds of beautiful flowers, and hung
them upon the branches, and strewed them on the path before            it,
and sang together in such sweet harmony, that the music resounded
likea     concert through the quiet grove.         Every time that the roe
laid itself to rest, a   little bird came flying out of the bushes, and
sang softly    till
                it    slept
                         ;      and
                                 a      wild cat sprang from the tree, and
placing itself upon the moss near    it,     fanned the air with its bushy
tail while the active lizards snapped up all the gnats that seemed
    ;
likely to sting it. In the morning when the roe arose from its bed,
and each time before     it    went out,
                                     a      pair of white doves flew down
from the roof, and delicately smoothed its hair with their beaks.
    It   happened once, very strangely, that upon   a     summer morning
the sky became overcast with clouds, and the air sultry and very
oppressive.   The hermit sat quietly in his cell, reading his prayer

book, but the roe could obtain no repose ; it did not eat nor drink,
but wandered restlessly here and there, until at length it ran down
into the cool wood, and threw itself upon a large plot of soft grass :
all the animals of the wood — a thousand and more — came, and at
a short distance laid themselves in a circle around                   it,
                                                                and on the
trees sat the beautiful many-coloured birds, like ladies in balcony.        a
All the creatures watched silently around the roe, until, overpowered
by  the great heat, they one after another fell asleep, and at length
the roe itself fell asleep also.         Only the hares, who stood as
sentinels, kept guard      with  pricked ears. Suddenly there sounded
through the still wood the barking of dogs and the shrill blast or
horns the sounds approached nearer and nearer, till, all at once,
     :
a young prince appeared, surrounded               by
                                               many hunters on horse and
foot, who had accidentally lost their way in the enchanted wood.
The hares whistled, and the other animals sprang up and pressed
around to defend the roe, who, starting up, fled swiftly away.         The
young prince, however, had caught sight of             it,
                                                     and cried,  " Whoever
kills that beautiful animal shall be put to death             but whoever
                                                                  ;

hunting-horn       !  Immediately the whole company, with the young
prince  at their head,   followed after the roe, who flew like an arrow
out of the wood up the rocks, and breaking into the cell where the
old man yet prayed, strove to conceal itself in the folds of his
garment.     The prince was quickly at the door of the hut, and soon
perceived where       had hid itself.
                       it                He called to the hermit, desiring
him to give    it  up    but   the  hermit  enclosed     in his arms, and
                                                             it

                  " Then thou shalt die " cried the young man, as he
                                 :
shall find it."                               !
raised his spear.       But these words awoke in the old man his
former warlike spirit, and in an instant he snatched his sword
from the wall.         combat began, both struck for
                       A                                    long time with
                                                                  a
formidable skill, until at last the strength of the old man failed
him, and the young prince, having struck his sword out of his
hand, was about to rush upon and kill him, when the roe, per
ceiving the danger of its defender, sprang between them and
received the wound which had been intended for the hermit.
There lay the tender little animal upon the grass, with its life-
blood streaming from its mouth. When,                  instead of flowing
                                                       lo!
upon the ground, the red blood spread itself over its whole body,
and veiled    itas with     a beautiful purple garment, and at the same
time its bonis grew into           golden crown; at last, instead of the

 roe, there lay in its place a most lovely princess, with her eyes
 closed lightly, as if asleep.        When the young prince beheld this
beautiful lady, instantly a deep affection for her possessed his
heart, and he sank upon his knees before her.                 "Awake, sweet
princess,"    he  said,
                         " and   thou   shalt  be  my queen ;" and then he
pressed a kiss upon her rosy lips.          At the same moment a mighty
whirlwind rose     in  the  air, the lightning flashed, the thunder pealed
across the heavens, and the earth shook terribly.             Then the young
princess cast up her eyes, and raising herself said to the king's
son, "The time is now fulfilled, and the spell is broken.                I and
 my   courtiers  have   been  transformed     by an evil charm  for a  hundred
years.     I accept you for my husband, and all that is mine is thine
also." As she spoke thus the sun again broke out from behind
the clouds, and in the woods beneath there appeared a most splen
did palace, with high towers and golden pinnacles.               At the same
instant, in spite of the distance, it might be perceived that the
wood swarmed with courtiers and attendants, upon horse and foot ;
and the blast of the trumpets, and the beating of drums resounded
on every side. Now, instead of a wild cat, there sat upon the
tree an intelligent page ; and on the roof, instead . of the turtle
doves, there sat a pair of ladies-in-waiting; and instead of sing
ing-birds, there now sat in the bushes all kinds of musicians,
who played upon all kinds of instruments, and sang sweet songs.
From the wood there now approached a splendid procession of
horses and servants, to escort the prince and his bride to their
palace.     When they had mounted their steeds they both wished
to take the old man with them, in order that he might become
their prime minister, and live with them continually.             But this the
hermit refused, saying,       "  Leave   me   here in my solitude :   I mingle
no more with mankind.            To me the beams of the sun are more
beautiful than your gold, and the rays of the moon more lovely
than your silver ; the stars are my precious stones, and the wide
heaven is my palace.         Seek me sometimes in my cell to tell me
                                 I
of your prosperity, which shall always earnestly pray for."
     And now, with heartfelt gratitude for his protection, the queen
and her husband departed.             It was not long before other kind
animals came to the hermit, they were not so wonderful as the
 former, but he took care of them with the same tenderness.
 When he died the young prince interred him in a magnificent
monument, and the princess planted beautiful flowers around his
grave, and moistened them with her tears.

    There    was once a little boy, who was not at all well grown, for
he was much smaller than he ought to have been for his age ; and
his legs were even crooked.         But he was of a lively, intelligent
disposition,  and  his  head  was   full of waggery.
    His parents had died when he was very young, and had left him
nothing whatever for a legacy.           He therefore hired himself as a
servant to a peasant.      But when he had been in his service three-
years, he went one day to his master, the peasant, and said :
                                                                     —

     "I  have served you honestly, and to the hest of my power, for
 three years, and    Inow think of going into the world, and making
my   fortune.   Be  so good, therefore, as to count me out the wages     I
have earned, and let me go my ways."
     The peasant then went to his closet, and having opened        it,
                                                                    he
was fumbling     a long while amongst his money, till at length he
brought out three small farthings, which he gave to Freddy, saying, —
     " See, here are your wages — farthing for each year.
                                  a                          I   think

      a
if you spend them judiciously, you may make your fortune even so         ;
for he who  is  careless of farthings does not deserve to have dollars.
Good luck speed you on your way."
     Little Freddy took the three farthings, and put them joyfully
into a leathern purse, which he had made himself out of    a  mouse's
skin, and  hidit in his pocket.    He then went to take leave of the
peasant's  wife and  children, and sallied forth into the wide world.
As often as he stopped to rest, or to spend the night under tree,

farthings, and to see whether any of them were lost.

and as yet no opportunity had offered itself for placing his money

to advantage.          One evening, however, he reached a chain of great
rocky mountains, and having climbed to the summit, looked all
about him to see which way he had better go, in order to reach
 either a village or a mill, where he might spend the night.                 But as
 far as the moonlight enabled him to see, he could perceive nothing
 but woods and wooded mountains. He therefore resolved to remain
 where he was, and having sought for a place that was overgrown
 with soft moss, he laid himself down as comfortably as he could, to
 go to sleep for the night.         But before he fell asleep, he once more
 drew out his mouseskin purse, in order to see whether any of his
farthings were lost.          As he was counting them in his palm by
moonlight,       a  strange   sort  of misty shadow fell upon his hand.
On looking up to see the cause of             it, he perceived   a   man standing
before him, whose face was quite covered with                a    grey beard that
reached down to his feet his robe hung about him in great many
                             ;                                       a
folds, and he had drawn           a   part of  it   over his head, so that his
face alone was visible   ;     and though     he  remained stock-still himself,
yet  his   dress   appeared   to be  fluttering   up and down, and all round
him, in one incessant whirl.            This gave him an unearthly appear
ance, and,     in  good sooth, he was no mortal man          ;      and when our
merry    little  hero   looked   up,  and   could   not   rightly  make   him out,
and one moment took him for           a   man, and the next for      a   column of
smoke, he began at last to feel           a   shuddering horror creeping all
over his frame, and, hastily thrusting his three little farthings into
his bag, rose from the ground, and was going to run away.                      But
just as he had risen, and        was   about   to  scamper off,    he  felt himself
held fast   by    his hind hair and although he was frightened at the
                               ;
sight of the apparition, he was obliged to look back. And now the
figure seemed again to be an old man in                  a grey rain-cloak.    The
man perceived his alarm, and said, good-naturedly enough, —
     " Never fear, Freddy     ;I      won't do you any harm."
     Little Freddy then breathed more freely, and said, —
     " Now this    is    kind of you to speak at last, that may know
                                                                 I
you really are human being but
                 a                    ;       it    isstill kinder of you not to
 do me any harm.            And you will not take away my three little
farthings     that
                 I     have  earned in three years either, will you ?"
     " Unless you finish     by    giving me them willingly," answered the
 grey man, "you shall take them all three away with you."
     "Well, then, in that case," said little Freddy, "there                is   no*
hurry ;    and you will now be very welcome bed-fellow."
                                      a
     " don't want to be your bed-fellow," growled the grey man

in his beard, in an angry tone      ;
                                        " but,"   continued he,   " in   order
to despatch my business with you at once, (for           I
                                                have still a jour
ney of one hundred miles to perform to-night), tell me, what will
you take for your three farthings ?"
     '
         Little Freddy now perceived that he had to deal neither with          a
human being nor a column of smoke, but with a sturdy mountain
spirit, who wanted his three farthings because they had, perhaps,
been coined out of the copper that had been dug from the bowels of
this very mountain ; for the little fellow was shrewd and cunning
enough : he therefore answered him : —
     " Yes, I shall not mind giving
                                      you one of my three farthings, if
you will give me a fowling-piece with which          I
                                                   shall be able to kill
every  bird that  I aim at."
    The grey spirit immediately handed him a very handsome gun,
as long again as little Freddy himself, before the latter could ever
perceive where he took it from.      But Freddy said, —
     " Ay, but I must                                              I
                         try whether it's a good one before pay for
it;" and taking a leaf on a distant tree as a mark, he shot at      and  it,
the leaf flew away as    ifithad never existed.   Then Freddy joyfully
reached him      farthing.
                 a           But the  Grey Spirit said —
     " You have asked for nothing at all out of the
                                                             :
                                                       way. Now take
more care, and ask for something better for the second farthing."

                                THE PLAYMATE.                          13
     " Oh, yes  !
                  "  said little Freddy, laughing.    " You see I'm not
able to dance, myself, because my legs are too crooked ; but       I have
a great passion for dancing, and it delights me beyond measure to
see others jumping about in the wildest glee.          Therefore, for the
second farthing     I   shall only ask for a fiddle that will force every
body to dance, whether they have a mind or not, the moment              I
begin fiddling."
     The Grey Spirit gave him likewise the fiddle he wished for,
besides its bow.      And again Freddy had not seen where he took it
from.     He said, however, as he gave it him : —
     " That was again a very foolish wish, Freddy. Now you are
come to the last farthing, so mind and wish for something wiser."
     So Freddy gave him the second farthing, and said : —
     " Well, then, wish that nobody may be able to refuse me the
                      I
first request that    I  shall make them."
     " That's something sensible at last," said the Grey Spirit. "      I
shall grant this wish with pleasure.       Go your ways, it shall be so."
     And Freddy then gave him the third farthing.            Meanwhile a
soft little breeze blew across the mountain top, and as the Grey
Spirit retired it seemed to the little boy as though he was again
nothing but a shadowy vapour chased away by the wind ; for the
harder the wind blew behind him, the faster he appeared to hasten
away, till he was soon quite lost in the distant shadows of night,
which were now drawing around.
     And little Freddy laughed in his sleeve, and rejoiced heartily
over his valuable presents, and hopped about on one leg, holding
the fowling-piece in one hand and the fiddle in the other, and cried
out, over and over again : " That was a foolish fellow with his
misty gown ! — a very foolish fellow, indeed !
                                                    " And he could not
get to sleep the whole night, for he was afraid, were he to close his
eyes, he should wake early the next morning and find it was all a
dream ; still he was obliged to rest himself, for he had trudged from
a great distance that same day : he therefore sat down, and awaited
the dawn of morning, wide awake.
     When the stars began to grow pale, and the breeze blew more
 sharply over the mountain tops, our little boy rose from his seat,
and strolled down on the other side of the steep rocks, when he
was joined by a monk, who was returning from a village in the
mountains, where he had been making a collection for his convent.
On his shoulder he carried a wallet filled with smoked meat and
eggs, and other presents that benevolent, pious housewives had given

him for his convent ; and when the monk approached him, the little
boy greeted him, and asked,
                                 " Where do you come from so early ?"
     " come from the nearest village," said the monk, " and
      I                                                              I
have been collecting for my convent ; and now    I    am going into the
town there below, in order to see what the good folks will give me."
     " Then," said little Freddy, " we will go together, for I'm going
there too."
     " Indeed ! " said the monk, with a groan. " The annual fair
is held there to-day. I suppose you are going to play on your
fiddle, and to earn some money?"
     " Yes, yes," answered little Freddy, " that is what mean to
                                                              I
do ;
     "  and he laughed in his sleeve, for he was thinking of a prank
that he intended playing the monk.
     When they got a little further, the latter perceived a wild dove
sitting upon a tree, and he said to Freddy : " Look, my son, what
a fat little dove is sitting there !
                                     "
     " Yes, it is a pretty little dove," said Freddy. " I like doves,
they are such gentle creatures, and do nobody any harm."
     " Ah ! and they taste so deliciously ! " said the monk, and
stood still, and kept looking at it.    " Yes," continued he, " it is a
good fat one ; and it would be a most dainty morsel, were it roasted
and stuffed ! Come, now, do shoot me that fat dove if you can."
     " Willingly," said Freddy ; " only you must pick it up your
self, for it will fall just amongst the brambles, and     I can't climb
over them with my short legs ; and I should be afraid, too, of the
thorns that would scratch me terribly."
     " Let me alone for getting it when it once lies there," said
the monk.      " My cowl is thick, and the thorns can't pierce it."
     " But we are now in Lent, and you must not eat flesh," returned
Freddy.
            " Now do let the poor creature live ; you can't keep it
fresh till you are allowed to eat meat again."
     " Well, but you won't betray me," said the monk ; " and if
nobody else sees me, I sha'nt mind eating flesh even in Lent, be
cause then it's no sin."
     " Indeed ! " said Freddy. " So what is not seen is no sin ?"
     " No, no ! my son," answered the monk.
     Little Freddy was annoyed by the monk's greediness and his
want of conscience, and he thought to himself : " Wait a moment,
and you shall pay for this." And he turned to him again and
said : " Very well, if you'll fetch      I'll shoot
                                    it it,
                                                     it down  ;" and he
immediately brought   it   down, and    fell right in the middle of the

                             THE PLAYMATE.                             15
brambles.      Tbe monk hastened to fetch       it,and having climbed
over the front brambles he picked the bird up.          But in the mean
time little Freddy had taken up his fiddle, and passed the bow over
it, saying, I " must see whether my fiddle in good order." And
                                                is
as he scraped the strings up and down with the bow, he struck up
a lively dance, although he had never learned to fiddle in his life.
     But no sooner did the monk catch the sound of the merry tune
than he began to dance in the brambles, painful as         it was to one
so fat and well-fed as he.        And now he lifted his right foot, and
hopped     about   on  the  left one; then he lifted his left foot, and
hopped about on the right, springing very high each time, and
dancing till all the eggs in his bag were broken to pieces, and the
yellow liquor streamed all down his cowl and he hopped about till
                                            ;
his fat cheeks, and still fatter body, were shaking again and he;
panted, and kept calling between whiles, ''Cease! — Cease, my
son! — Cease, or you will put an end to me!            Cease! orI    shall
dance myself to death
                              "
      " No," said Freddy, " you must first have
                         !
                                                      a  jig, which  is   a
still livelier measure than this ." and he began fiddling, and the
monk began dancing anew, till he was nearly breathless.              This
delighted the little boy very much, especially as the thorns and
brambles stuck to the monk's cowl, and held him so fast, that he
was obliged to tear himself loose in the dance, while the fragments
of his cowl hung upon the briary hedge and the monk might beg
                                           ;
and pray as he would, the little rogue continued fiddling away as
hard as he could.
     The monk at last exclaimed    :
                                       " will give you all the money
                                       I                              I
have collected if    you'll stop.   Do, pray, give over, or you'll be the
death of me \"
     So Freddy at length stopped, and let him recover his breath.
And the monk wiped the perspiration from his brow, and drew
a long breath, and disentangled his cowl from the brambles, and
came out.      But when little Freddy claimed his money, he not only
would not give   it     him, but reprimanded him besides for having,
with his accursed fiddle, forced him to dance when he ought to
have shewn him more respect.
     But little Freddy threatened to strike up the jig again    if he did
not immediately pull out the money which he had promised to
give him.      Then the fat monk begged him not to do any such
thing,   and  that  he would give him what he wished   ;   so he took his
bag off his shoulder: but when he saw how all his eggs were

16                               THE PLAYMATE.
broken, and had streamed away, he sighed deeply, and said, — " To
think of God's good gifts being spoiled in this manner ! How
many an excellent lenten-dish might have been made out of them !
— and now they'll do nobody any good.''
    But little Freddy laughed, and said : " Don't regret your eggs,
good father !    Haven't you had a merry egg-dance instead ? Only
thrust your hand into the egg sauce and fish out your purse, and
don't make a long job of         or else I'll set you a-dancing again."
                                 it,
    The monk sighed,      "  Heaven take pity on me — have fallen
                                                       !   I
into the hands of most reckless rogue."
                    a                               And he put his hand
into his bag   and drew  forth his purse      and Freddy doffed his little
                                               ;
red cap and held   it out, and the monk emptied his money into it..
    The waggish little fellow then put the money into his pocket,
and said to the monk      " Well, thank you for paying me so hand
                                       I
                                                            "
                        :
somely for the small amount of trouble         Ihave taken
    " Yes," said the monk " and may another
                                                           !
                                  ;                     pay you in such
coin as you deserve."
    But little Freddy only laughed, and made no answer, and pur
sued his way in high glee, while the monk walked along sulkily on
the other side of the road.       And when they reached the town, and
passed    bythe  Swan  inn,   the   little boy said, " Now, farewell, Sir
Monk  !   I   hope you'll enjoy the fat dove at your dinner.          And
mind you collect plenty       of   money for your convent, in order to
make up for your loss        !   Iam going in here to give them      taste
                                                                       a
of my fiddle, and play the folks something that shall make them
merry and set them a-dancing."            And so he let the monk go his
ways,  and he   walked up   the   steps, and went and placed himself at
a table in the room, and called for half          pint of wine and after
                                                   a           ;
he had sat there awhile, he began to fiddle, and all the guests
began to dance with great delight          and even the landlord and the
                                           ;
waiters began to dance about amongst the guests.
     It pleased them all, however, vastly well, for they were pack     a
of jolly companions, and they paid him handsomely       and as often
                                                           ;
as he stopped, they bid him play them something       new.   And the
people who passed       by
                         in the street began to dance likewise, when
they  heard  the fiddle.
     But the monk was very angry with little Freddy for having
taken all his money, and so he went before the judge of the town
and lodged complaint against him.
               a                         The judge then said
     " If we did but know where the rogue hides himself, we'd take
                                                                   :
good care to punish him for his pranks."

                          THE PLAYMATE.                          17
    " Well,  then," said the monk, " only send constable Holdfast
after him, and let him go to the Swan inn, and see whether he does
not find there a little boy with crooked legs, who has got a fiddle
and a long fowling-piece."
     So the judge sent his constable after him.         But when he
reached the Swan inn he found every thing topsy-turvy; people
were dancing about in the street, and in the hall, and in the room ;
and little Freddy was standing on the table and fiddling away with
a roguish look, and enjoying the fun of seeing every body dancing
round him.      And when constable Holdfast heard the fiddle, he
too had half a mind to trip it " on the light fantastic toe." And it
was a great piece of luck for him that Freddy stopped to take a
moment's rest, and the dance ceased, or else Holdfast must have
capered about with the rest.
     He now went up to him, and taking him by the sleeve, —
    " Holloa ! my friend," said he, " have     I  found you at last ?
Come along with me."
    Now little Freddy was curious to know what he wanted with
him, and so he went willingly enough.               For he thought,
         3.                                               D

 18                            THE PLAYMATE.
 " Should the worst come to the worst, I can but beg him to let me
 go again ; for every body is obliged to grant my first request."
     But when the constable took him before the judge, beside
 whom sat the monk, he then saw that the latter had accused him.
 And when the judge said to him, —
     " Now confess the truth at once, you rogue ! Have you not
 done as the reverend gentleman there says you have?                  Didn't
 you play  off  your  pranks  upon    him,  and take away   his money ?"
     " Yes, Mr. Judge," said our little Freddy; " cannot deny it."
                                                          I
     The judge then called out angrily, —
     " You rogue in grain ! Can't you play your pranks upon your
 equals, instead of making that respectable man there a butt for
your wanton freaks ? Don't you know that it is said in the last
commandment that 'thou shalt not covet any thing that is thy
                 '
neighbour's ?        Only wait a bit, and I'll reward you as you deserve.
I'll have you hung upon the gallows before every body, to serve as
an example for all mischievous imps and thieves !
                                                          "
     And then he called the hangman, and delivered the little boy
to him, and bid him lead him at once to the gallows, and hang him up.
     The hangman then seized him and bound a cord round his
body, and took him away with him.             And the judge accompanied
them,   to see  if the hangman    did   his duty ; and the monk went too,
in order to exhort him on the way, and to help him to pray at the
foot of the gallows.       And a great crowd of men and women fol
lowed, in order to see how the poor little fiddler would be hanged.
     But when the monk wanted to speak comfort to him, little
Freddy only answered, —
     " Now pray let me alone, reverend sir !           I know that   I have
deserved my fate.                        I                         I
                        It's true that meant no great harm ; like to
see people dancing right merrily, and         I did not think it was such a
great  sin to  take  pleasure  in it.    And  I thought that if you could
eat meat in Lent, though it is forbidden, that you might very well
dance for once in a way."
     Meanwhile they had reached the gallows.             The people placed
themselves round it in a large circle. The ladder was then brought,
and the hangman took the cord off poor little Freddy's body, and
bound it round his neck, and then mounted a couple of staves of
the ladder, and said to him, —
     " Come, get up after me, my son ! "
     And little Freddy climbed up a couple of staves of the long
ladder after him.      But now he thought it high time to make his

 first request to the judge, or it might be too late if he waited till
 he were a couple of staves higher.            He therefore turned to the
judge, and said,     —
      " Ah, Mr. Judge, have a great favour to ask you before get
                           I                                           I
up to the top there, and one that you surely might grant me !
                                                                       "
      " It shall not be refused, my son, if have power to grant it,"
                                                 I
 answered the judge.
      " Well, then," said little Freddy, " am so fond of my fiddle,
                                                I
that   I  don't like to part with it before      I have fiddled a last tune
upon    it.  Therefore,   allow  me  to    amuse myself with it once more
before my death, and to play something that will entertain both
myself and you."
      But the monk then turned to the judge, and said, " Mr. Judge,
do not allow him to do so.           It will be the death of us all if he
begins fiddling."
      But the judge answered : " One must not refuse a poor fellow
a reasonable request, when he is on the steps of the gallows."
      He therefore turned to constable Holdfast, and ordered him to
fetch the little boy's fiddle.     And Freddy received it joyfully, and
began to draw the bow over the strings.               Then the children all
around began to dance.            And little Freddy fiddled away more
vigorously    than  ever.
                  "
                                       I
      Then the hangman said : " must have a dance ;            I can't hold
it any longer !                                     ,
      And down he got, and began dancing under the gallows.
      And after the judge had looked on for awhile, and perceived
that even Holdfast, the constable, had placed little Freddy's fowling-
piece against the ladder, in order to be better able to dance, and all
around were dancing, he exclaimed : " Since all are dancing, why
should I alone stand still ?" And he began to dance with the rest.
      And when the monk saw that, he exclaimed : " And I, too,
must enjoy the dance ! "         And he danced about with the crowd.
But he was soon tired, because he was so stout.               He therefore
called out to the judge:      " For God's sake, dear Mr. Judge, do have
him stopped! It is quite a shame for us to be dancing about
before all these people.        Didn't   I  warn you?    I knew very well
how it would be."
      But the judge, who had grown quite frolicsome during the
dance, only answered, as he capered along,
                                                   " Dance away, reverend
father, dance away !      I  have no mind to stop yet ; the tune is too
merry for that."

20                        THE PLAYMATE.
     " Yes," said little Freddy ; " and now mind,    Iam going to
play you a jig. You know that, reverend father, don't you? it is
a merry tune, isn't it?"   And he began to play anew.
    And the surrounding crowd, together with the constable and
the judge, and the women and the children, all began to dance
indiscriminately with each other, so that there was a regular hub
bub, both under the gallows and all round them; and they all
capered about, and many cried out,
                                         " Hurrah ! It was never so
merry at any body's hanging before!"
     But little Freddy now came down from his ladder, still fiddling
as he went, and, taking his fowling-piece under his arm, he ran
fiddling through the dancing crowd, and made off as quick as he
could.     But the people all danced after him, and danced away till
they had fairly danced themselves tired, and fell to the ground on
the road-side.     The fat monk was the first to fall down, panting,
for he had danced his very breath away ; then the judge fell, then
the hangman, and then Holdfast, the constable ; and now a couple
fell here, and another couple there.       And Freddy ran on, still
fiddling away, until they had all dropped down exhausted.
     And when he saw them all lying on the ground, little Freddy
laughed heartily in his sleeve to think that he had saved himself
from the gallows through his fiddle ; and he wandered on to other
districts and other towns, and gained a deal of money by his fiddle,
and played so many pranks, that nothing was talked of but little
Freddy and his fiddle.     And so he lived on merrily for many years,
till he grew a little old man.
     When he died, all the strings of his fiddle snapped asunder.
Many tried to play upon it by putting new strings to it; but
whoever had not learnt to fiddle could not fiddle upon it any more
than upon any other fiddle. And if a dance was played upon        it,
nobody was obliged to dance to  it   except those who happened just
then to have   a   mind to dance. In short,  it  had become fiddle
                                                             a
just  like  any  other fiddle.

              TRADITIONAL BALLADS. — EDITED BY FELIX SUMMERLY.
                     VALENTINE AND URSINE                 Part II.
In high renown with prince      and peer,   Beyond it rose a castle fair,
   Now hVd sir Valentine ;                     Y-built of marble stone :
His high renown with prince and peer        The battlements were gilt with gold,
   Made envious hearts repine.                 And glittered in the sun.
It chane'd the king upon a day              Beneath the bridge, with strange device,
   Prepar'd a sumptuous feast :                A hundred bells were hung ;
And there came lords, and dainty dames,     That man nor beast might pass thereon,
   And many a nohle guest.                     But strait their larum rung.
Amid their cups, that freely flow"d,        This quickly found     the youthful pair,
   Their revelry and mirth,                    Who boldly crossing o'er,
A youthful knight tax'd Valentine,          The jangling sound bedeaft their ears,
   With base and doubtful birth.               And rung from shore to shore.
The foul reproach, so grossly urg'd,        Quick at the sound the castle gates
   His generous heart did wound ;              Unlock'd and opened wide,
And strait he vow'd he ne'er would rest     And strait a giant huge and grim
   Till he his parents found.                  Stalk'd forth with stately pride.
                                            " Now yield you, caitiffs, to my will   "
Then bidding king and peers adieu,                                                ;
   Early one summer's day,                     He cried with hideous roar ;
With faithful Ursine by his side,           " Or else the wolves shall eat your flesh,
   From court he took his way.                And ravens drink your gore."
O'er  hill and valley, moss and moor,       " Vain boaster," said the youthful knight,
   For many a day they pass ;                  " I scorn  thy threats and thee :
At length, upon a moated lake,              I trust to force  thy brazen gates,
   They found   a  bridge of brass.            And set thy captives free."

Then putting spurs unto his steed,           "Alas ! young knight," she weeping said,
   He aim'd a dreadful thrust ;                 " Condole my wretched fate ;
The spear against the giant glanc'd,         A childless mother here you see ;
  And caus'd the blood to burst.                A wife without a mate.
Mad and outrageous with the pain,            " These twenty winters here forlorn,
   He whirl'd his mace of steel ;               I've drawn my hated breath ;
The very wind of such a blow                 Sole witness of a monster's crimes,
   Had made the champion reel.                  And wishing aye for death.
It haply  missed    ;  and now the knight    " Know,   I  am sister of a king,
   His glittering     sword display'd ;         And in my early years
And riding round with whirlwind speed        Was married to a mighty prince,
   Oft made him feel the blade.                 The fairest of his peers.
As when a large and monstrous oak            " With him    I sweetly  UVd in love
   Unceasing axes hew :                         A twelvemonth     and a day :
So fast around the giant's limbs             When lo ! a foul and treacherous priest
   The blows quick-darting flew.                Y-wrought our love's decay.
As when the boughs with hideous fall         " His seeming goodness won him       pow"r ;
   Some hapless woodman crush :                 He had his master's ear :
With such a force the enormous         foe   And long to me and all the world
  Did on the champion rush.                     He did a saint appear.
A fearful  blow, alas ! there came,          " One
                                                     day, when we were all alone,
   Both horse and knight it took,               He proffered odious love :
And laid them senseless in the dust        ;                             I
                                             The wretch with horror repuls'd,
   So fatal was the stroke.                     And from my presence drove.
Then smiling forth a hideous grin,           " He feign'd remorse, and piteous    begg'd
   The giant strides in haste,                  His crime I'd not reveal :
And, stooping, aims a second stroke          Which, for his seeming penitence,

But  ere it fell, two thundering blows       " With treason, villany, and wrong,
  Upon his scull descend :                      My goodness he repaid :
From Ursine's knotty club they came,         With jealous doubts he fill'd my lord,
   Who ran to save his friend.                  And me to woe betray'd.
Down sank the giant, gaping wide,            " He hid   a slave within my bed,           <
  And rolling his grim eyes :                   Then rais'd a bitter cry.

Quickly sir Valentine reviv'd                " A mother    I was like to be,

At length within a lonely cell               And tow"rds my brother's distant court,

Her gentle eyes were dim'd with tears;       " Long time    thro' sundry foreign lands

And long sir Valentine besought              At length, within a forest wild,
  Her doleful tale to know.                    I  fainted quite away.

" A prowling      bear burst from the wood,       And pulling forth the cloak of gold,
    And seiz'd my younger son ;                     In which himself was found ;
Affection lent my weakness wings,                 The lady gave a sudden shriek,
    And after them      I run.                      And fainted on the ground.
" But all    forewearied,   weak, and spent,      But by his pious care reviv"d,
    I  quickly swooned away       :                 His tale she heard anon ;
And there     beneath the greenwood shade        And soon by other tokens found,
    Long time    I  lifeless lay.                   He was indeed her son.
" At length    the knight brought me relief,      " But who's this hairy youth?" shesaid:
    And rais'd me from the ground :                 " He much resembles thee :
But neither of my pretty babes                   The bear devour'd my younger son,
    Could ever more be found.                        Or sure that son were he."
" And while in search we wander" d far,          " Madam, thisyouthwithbearswas        bred,

    I shall    not always speak of things in their actual and sub
stantial forms and facts, but sometimes as they appeared to a Child's
imagination and feelings. These visions are realities of the mind in
the beautiful dawn of life ; they are the facts of childhood, whose
day-dreams are at once its poetry and its science.    Nature is then
a lovely romance ; its commonest objects, if they are pure to the
heart, are often wonders and delights : for the eye of a happy child

is always seeing    miracles.  Such visions are like water to the roots,
and dews to the   buds,  of the human plant ; and as these waters and
these dews are    sweet and profuse, and the plant is open to the
genial influence  of the sun and air, so groweth the fair creature to
a full and bright  maturity.    Listen, therefore, young friends, to the
history of a day ; its varied impressions were never erased from the
memory.
     A happy Child    awoke one morning at day-break, and heard the
birds singing in the trees near her window. The Child arose, and
went out into the garden, and as the path lay beneath her mother's
bedroom, she stood still and looked up.         The blinds were closely
 drawn, and she held her breath for fear of disturbing the silent
house that seemed so sound asleep.         She prayed in the fulness of
her heart for all sorts of blessings upon that dear bed ; and as she
prayed, she fancied that two beautiful large angels came half-way
through the white frame-work of the bed's head, and bent over her
mother's pillow, though without waking her.
     More birds now began to sing as the day grew lighter.           An
orange gleam was in the eastern sky, low down, with streaks of pale
rose-colour above it ; and the rosy streaks got redder and redder as
the Child looked at them, while the orange gleam beneath became
brighter and brighter. High up in the sky, opposite to those deep
 ening lines, yet at a great distance, there was a kind of broken oval
 shape of pale dull silver       never could be the moon that was so
                                (it
bright last night), with    aslight shade of misty blue upon one side
of   it
      ; and this broken oval shape was gradually receding deeper
into some dusky grey clouds that opened to receive it.
     Round the garden walked the Child, thinking what wonderful
                                                          a
day of joy this would be to her elder sister, who would be seventeen
next May — eight whole years older than herself — and who was
                                                    !
now to be married to her old playmate, Willy, who was nineteen on
his last birthday.     At this moment,   a  goldfinch very handsomely
dressed, and  a   robin in     russet coat, perched on opposite twigs,
                                a
each on   a topmost twig. Both began to sing together in the most
joyous  manner.     They knew very well what the Child was thinking
about, for the goldfinch ruffled his wings and topknot, and all the
crimson feathers about his hot little face, in smart, funny manner,
                                                a
to make   a fuss as she passed     and the robin gave large, full stare
                                    ;               a
with one of his round, black eyes — then        aquick bob, that looked
like  a wink  —  and flew away.      Both of these little fellows were
wedding guests.

                            THE PLAYMATE.                           27
     A  rivulet formed the boundary of one side of the garden. Over
this rivulet a plank was laid for a bridge, which the Child crossed,
and slowly wandered along the path beside the hedge. She stopped
to look at a bud of the wild convolvulus.      Its white head was just
opening.     The sun was now rising above the roof of the house, and
its light had darted over the further end of the garden ; but the
hawthorn hedge was still between, and every thing lay in shadow
on this side of it. Presently the sun had got as high as the very
highest of the great elm-trees, and then down came a broad beam,
all in a bright shower over the hedge, and far across the fields.
The convolvulus had opened its bud, and a delicate white trumpet
hung trembling in the golden splendoiir ! It was the first and only
blossom the convolvulus had as yet put forth : all the other buds
were some days younger, and were still closely packed up and
sleeping in their dusky green sheaths.
     " Sweet flower ! " said the Child ; " welcome to the first Sun
beam of day, — thy birthday ; and may all thy mornings be as bright
as this."
     The Child stood gazing silently on the convolvulus.        " How
              I
much older am," thought she,       " than this flower ! It is younger
even than little baby-cousin Florence, who cannot yet walk alone."
But as she thought of her little cousin, she all at once recollected
that yesterday the news had arrived that Florence had begun to
talk; and without further reflection she hastened along by the
hedge, and across the clover-field, and so through the old orchard
up to the house of her dear pretty aunt Ellen, whose sweet face
everybody loved, and who was the mother of Florence.
     This pretty aunt Ellen, as she was often called by several chil
dren besides the one little girl in white who now came and tapped
so softly at her bedroom door, was still in bed, partly because it
was yet very early, and partly because she had been in very delicate
health for some time ; indeed ever since the birth of little Florence.
Had all those young eyes which gazed upon her soft ethereal face,
her transparent complexion, with the rose-blush tint in the middle
of her cheek, — could those young eyes have seen the cause of this
unearthly loveliness, and have known her state of fast-declining
health, there would have been other epithets bestowed upon her
besides pretty aunt Ellen, other emotions far less joyful in gazing
upon her.
     Now as for this baby-cousin Florence, it was the most wonder
ful baby ever heard of, and talked as no other baby was ever known

to do at this age.      She could not only ask for every thing she
wanted   — if not byword, yet by signs and noises, and several charm
ing   and intelligent crows and squeals — but she had yesterday called
attention to some creatures in the field, and in words that actually
made a rhyme, — Moo tow turn nooky maa, an teep tay baa," which,
                               "
being translated, meant, — Moo cow come to look at mamma, and
sheep say baa." A traveller, a man of great learning, — just returned
from the Society Islands in the South Pacific Ocean, — had assured
them that this baby-language bore an extraordinary resemblance in
sound and accent to that of the natives of those uncivilised, yet
peaceful, islands ; and playfellow Willy had declared that he had read
some words very like them, indeed, in Captain Cook's "Voyages."
     The Child played in the orchard with this wonderful baby-cousin
and its little nurse several hours.     Its dear mamma could not get up
to-day, though     she  smiled   so sweetly at the Child, and kissed her
so tenderly when she came back from the orchard to take leave and
return home.
     Down stairs ran the Child, and out at the door, and through the
orchard again, and away across the fields.         She must not be too
late for her sister's wedding.      It was nearly noon as she ran along
by   the  hedge,   and  approached the convolvulus.       There was one
dark cloud in the heavens, and behind this the sun was steadily
burning, and shewing his dazzling face only now and then — and,
indeed, only a small part of his face.
     But as she arrived opposite to the convolvulus, forth came the
sun, and a broad and steady beam fell upon the flower and upon
the Child's golden locks at the same time.        She stopped before the
luminous white blossom, now with its beautiful trumpet-mouth
expanded to the utmost, and seeming to drink in the sun's rays,
when suddenly there burst out of the bright clouds, and not very
far distant in the sky, a sweet peal of church bells ! " One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight !
                                       " cried the Child, as fast as the
bells ; and off she ran in the direction of the village church, singing
aloud with the merry peal of the bells as she skipped along.
     The wedding train are on the way : there they move, onwards
between the trees ! Now they float across the green level above the
meadow, singing; all the young girls of the village dressed in
white, with wreaths and garlands of white roses.        Some are nearly
sixteen years old !     Emmy, the bride,     is more than  sixteen ! On
ward they move : and all that train of white angels is now fast
gathering together at the churchyard gate.

                          THE PLAYMATE.                             29
     Behind all these snow-white maidens slowly move fathers and
mothers, and old figures of grandsires and grandames, and some
very old figures indeed, looking like the parents of every one there.
In front of all that crowd of angels stands the old village church,
with birds'-nests in the ivy walls, and in the arched windows, and
in the little old grey spire.    The gravestones are so aged that
they have lost all shape, and are half covered with dry spots of grey
and reddish moss, and some of them are quite covered with thick
green moss, and sinking backwards or sideways, or bent down
forwards, like the oldest of the great-grandfathers in the marriage
train, and seeming as if bowing down into the earth, to be at rest
beneath the grass.     The peal of bells ceases ; and the peal and
roll of the organ rises up into heaven with the angels' voices.
     Do the hours fly, or do they stand still ? The present is so
delicious, why should it become the future ?
     If the hours have not gone on, the sun certainly has. From
that high place where he was shining a little while ago — or, surely,
not very long since — he has now descended, while nobody observed ;
and  is, indeed, below the large lower boughs of the elm-trees  :  he
isfast gliding down.  The Child thought of the convolvulus, which
she had twice before noticed to-day, so she ran off to see how
itlooked in the beam of the setting sun.
    The convolvulus was most lovely beneath the glorious sky, with

 golden  fire below and purple and crimson streaks above.           The
 declining sunbeam swept across the rivulet and garden, and over
 the meadows and churchyard, with the bright old church; and
 across the field and farmyard, beyond the stile ; over the upland
pastures beyond the farm, and then streaming across the climbing
 wood that skirted the upland, fell upon the soft range of hills
 above, and melted into the softer clouds of the distance. The Child
 stood awhile observing this with silent rapture, and then ran back
to join the happy crowd of wedding guests and fairy-like friends.
     Here we stand in the sun while the birds are singing round us
among the trees, and we inhale the sweet scents of the garden, and
white angels are dancing between the trees.       Off they drop — one
by one, and two by two.       Those who dance, must also sleep. The
garden is now all in soft shade ; but what of that ? Is not the shade
also beautiful?    Why should these pleasures have any change?
 and why should we leave the garden because the dancers have left
the lawn — except to go to bed?       Life must end at some time — so
they say. The shade is darker in the garden. Oh, happy bed, with
dreams, or without a dream, but with a Morning certain to come !
     Yes, a change of some kind has happened.        That same night,
after all were in bed, a loud ringing was heard at the gate !      And
hasty footsteps  moved  along   the garden paths, — and  in the passage
below, — and upstairs to the bed-room, — and down again, — and the
words "Poor, dear Ellen!" were heard by more than one of the
listeners in bed.
     Has any sad thing happened to dear, pretty aunt Ellen, who
looked so thoughtful and was so full of tenderness this morning !
What can it be ? Something in black goes by ! Who taps at the
door ? Here we are — all children — all at rest, or soon to be so ; we
only wait to say our prayers, and then we hope to sleep in God's arms !
     Early next morning the Child got up, and went into the garden.
She felt not so happy as yesterday — indeed, not half so happy.
Her heart seemed to have become heavy in her breast.          But there
was no cause for this !     She thought she would go straightway to
see how the beautiful convolvulus-flower looked.
     When she arrived at the place, it was gone !         It had fallen
off.    Could this shrivelled, closed-up, damp, dingy thing, lying
upon the earth beneath, be really the flower she had seen there
yesterday, all covered with sunbeams ? Impossible ! Yet, perhaps,
it may be the sad remains of it. Yes, it must, indeed, be so. This,
then, is death ? It is death.       And now the Child saw what had

 happened    to her dear mamma's      dear sister Ellen, the mother of
 her baby-cousin Florence.      And the Child burst into a passion of
tears, crying aloud,    " Oh, miserable Child, there is Death come
among us !
              "
     The Child ceased her lamentations, for a strange whispering of
leaves behind the convolvulus made her stop to listen with some
alarm ; and a Voice, thrilling with sweetness, and a something
unknown, spoke from the leaves, and said, —
     " Weep not, Child, for the flower that liveth but a day, and
waste no sorrow upon the beauty to which there cometh no second
morning upon earth.
     " It hath had the full
                                enjoyment of its nature, and should
pass away softly to make room that another may enjoy the same.
     " There are three great things in this world ; and there is none
other like unto them.
     " The first is Birth, which is the breath of life, and hath
feeling and thought for its inheritance.       The last is Death, which
giveth  rest  and sleep, and is the means  of   change to another state
— the dark but secure bridge, that leadeth onward to heaven.
    " Thus are Birth and Death the beginning and the end of
things — with Love in the midst of all.
    " There is nothing else so
                                    good and wise as universal Love ;
and it is the only universal happiness for all living creatures of
earth, of air, and of the waters.
     " Oh,
            happy Child ! enjoy the loving space of thy mortal time ;
give all the love thou hast to all around thee ; so shalt thou prolong
the pleasantness of thy days, and cover with sunbeams thy morn
ing, noon, and evening, until Death, crowned with stars, shall
descend upon thee."

                       THE MONTH OF MAY.
                           BY MARY ROBMITS.
      Merrily     do the villagers sally forth on the first of May: the
young hurry along as if their lives depended on gathering the
first branches, while the older, and those who have seen somewhat
of life's changes, rejoice in the beauty and fragrance of the blos
soms, and listen to the harmony of birds praising their Maker
"after their kind."
      It is a gladdening sight to witness groups of people going forth
in their best attire, with merry children, to the wood-side, there to
gather branches of may, and sweet herbs and flowers.          The strong
men seek out a tall tree, and that most clear of branches.          Then
is heard the woodcutter's hatchet, waking up the echoes both far
and near ; and then the crashing sound, when the noble head sinks
suddenly from among the topmost branches of surrounding trees,
and comes with a thundering fall to the ground.          Low it lies with
its leafy honours, but not destined to lie long, for it is soon fixed
to a team of oxen, the numbers of which betoken the liberality of
the neighbouring farmers; for twenty, and even thirty, are not
 unfrequently yoked for the purpose, each one having a nosegay
 tied to his horns.    He who looks at the procession as it emerges
 from some good greenwood, sees a sight of exceeding beauty ; he
 might almost fancy that a train of flowers was being carried in
 large baskets, so profusely are the horns of the ponderous oxen
 wreathed with the lovely productions of the spring.         Next comes
 the tree, crashing beneath its weight.        It is covered with herbs
 and flowers which busy hands have bound around, except at inter
 vals, where the bright colours with which the trunk is painted
 serve to throw out the delicate tints of the flowers.      The branches
 too are decorated in like manner, and behind it follows a great
  crowd, most of whom carry flowers in their hands, or large branches
  of may ; and young children have their posies of cuckoo-pints or
  cowslips.    The tree, thus gaily attired, is soon raised up, with
  streamers at the top ; beneath it the ground is strewed with flowers
  and green branches, and old and young dance around it in their
  natural pouring forth of joy at the blessing of returning spring.

            THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BIRDS.
                        BY CHARLOTTE SMITH.
     There    are few subjects more worthy of admiration than the
various instincts by which the different classes of birds are governed,
and the manner in which Nature has fitted them for the modes of
life they are destined to follow.   Many of them contribute to the
sustenance or convenience of man by their flesh and feathers, and
by the instinct which directs them, for their own support, to
destroy great numbers of those insects, which would otherwise be
           5.                                               p

injurious to him ; while his pleasure is promoted by the beauty of
their forms, and the cheering sounds of their voices.   " The music
of the groves  "   has always been named among the most pleasing
circumstances    that attend the renewal of vegetative life. And
even the dark and gloomy days of winter are not without sounds,
that afford a sort of melancholy pleasure.    The evening owl, and
the rooks that in a calm morning clamour high in the air, in their
flight toward distant downs and wild heaths, where in mild weather
the worms work up on the surface, contribute to the satisfaction of
the pensive observer.    So felt that admirable poet, to whom      amI
always disposed to refer for forcible and exquisite description, —
                 " And cawing rooks, and kites that swim sublime
                  In stillrepeated circles, screaming loud ;
                  The jay, the pie, and e'en the boding owl,
                  That hails the rising moon, have charms for me."
     In, or rather before, very severe weather, vast flocks of wild
waterfowl pass overhead in their way from the North to places
where, from the shelter of woods and hills, or the rapidity of the
streams, the frost does not deprive them of their food.       These,
particularly wild geese,          fly
                             so high in the air, that they are often
heard without being seen.     Nearer the sea, the birds peculiar to
the rocks and sands scream round the cliffs, or wheel over the
expanse of water   ;and are not less in harmony with the scene than
the thrush, the woodlark, and the nightingale, with the tender
green and reviving beauty of spring.

philosopher and the poet should both be naturalists.               Homer,

                                    a

                           THE WOODRANGER'S                            SON.

                  "   In the depths of the dark and silent wood
                      The ranger's lonely cottage stood :
                      No sound by day hut the rustling trees,
                      No sound by night but the whistling breeze,
                        And the wild bird's screaming note."
     This old    verse recurs to my mind as                            I
                                                       sit down to relate a
 passage in the     life  of  little  Eberhard.    And   the story itself? —
 ay, indeed, in recalling it                 I
                                      seem to be listening to one of those
 old songs, wafted to my ear with a mournful, long-drawn melody,
 such as one often hears in a lonely valley.             But the stone cross
 stands there still, although half-buried in the ground, and tbe wild
 roses twine about the mossy stone.          Listen, then.
      There stands the ranger's house, silent and lonely as the song
 describes it.    A spaniel is lying in the sunshine, with his eyes
half shut, as if asleep ; but every now and then he snaps at a fly,
which is bold enough to dance upon his nose : if he catches                 the        it,
poor thing    is  swallowed down in an instant, but                 escapes he  if

only shakes his ears contemptuously, and composes himself again
quietly to rest.       It   easy to see in Nimrod's face (for so the dog
                               is
    called) how much he looks down on such               fly-chase as beneath
is                                                                     a

other game the last shot he heard had struck his master, whose
            ;
loss is  mourned       by  widowed mother and her only son Eberhard.

The dog cannot weep, he can only mourn in silence                 and he has     ;
fallen away, as    iftormented               by
                                         bad conscience.

poor Nimrod was not altogether free from fault, —but this will all
be disclosed in due time.
     Nimrod gets up, stretches himself, draws long face, as weary      a              if
of life, and then walks slowly to the hedge, and stands there watch
ing little Eberhard, who, seated on the ground,              busy cutting and
                                                                           is
peeling    some twigs    of   linden-tree.
                                    a
     Eberhard was boy scarcely nine years of age his whole dress
                           a                                                :
consisted of  a  shirt and        pair of carefully patched trousers.
                                        a                                   His
blond hair, uncut, fell upon his shoulders, and his clear blue eyes
peeped out from under the arched brows                whilst his plump and
                                                                  ;
rosy cheeks betokened          childish absence of care, and his bare, sun
                                    a
burnt chest showed how he was used to sport about in the open air.
     At the moment of which we are now speaking Eberhard was

36                             THE PLAYMATE.
sitting on a hedge-bank, and with compressed lips was teaching his
little pipe the notes which he should afterwards play upon it. The
dog stood before him, looking on.
     "Ah, Nimrod!"        said the     boy; "and you too would like to
have a pipe, eh   ?    O, you poor beast ! you can do nothing but
howl and bark, whilst I can sing and whistle : you'll see, only wait
till I've done." And then he added to himself, in an under tone,
" Ay, and if the birds sing in the trees, the little twigs have also
tunes shut up in them ; and if one only knows how to set about          it,
out they come.      The boughs on the trees are nothing more than
unmade whistles.       Now,    if  one could but get the bark off  a tree
whole, there would be      a   pipe indeed! 'twould be heard as far as
the church clock but what
                  :                amouth one must have to hold    it
                                                                    !
                                                                     "
     Eberhard laughed to himself at the thought of the huge mouth,
with the whole bark of         a linden-tree stuck in it. But the dog
fancied that the laugh was meant for him he could scarcely have
                                                ;
understood    a  person's laughing to himself at his own thoughts.
He rubbed his sides against Eberhard's legs, in return for his kind
                             "
ness, but the boy said, — There, there, lie down     !  I've no time to
play with you now,    I  have work to do."
     Little Eberhard was rather too hasty about his work, which
required care he tapped the wood with the handle
              :                                                his knife,
                                                              of
and loosened the bark around the twigs, but still        it  broke con
tinually, as he drew      it  hastily off: he had yet to learn that he
could only cut those parts of the twigs which had no knots.         This
he now found out, and as he took up the last twig he exclaimed,
" Well, you must and shall do, — wait moment "
                                            a        !
     On   a  sudden   a shrill whistle was heard, proceeding from the
forest:   the dog jumped up, and pricked up his ears.       The whistle

                             THE PLAYMATE.                              37
was repeated, and in an instant the dog was off like a shot.         Eber-
hard ran after him, whistling and crying,     —  " Nimrod ! come back,
Nimrod    !
            "                                  —
               But the dog heeded him not he was already far out
of sight and hearing. Still Eberhard continued running further and
further into the forest, as if some one were pursuing him. At length
he stopped, for he thought that the dog would be sure to return
home by himself. " He is a faithful beast," said Eberhard ; " though,
to be sure, 't is not very faithful of him to run away thus."
     Eberhard's mother had forbidden him to go alone into the
forest, and he had promised to mind what she said.
                                                              " But now,"
thought he, "I'm here against my own will;                I   only wanted
to bring Nimrod home, and        I cannot therefore have disobeyed my
mother's orders.                             I
                     And, surely, now that am here there can be no
harm in my running about and having a little fun."
     So easy is it to invent excuses for any wrong thing we have
a wish to do, although we do not really believe the excuses to be
good, and in the background a little voice is heard which forbids
the deed. But we too often act as Eberhard now did : he whistled
and sang, that he might not hear the voice of conscience in his
breast ; he climbed up one tree after another, as if to escape from
his good angel, but still it followed him, entreating him to return
home.     Once, indeed, half persuaded, he got down a tree, and as
he stood looking up through the green boughs into the blue sky,
a squirrel ran up a beech-tree, seated itself on a high branch,
cleaned its smooth fur, and peered merrily about.                 Eberhard
snapped his finger at the squirrel, and thought to himself,
                                                                   " I only
wish I had you !     I am much worse off indeed than the birds or
squirrels, for I  can neither fly nor climb like them.        Nimrod was
right to run off into the forest ; he is master there, and we with our
broad clumsy feet cannot follow him.        I                   I
                                               only wish that had four
feet —  I'd jump then in another fashion."
     A mocking-bird, which was perched aloft on the top of a
withered branch, seemed to mock at Eberhard's strange fancies in
all kinds of tunes ; for these birds have no note of their own, and
only imitate those of other songsters.        Eberhard was teased, and
tried to frighten the bird away, by crying out and throwing stones
at it ; but the bird would not stir, until it saw the boy climbing up
to the top of the tree, then, whish ! off it flew to another tree,
where it began its song again.        But Eberhard found other birds
which could not fly away : there was a blackbird's nest, with young
ones scarcely out of the egg.      " One, two, three, four, five," counted

38                           THE PLAYMATE.
                                                           .^^fT'*'
Eberhard ; " again an odd number ! In every bird's nest I have
remarked this : it surely must have some meaning, if one only knew
what.     My mother was right when she put an odd number of eggs
under the hen to hatch."
     Had Eberhard paid more attention, and not been so hasty as to
imagine a general rule from the few nests he had seen, he would
have known that there is no mystery about the odd number of
eggs, simply because it is not true : the swallow, the house- and
wood-pigeon, sit upon two eggs only, and two is an even number
all the world over. But indeed if we knew everything in youth
there would be no occasion for us to grow old.
    The young blackbirds, whose mother had perhaps not yet told
them how many brothers and sisters they were, stretched out their
yellow beaks to Eberhard, and looked at him with their big yellow-
ringed eyes, as if in astonishment.       It was all one to them how
many they were, provided they       had  something to eat.    Eberhard
pulled a knife and a piece of string out of his pocket, and found at
the bottom a few crumbs of bread ; these he chewed, and then fed
the little birds : but all the thanks he got was a shake of the head,
whilst they only ducked down to swallow the bread more easily.
Eberhard saw that he could not yet take the nest without killing
all the little birds, and a feeling of pity moved him as he thought
of the mother returning home and finding her young ones gone :
but he resolved to wait till the old bird came.         Then again he
thought    of his  own  mother,  and  he  grew quite  hot with anxiety

 when he recollected how long he had heen away from home.           One
minute he resolved to leave the young birds to their mother, and
 only come from time to time to peep at them ; but still he longed
to take them.      But might not some other boy perhaps find them,
and rob the nest ? However his kind feeling conquered, and he
thought, if another boy could find it in his heart to be so cruel, he
could not.     "Bless you!" he said gently, bending close over the
nest ; and then climbing down, he cut three notches in the tree,
that he might know it again. At length he went his way home
wards : but still he must go a little round-about way.     Who knows
 but that he might find the dog ?
                        II.— COUSIN GOTTFRIED.
     Reader,    have you ever been quite alone at noonday in the
depths   of  a pine-forest?    The tall and slender stems, with their
smooth bark, stand glistening in the broken sunshine, and giving
out their resinous perfume : high above project their leafy crowns,
and at their feet the little tendrils of the moss interlace each other
closely, and form a soft covering to the ground.     Yonder stands a
solitary holly-bush, with its shining leaves ; a little lizard, which
had come out to sun itself in the moss, rustles deeper into its
retreat at your approach.       Leave the poor thing in peace; who
knows for what purpose it was created?
     As Eberhard pursued his way, a man suddenly stood before
him, clad in green, and with his gun slung at his back.        With a
smile and in a friendly tone he addressed Eberhard : he was the owner
of the forest, a rich peasant, who went by the name of "Cousin
Gottfried" among the folks in the country round about; who
were, in truth, just as nearly related to him as to the emperor of
Bussia.
     " What brings you here ?" asked Gottfried.
     " My two legs," answered Eberhard, pointing to them, and
thinking the while of his wish to have four.
     " What are you looking for ? "
     " Oh, nothing in particular; only our dog has run away."
     "Let him run to old Nick, the good-for-nothing beast ! he has had
too many masters, and is now quite muddle-pated. If ever       I fall in
with the creature, I'll shoot him as sure as he runs on four legs."
     Eberhard seized Gottfried's hand, and begged so earnestly for the
dog's life, that Gottfried at length promised to have patience with
him. He did not let go the boy's hand, and they walked on for

40                                 THE PLAYMATE.
awhile in silence, until they came to a little rising ground, on which
stood some noble pine-trees : then Eberhard exclaimed,
       "Cousin, what beautiful trees ! they are as fine             ...
                                                                 as fine . . .
as fine as a church ; ay, indeed, and much finer still !"
      " That's right, my boy ! " said Gottfried ; " I'm glad to see you
also like them.       Look-ye, the trees yonder, from that holly-bush
                  '
down to the         Shady Hollow/ are my state-room, my drawing-
room, in short, my delight : in the winter, when the sap leaves the
trunk and the time comes to fell the trees, this clump here has
been marked out four or five times to be cut down ; but when it
came to the point, and     I  looked at them, I've thought to myself —
Why not let them stand ? they are better where they are ; and,
indeed, they're a glorious sight.       There's a good sum of money, to
be sure, lying idle ; but what of that ? they are my pleasure, and
that's something; and it gladdens my very heart every time pass               I
this way to see them standing still alive and fresh and green."
      " Do trees, then, die?" asked Eberhard.
      " Certainly," answered Gottfried ; " everything in this world
must die. If the trees stand beyond their time, they become rotten
at the core."
       " Cousin," said Eberhard again, " you can tell me, dare say,       I
what becomes of all the millions and millions of birds that there
are in the world : one hardly ever finds a dead bird."
       " In this you see," replied Gottfried, "how pure and cleanly —
I   would say modest — Nature is in everything ; whatever ceases to
be of use, disappears of itself.       Thus, when a bird feels that it is
going to die    (of  which it    well enough aware)
                                   is                     creeps into some

animals live, or into      a cleft in   rock, or    hollow tree, where the

ants, flies, and other insects find      there the bird lays itself patiently
 down, puts its head under its wing, and waits until its heart ceases
to beat, and life     isgone   and scarcely have two days passed when
                               ;
the ants and insects have eaten         up, and nothing remains but the
                                        it
feathers, which are carried away                by
                                            the wind, or the young birds
take them and line their nests.         Everything      well ordered in the
                                                             is
world. The birds, all their life long, live upon ants' eggs, flies,
 and the like, and at last are themselves the food of those insects.
I   am not sure whether    it     exactly as
                                   is           say, but
                                                     I        appears so to

 me, and there    is   something sacred in the manner in which these
 little creatures instinctively retire from man's sight to die."
       Eberhard was delighted with all that Gottfried told him, and

he sighed to think how little his mother knew of life in the forest,
and that he had no one whom he could ask about these things, now
that his father was dead.
    " Cousin," said Eberhard, " do you know why waggons have
four wheels ? "
    " There are also carts with two wheels," answered Gottfried.

   "Yes, know that," rejoined Eberhard; "but there are many.
more four-wheeled waggons, and they are much better ; the two-
wheeled ones are just like a man with his two feet, easily upset."
   " Ay, if he does not keep his balance ! " said Gottfried, with a
smile ; and Eberhard continued : —
     " think men must have copied the four-wheeled waggons
      I
from swift-footed animals. Birds have only two feet, because they
are not intended for walking but for flying, and everything that
is obliged to remain on the ground has four feet : is it not so ?"
     " Yes ; but the waggons ? "
     " Why they are like an animal. When my dog is jumping
about, he seems just like a waggon ; his head is the axletree, and
his body is the body of the waggon, and so he moves swiftly and
turns about easily; and     I  cannot help thinking that men have
learnt from this how to make waggons."
    Gottfried nodded, as much as to say that the boy was right ;
and Eberhard, delighted to find so ready a listener, went on prat
tling away about all kinds of things, just whatever came into his
head.    At this moment a goldfinch whistled in a bush hard by,
and Eberhard exclaimed, "Cousin, do you think that the bird
knows its own name ?
                         "
     " What do you mean ? "
    " Why think that we men have given the birds their names,
           I
but that they know nothing about it.                   I
                                           Now should like to find
out how they call to one another   — I should like to know why it is
that a bird is straining its body and singing the whole day long."
    " Why that indeed can't tell you."
                        I
    " We have only one name for so many birds," continued Eber
hard ; " swallow, lark, and so forth.    Now       I
                                                 think if a blackbird
has five children, that each of them must have a name of its own."
     " The birds," replied Gottfried, smiling, " don't take their
children to church to be baptized."
    " And yet perhaps the birds may have names amongst them
selves, and we know nothing of it."
     " Yes, we know nothing about        and that's all that can be
                                         it,
said," replied Gottfried.
    Eberhard had still a  number of questions on his tongue's end,
and Gottfried liked to chat with the boy, for he was very fond of him.
But he now reminded him of returning home, and pointed out
the path through the wooded defile called the
                                                 " Shady Hollow," as
the nearest way.    Off went Eberhard with bounding step. How
                                               a

                             THE PLAYMATE.                             43
different was everything in the " Hollow
                                                   " to the
                                                              open forest
above ! The      brook  made   its way with  difficulty among the rocks ;
Eberhard had a great wish to look for crawfish, but he resolved not
to let anything stop him again.      The air was chilly, notwithstanding
the warmth and brightness of the noonday sun ; huge masses of
rock overhung the path on all sides, threatening to fall upon the
passer-by. One huge rock, overgrown with moss, had been stopped
as it was rolling down the steep by a young fir-tree, which fixed
itself firmly against the rock, and rose straight upwards toward
the sky.      Hard by lay a tall uprooted pine, bare and withered;
whilst here and there the stems of old trees hung down, bent with
age, and their dark boughs tipped with fresh green shoots.
     Eberhard had proceeded only a few steps when a dog barked ;
he at once recognised Nimrod : but why did not the dog come to
him ? Eberhard climbed up a rock, in order to look about and call
to the animal, but the sound died away upon his lips.             On the
opposite   side of the glen, stretched on  a bank   of ferns and moss, he
saw a rough-looking man, with black bushy hair and beard, and a
fierce expression in his eye ; at his side lay Nimrod, whom the man
was evidently trying to attach to himself.        As soon as the dog per
ceived Eberhard he bounded off to meet him ; and yet, plainly as
if  expecting a reproachful look in his master's face, he crouched
down at his feet, winced, and patiently awaited a beating.          Eber

 hard however had no time for this, for in a minute the rough-
 looking man stood before him, and exclaimed with feigned ignorance
 and in a sharp tone, " Who are you ?
                                        "
     " am the woodranger's son, Eberhard," answered the boy.
       I
     " And where is your father ? "
     " Dead, — he was shot in the forest."
     " Who shot him ? "
     " That nobody knows : if we knew that          "
     " Then you ought to kill the man who shot him, or you are no
 brave lad, no true forester's son."
     " Yes indeed," replied the boy resolutely.
     The man laughed aloud, and it seemed to Eberhard as if another
 person were laughing likewise down behind the rocks.         A sudden
feeling of fear and anxiety seized him ; he began to weep aloud,
 and said with a faltering voice, " Give me back my dog, I must go
home."     Nimrod understood what was going on, and bounded joy
fully up to Eberhard ; but the rough man gave the poor dog a kick
that sent him rolling down the hill-side, and he came limping up
again and laid himself down at the man's feet.
                                                     " Home, indeed ! "
said the man to Eberhard ; " no, no, you come with me."
     Escape was impossible, and as the only way of resisting, Eber
hard threw himself on the ground, and would not stir from the
spot.    The stranger, seeing that he could not succeed by violent
means, now tried what fair words would do, and said,
                                                            " I will not
hurt you, I promise ; you shall only help me to get a nest, and
then I'll give you something : what would you like to have ?"
     " Nothing — want only to go home."
                  I
     " But would' nt you like to have a little squirrel ? "
     " Yes indeed — but must and will go home."
                          I
     Eberhard stood half-angry, half-entreating ; his hand was again
clasped in another's, but the stranger's grasp was not like good
Cousin Gottfried's.     The boy yielded, and went with him, for he
saw plainly that resistance was of no use; and moreover he hoped
that, when they once got out of the Hollow, he should meet with
help : Cousin Gottfried, he thought, could not be far off, or they
would surely fall in with some one who would befriend him. But
no person, alas! was to be seen, and the stranger grasped Eber-
hard's hand as tight as a vice.

                              THE PLAYMATE.                          45
                      III.— THE VULTURE'S NEST.
     The stranger struck into a pathless track; and Eberhard,
who had fancied that he knew every tree and bush far and
wide, seemed, as he gazed around, to be in a new world.            They
 soon came to a large rocky basin, which looked like the dried-up
bed of some lake. The sun was already going down, and evening
was approaching.       Upon the wide open space were only a few
scattered bushes.      Here and there was heard the grasshopper's
chirp ; the droning bees hummed past ; and the butterflies, like
liberated flowers, flew gently through the air to their sisters, who
remained bound to the earth.         The tapping sound of the wood
pecker was heard    in   the forest, and the stone-thrush sang merrily
among the rocks, as if rejoicing to find life pleasant even there.
Eberhard in leaping from rock to rock often slipped and hurt his
knees : the stranger therefore (was it from kindness, or another
feeling ?) took the boy up in his arms, and sprang with him over
the deep chasms without ever stumbling.          At length they came
to a long, narrow ledge of rock, and now they walked again hand-
in-hand.
     " Where is your father's gun ?" said the stranger.
     "It hangs over the door at home, upon the stag's horns — the
last stag my grandfather shot."
     "Your grandfather was a murderer, — the murderer of my
father !
         " exclaimed the man, with a fierce look. Eberhard stared
in amazement, as the other continued, "Why don't you sell the
gun ? why don't you give it away ?"
     " Old Klaus, the ranger, told my mother that she should leave the
gun hanging where it was ; there is a bullet in it still — the last one
my father rammed down ; and Klaus says, that if ever the murderer
comes into our room, the gun will go off by itself and shoot him."
    Eberhard felt the stranger's hand tremble, as he held his breath
and bit his lips until they bled : then with a forced laugh the man
         "
said, — Stuff and nonsense ! do you suppose the fellow would be
such a fool as to come into your room and place himself just before
the muzzle of the gun, as much as to say, Now shoot me ?"
    The man turned sharply round, as if he felt some one pulling
him from behind. " What was that ?" he exclaimed fiercely, and yet
half trembling : "what are you about ? why are you pulling me?"
    " did nothing," answered the boy ; " and indeed could not
      I                                                    I
pull you."    An indescribable dread came over Eberhard, and he

46                             THE PLAYMATE.
began to sing aloud the pious songs which his mother had taught
him : he thought they would free him from the evil spirit which
held him prisoner, and dispel the terror and anxiety he felt. At
first the stranger, in a harsh voice, bade him be silent ; but
Eberhard did not heed him, and as he went on singing more
and more fervently, the man's rough hand gradually relaxed
its grasp ; he sighed deeply, muttering to himself, and unable to
check the boy, who sang as follows : —
                  " Angels, that in  heaven do dwell,
                    Keep and guard us safe and well !
                    Saints, that live with angels there,
                    Keep us ever in your care.
                    They do watch lest ill befall
                    To us, body, soul and all.
                   When we go about, or bide,
                    When we walk or when we ride,
                   When we sleep or when we wake,
                   We their care and love partake.
                    In all our ways, by day and night,
                    God doth guard us with his might,       Amen  !
     The stranger had involuntarily taken off his hat, and stood
there with folded hands and downcast eyes.                   Then he looked at
Eberhard, upon whose features the evening sun shone brightly:
they were radiant, as with a reflexion of Heaven's glory, and it
seemed to the boy as if he were taken up from earth, and heavenly
forms were hovering about him as he sang, —
                       " Tell me, angels, tell me where,
                           Have you seen my father dear      ?
                         For he's now in heaven high,
                           With the angels in the sky."
     They had now come to the end of the ledge of rock, where stood
a slender  birch-tree : Eberhard bent it down, as if it were a switch,
and stepping along its stem over a chasm in the rocks he sang, —
                    " Bend thee, tree !   and bend thee, bough !
                      My child has no    peace nor rest, I trow :
                      Now bend you leaves ! and bend thee, grass     !
                      And let all ill and danger pass."
     The stranger looked at the boy ; he could almost fancy him
some holy object, as he stepped thus securely over the frightful
abyss : he seemed half inclined to let him go ; when suddenly the
birch-tree flew back and struck the man in the face. This roused
his passion : he sought for the plank, which he kept concealed
in a cleft in the rock, and crossed over to the boy.                Eberhard was

                             THE PLAYMATE.                          47
 upon his knees, and stretching his clasped hands to heaven he
 was repeating a little prayer.    "Hold your noise!" exclaimed the
 surly man; "I've had enough of that: what are you afraid of?
 I'll not hurt you, but you must go along with me."
      "What for?"      asked
 Eberhard.
      " The rocks where we
 are now standing," re
plied the man, " are
 called the Cockscomb ;
you have        seen   them
often enough from a dis
tance; rarely indeed does
any one come thus far.
We are now within a few
yards of the vulture's
nest, — climb up the rock
there, and bring me the
young ones."
      " What do you want
them for ?"
      "The magistrates pay
a reward   for all the claws
that are brought to them;
and you too shall have
a share."
      "Pll not have any;
why don't you take the
nest yourself?"
      " Because   I cannot :
a person    would be lost
if he were to attempt
it alone; for when the old vulture comes, she would peck out
his eyes to a certainty.     I'll wait down here, with my gun, and
watch ; and if the bird makes a pounce, I'll settle him in a trice."
      "But where is the dog?" asked the boy, without knowing
exactly why.
      "He has not followed us," replied the stranger sharply; "and
moreover he couldn't help us.       Quick now, and climb up ! don't
you hear what a noise the young ones are making?           Off with
you!"

48                           THE PLAYMATE.
     Eberhard climbed almost involuntarily up to the shelf of rock
above, whilst, the man remained below upon the watch.
      Reader, have you ever closely observed a bird of prey balancing
itself aloft ? The lark, with its unwearied song, and the tuneless
swallow, skim for their own pleasure through the ocean of air ;
their flight is no hurried fluttering from one resting-place on earth
to another, but they are at home in the blue expanse of heaven.
And, like the lark and the swallow, the bird of prey hovers and
circles in its flight aloft.   Why have we given it that reproachful
name    — bird of prey ? The lark and the swallow snap up flies
and worms ; and the bird of prey obeys only the same instinct,
when it seizes, with its strong talons and sharp beak, larger prey
to support its life : and the lark and the bird of prey both do the
will of their Creator.
      Short-sighted beings that we are ! Behold yon black speck in
the sky, close to the horizon, fixed as if spell-bound by the sports
man's eye.      It comes nearer; with outstretched wings it floats
upon the light air. See now, how it sweeps round in a circle, as if
without an effort ! then, with a few strokes of its tail upon the air,
it rises, and sinks, and again scarcely moves from the spot.
     Eberhard reached the nest, and, in spite of his fear, he could not
help feeling a kind of joyous amazement when he looked at the
young birds : they were blind, and lay nestling their almost naked
heads together, either from affright, or perhaps because they had
something to say to one another which no human ear can under
stand.     For a minute Eberhard stood looking compassionately at
them, and thought, " How curious it is that dogs and vultures,
which have the best eyes in the world, are both born blind ! "
The young birds however appeared to notice Eberhard's presence, for
they tumbled about one over another, stretched out their red and
yellow beaks as far as they could, and rolled over and over in the
feathers of the various singing-birds that lined the nest.
      " Throw me down the young ones ! " cried the man, and
instantly again fixed his eye intently upon the sky.          Eberhard
stretched out his hand to take the young birds, which seemed
ready to fly at him : then he grew angry, and flung them down
one after    another — again there were five!
     A rushing sound was suddenly heard in the air above. " Duck
down, for your life \" cried a voice, and — bang ! — the report of a
gun followed, and a large dark wing sank down upon Eberhard :
he could keep his hold no longer, and sliding down the rock he fell

senseless on the ground beside the dying young ones and the old
dead vulture. The shot had been fired close above Eberhard's head.
     The poacher — for so we must now call the strange man — fixed
a dark and sinister look upon the boy, and then upon the vulture
at his side.    The sun was just sinking behind the mountain's
brow, and the man's face glowed in the light !
                                                  " The devil had a
hand in that shot ! " he exclaimed : " it would never have been so
   I
if had wished it. Why the boy is charmed, and as if he had
some unearthly spirit to protect him!    Well then, let his guardian
angel  take  him home —  ha, ha !"  The   man laughed wildly, while
            7.                                           H

he yet trembled inwardly with dread : he lifted up the huge bird,
with its expanded wings and bloody feathers ; but at that instant
seeing Eberhard stir, he hastened from the spot, and left the boy
lying there beside the expiring young vultures.
     In the night all the birds were startled from sleep in their
nests, for a boy went singing through the wood, —
                 " Now bend thee, tree, and bend thee bough,
                                                     I
                   My child has no peace nor rest, trow ;
                   Now bend you leaves, and bend thee grass,
                   And let all ill and danger pass."
                  IV.—EBERHARD'S RETURN HOME.
     The tops of the pine-trees       glisten in the first blush of dawn,
and the sun rises slowly behind the mountains; for its rising
appears to our eye much more gradual than its set.                    The owls
hoot for the last time   in their    hidden  retreats, —  the clear throats of
the little songsters upon the trees twitter as in a dream.             The sun
rises higher up, and breathes as it were a mild and trembling
glow upon the stems of the trees ; and all is silent around, in the
cool shades of the forest, as if some spirit were wandering through
a holy place.    The trees draw close their foliage, as with an in
stinctive feeling of awe, and quiver gently, and the birds hold in
their breath.    Then all at once a linnet's note is heard, exultingly
loud and clear,  —  others join in, — a joyous chorus of song resounds
through the forest — the day has dawned ! The dew drops glisten
in all the colours of the rainbow, and the lady-birds creep up
the blades of grass, and their shining wings glitter in the sun
light.    The butterflies flutter about, and greet the little flowers
                                                   as they awaken from their
                                                   sleep; and the floweret
                                                   turns, and bends its head
                                                   from side to side in the
                                                   gentle breath of morn,
                                                   greeting its sisters far and
                                                   wide around, and sending
                                                   forth its sweet perfume in
                                                   to the wide world of life.
                                                       On the moss, beneath
                                                   a beautiful pine-tree, close
                                                   to a bed of wild strawber
                                                   ries in full flower, lies a
boy, fast asleep, with his  right hand under his head.         It is Eberhard.

                            THE PLAYMATE.                           51
The dog sits beside him, with his eyes fixed upon the boy : he no
longer snaps at the flies, but only brushes them gently off, as if
afraid to awaken Eberhard by the least noise.
     The sunbeams kissed the boy's cheek, and gave it a still redder
glow; but Eberhard slept on calmly, as if the dark night were
around him : once only he sighed aloud, then turned, and fell
asleep again.     A man stepped out from the thicket ; the dog
sprang to meet him, wagging his tail; but Gottfried (for it was
he) put the dog away from him, and stood for some minutes
gazing upon the sleeping boy: at length he bent over him, and
cried into his ear, "Cuckoo!" Eberhard awoke,— he twinkled and
rubbed his eyes : he knew not where he was, and looked in speech
less amazement around.        When Gottfried inquired how he had
come there, he no longer answered with a joke, but he wept,
for he thought of his mother.
     " I had some talk with your mother yesterday," said Gottfried,
" and we have settled that, if you like, you shall be a schoolmaster.
A ranger's life is dangerous to your family, and you are an only

     " Oh, yes, anything that you and mother wish, and promise

you I will be diligent ; but now     I must make haste home."       So
saying, away   ran  Eberhard,  and the  dog bounded   on before.   He
was afraid lest Gottfried should ask him about the past night, and
the whole came back to his mind like a dark and heavy dream.
How he shouted with joy when he came in sight of his mother's
cottage ! the dog had reached it first, but he now came pacing
slowly back.    Eberhard called aloud to his mother from afar off,
but she did not appear.       He found the door and windows all
fastened up.    "  Surely," thought he,
                                          " mother must have gone
out early in the morning to look for me; or can she have
been wandering about the whole night in the forest?"             Eber
hard now felt how painful it is to remain waiting anxiously for
any one we love, whilst hour after hour passes and no one comes.
At length, however, some one did come, — it was the poacher, who
stepped out from the thicket, looking cautiously around.         Eber
hard shrieked aloud, as if he were going      to  be  murdered; but
the man said, " Be quiet ! I have brought you here a beautiful
present : you wished for a squirrel, but here's something          far
prettier, — a young fox.     Only promise me not to say a word oi
anything   that  has  passed between us."    So saying, the poacher
took a young fox out of a coarse cloth, put a little chain round its

neck, fastened this to the kennel, and then vanished as suddenly as
he had appeared.
    Eberhard' s mother at length returned home ; silent and sobbing
she threw her arms about her child's neck, and stroked his forehead
              ,                           again and again, to be
                                          assured that it was he,                  —
                                          that he was really alive.
                                          Eberhard said nothing of
                                          his adventures     in the
                                          forest, and for this want
                                          of frankness he had a
                                                    heavy punishment in store
                                                    for him. When the good
                                                    woman saw the fox, she
                                                    was going to untie    andit,
                                                    let  itrun back into the
                                                    wood  ; but she was afraid
                                                    to touch the animal, and
                                                    so the fox remained tied
                                                    up, and Eberhard told his
                                                    mother that     had been
                                                                   it
given him    bya  man in the forest.
     Eberhard now led happy and peaceful life again, but he was
                         a
not allowed to go into the forest     by  himself; and yet an irresistible
desire,a   kind of  spell, drew  him  thither.   The bright and tranquil
days of life leave behind them the least frequent remembrances;
and even when we recall them, their occurrences are related with
greater difficulty than those passages in our lives which are ruled
with less even lines.       Nevertheless these very days are the most
blessed we enjoy.      But in this respect     it with individuals as with
                                                    is

The history of     apeople records only the extraordinary events that
have taken place, and the same was the case, we see, with the his
tory of Eberhard's youth.       How glorious were the hours and days
he spent in the cornfield on the hill behind the cottage, watching
the corn as   it waved to and fro like     astream, or fancying         itmaa
jestic forest, with  its huge giant  stems ! —    seems
                                                    it    so,  at all events,
to the little insects, as they run about among the corn, and stop
again and again to rest in the weary effort of climbing up             blade.
                                                                        a
We call things great and small, but all depends upon the manner
in which we view them    ;    and when we extend our thoughts to the

  universe, our earth is but a little ball, and we men are only tiny
 creatures that creep about on it.
      Often did Eberhard stand in the ploughed field and reflect upon
 this problem of existence, and thoughts of infinity passed unconsci
 ously through his mind. Or he would stretch himself on the strip
 of grass by the field-side, and lie watching the little insects, as they
 hurried about among the grass ; or he looked up into the blue sky,
 where the pale moon stood in the clear noonday, patiently awaiting
 her time, when she should come forth in her mild glory, and the
 world should gaze upon her bright orb.             How unutterable were
 the feelings that passed through Eberhard' s breast ! he thought of
 everything, and yet he knew not what.            And then he would get
 up,  and stretch his  limbs    with a  vigorous feeling of delight, and in
 voluntarily shout aloud, or stand silent and thoughtful from the
 very fulness of his joy.      There is something mysteriously refreshing
 in reposing upon the earth, and a deep meaning is conveyed in the
 old Greek legend of Antaeus, who was weak when lifted from the
 earth, but became invincibly strong the instant he touched it again.
      One day as Eberhard was lying in a furrow, looking thoughtfully
up at the sky, and listening to a quail in the wheat-field close by,
he saw a pretty linnet, apparently just fledged, flying a short dis
tance and then dropping again on the ground.               Eberhard wished
to catch the bird.         Suddenly he jumped up, nimble and light-
hearted as if he had just been bathing in a fresh stream, and
ran after it from bush to bush ; but no sooner did he come near it
than the linnet was off again.         Still he did not give up the chase,
but ran on and on until he came to a deep ditch : the bird flew over
it,  and perching on     a   spray upon the opposite side sang    a   pretty
song   —   asong which no one had taught it.             Eberhard stopped
and reflected, that before he could climb down the bank and up
the other side, the bird would have       a    long start of him.     Open
ing and shutting his hand, he smiled to himself as he thought,
" How wonderfully birds' feet are made the bird hops from bough
                                              !
to bough, and never misses the twig, nor falls.           And how quickly
too   itcan open and shut its claws       —  and whata    good eyeit   must
have to calculate   it   all, and so quickly  !    To be sure," he added
half aloud, and turning his head round, "they have also           a   much
cleverer neck than we, to turn about so easily; whilst we have
to turn our whole body       if  we want to look round."      Breaking off
from this train of thought, Eberhard continued his walk, singing
a  merry song.

54                           THE PLAYMATE.
     Reader,   if any one were to lead you to a spot, and say,
" Listen   now to the echo ! " you would think little of it : but it
is very different when you come upon it alone and unawares,
as Eberhard now did.        He started when he heard the sound of
his voice echoed from the forest in a clear and lengthened tone ;
but recovering himself he cried " O ho !             " 0 ho .'" repeated
                                              "
                                                 . .
the echo from the depths of the wood.       And again he cried, " No
bird can do that, or make the forest speak!" . . "Speak!" re
turned the echo. Then he exclaimed, " Gottfried ! " and instantly
the name sounded from side to side.       And now he shouted aloud
his own name, " Eberhard ! " and the echo came back, " Eber
hard!"      What a happy feeling shot through the boy's heart, as
he heard his name repeated far and wide around, and in his joy
he exclaimed, "Now all the trees know my name." . . "my
name!" repeated the rocks around.           With inexpressible delight
Eberhard stood playing thus with the echo, which he had been the
first to awaken ; never before had any one on this very spot taught
the trees and hills to speak.     He tried to awaken it from another
spot, but it sounded less clear and loud than from that which he
had first discovered unawares.      He turned round, and said once
again,
         "                 "
           Farewell \" . . Farewell !
                                       "
                                          replied the echo ; and Eber
hard went down the hill to his mother's cottage.               His breast
swelled with emotion; in the depths of the forest he had heard
the voice of Nature, who answers to us distinctly when we greet
her from the right spot.      Oh, were not those happy, blissful days?
And yet sorrow was not far distant.
     One Saturday afternoon, Eberhard had gone to the village a
few miles off, when Cousin Gottfried stopped at the ranger's cot
tage in passing, and chatted awhile with the widow, who was busy
hanging out the linen.        She began to complain, that ever since
the fox had come to the house she had had no peace or rest with
her boy; she was always in dread when he was playing with the
animal : for though, in truth, it had not as yet done him any harm,
" Who                        "
         knows/' said she, but that the beast may one day suddenly
 go wild ?"     In short, she knew not what to do to prevent mischief.
     "That's an easy matter," said Gottfried; and he went to the
kennel, unslung his fowling-piece, let the fox loose, and shot him
 dead.    Gottfried laughed at himself for such an easy shot, as he
 dextrously stripped off the skin and thrust it into his game-bag.
 " Now you must do me a good turn," said he to the woman. " I
 have no more shot with me, and I don't like to go through the

                               THE PLAYMATE.                           55
wood     with   an empty pouch — it is not my way.         I'll leave my
gun here, and take your husband's, which hangs up in the cottage ;
there is still a bullet left in it."     So saying Gottfried took the
gun    and  went   his   way.
     Whilst this was passing at the ranger's cottage, the poacher
was watching for Eberhard on his return home from the village.
He stationed himself in a deep hole, where the stump of a tree
had been dug out, and soliloquised thus : — " So, Eberhard is to be
a schoolmaster !       I  may then wait long enough before the shot
that is destined for me will hit its mark ; and am      I to be kept in
this suspense, and going about for ever in fear and dread ? Ay,
and after all, perhaps, the mark of the murder will stick to my
family, and the folks up yonder go free ! No, by heaven, no !
For ages it has gone turn and turn with our families, and now 'tis
their turn to bear the guilt : the ranger has left one shot behind
him — that is my death-shot; it is time that my fate should be
accomplished."
     At this instant Eberhard came singing past; the poacher
stepped across his path, and presented to him a young thrush.
The boy took the bird, but he instantly let it fly away, and turned
a deaf ear to the poacher's soft words and promises.            The man
offered to teach him to shoot, better than any boy of his age far
and wide; and this was a great temptation to Eberhard, but he
suppressed his wish, and remained resolute,
                                                      " Only bring me
your father's gun to the Shady Hollow, and you shall have what
ever you like," said the man in a beseeching tone ; but Eberhard
ran off and the poacher cried after him,        "If you alter your mind,
you    can  come   —  I  shall be there in the   morning."
     "But I shall not come," said Eberhard to himself; and he
hastened home.        When he came there and found the fox gone, he
flew into a rage, and entreated his mother to tell him what had be
 come of the animal. But his mother gave him no answer, and
only forbade his asking any more questions about the fox.           As he
was looking about, he perceived some drops of blood on the ground :
his anger was now excited to the utmost, and he resolved to himself
 at all hazards to get another fox.
              V.— FURTHER ADVENTURES        IN THE FOREST.
      The next morning, whilst his mother was still asleep, Eberhard
 stole   downstairs into the sitting-room     :  his hand trembled      as

56                            THE PLAYMATE.
he seized the gun, and took it down.            The dog bounded for joy
when he saw his young master            thus   armed,   and they soon dis
appeared among the trees, but this time they went together.
    The morning dew lay still undisturbed upon ground and bush ;
no foot of bird or beast had brushed it off, nor had the sun's
rays drunk it up.       Eberhard struck into the young plantation,
where the tangled boughs seemed purposely to oppose his going
further : still he went resolutely on and on.            Presently he heard
some one singing at a distance; Eberhard hastily concealed the
gun among the bushes, for he recognised the voice of Gottfried, —
                   " Awake, ye birds in bush and brake !
                     Ye little nightingales, awake !
                     Sing with your bills, that seem to be
                     Turned as it were of ivory.                      •
                     Praise God, sweet prattlers of the grove,
                     And sing to Him who reigns above ! "
    Eberhard stood still, with folded hands, and prayed fervently :
his own strong sense of duty came back, and he resolved to return
home unseen, and never more to do such a wrong action.                  But
the triumph over his wrong feelings was incomplete, or he would
not have feared to meet the good man and frankly to confess to
him his crime, instead of endeavouring to steal away unobserved.
And this very feeling, of the fear of man, more than of the all-seeing
eye of God, caused Eberhard a deep and bitter pang."
    The dog barked : Gottfried came up. After his first expression

of surprise at meeting Eberhard thus a third time in so strange a
manner, he said, " Don't run about alone in the forest ; the Spaniard
Michael is again in these parts, and he is not a man to be trusted."
    " Who is the Spaniard Michael ? " said Eberhard.
    " Come out of this thicket, and will tell you the story ; you
                                       I
must hear it one time or another.") . . , .</ * -
    Eberhard was in anxiety at leaving the spot, fearing that he
should not find the bush again where he had hidden the gun ;
however he managed unseen to break -off a fir- twig, and place it
across another which lay upon the ground : he knew the marks used
by the rangers. They now went out into the older and more
open part of the forest ; then Gottfried sitting down on the stump
of a tree, and Eberhard on the bank opposite to him, the former
thus began: —                               ,.
                                                      «... ., ...,,...
    "The Spaniard Michael and all his family have, time. out pf
mind, been the enemies of your family; for your father, grand
father, and great-grandfather — ay, and further back still' — were
all rangers here; and the family of the Spaniard Michael have
always been poachers in these forests.      It is not known exactly
how the deadly feud between the two families first arose; but,
as you know, there always exists a strife between the rangers and
poachers: it seems indeed just as if the fierce spirit of the wild-
beasts, which are the cause of their enmity, passed into their
hearts.    Your great-grandfather was shot by one of the: Michaels,
and your grandfather in turn laid one of them in the dust, folks
say that the whole family are descended from a soldier, who, in
times of old, was left behind in these parts by the Spanish arnjy ;
they have hot, fiery blood in their veins.     As surely as the sun
now shines, your father was killed by a shot from the Spaniard
Michael, who, having been let out of prison, wanders about here
in the forests, and follows his old trade. You know that the laws
against the poachers, and the murders they commit, are seldom
enforced — j;here is a kind of understanding between rangers and
poachers, and indeed little good would' come of putting the law in
execution.    The Spaniard Michael was thrown into i prison after
your father's death, but he lied through thick and thin until he
got out again ; who knows what is now in his mind?— qertainly no
good.    I have already experienced his malice : my servant-lad met
him late last night in the wood, and this morning, J, find .nails
driven red-hot into my finest pine-trees, so that they must perish.
The Spaniard Michael knows how       I love those trees, and for that

 very reason he has destroyed them.     One could weep tears of blood
 to think how far the wickedness of men can go, — that they even
 take delight in destroying the pleasure of others.''
      Gottfried fetched a deep sigh and then continued : —
      " Ay, and the dog there had a share in your father's death !
 Do you see how he whines? he knows what          I am saying.    The
report of the affair probably originated with the Spaniard Michael
himself: he reared the dog, and then had him sold to your father
through a dealer.        Once when they met in the forest, in deadly
enmity, the dog leaped first upon one and then on the other, not
knowing which was his master : both called and whistled to him,
and just as your father was turning angrily round, the Spaniard
Michael shot him dead upon the spot.          Yes, howl dog, howl !
thou art indeed like many a human dog, who has sold himself,
and no longer knows to whom he belongs.''       Cousin Gottfried con
cluded his story and rose up.
     Eberhard felt his limbs totter; he could scarcely stand up
right : scalding tears stood in his eyes, and yet he could not weep :
he pressed his eyelids as if he would force himself to sleep, and
thus find relief from the frightful story he had heard.     Gottfried
held out his hand to him as he bade him good-by, and again cau
tioned him to return quickly home.      The dog had lain his head on
Eberhard's knee, but the boy now stood up, pushed him away,
and hastened into the plantation to fetch the gun, which he soon
found by the mark he had left; but on looking at it closely, he
fancied it seemed a strange one.      Could any one have been there
and changed it ? As he stood thinking thus, the poacher came
out of the thicket.
     "Are you the Spaniard Michael?" cried Eberhard, raising the
gun and cocking it.
     "I  am," exclaimed the man.
     "Was it you who shot my father?"
     " Yes, — but stop, you have no powder in the pan : give me the
gun." He snatched it from Eberhard, primed it from his flask,
then gave it back to him, and placing himself before the muzzle
said,
       " Now, fire ! " Eberhard stood speechless, and pale as death.
     " Chicken-hearted boy ! " exclaimed the poacher with a sneer.
" Courage,    lad, — fire !"
     Eberhard recovered his speech, and throwing himself on the
ground he cried out that he would not fire, but would sooner
die himself.       The poacher lifted up the gun together with the

 boy, kept Eberhard's mouth closed to prevent his crying, and ran
 through the wood down into the Shady Hollow, to a deep ravine
 shut in by overhanging rocks ; there he set the lad down, and said,
 "Now cry as you will — no ear will hear. you. Upon this spot
 you must shoot me.         I  might have confessed the murder, but no,     I

always been, and so it must continue."            As he said this, he placed
Eberhard upon a projecting piece of rock, put the gun, ready
primed and cocked, into his hand, stationed himself upon another
rock opposite, and then drawing a dagger from his pocket, he cried
out in a fierce tone, "Fire ! or you are dead — be quick \"
     Involuntarily Eberhard's finger was upon the trigger, when
the dog leaped on him, as if to stay his hand.              " Ha ! are you
there again ?   "  cried Michael, gnashing his teeth : in a moment he
snatched    his   dagger and plunged it into the dog's neck; then
putting up the dagger again, he flung the body of the poor animal
into a hole.     A third time he primed the gun, and standing before
it exclaimed, " Quick — pull the trigger \"
     "I                        I
         will not die, and will not do murder !'' shrieked Eberhard.
                       "
     "Eire! or
     At this moment a shot was heard from a rock above ; Michael
staggered back, exclaiming as he fell,
                                             " 'Tis the death shot ! "
     He was right: Gottfried was standing above, with the gun
which he had borrowed from the ranger's widow : he had observed
what was passing, and at once guessing the truth, he had thus put
an end to the dreadful scene and saved Eberhard.
     The smoke drew slowly off the damp rocks and trees ; Michael,
had breathed his last.          A number of newly made nails, which had
fallen from his pocket, lay strewn upon the ground : they were
exactly like those in the pine-trees.             With the death of the
Spaniard    Michael     the   frightful succession  of murders terminated.
Would that he might be the last sacrifice to that spirit of cupidity
and revenge by which man desecrates the sanctity of the forest !
     And Eberhard? — he           was carried home insensible, and lay for
several weeks in a fever.          When old enough, he was placed in a
school for training schoolmasters : his love of nature, which began
in childhood, led him to make the science of natural history his

 peculiar study ; and here he learned also to. understand many things
 which had formerly perplexed him, and to rectify many errors
which, when an uninstructed boy, he had looked upon as undoubted
 truths.   One thing in his studies was very strange to Eberhard, —
he no longer recognised many of the birds of his own native forests,
 although carefully stuffed in the museums, accurately figured in
books, and described from their internal structure and outward
appearance;    for one thing was wanting — and this with birds is
 the chief one — song.   Eberhard tried to write down the songs of
the' birds with musical notes and letters, but he soon gave up the
 attempt : there are things which cannot he committed to paper
nor learnt from books, and this too. has, its good.
     When Eberhard had ended his schooling, he joined an expedi
tion of discovery for purposes of natural history into Africa.
Accustomed from his youth up to a spirit of independence and
a' wild roving life, he bears the toil and hardships. of this life more
easily than many others.     He has already discovered several new
species of birds, and sent home many rare objects of interest.
     Eberhard's name is now mentioned with . honour : who knows
whether this gives him as much joy as when the lonely echo in the
forest repeated it ?   He is now far away, and cannot prevent our
relating the stories of his youth. Perhaps he will, some day or
other, inform us himself what life one leads in Africa, and whether
there are in that country also such wicked poachers.
     On the spot where the Spaniard Michael fell there still stands
a stone cross, half buried in the ground, and the wild roses twine
and blossom around the mossy stone.

                            MUSCIPULA.
         BY THE AUTHOR OF       "   THE GOODNATUEED BEAR."
     "Take pity upon me, a poor little Mouse, who has had the mis
 fortune to creep into this hard place, attracted by the smell of
 something nice in the inside !     I  little thought I should not be able
to creep out again.       Take pity upon me, dear Miss Muscipula, and
this once— only this once — open the trap-door !          Iam the mother
of a large family — all entirely dependant upon my exertions; and
we live, if you please, Miss Muscipula, in a little round hole in
the field, at the bottom of your ladyship's garden.
     " Of that round hole in the bank underneath the hawthorn tree,
my husband, Mr. Squeakmould, and I, have been the humble
tenants these two seasons.        We do not take up much room, and
we do very little mischief.         Indeed, we do no mischief at all,
because the few nibbles we take at cabbage-stalks and young pea-
tops, which are necessary to our existence, only do the plants good,
by giving more room.         We also do a great deal of service to your
ladyship's garden, by frightening away a variety of impudent in
sects with large mouths, who feed like horny lions and hairy
serpents upon the sweet green leaves and tender shoots, besides
rumpling the flowers.        I think I perceive you are smiling, Queen
Muscipula, and that you are not displeased with us for living in
your dominions.        I think you might have many far less loyal sub
jects than your most obedient humble servants, Mr. and Mrs.
 Squeakmould and family.         I also think your eye has once or twice
glanced    down   at the fastening of this trap, in which I am kneeling,
as though you were thinking of letting me out.
     " As to my family, they are composed of poor Mr. Squeakmould,
five young mice-daughters, and one promising mouse-son.              Poor
Mr. Squeakmould — wee wee wee! forgive these tears — as I was
about to inform you — wee wee wee! — has been laid up in one
corner of our house with a sore toe, under which affliction he is
very peevish and impatient.          He lost a whole nail and nearly a
barley-corn's length of skin with the hair upon     it,  and has not done
a  scratch of work these three weeks.     I      think sometimes that he
could do a   little work with the other three legs, besides nibbling   ;
but  I  always ivas
                  a     most indulgent mouse-wife, and    I  am sure that
I  shall not sink in    your ladyship's opinion upon that account, as

one female always has a proper feeling for another.           I  venture to
hope that you will graciously allow me to escape from        this  trap ?
       " How green and beautiful the fields were this morning, when
I   first peeped out of my hole and tickled a dewdrop with the
point of one trembling whisker ! As it smiled, and melted, and
fell,   I thought of the pleasantness and freshness of life, and also
of its shortness. Mr. Squeakmould was still asleep. He had
passed a shocking night with his toe.             And I had my share of
it — of the shocking night,       I   mean,   not  his dear toe. My five
daughters were also still asleep ; but my son was playing with the
extreme tip of my tail, which I left dangling down to the bottom
of our nest, to keep him quiet.          So, as I  was meditating in this
tender and instructive manner upon the beauties of the fields, not
without an occasional glance at the many good little things coming
up in your ladyship's benevolent garden, gradually, to the soft
sound of bells in the distance, and of a rivulet close by, there
came hovering upon the summer air the wonderful smell of cheese !
Am I correct in thinking that       I   saw your white fingers approach
ing the unpleasant fastening of this trap, with the intent to set me
at liberty ?
      " But what could do when smelt cheese ? It is well known
                         I            I
to all natural historians that the odour of this sweetmeat has an
effect quite irresistible upon the whole nervous system of the
mouse species.      I  therefore crept cautiously forth, following the
graceful and infallible motions of my whiskers, which continued to
wave and lead me onward.         " They marshalled me the way that         I
should go," as our poet, Master Speargrass, whose fame has ex
tended through every corner of the field, heroically expresses it.
With whiskers erect and quivering I advanced, until at length              I
arrived in front of a dark circular temple of wire, in the midst of
which, like a great lamp from the roof, hung the orange- coloured
morsel with the magical odour.
      " I feel persuaded by your
                                   ladyship's expressive smile that your
fingers, now placed upon the fastening of this trap             Ah ! what
do  I   see? —  the door beginning to open!     —   the green fields shine
and call to me    —  my liberty  —                —

ah ! the door opens ! Squeakmould !               all our blessings upon
you, Miss Muscipula ! — the fresh dewy grass — farewell for ever,

The father of Robin      a forester was,     And then Robin "got on his basket-hilt
   And he shot with a lusty strong bow,           sword,
Two north-country miles and an inch at         With    a dagger on the other side ;
     a shot,                                 And said, " My dear mother, let's haste

      know.                                    We have forty long miles for to ride."
For they brought Adam Bell, and Clym         When Robin had mounted his gelding
     of the Clough,                               so grey,

   And the forester beat them all three.       His gelding had oft carried double.

                            THE BEECH.
               from " The Woodland Companion," by Dr. Aikin.
     The beech is one of the most stately timber trees, and com
poses large woods in some parts of this country.             It particularly
delights in a chalky soil, where it will flourish and arrive at a great
size, though the land has all the appearance of barrenness.           When
standing singly, or at large distances from other trees, it spreads in
a round form to a wide extent, and forms a deep mass of shade ;
but when drawn up in close plantations, it rises to a great height,
with singular elegance and airiness.      Its leaves are of a pleasant
green, and many of them remain on the trees during winter, after
turning brown. No verdure, however, will thrive beneath its shade.
The smoothness of its bark has from ancient times tempted the
rural lover to carve the favourite name upon it — a custom recorded
in various passages of the poets ; and the opening of Virgil's first
Eclogue represents    the musing shepherd as reclining under the
shade   of a spreading beech.
    This is one of the glandiferous or mast-bearing trees.        Its nuts,
when eaten raw, are apt to occasion giddiness and head-ache, but,
when thoroughly dried and powdered, are said to make wholesome

bread.     They are, however, chiefly the food of deer and swine, and
of squirrels, dormice, and other small quadrupeds, which are nu
merous in the beechen woods.         An oil expressed from them is used
in some countries in place of butter.
      The wood of the beech is brittle, and apt to decay ; but, being
easily wrought, it is much used for various domestic purposes.         The
poets,   who  celebrate   the simplicity  and frugality of the early  ages,
speak much of the beechen cups and bowls, some of which received
an extraordinary value from the hand of the carver.          In our days,
beech is a common material of the turner and cabinet-maker ; the
former using it for his larger ware, and the latter for common
chairs and other articles of furniture.        It     indeed, almost the
                                                     is,
 only English    wood    employed  by  the London   cabinet-makers.     Its
lightness causes  it    to be chosen for the handles of tools  ;  and it  is
 split into thin scales for band-boxes, sword- scabbards, and the like.
 It  is
      a   common wood for fuel, and, in some countries,       is regularly'
 grown in plantations for that purpose.          The dried leaves of the
 beech make   a   very good stuffing for mattrasses.

                                     JUNE.
                               BY MARY ROBERTS.
      Let  us walk beside the river, flowing in its own calm, silent
beauty, and reflecting the summer-clouds as they sail majestically
through the heavens.           On its margin grow tall bullrushes, and
willow herbs, marsh marigolds, and St. John's wort, with their
reddish-yellow blossoms opening only to the sunbeams ; and, as if
calmly resting on their oars, white water-lilies, beautiful as those
which crowd the little bays and inlets of the Alpine lakes, are seen
on either side. Their snow-white globes float on the bosom of broad
leaves, and beneath them the speckled trout often swim for shelter,
when storms or a swiftly passing boat disturb the surface of the
stream.     Very pleasant, in this warm month, is the fresh breeze
that comes from off the water, and soothing is it to watch the tran
quil current thus gliding on, undisturbed by rocks or eddies.
      There is the stile and narrow path that leads into the meadow,
through which the river winds. Yesterday the grass stood thick,
moonflowers, and ragged-robins, buttercups, meadow-sweets, and
cuckoo-flowers,     lifted their heads above the undulating verdure.
Field-mice dwelt safely, and brought up their young ; and the field-
lark built her simple nest beside some over-arching tuft, and soared
and warbled in the early morning, when scarcely the wakeful
labourer was abroad : butterflies flitted from one flower to another,
and bees went in and out to visit the fragrant clover.              But now
the success of the rapid scythe is laying the herbage low.           What a
 deep, still sound   it is ! for the men   are too intent upon their work to
 talk, and no other noise is heard, except the gentle ripple of the
 quiet river. A beautiful array of flowers falls at every stroke,
 while the rich grass, sinking before the scythes of the strong
 mowers, settles in waves one beyond the other.            We might gather
 a bouquet of wild flowers from off those waves, for the sun has not
 yet withered them.
      The field is large.      It will take a long day, perhaps, even more,
 to cut down the whole.          We cannot wait much longer, pleasant as
 it  is to watch the mowers ; but we will go a little further up the
 hill, and turn into Farmer Welford's field, where we shall find
 something more going on, for his grass was cut last week.
       What a cheerful and merry scene ! Few country sights are more
 pleasing than a field with haymakers at work.              It was sad to see

 72                          THE PLAYMATE.
 the grass and wild-flowers falling before the rapid scythe — to think
 of the field-larks' nest, and the distress of the poor little mice
 driven in a moment from their homes; to think, too, that dull
 winter must pass over us before we can see again bright flowers in
 the same green meadow !       But here all is joyous.
      The haymakers work blithely, tossing about the grass, and
talking and laughing right merrily. This is a holyday, both for
old and young. Many who are employed in manufactures, with
their wives and children, obtain leave to work in the fields when
hands are scarce; and the doing so seems like a new life to them.
You may see at the further end, hillocks of grass thrown up in long
rows; the haymakers call them wind-cocks; they are piled light
and high, that the wind may blow through them ; but in this part
of the field people are tossing the hay about.         Grey-headed old
men are here, aged women, and children, seemingly without
number. Their parents are hard at work, and very glad are they
to put the " wee things
                           " in safe keeping among the old folks, who
yet can help a little.     Look at those girls and boys at play — see
how they pelt one another with the hay, and roll each other over
upon the grass — these are happy days.           See those youngsters,
scarcely  able  to totter, how  they tumble   on the sweet, fresh grass ;
while those who have strength to handle the rake mimic the
labours of their parents, and draw tiny loads along the greensward.
Meanwhile the hay is thrown about, and with each returning day
comes the same pleasant labour, till the creaking of a wagon, lum
bering up the hollow road from the old farm-house, half way down
the hill, gives the signal, which tells that the haymaking season is
about to close.     A short time elapses, and the creak of the heavy-
laden wagon,is heard ringing over the stones.        It comes up again
for another load; then lumbers back to the old farm, where labourers
are busily employed in placing the hay upon a strong foundation of
wattled boughs. / Some tread down the i hay; others throw it up
from out the wagon; till at length loud huzzas, that wake up all
the neighbouring echoes, announce that all the hay-stacks are
completed. .
   .
     June is the shearing month; the season, too, for bees to swarm;
and those who are much abroad in the fields may often hear the
loud ringing of a warming-pan from some cottage garden, designed,
as in the days of Virgil, to drive the bee colony to shelter.



                            THE PLAYMATE.                           73
               THE MADONNA DELLA SEDIA.
                           ( From the German. )
    Many hundred     years ago, there lived in the beautiful land
of Italy an aged recluse.      After many severe trials and losses, he
had retired to a deep solitary ravine, there to spend his last days in
        10.                                                L

peace   and devotion.    Yet such was his reputation for wisdom and
goodness, that even there he was sought out by many persons; and
the sorrowful or downcast mind always found counsel and comfort
in his lowly hut.      He was, therefore, justly love^jl and revered by
all who knew him, and he, in return, though so nearly withdrawn
from all human society, felt the natural craving of the human
heart for sympathy and affection.      Two lovely objects supplied this
void ; these he was accustomed to call his children : one had a
voice, the other was dumb. The first was Maria, the little daughter
of a neighbouring vine-dresser, who clung to the hermit with the
fervour of affection, and often traversed the dark forest alone to visit
him and carry bread, flowers, or the rich produce of her father's
hills.   The dumb child was a lofty and beautiful oak-tree, which
grew   above his hut, sheltering him with its wide-spreading boughs.
With the one favourite, the old man enjoyed the prattle of innocence;
he taught the child useful things, made her more familiar with
nature, and carefully scattered seeds of goodness in her little heart.
Upon the other he bestowed almost paternal care; in the dry sum
mer season he watered its roots from a neighbouring brook; he
fed and cherished the little birds which built their nests in its
branches ; and many a time, by his earnest entreaties, rescued his
darling tree from the stroke of the axe.
     " Be ever green, my strong and stately daughter," said the old
man, as he clasped his tree.      " understand well the rustling and
                                    I
whispering of thy boughs, and will protect thee till thou over-
shadowest my grave."
     After a very long, hard winter, during which the hills had been
covered with snow to a great depth, a thaw came on so suddenly
that the mountain-streams rushed down with terrific force, and
caused great devastation in the valleys.        One morning, Maria's
father came in hastily, exclaiming to his wife, " Alas, our poor dear
hermit ! we shall never speak with him more.            I have just seen
from my vineyard how the flood is raging through the valley, so
that the trees are only just visible above the waters."
     Maria wept and piteously entreated her father to go to the old
man's assistance; but he assured her that it was impossible, for the
torrent had been rushing for hours above the roof of his habitation.
Yet the hermit was saved ! — not, however, by the hand of man :
no, his dumb daughter had stood unmoved by the flood, and had
supported him in her arms above its violence.       He had fled to the
roof of his hut, upon first perceiving the rising of the stream ; and
when that was on the point of being overflowed, he had climbed

the tree, which firmly withstood the fury of the waters, while many
of its neighbours were uprooted and borne away.              Three days
passed before the waters subsided ; for three days did the poor old
man remain perched in the topmost branches of his tree, exposed to
the cold and rain, with no other nourishment than a little dry bread,
which he had providentially taken with him.
    At length, on the fourth day, when almost powerless and ex
hausted, he came down, sank upon the damp muddy ground, and
waited only for death.     But a preserving angel came instead.       It
was his loving little friend Maria, who had known no rest nor happy
moment since the fearful occurrence, and who now hastened through
the clammy, miry forest path, with difficulty making her way
through the ruins left by the flood.        She came to know tlje fate
of the good old man ; for, in spite of her father's apprehensions,
she clung to the hope of his being yet alive; and in this sweet
hope she brought with her a basket of provisions.             When she
found her poor friend lying on the ground, she threw herself down
by him, embraced him with her little arms, and recalled him to
consciousness and joy.
    The hermit thankfully partook of the nourishing food and re
viving cordial which Maria offered him ; then he kneeled down and
devoutly thanked God for the preservation of his life, and implored
Him to bless the instruments of his deliverance, and to exalt them
above all their race.      Strengthened and refreshed, he suffered
Maria to lead him to her father's dwelling, where he abode until he
could again withdraw to his solitude.
    When Maria had grown up in innocence, beauty, and virtue,
and had become a happy wife and mother, her ancient friend, the
hermit, had long been numbered with the dead. Maria had closed
his eyes, received his last blessing, and like an affectionate daughter
had sincerely lamented him. His hut in the glen had fallen to ruins,
and his beloved oak-tree had been felled; it was afterwards converted
into wine casks, which were purchased by Maria's father.
    Now, where is the fulfilment of the old man's prayer ? do you
ask, my children, since the wood of the beloved tree was doomed to
moulder away in dark, damp cellars ; and Maria's was a humble,
undistinguished lot ! Just listen patiently for a moment.
    One of these wine-casks happened to have been rolled under
the portico of the house, in order to be repaired and in readiness
for the approaching season of vintage.       Maria, to enjoy the beauty
and freshness of the early morning, had seated herself under the
portico with her two rosy children, fondling the babe at her bosom,

76                          THE PLAYMATE.
while the elder one played at her feet. As she gazed upon the
valley beneath, once inhabited by her still tenderly remembered old
friend, she recollected his blessing, and felt how it had been ful
filled to her in her children.      Her serene blue eyes glistened in
silent thankfulness.
     Just at that time, a young man gently wandered by, apparently
lost in meditation or dreaming fancy.       It was Raphael Sanzio, the
greatest painter of his own and every other age.        An image of the
Holy Mother and infant Jesus had long hovered before his soul ;
but never yet had he been able to embody his idea.            Full of the
engrossing thought, he had set out in his early solitary ramble to
collect his powers.
     As he passed, Maria greeted him courteously.          He looked up
at the sound of her gentle voice ; and when he perceived the lovely
mother and her children, he felt at once that here he had found his
so long and vainly desired reality.     From the mother's face beamed
the holiest love ; on her fair bosom rested the angelic infant, while
the elder one looked joyfully up, holding in his hand a wand,
fashioned into the form of a cross.       The artist, in this moment of
inspiration, wished to secure the group by sketching it on the
spot ; he had, however, only a chalk pencil in his hand.        The first
rays of the morning sun shining on the smooth end of the cask
suggested to Raphael the idea that this would suit his purpose.
He sketched the beautiful Maria and her children upon         it, tookit
out of the cask, and carried    it  home, where he allowed himself no
rest, until he had worked out and completed his immortal picture
of " The Holy Family."
     Raphael Sanzio (TUrbino died in 1520, more than 300 years
ago; but his picture has not perished, but will be preserved as        a
sacred treasure from generation to generation.
     Thus, dear children, you see how the good old man's blessing
has been fulfilled;   how his two beloved children have been united
again, and    in the sacred wood of the oak-tree the features of Maria
and her children have been borne down in glorious beauty through
centuries.     Long will refined taste and devout hearts be enraptured
and exalted at beholding that divine work of human art.
     Perhaps it    may be the good fortune of some amongst you to
visit the land of this invaluable painting, where   it    yet to be seen
                                                         is
and  is still renowned under the name of the Madonna della Sedia.*

                                  THE PLAYMATE.                               77
                             SPRING FLOWERS.
     The fields are now enamelled with flowers, the trees are sending
forth their young and tender leaves, and the bright green of the
larch is enlivening the woods.             Spring is come, — bright, pleasant,
hopeful Spring, — and each day brings forth some new beauty or
unfolds the buds of some old favourite; the primroses cover the
banks, and the cowslips deck the fields ; and
                   " The green turf, with daisies 'broidered o'er."
In  the damp, mossy recesses of the woods the stately orchis rears
her purple head, and the " nodding violet" nestles in the grass.
Flowers are the friends of those who dwell in the country.                 Shut
out from society, these furnish constant delight to all who watch
them carefully : their lovely colours, their graceful forms, their
endless succession, give variety and interest to every walk.             As the
months come round we look for the buds of promise, and see them
day by day expanding into beauty.                With poets they have always
been favourites; and by associating poetry with these lovely nurslings
of the woods and fields, a new source of pleasure arises in a country
ramble.
           " Flowers    to the fair ! To you these flowers I  bring,

     The Daffodil is an April flower, often showing its bright yellow
blossoms as early as March ; but this year the season has been so
cold that even in May they are still in flower. Here, in the south
of England, they grow wild, and the people call them " Lent-
lilies."

OX                           THE PLAYMATE.
Walter Scott introduced the historical romance into our literature ;
and in many of his novels has skilfully blended history with ro
mance, and given us faithful and valuable pictures of manners and
customs now passed away.        Fiction, however, can add little to the
charm of simple truth; and we may find tales of as deep and
powerful interest scattered through history, as ever sprang from
the imagination of the novelist.
     Amongst the most remarkable events recorded in history are
those great struggles which have taken place from time to time
between tyranny and freedom: these are important, not only in
connexion with the individuals who originated them, but univer
sally ; since, wherever man has boldly and successfully resisted the
spirit of oppression, a step has been gained in the march of nations
towards civilisation. To describe some of these struggles, and shew
their beneficial results, will be one aim of your Playmate's " His
torical Sketches."

                       THE SICILIAN VESPERS.
     The Normans, or Northmen, were amongst the most adven
turous of the barbarian tribes, who in the Middle Ages ravaged the
South of Europe.       They dwelt on the shores of the Baltic, and
having learned the art of building ships, sailed away in search of
distant countries to conquer. They landed and established a colony
in the north of France, and, emboldened by success, advanced fur
ther, passed the Straits of Gibraltar, and, charmed ,with the beauty
and fertility of Italy, attacked the inhabitants, and possessed them
selves by degrees of Apulia and Calabria ; they drove the Saracens
from Sicily, subdued the three republics of Beneventum, Salerno,
and Capua, and finally seizing upon Naples, erected the whole of the
south of Italy into a kingdom, under the title of the Two Sicilies,
a. d. 1138. The crown continued in the Norman line until 1183,
when, in default of male descendants, it was transferred with the
hand of Constance, its sole heiress, to Henry VI., emperor of
Germany.      Frederic II., his successor, bequeathed this kingdom
to his son Conrad, on whose death it passed into the hands of
Conradin, a mere child. During the minority of Conradin his uncle
Manfred usurped the government, and by his courteous manners
and just administration of affairs gained the attachment of all his
subjects.    As Conradin grew up, he became impatient of his uncle's

                            THE PLAYMATE.                              83
usurpation, but, wisely desirous of averting the evils of war, he entered
into a compromise ; agreeing that Manfred should retain the sceptre
during his life, on condition of its reverting to himself at his death.
     A feud had long existed between the Popes and the Emperors
of Germany ; and Urban IV. was so alarmed by the growing popu
larity and valour of Manfred, that he unwisely invited Charles of
Anjou, brother of Louis IX. of France, to come to his assistance,
promising to invest him with the crown of the Two Sicilies. Charles,
induced by the entreaties of his wife Beatrice, an ambitious woman,
engaged in the undertaking, and entered Italy at the head of a
powerful army. Manfred at once recognised the danger, yet did
not shrink from his post.     The armies met near Beneventum, and
after a fierce and bloody struggle Manfred was slain and his troops
routed.     Charles then marched straight to Naples, and took pos
session of his new dominions.
     When Conradin heard this fatal news, imploring aid from
his German friends, he hastened to revenge his uncle's death and
regain the kingdom, of which he was uow the rightful sovereign.
 His courage and valour were alike unavailing, when matched against
the experience and subtlety of his rival.      Conradin was defeated,
taken prisoner, and executed by order of the relentless Charles.
When led forth to death, the stripling excited universal sympathy
by his tender age, his dignified bearing, but most of all by his
innocence.     Having mounted the scaffold, he knelt in prayer ; the
remembrance of his mother alone daunted his spirit for a moment.
 " My mother ! my mother ! " he exclaimed, " this news will break
 your heart.'"    Then rising, he threw his glove amongst the crowd,
 intreating  that  some one would carry it to Constance, the daughter
 of Manfred, and wife of Peter king of Arragon, whom he formally
 nominated his successor to the Sicilian kingdom.
      Charles was now firmly seated on the throne ; his disposition,
 at all times stern and severe, became, after the death of his wife
 Beatrice, cruel and blood-thirsty.    He oppressed his people with
 unjust taxes, until unable any longer to endure his tyranny the
 Sicilians rose and fearfully revenged their wrongs. I shall, give an
 abridged account of this insurrection in the words of the Italian
 historian Giannone.
      Giovanni di Procida, a nobleman of Salerno and lord of Procida,
 was a firm adherent of the house of Swabia, and greatly esteemed
 both by Frederick II. and Manfred.      After the fatal termination of
 the battle of Beneventum, he was present at the execution of Con

84                             THE FLATMATE.
radin, picked up the glove thrown by the youthful victim from the
scaffold, and hastening to Spain gained admittance to Queen
Constance.     To her he
delivered this dying be
quest, together with the
message of her nephew.
Constance  was deeply
affected by the news;
both she and her hus
band received Procida
with the greatest kind
ness, and created him
baron of Valencia. Gio
vanni, touched by this
generosity,   devoted all
his energies  to their ser
vice ; resolving never to
relax in his exertions,
until Constance should be
placed upon the throne
of the Two Sicilies. He
maintained a body of
men as spies on the ac
tions of Charles, and be
gan cautiously to unfold
his schemes,    b^y
                  letter, to
a  few chosen friends. He
made but little progress
at first, for Charles had      I
carefully distributed his followers through the towns of Apulia and
Calabria, and   by severely punishing all the disaffected, and heaping
rewards  on  those who joined his cause, the attachment to the me
mory of Manfred had been effectually crushed.           This being the
case, Procida turned his attention to Sicily, where he found          a
state of things more ripe for his purpose.           The ministers to
whom Charles had entrusted the government of the island were
all Frenchmen, selected from his army, whose sole aim was to
enrich themselves, caring not at what cost to the people; the
Sicilians in consequence cordially hated their oppressors, and
Giovanni entering the island in disguise, quickly induced some of
the most powerful amongst the nobles to join in       a   conspiracy for

                              THE PLAYMATE.                         85
 attacking and expelling the French, and proclaiming Peter and
 Constance sovereigns of Sicily.      They agreed however to remain
 quiet until further aid could be procured, conscious that their
 own resources would not suffice against so formidable an antagonist.
 It occurred at once to Giovanni, that they might avail themselves
 of the dispute then existing between Pope Nicholas and Charles ; he
 remembered also that Paleologus, emperor of the East, was in hourly
dread of an invasion from Charles, and that he might easily be won
to take part in any enterprise which might divert his attention
from an attack on Con
 stantinople.   In the dis
 guise of a monk he re
 paired at once to Rome,
where he found the pope
most favourably inclined
to the plans of the con
 spirators. In the same
 dress he continued his
journey to Constanti
nople, and readily per
 suaded Paleologus to co
operate with them ; con
vincing him that the
 surest method of avert
ing an attack from his
 own dominions was to
 advance money to Peter
 of Arragon, in further
 ance of the Sicilian en
 terprise. Thus war being
 carried into the territories
 of Charles, he must of
 necessity abandon all idea
 of foreign conquest. The
 emperor willingly agreed
 to advance a sum of mo
 ney, on condition that Peter would begin the expedition immediately,
 and with spirit.      He despatched his private secretary with Gio
 vanni to the court of Peter, entrusting the money to him, and at
 the same time commanding him to assure the Pope of his willing
 ness to aid the cause.     The two ambassadors landed at Malta, where

 86                           THE PLAYMATE.
 they were met by some of the conspirators from Sicily ; and after
 relating to them the prosperous state of their affairs, and re-ani
 mating their hopes, they proceeded to Rome. Nicholas listened to
 their project favorably ; he was alarmed at the increasing power of
 Charles, who had begun to treat the Papal see with great neglect,
 and readily agreed to assist the conspirators with money.         He pro
 mised to give the Papal sanction to the enterprise, and to grant the
 investiture of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies to Peter. From
 Rome, Procida hastened to Arragon; he found Peter timid, and
 wavering as to his part of the affair ; but when he was made clearly
 to understand that the emperor Paleologus, and the Pope, had
 shewn the sincerity of their offers of assistance by advancing large
 sums of money — that the Sicilians burned with impatience to throw
 off the French yoke — and that he need not appear in the under
 taking until the conspiracy had actually burst forth, Peter's fears
 began to vanish.    Procida found an able coadjutor in Constance,
 who entreated her husband not to allow so excellent an opportunity
 of avenging the death of her father and nephew to pass by ; urging
 upon him at the same time the advantage of annexing the crown of
 the Two Sicilies to that of Arragon.       Peter at last yielded to all
 these arguments ; he speedily convoked an assembly of his nobles,
 who agreed forthwith to equip a fleet, under the pretence of
 making war upon the Saracens in Africa.             The better to elude
 suspicion, it was ordered to steer for that country, hover about the
coast, and be in readiness to set sail for Sicily if the conspiracy
 succeeded, or, in the event of a failure, to prosecute the avowed expe
 dition against the Infidels.
      During the arrangement of these preliminaries Pope Nicholas
died, and a Frenchman, a partisan of Charles, was elected by his
intrigues to fill the Papal chair, under the name of Martin IV.
Giovanni, fearing that the ardour of Paleologus might cool, deter
mined to return at once to Constantinople.          Accompanied by the
Emperor's secretary, he again assumed his monk's disguise, and
crossed over to Sicily ; they here communicated with some of the
leaders in the conspiracy, and confiding to them all that had been
already done, implored them to keep a good heart and fear nothing
from the death of Nicholas.       Giovanni succeeded in impressing the
secretary  with  the ardour  of  the Sicilians, and their firm resolve to
die rather than longer to endure the tyranny of the French : thus
he was enabled, from personal observation, to re-assure the Em
peror, to whose court they immediately repaired.          It is a singular

                            THE PLAYMATE.                          87
fact that, by the prudence of Procida, this conspiracy, carried on
between so many and widely scattered nations for two years, was
kept a secret from the crafty Charles.
     Peter, though dismayed by the death of his ally Nicholas, did
not abandon the enterprise.        He sent ambassadors to the new
pontiff, ostensibly  to  congratulate him on his accession to the
throne, but really to sound his opinions on the claim of Constance
to the kingdom of the Two Sicilies ; endeavouring to persuade the
Pope that he desired to decide the question, not in the field of
battle, but peacefully in the courts of the Holy College.      Martin
courteously thanked the ambassador for his visit, but added,  — " Tell
your king to expect no favour from the apostolic seat until he
has paid all the arrears of tax due from his predecessors and him
self, as true vassals and feudatories of the Church."      Meanwhile
Giovanni di Procida returned from Constantinople, and, under
various disguises, traversed Sicily, exciting the conspirators to re
bellion. By means of secret messengers he kept up a communica
tion with Peter, and, as soon as he found that the fleet was ready
to set sail, he fixed a day and hour for the insurrection to burst
forth.
     On the second day of Easter, in the month of March, 1282,
when the vesper-bell tolled the hour of evening prayer through
out every part of Sicily, the people rushed out armed, and mas
sacred all the French inhabitants of the island, without distinc
tion of age or sex ; so blind was their rage and fury, that many
Sicilian women and children, whose tender age might well have
been their safeguard, were sacrificed in the tumult.    The names of
Peter and Constance resounded through the island ; in less than
two hours eight thousand persons perished — none were spared : a
few tried to escape and conceal themselves until the excitement
should subside, but in vairi ; the Sicilians pursued their victims
until not a Frenchman remained in the island.
     Thus ended " The Sicilian Vespers," which gave a death-blow
to the power of Charles.       He vainly endeavoured to regain the
crown : disheartened by his losses, broken down by bodily disease,
this usurper and tyrant ended his days in misery, surviving the
Sicilian insurrection little more than two years.

                     THE HORSE-SHOE-NAIL.
                      From  the German of MM. Grimm.
     A farmer    once went to market, and, meeting with good luck,
he sold all his corn and lined his purse with silver and gold. Then
he thought it time to return, in order to reach home before night
fall: so he packed his money-bags upon his horse's back and set
out on his journey.      At noon he stopped in a village to rest ; and
when he was starting again the hostler, as he led out the horse, said,
" Please you, sir, the left shoe behind has lost a nail." " Let it
go," answered the farmer ; " the shoe will hold fast enough for the
                    I
twenty miles that have still to travel. I'm in haste."        So saying,
he journeyed on.
     In the afternoon, the farmer stopped again to bait his horse;
and as he was sitting in the inn the stable-boy came, and said,
"  Sir, your horse has lost a nail in his left shoe behind : shall I
take him to the smithy?"             "Let him alone," answered the
farmer ; I've only six miles further to go, and the horse will travel
well enough that distance.       I've no time to lose."
     Away rode the farmer; but he had not gone far before the
horse began to limp : it had not limped far, ere it began to
stumble ; and it had not stumbled long, before it fell down and
broke a leg. Then the farmer was obliged to leave the horse lying
in the road, to unstrap his bags, throw them over his shoulder, and
make his way home on foot as well as he could, where he did not
arrive till late at night.      "All my ill-luck," said the farmer to
himself,  " comes from that cursed horse-shoe-nail !
                                                        "
                            THE MONKEY.
     A monkey got into     the room of a rich miser, who never gave a
farthing to the poor; and seeing a chest full of gold, he began
flinging the sovereigns out at the window among the people, till
there was not one left. The monkey had just finished his job when
the old miser came home ; and seeing what had been done, his
rage was very great, and he would have killed the monkey on the
spot, if he had not jumped away faster than he came in.        A neigh
bour, hearing what had been done, said to the miser,      " It was very
foolish of the monkey, certainly, to throw the* sovereigns out at the
window ; but it was still more foolish for you to keep them locked up
in a chest, without making any good use of them.

          THE FISHERMAN AND THE FLOUNDER.
                   From the German of the Brothers Grimm.
    There    was once a fisherman and his wife, who lived together in a
wretched hovel, close to the sea, and every day he went to throw
out his line; and this lasted for a long time.
    One day as he sat on the shore watching his angle, and gazing
right into the shining waters, something, very weighty pulled the
           12.                                             N

line down deep beneath the surface, and when he succeeded in draw
ing it up again, behold, he had caught a large flounder !
     Then the flounder said to him : " Prithee let me go — for I'm
not a real flounder, but an enchanted prince ; so put me back into
the water, and let me swim away."
     " You needn't say so many words about it," replied the man,
" for any way should let go a flounder that is able to speak."
               I
    So he set him back into the waters, and the flounder dived down
to the bottom, leaving a long track of blood behind him.
    The man then returned to his hovel, and told his wife how he
had caught a flounder, who had told him he was an enchanted
prince, upon which he had let him go his ways.
    " And did you ask for nothing ?" said the wife.
    " No," said the husband : " what should I have asked for ? "
    "Ah!" replied she, "'tis so wretched to live in this dirty,
narrow hovel ! Now do go and ask for a nice cottage."
    The fisherman did not much relish this, still he went to the sea
shore, and when he reached it the sea looked both green and yellow,
and he stood beside the waters, and said        :
                 " Flounder, flounder, in the  sea,
                   Quickly hither come to me ;
                   For my wife, dame Isabel,
                   Wants strange things  I  scarce dare tell."

                                THE PLAYMATE.                           91
     The flounder then came swimming along, and said :
     "Well, what does she want ?"
     " Alas ! " replied the man, " my wife says, that when caught I
you   I ought to have asked for a boon, for she doesn't like to live
any longer in our hovel, but wants a proper cottage."
     " Go home," replied the flounder; " you will find her in it."
     So the man went home, and he found his wife standing at the
door of a cottage, and she said to him : " Come in, this is really some
thing better than what we had before."
     And there was a room, a chamber, and a kitchen, and behind
there was a little garden with all sorts of vegetables, and a farmyard
with ducks and hens.
     " Oh, how contented we shall now be ! " cried the fisherman.
     " Yes — we'll endeavour to be so," replied the woman.
     A week, and then a fortnight had scarcely passed over their
heads, when the wife said :
                                  " Husband, this cottage is too small for
me; the farmyard and garden are too small— I want to live in a fine
large house.     Go to the flounder, and ask him to get us a mansion."
     " Wife, wife ! " said the man, " the flounder gave us the cottage,
and I should not like to go back to him to ask for something more,
for he might take it ill."
     " Don't tell me ! " said the wife; " he can do it well enough, and
very willingly too, if you do but go and ask him."
     So the man went away with a heavy heart, and when he reached
the sea-side the waters looked violet, grey, and dark blue ; but they
were quite smooth, so he walked up to them and said :
                    " Flounder, flounder, in the  sea,
                      Prithee quickly come to me ;
                      For my wife, dame Isabel,
                      Wants strange things   I scarce dare tell."
     " Why,    what does she want      ?
                                         "
                                           said the flounder.
     "Alack ! " replied the fisherman in deep sorrow, "my wife wants
to live in a  stone house   !
                              "
     "Go   home, and you        will find her standing before the door,"
said the flounder.
     So the husband went back, and sure enough his wife was stand
ing in front of a large palace.
     " See, goodman," said she ; " this is something like ! "
     And hereupon they entered it together, and they found a num
ber of servants, and the walls were all glittering ; there was a golden
chair and table in the room, and behind the castle was a garden, and

a wood about          half
                       mile long, in which were stags, and deer, and
                             a
hares ; while in the yard stood stables full of cows and horses.
     " Now," said the husband, " we'll live in this fine castle, and
be contented/'
     "We will consider about that," said the wife; "in the mean
time we'll consult our pillow."
     So they retired to rest.
     On the following morning the wife woke up, and seeing it was
broad day, she pushed her elbow into her husband's side, saying :
" Get up, husband, we ought to reign over the whole land."
     " But, wife," said the husband, " what's the use of reigning ?
            I
I'm sure don't wish to be king."
     " Well, then, I'll be king," answered she.
     " O wife ! " replied the husband, " how can you become
king ? Surely the flounder won't grant us that !
                                                   "
     " Husband," rejoined she, " go straight to him, for I'm set
upon being king."
     So the husband went away quite sad to think that his wife in
sisted on being king, and when he reached the sea the waves were
of a blackish grey, and rolling up and down.       So he stood on the
shore saying      :
                        " Flounder, flounder, in     the sea,
                             Prithee quickly come to me ;
                             For my wife, dame Isabel,
                             Wants strange things   Iscarce dare tell."
     " Why, what does she want now ?" said the flounder.
    "Alas !" sighed the man, " my wife wants to be king !"
    " Go home, she is beeome so already," said the flounder.
    So the husband went home, and when he reached the palace
he perceived a quantity of soldiers with trumpets and drums, and
his wife was sitting on a lofty throne of gold, studded with dia
monds, and wore a golden crown, and on each side of her stood a
row of waiting-women, each one a head shorter than the other.
    " Well," said the husband, " so now you are king ?"
    "Yes," replied she; "I'm king."
    And after he had gazed at her for awhile he said, "What a fine
thing it    is,
            wife, that you should be king   Now we'll wish for no
                                                          !

    " Nay, goodman," said she, " this has lasted long enough —            I
can't stand      any longer: I'm king, and now
                  it                                   choose to be I
emperor."

                                  THE PLAYMATE.                                        93
   " Alas, wife ! "        said the husband,              " what    is the use of being
emperor ?
          "
      "
      Husband," said she, " go to the flounder ;                    I
                                                     will be emperor."
    " But, wife," said the husband, " the flounder can't make you
emperor, and I shouldn't like to ask him."
    " I'm king," said the wife, " and you are my husband ; so
go at once as      I
                tell you."
    So the husband left her, and as he went his ways he said to
himself : " This is going rather too far— it is too barefaced to ask to
be emperor, and the flounder will finish by being angry."
    With these words he reached the shore, and the waters were
black and thick, and the wind was whistling with a shrill voice.
He then approached the            sea, and said, —
                       " Flounder, flounder, in the sea,
                         Prithee quickly come to me ;
                         For my wife; dame Isabel,
                         Wants strange things         I

      "Well ! what does she want?" said the flounder.
      " Alas ! " cried he, " my wife wants to be emperor !                   '.'
      " Go home," said the flounder " she emperor already."
                                                  ;           is
     The husband then went back, and on reaching home he found
his wife sitting on    very lofty throne, that was made of
                         a                                       single            a

least two yards high, and on each      side of her stood  row of satel   a
lites, one shorter than the other, from the tallest giant down to the
tiniest dwarf, as short as my little finger. Before her stood princes
and counts, and when her husband approached her he said
                                                                   " So            :

     " Yes," replied she " I'm emperor."

     " Nay, wife," said the husband, "how can you think of wanting
to be pope     ?You know there only one pope in all Christendom."

      " Nay,   wife," said he,        " the   flounder can't make       a   pope   of you

                                     replied she

94                           THE PLAYMATE.
     So the husband went,  but his spirits nagged and his knees
trembled, while the wind blew violently, and the waves were lash
ing the shore as when there is a shipwreck, and the billows were
raging, and the sky was black, and a tempest seemed about to
burst forth. And the fisherman was quite unnerved as he ap
proached the water, and said, —
                  " Flounder, flounder, in   the sea,
                   Prithee quickly come to me ;
                   For my wife, dame Isabel,
                   Wants strange things      I

     " Why, what does she want now ? "           said the flounder.
     " Alas !" said the man, " my wife           has taken it into her head
                        "
to want to be a pope !
     " Go back," said the flounder ; " a pope you will find her.'*
     Then he went back, and on reaching home he found his wife
sitting on a throne two miles high, with a triple crown upon her
head, and around her stood a staff of the highest dignitaries of the
church, and on each side of her was placed a row of wax-lights, the
biggest of which was as thick as the largest tower, gradually dwind
ling down to a farthing rushlight.
     " Wife," said the husband as he looked at her, " so now you
are a pope   ?"
     " Yes," replied  she;
                           " am pope."
                              I
     " O wife," said   the husband, " what a fine thing it is that you
should be pope ! And now, wife, you'll be contented; for, being
pope, you can't get any higher."
     " shall think about that," said the wife.
      I
    And then they retired to rest ; but she could not feel satisfied,
and her ambition would not let her sleep, for she kept thinking
what she should wish for next.
                                    "
     At length the sun rose. " Ha ! thought she, as she watched it
from the window, " why should not make the sun rise myself?"

     Then she waxed wroth, and giving her husband a push, she
said : " Husband, go to the flounder, for               I

of the spheres."
     The husband, though still half asleep, was so frightened at
this that he fell out of bed.
     "Wife, wife!" remonstrated he, "think better of             it,
                                                               and be
satisfied with remaining pope."
     " No," cried the wife, " cannot bear any longer to see the

 I  please.   I  want to be Lord of the spheres."
      " Alas, wife ! " said the fisherman, " the flounder cannot grant
 such a wish. He can make an emperor or a pope, but further his
 power can't go."
      " Husband 1" cried she in a rage, " want to be equal to the

 Lord of the spheres : so go at once to the flounder."
      The fisherman trembled in every limb, and there arose such a
 storm that the trees and the very rocks waved about, while the sky
 was one sheet of black, and it thundered and lightened ; and the
 billows of the sea rose up as high as mountains, with each a crest of
 foam on their summit.           He then said :
                       " Flounder, flounder, in  the sea,

                         Wants strange things scarce dare tell."
      "What     does she want next?" inquired the flounder.
      " Alas ! "  faltered he, " she wants to be equal to the Lord of the
 spheres!"
      " Go back to your hovel again !" cried the flounder.
      And in their hovel sure enough are they still to this very day.
               A RICH HEAD AND A POOR HEAD.
      During      the reign of the late King of Poland, a conspiracy
was formed against him ; by no means an uncommon occurrence in
that unhappy country. One of the rebels, a Polish prince, forgot
his duty to his sovereign so far as to set a price of 20,000 florins
on the royal head.            He had even the insolence to write to the
King, informing him of the circumstance, with the idea of either
vexing or frightening him. The King, however, sent him the
following cool reply : —
                                " have received your letter, and beg to
                                  I
inform you that the perusal of it gave me exceeding pleasure, so
glad was    I to find that you valued my head at such a high price ;
I  can assure you, that I should be very sorry to pay one farthing
for yours."

           Thi   summer sun has ceased to shed
              My first    on garden hedgerows      trim ;"
           Its changing tints from      earth have fled,
              The   stars with dewy clouds are dim.
           Regardless of the evening's damp,
              Two lovers down the pathway stray ;
           I shew   my ineffectual lamp
              To light them     on their darkling way.
           As in the lady's willing ear
              His  ardent vows of true love speak,
           In lovelier tints doth    reappear
              My first upon her blushing       cheek.
           Confiding girl    ! his vows beware,
              And let yon rose     a warning yield     ;
           Amid its leaves that bloom so fair
              My loathsome second's oft concealed.
           Forsworn     ?  Once more with deeper dye
              My first, of   shame and ire the token,
           Flushes her cheek, lights up her eye,
              Then     leaves   her   pale,   disgraced,
                heart-broken.
           Trampled       in blood   where   war clouds
                roll,
              On battle-field the traitor fies   ;
           While   fiends exulting plunge his soul
              To  where my second never dies         !

                              FAIR ROSAMOND.
When   as King Henry ruled this land,   Her crisped locks like threads of gold
  The  second of that name,               Appeale (1 to each man's sight ;
Besides the queen, he dearly loved      Her sparkling eyes, like Orient pearls,
  A fair and comely dame.                 Did cast a heavenly light.
Most peerless was her beauty found,     The blood within her crystal cheeks
  Her favour, and her face ;              Did such a colour drive,
A sweeter creature in this world        As though the lily and the rose
  Could never prince embrace.             For mastership did strive.
             13.

 98                               THE PLAYMATE.
Yea, Rosamond, fair Rosamond,             But yet, my Rose, be sure thou shalt
     Her name was called so,                 My coming shortly see,
To whom our queen, dame Eleanor,          And in my heart, when hence        I am,
    Was known a deadly foe.                  I'll bear my Rose with me."
 The king, therefore, for her defence     When Rosamond, that lady bright,
    Against the furious queen,               Did hear the king say so,
At Woodstock builded such a bower,        The sorrow of her grieved heart
    The like was never seen.                 Her outward looks did show ;
Most curiously that bower was built       And from her clear and crystal eyes
    Of stone and timber strong ;             The tears gush'd out apace,
An hundred and fifty doors                Which like the silver-pearled dew
    Did to this bower belong :               Ran down her comely face.
And they so cunningly contrived,          Her lips, erst like the coral red,
    With turnings round about,               Did wax both wan and pale,
That none but with a clue of thread       And for the sorrow she conceived
    Could enter in or out.                   Her vital spirits fail ;
And for his love and lady's sake,         And falling down all in a swoon
    That was so fair and bright,             Before King Henry's face,
The keeping of this boVr he gave          Full oft he in his princely arms
    Unto a valiant knight.                   Her body did embrace :
But Fortune, that doth often frown        And twenty times, with watery eyes,
    Where she before did smile ;             He kiss'd her tender cheek,
The king's delight and lady's joy         Until he had revived again
    Full soon she did beguile :              Her senses mild and meek.
For why ?—the king's ungracious     son,  " Why grieves my Rose, my sweetest
  . Whom he did                              The king did often say.
                   high advance,                                              [Rose?"
Against his father raised wars            " Because," quoth she, " to bloody wars
    Within the realm of France.              My lord must part away.
But   yet, before our comely king         But since your     grace to foreign coasts,
    The English land forsook,               Among your foes unkind,
Of Rosamond, his lady fair,               Must go to hazard life and limb,
    His farewell thus he took :                             I
                                            Why should stay behind ?
" My Rosamond, my only Rose,
                                          Nay, rather let me, like a page,
    That pleaseth best mine eye :           Your sword and target bear ;
The fairest flower in all the world       That on my breast the blows may light,'
    To feed my fantasy :                    Which would offend you there.
The flower of mine affected heart,        Or let  me, in your royal tent,
    Whose sweetness doth excel :             Prepare your bed at night,
My royal Rose, a thousand times           And with sweet baths refresh your grace
    I bid thee now farewell !               At your return from fight.
      I
For must leave my fairest flower,         So  I  your presence may enjoy
    My sweetest Rose, a space,               No toil  I will refuse :
And cross the seas to famous France,      But wanting you, my life is death;
    Proud rebels to abase.                   Nay, death I'd rather choose."

                                       THE PLAYMATE.                                      99
" Content thyself, my       dearest love ;        " Cast off from thee these robes," she
   Thy rest at home shall be                        " That rich and costly be ;        [said,

   For travel fits not thee.                        Which I have brought to thee."
Fair ladies brook not bloody wars :               Then presently upon her knees
   Soft peace their sex delights ;                   Sweet Rosamond did fall ;
' Not rugged camps, but courtly bowers          ; And pardon of the queen she craved
    Gay feasts, not cruel fights.'                   For her offences all.
My Base shall safely here abide,                  " Take pity on my youthful     years,"
   With music pass the day ;                         Fair Rosamond did cry ;
Whilst I, among the piercing pikes,               " And let me not with poison strong
   My foes seek far away.                            Enforced be to die.

    Whilst I'm in armour dight       ;               And in some cloister bide ;
  Gay galliards here my love shall dance          Or else be banish'd, if you please,

   When     I  am parted hence."                     As you think meet to do."
And therewithal he       fetch'd a sigh,          And with   these words, her lily hands
    As though his heart would break         ;        She wrung full often there ;
 And Rosamond, for very grief,                    And down along her lovely face
    Not one plain word could speak.                  Did trickle many a tear.
And    at their parting well they might           But nothing could this furious    queen
    In  heart be grieved sore :                      Therewith appeased be ;
 After that day fair Rosamond                     The cup of deadly poison strong,
    The king did see no more.                        As she knelt on her knee,
 For when his     grace had pass'd the seas,       She gave this comely dame to drink      ;
    And into France was gone,                        Who took it in her hand,
 With envious heart Queen Eleanor                  And from her bended knee arose,
    To Woodstock came anon.                          And on her feet did stand :
  And forth    she calls this trusty knight,       And casting up her eyes to heaven,
    In  an unhappy hour ;                            She did for mercy call ;
  Who with his clue of twined thread,              And drinking up the poison strong,
    Came from this famous bower.                     Her life she lost withal.
  And when that they had wounded him,              And when that death through every limb
    The queen this thread did get,                    Had shewn its greatest spite,
  And went where Lady Rosamond                     Her chiefest foes did plain confess
     Was like an angel set.                           She was a glorious wight.
  But when     the queen with steadfast eye        Her  body then they did entomb,
    Beheld her beauteous face,                        When life was fled away,
  She was amazed in her mind                       At Godstow, near to Oxford town,
     At her exceeding grace.                          As may be seen this day.

            ^^WO,
                              THE OAK.
               From " The Woodland Companion,"  by Dr. Aikln.
     The  oak stands   at the head of British timber-trees, as well on
account of its utility as of the grandeur and majesty of its figure.
It arrives at a bulk equal, if not superior, to that of any other tree
of the forest ; and by the vast arms which it throws out on every
side, it forms a mass which fills the eye of the spectator, and im
presses him with gigantic ideas.      Its rugged bark and jagged deep-
green leaves add to its character of rustic and masculine strength.
     The oak most delights in a rich, strong soil, in which it strikes
its roots to a vast depth.    It loves hilly rather than boggy ground,
and thrives best in large plantations.       It is injured by cropping ;
whence may be estimated the mischief annually done to this noble
tree by the custom of cutting large branches for the celebration of
the 29th of May. It forms the largest head, and spreads in the
most picturesque figure, when growing singly, as in parks and
ornamental grounds; but it rises with a tall and straight trunk
only in woods and close plantations.
     The uses of the oak-tree are very various, and comprehend
almost every part of it.    The acorns (which, in common with the
nuts of other timber-trees, bear the name of mast) are said to have
been one of the earliest foods of mankind ; and in some of the
warm climates they are still in use for that purpose.              With us
they  are valued  as the food  of swine,  of which large    droves are sent

                               THE PLAYMATE.                              101
to fatten in the oak woods in this kingdom during some weeks in
autumn, when the ripe acorns begin to fall.              Squirrels and other
small quadrupeds also partake of the repast, and lay up acorns for
their winter store.
     Every part of the oak abounds in an astringent juice, which is
applied to various purposes.        The bark is particularly valuable on
this account, which renders it the chief material for tanning leather.
Oaks growing in hedge-rows, which seldom arrive to the size of
timber-trees, owe great part of their value to their bark. Before it
is used it is ground to powder, and the infusion of it in water is
by the tanners termed ooze. The small twigs, and even the leaves
of the oak, may be applied to a similar purpose.             Galls, which are
an excrescence formed in the warm countries upon the leaves of a
species of oak by means of an insect, are some of the strongest
astringents known, and are much vised in dyeing, on account of
their property of striking a deep black, with the addition of vitriol
of iron. The oak-apples (as they are improperly called), formed in
the same manner upon our trees, possess a similar property, in a
smaller degree.       Oak saw-dust is the principal material used in
dying   fustians.   It gives all the varieties of drab colours and shades
of brown, accordingly as it is managed and compounded.
     But it is by the use of its wood that the oak has acquired its
chief fame, and especially for the important purpose of ship-building.
This has made it so peculiarly the favourite of England, to whose
naval glory it is supposed materially to have contributed.              Thus
Pope,  in "  Windsor   Forest," speaking      of vegetable treasure, says, —
               " Let India  boast her plants, nor envy we
                  The weeping amber and the balmy tree,
                  While by our oaks the precious loads are borne,
                  And realms commanded which those trees adom."
     Oak-timber is fitted for this purpose by its strength and
durability, and also by the property of not readily splintering, — a
circumstance of much consequence since the invention of cannon.
 Ships of war, therefore, if not entirely built of oak (which from the
present scarcity of that timber is seldom done) have always their
 sides planked with it.      The crooked pieces of this wood, procured
from the bend of the branches, are also used for the knees, by
 which the planks are held out and supported.             Oak-timber is like
 wise preferred    for  many other services         of strength. In house
 building it is used for door and window-frames, and for wall plates.
 When more plentiful, floors and staircases were also made of it.

102                           THE PLAYMATE.
In  machinery, no other wood is equal to it where a great stress is
to be borne ; as in mill-work, steam-engines, and the like.               It is
used for the bodies of carts and waggons, also for gates, posts, and
ladders.   In the country it is a common material for furniture,
such as tables, bedsteads, and chests of drawers ; its durability
being thought a compensation for the difficulty of working it. The
coopers employ it for their largest vessels, and for well -buckets
and water-pails.
     The oak may be termed not less the poet's tree than the
artisan's.  Some of the first poets, ancient and modern, have
chosen it as an object either of direct description or of simile ; and
that, not only in its flourishing state, but in its decay.             Spenser
has given a fable of the Oak and the Briar, in his " Shepherd's
Calendar," which, as being of true English growth,             I shall copy: —
                " There grew an aged tree on the green,
                  A goodly oak sometime had it been,
                  With arms full strong and largely displayed,
                  But of their leaves they were disarray'd :
                  The body big and mightily pight,
                  Thoroughly rooted, and of wondrous height,
                  Whylom had been the king of the field,
                  And mochel mast to the husband did yield,
                  And with his nuts larded many swine ;
                  But now the grey moss mari''d his rine,
                  His bared boughs were beaten with storms,
                  His top was bald and wasted with worms,
                  His honour decay'd, his branches sere." — February.
     A more exact visible representation of the same object cannot
be given, than by the figure of the old oak of Cowthorpe, Yorkshire,
which measures sixteen yards in circumference within three feet of
the ground, in Dr. Hunter's edition of Evelyn's           " Sylva."

               THE MONTH OF JULY.— ANGLING.
                              By Mary Roberts.
      Izaac Walton tells    us that the pleasant art of angling is some
                    —
what like poetry a thing not to be acquired, but rather natural to
the mind ; and that he who desires to be a good angler must possess
both hope and patience.       Therefore, playmates, let us sit awhile on
this green bank, that our pulses may beat less quickly, and our
minds possess somewhat of that quietness which Master Walton
so much commends.
      How calmly glides the deep clear river, now winding through
a narrow channel with noble trees on either side, flinging their
broad shadows on its tranquil waters ; now emerging in its fulness
and sweeping onward with a broad and ample current ! Methinks
it is not strange that boys should like to pass whole hours on the
margin of such a river, not dreaming of their lessons, but calmly
intent upon their quiet labours ; for the mind must have an object,
and the ardent youth who thus sits on the flower-dotted bank, with
a long angling rod, could not brook the waste of unemployed time.
      It is very pleasant to rest here, to feel the soft fresh air, and
hear the cheerful hum of the industrious bee, gathering her honey-
harvest among the wild thyme.          Surely she teaches us a lesson
that we may do well to follow. And now that we are cool and quiet
let us begin the business of the day, each one choosing what part
of the river he likes best for fishing; and let us make this green
bank our place of meeting.
      Well, here we are again with line and basket.        Some of my
playmates have been unsuccessful.       Never mind, we shall do better
another day.       But  Ernest and Augustus come with smiling faces
and heavy loads.       What have you got ? A chub, a salmon, and
plenty of trout.      My old master, he who first taught me to love
Virgil, used to say that a salmon was the king of fresh-water fish.
 He took me with him on a fishing excursion through North Wales,
and we angled in the glorious lake of Llanberris, with a magnificent
brotherhood of rocks grouping around and casting their broad
shadows on the water, while the beams of the rising sun, silently
and yet irresistibly, seemed to motion them to withdraw, till the
whole surface of the lake rippled and sparkled with a brightness on
 which the eye could hardly rest.      We soon filled our baskets, and
 then went on to the meeting of the Blue Pools ; from thence to the
 river Gwynan, wandering with a loud sound through the romantic
 village of Bethgellert, where, tradition says, Llewellyn had a palace,

and poor Gellert, his faithful dog, lies beneath four grey stones, in
a meadow near the river.      We explored the whole neighbourhood
and sought out the haunts of the ancient bards, for, like Klopstock,
my master never lost the freshness of his feelings. He loved all

      And much that good old man would tell concerning the migra
tions of the salmon. • " They set forth," he said, " from their haunts
in all seas, whether belonging to the arctic or equatorial regions,
and proceed with the utmost regularity.      Ay, boys," he would add,
with an arch smile,
                      " if you need an example of order and obedience
to your mothers, take it from the salmon.      Foremost of the migra
tory bands proceeds a full-grown matron, with a steady, yet rapid
motion, followed by others of the same kind, two and two.          Each
pair in advance of those behind, from three to six feet.       To these
sucked the older members of the community; and last of all, the
young. fry, two and two, are frisking hither and thither,— no striving
to get a-head of their mothers, no pushing among their superiors
in age. Poets speak concerning the return of wandering birds,
and associate with them the opening of flowers and the leafing
of forest trees, but not less wonderful^ are the migrations of the
finny tribes, and the peculiar provision which they make for their
young.      A solitary fish remains to guard the infant , prodigy till
 sufficiently grown, when she returns with them to the sea. . Thus
wandering up the beds of rivers in order to deposit their eggs On
the soft sand, myriads of the salmon genus diffuse plenty through
the most inhospitable regions ; and the periods of their arrival are so
 accurately defined, that the inhabitants designate their months by
 the names of different species.    Strong winds sweeping along the
 cold and woodless shores, serve also an important purpose; they
 drive before them such whirlwinds of sand that the entrances into
 inland lakes are blocked up, and hence considerable numbers are
 detained.    When, however, spring commences, and the inhabitants
 depend no longer on their rivers for support, the winds uniformly
 change,. they scatter the sandy barriers, and the prisoners escape."

 often say; "seek to obtain knowledge concerning the wonders by
 which we are surrounded. You, my boys, will find such knowledge
 useful as you journey along the path of life ; and I, an aged man,
 whose wanderings are well-nigh over, can find much pleasure in

                        THE WINE-MAKERS.
               (Translated from the German by Alfred Sothern.)
    Once upon a time there lived two children, named Kardel and
Michel. Now Kardel was quite a stupid little thing, and it must
be confessed that Michel was not over-clever.            One day the chil
dren saw their mother drinking some wine.
    " Mother," said Kardel, " from what cow have you milked
that wine?"
    " You little stupid thing ! " said his mother ; " wine does not
come from the cow, but from the vine."
          14.                                                  p

    106                         THE PLAYMATE.
        Michel shook his head, and said gravely, " Nay, mother, I
    have been for the last half- hour lying under the vine, and I watched
.
    the berries   continually, and although   I   kept my mouth open, as
    I  always do, no wine ran into it.5'
         "Ah!" sighed his mother; and then she said, "Why, you
    stupid head, the wine must be made ! First cut a bunch of grapes
    from the vine, and having done so, squeeze it with your foot ; then
    let the juice stand, and when, after a month's time, you look at        it,
    you will find it to be clear wine."
        A  month after this, on  a   rainy day, the children came to their
    mother with   a glass full of dirty rain water.
         " And what    isthat for?" asked the mother.
         " Wine," answered Michel, and laughed out of all countenance.
         " Do not talk so                                       " Is wine to
                           foolishly!" scolded the mother.
    be put into that dirty stuff?"
         " Oh, surely! " simpered little Kardel. " Only      itisnot so clear
    as that which you drink.       Remember, mother,    a   month ago you
    told us how wine was made, and we have made           it  exactly as you
    said.   We went first to the vine-dresser, who cut us         abunch of
    grapes, and having trodden them under our feet, we let the juice
    stand, and on looking at   it   to-day, we found this wine exactly on
    the same spot where we had squeezed the grapes      a   month before."
         " Ah " sighed the mother, " that little Michel should have
                                                                           "
             !
    such little sense, and that Kardel should be such    a  stupid thing!
         In another story you shall hear still more of the clever things
    which little Kardel and Michel did.

She was a fair and winning child,             Behind her cot a garden lay,

And sun-bright locks that on the breeze       And rich with herbs, and roots, and

And food and maintenance it owed              Beneath a goodly maple tree
   Unto an ancient dame :                        The grandame used to dine.

New cheese and milk, and wheaten            And for     the health-bestowing breeze
   On snow-white linen placed, [cakes,          The cottage hearth forsook,
With pulse and fruits and honeycomb          And ever in the garden ground
    The hoard abundant graced ;                 Its daily food partook.'
'Twas here (forbade the fever'd room)        This nurse,    a poor but righteous dame,
    The gleesome Alice play'd,                  Who fea^d God's holy word,
Her primer conn'd, her worsted wound,        Had but to speak to gain belief
    Her little kerchief made ;                  For all that she averr'd.

But    ever at its waking hour                 Haste

On tiptoe, from its cradle nest,             'Twould brace my languid heart again
    To where the matron slept ;                  To breathe the blessed air ;

    Its cherish'd hiding-place.                  Some drear, unholy spell !
And when the sun, midst clouds of gold,      Now by her cheery hearth once more
    Sank in the glorious west,                   That ancient dame was seen,
One moment more 'twas fondly snatch'd        In coif and pinner white array'd,
    Unto that yearning breast.                   With venerable mien.
 Now ofttimes as the widow dwelt             The matin meal was straight prepared,
    On that dear baby's face,                    With pious thanks prefaced,
She fancied pining sickness prey"d           And then before the restless child,
    Upon its roseate grace.                      Its bread and milk were placed ;
And then, with      keen alarms disturb'd,   AVith eager grasp and bright'ning        brow
    She sent it from her side,                   It took its bidden store,
And would the chamber's heated air           Glanced round awhile, then quiet stole
    With nervous tremor chide.                   Forth through the open door :
 One morning, duly, to her couch             The     grandame rose: 'Methinks 'tis
    The treasured charge was led,                My darling thus should flee! [strange

 Pale was the little shrunken cheek,         With    weak but hurried step she trod,        .
    And dim the drooping eye,                    The babe outstripp'd the wind,
 ' Oh, God !' the aged woman gasp'd          With little porringer in hand,
    ' My                           '
          precious lamb will die !               Nor ever look'd behind :
 She felt its tiny arms — to her             It reached    the bed of purple thyme,
     They seem'd all worn and thin ;             Yet made no stop or stay,
 She look'd into its eyes —there danced      The turfen seat, the maple shade,
     No joyous light within.                     But still went on its way ;
 No reason could the nurse assign            And now quite at the garden's verge
     For this sore, grievous change,             With flow'ring shrubs o'erspread,
 ' The child was fed, and
                             tended too,     It pull'd the stem aside, and through
     (In truth  'twas passing strange!)          The fragrant covert sped.

All smitten with     a deep amaze,             And pleasure did the nursling child
   The trembling dames drew nigh,                All touchingly reveal,
And, shelter'd by the verdant fence,          While with the gentle snake it to/d
   Beheld with curious eye                       And halved its little meal :
A sylvan    glade o'er-knit with trees,       On this side of the porringer
   Amidst whose branches peer'd                  The bonny lambkin sat,
Blue glimpses of the summer sky,              And, lapping up its given share,
   By flitting sunbeam cheer'd ;                 The serpent lay on that.
The merry birds upon the boughs               So lovingly blithe Alice fed
   Their trilling matins sung,                   With her strange-chosen mate,
And every blade, and leaf, and thorn,         But ever, as the creature sought
   With beady dew was hung :                     To pilfer from the plate,
But nothing did the elders       heed         She softly tapp'd it on the head
   The wood-lark's     song to hear,             And, lispingly, did chide,
For   on that elfin spot they gazed           ' Fie !
                                                       Spettle-bat ! dear Spettle-bat !
   With wonder and with fear       ;             Teep on de other thide!'*
There, seated on the tender grass,            In  silence both the women watch'd
   They mark'd their wayward pet,                To mark how all would       end,
And by its side its porringer                 And, lost in wonder, knew not what
   And little platter set.                       The omen might portend.
Now once and twice      the fondling rapp'd   Well, soon between the babe and snake
   With spoon upon      the ground ;             The porringer was clear'd,
A  noise was heard far in the brake,          And gladden'd by the social meal
   And then    a rustling sound ;                The beauteous worm appealed.
And lo ! with many a spiral fold,             In  many a sportive wreath it coil'd
   Did from the coppice glide                    Upon the fragrant moss ;
A  serpent,   dazzlingly attir"d              Now like a di'mond arrow threw
   In beauty    and in pride ;                   Its taper length across ;
Its  glossy skin of green and gold,           Now, twisting to some poplar twig,
   With silver interlaced,                       Swung lithely to and fro ;
Seem'd studded with ten thousand gems         Now vaulted through the liquid air,
   By cunning fancy placed ;                     Now, diving, hid below :
And as it raised its jewell'd head            And round and round, and here and there
   Full haughtily on high,                       It wheel'd and leap'd and spun,
No Indian stone could match the light         Now gleaming in the leafy shade,
   Flash'd from that em'rald eye.                Now glitt'ring in the sun.
With wondrous gambolling it         crept     All this   the little Alice view'd
   Straight to the infant's feet,                With many a frolic smile,
And, fawning, joyously appeared               And clapp'd her tiny hands and crow'd
   Its visitor to greet.                         With very joy the while.

So wild and wilder wax'd the mirth        Well ! 'twas the heart-wrung mourner's
   Of that fantastic guest,                 At closing of the day,            [wont,
As though its gratitude should be         To seek the chamber of the dead,
   With antic feat exprest ;                And there to watch and pray.
Till, frenzy-wrought, it   made a spring, One eve the mellow harvest-moon
   As flashing meteor quick,                Shone o'er the tree-tops bright,
And twining round the fearless babe,      When to the stilly room she stole,
   Its  face began to  lick ;               But shrunk aghast with fright,
Now terror-struck the aged dame,          There, nestled by the infant's cheek,
   Scarce conquer' d from the first,        A furnish' d serpent lay —
And, shrieking loudly, through the hedge  The same that in the forest glade
   With sudden strength she burst.          Once used to feed and play :
Away, away, like lightning swift          All stiff and motionless, it look'd
   The startled reptile flew,               A form hewn out in stone ;
And in the tangled thicket's depth        And faded were its glorious hues,
   Was, instant, lost to view ;             In death for ever flown !
Nor  ever paused the troubled dame        The marvel flew the country o'er,
   Till, tremblingly,   she bore            And lil I'd it with amaze,
Her darling child, clasp'd in her arms,   And on the wondrous Indian snake
   Safe to her cottage door.                Lo ! many came to gaze.
She wildly sought for scathe or wound     And some with pity mused upon
  With agony distrest,                      That wasted, perish'd thing,
And on its tender face and limbs          Whose fangless jaws full plainly told
   Ten thousand kisses prest :              Thence could no venom spring ;
But not the slightest scratch appear'd,   All lifted up their hands and   eyes,
  No trace of hurt was seen ;               But nobody could say
And oft she glorified the Lord            To whom the hapless snake belonged,
   That snake had harmless been.            Nor whence it chanced to stray.
But, mark me well ! from that day forth   So buried was the victim -babe
   The infant pined away,                   Within the churchyard lone,
And, ere the summer leaves decay'd,       And o'er the hallow'd spot was raised
  A stricken corpse it lay :                A monumental stone,
And oft before it died it smiled,         On which wee Alice and the snake,
  And in delirium cried —                   Fail' graven, were descried,
'Fie! Spettle-bat! dear Spettle-bat    !  With 'Spettle-bat! dear Spettle-bal!
   Teep on de other thide !'                Teep on de other thide !'
Now in its early coffin laid,             And never from the burial day
   In little night-clothes drest,           The grey-hair'd woman smiled,
So placid, pale, and pure, it seem'd      But, habited in sable weeds,
   But newly ruck'il to rest.               Sat, sorrowing for her child ;
And varied rumours crept abroad           And morn and eve, throughout the year,

               From "   The Woodland   Companion"   by   Dr.   Aik'm.
     The common elm is a large timber-tree of great beauty and use.
It  grows to a great height, and at the same time, if permitted,
throws out expanded arms, so as to cover a large extent with its
shade.   Hence it is often planted singly or a few together in village
greens, where it affords both a majestic object and a pleasant
summer shelter.     The elm      however, often seen trained to
                                is,                                vast a
height with    asingle naked trunk, which mode of rearing destroys
its beauty, though  it  better fits   for
                                       it    particular use.
                                               a               In this
stateit    very common in hedge-rows, especially in the neighbour

are generally planted in avenues or in other artificial situations.
The diversity in the form and site of elms      agreeably sketched

  Cowper, the poet, who, of all others, viewed natural objects with
 most taste and correctness.         He first mentions them as growing by
 the river's side.
                                " There, fast rooted in his bank
                   Stand, never overlooked, our favourite elms
                   That screen the herdsman's solitary hut." — Task, b. i.
      Then they are seen encircling a cottage upon a hill.
                " 'Tis perch'd upon the green-hill top, but close
                   Environ'd with a ring of branching elms
                   That overhang the thatch." — Ibid.
      He also notices its hue, as of a deeper green than the ash.
      The elm .best loves an open situation and a black clayey soil.
 It  bears transplantation well.       It does not injure the grass beneath
 it ; and its leaves are agreeable to cattle, and in some countries
 constitute a considerable part of their food.              The ancients made
 great use of elms properly trimmed as props or supports for their
vines ; and the poets frequently allude to the marriage of these
dissimilar plants, and the aid derived to the weak and fruitful vine
by twining round the strong stem of her husband elm.
      The wood of the elm is hard and tough, and useful for a variety
of purposes. It is particularly serviceable for occasions which re
quire its being kept constantly wet , as in the keels and planking
beneath the water-line of ships, mill-wheels and water-works.
It is likewise used for axle-trees, naves, gate-posts and rails, floors,
dressers, blocks, &c. and it is very fit for the carved and ornamental
works belonging to architecture.
      There are several varieties of the elm, differing in the roughness
and smoothness of their leaves, and manner of growth. A dwarf kind
is employed for making tall hedges in gardens, or nursery grounds.

    Among the various nations who contributed to the overthrow
of the Roman empire, the Lombards were perhaps the people who
did most to repair the evils which had arisen to Italy from the
successive inroads of the northern hordes.        The Allemanni, a tribe of
Germans who dwelt between the Oder and the Danube, were the
           15,                                                Q

 first to penetrate into Italy. These barbarians were astonished and
 delighted with the beauty and fertility of the country ; dwelling
 themselves in a northern region, where the cold was excessive, in
 the midst of wild, trackless forests, and swampy, uncultivated plains,
 they regarded Italy as a kind of Paradise, with its rich fields,
 luxuriant vegetation, bright and cloudless sky, and warm sunny
 atmosphere.      The beautiful cities, enriched with edifices of Roman
 magnificence, baths, circuses, amphitheatres, and temples, dazzled
 and bewildered these Northerns ; who, when they returned to their
native country and related their tales of wonder, spread amongst their
brethren and comrades a desire to go themselves and visit this
 land of enchantment.         The love of war was the strongest feeling
in the breast of the barbarians, and they eagerly seized on the hope
of conquering this beautiful country. One by one the nations of
the north descended into Italy, spreading ruin and terror around ;
already had the Goths, Huns, Vandals, and many other tribes, joined
in the work of destruction ; rushing down from the Alps like a tor
rent, they drove the affrighted natives before them, plundered cities,
destroyed the noble buildings which adorned them, desolated the
country, and then retired, giving place to fresh hordes of in
vaders.     Italy fell a victim to these ruthless tribes, and at the time of
which    I  now propose to write, this once fertile and beautiful country
presented a scene of misery and desolation which can scarcely be
imagined. The empire of Rome was overthrown, a.d. 476, by
Odoacer, chief of the Heruli, who proclaimed himself King of Italy.
Theodoric, an Ostrogoth, subsequently usurped the sceptre, a.d.
493, and by the introduction of wise and salutary laws, and his
encouragement of agriculture and maintenance of peace, revived the
fainting hopes of his subjects.       Italy, after his death, was subdued
by   the   arms  of Justinian, emperor of the East, and remained for
many years     under   the government of ministers appointed by him.
One of these, Narses, having been treated with the cruellest ingra
titude by the emperor, in revenge invited the Lombards to invade
Italy, promising to yield it up to them on their first appearance —
an offer too tempting to be rejected by this ambitious and warlike
people.
      But who were these Lombards ? Listen, and I will tell you a
story of them, and of their king Alboin — of their strange man
ners and customs, of their cruelties and their virtues ; and from
this you will see how widely barbarian life differed from that of
civilised nations.

                            THE PLAYMATE.                          115
     The Lombards, or Longobardi (as they were called from their
long beards), came originally from the north of Germany, near the
Elbe ; by' degrees they migrated southwards, and fixed their tem
porary residence in Pannonia, a province to the north-east of Italy.
Alboin, while still a boy, killed in battle the son of Turisund,
the king of the Gepidae, who was the mortal enemy of the Lom
bard nation. His youth had hitherto excluded him from join
ing in the banquets given by the chiefs in honour of the victories
obtained over their enemies ; none being allowed to join in these
festivities until they had been invested with their arms by the hand
of a stranger king. Alboin, elated by recent victory and the death
of his youthful antagonist, entered his father's tent, and prepared to
take his seat amongst the warriors, when he was sternly reprimanded
by his father and desired to withdraw.      Stung to the quick at this
public rebuke, he mounted his horse, and riding to the camp of the
Gepidae, presented himself before the king, who was overwhelmed
with grief at the death of his son. With the blood of the child still
warm upon his hands, Alboin claimed the rights of hospitality from
the heart-stricken parent ; and so sacred were these esteemed among
barbarians, that Turisund, stifling his own emotions, received him
courteously, placed him beside himself in the vacant chair of his mur
dered son, and pledged him in the wine-cup.        During the repast,
Cunimund, the brother of the slain, roused by the presence of so
bitter a*n enemy, and inflamed with wine, insulted the dauntless young
Lombard.      Swords flashed from their scabbards, and blood would
soon have flowed, but for the interference of the king, who with calm
dignity commanded silence, and claimed for his guest the protec
tion to which his position as a stranger at their board entitled him ;
with his own hand he invested him with the arms which had be
longed to his son, and dismissed him with every mark of honour.
    This act gained for Alboin the applause of his nation, and on his
return he was hailed with shouts, and received as a conqueror ; to
us it can only appear a cruel and wanton insult offered to an aged
man, whose grey hairs and sorrow at least entitled him to respect.
During his short sojourn in the enemy's camp, Alboin had fallen
violently in love with Rosamund, the daughter of Cunimund, and
determined at any cost to gain her for his wife. By the death of his
father Alboin had become king, and proceeded in due form to
make proposals for the hand of Rosamund ; these were spurned
with indignation, the fair princess scorning to ally herself with the
enemy of her country and the murderer of her uncle. Alboin, how

116                          THE PLAYMATE.
ever, was not thus to be diverted from his purpose ; his peaceful
overtures being rejected, he renewed the war with the Gepidse,
which had been suspended; his arms were successful — with his
own hand he slew Cunimund, and compelled the wretched Rosa
mund to become his reluctant bride. The scull of his vanquished
foe was, according to the custom of the Lombards, converted into a
drinking-cup and carefully preserved amongst the regal treasures,
which were produeed on occasions of great festivity.
    Soon after this ill-fated marriage, Alboin, at the invitation of the
treacherous Narses, descended into Italy.         His progress there was
triumphant ; those fair plains, still known by the name of Lom-
bardy, yielded to this new invasion, almost without a struggle.
Pavia alone • offered a brave         resistance to his        arms; for
                                             three years it defended it
                                             self against the Lombards,
                                             until Alboin, exasperated by
                                             the protracted contest, swore
                                             an oath to massacre all the
                                             inhabitants as soon as they
                                             should fall into his power.
                                             Famine at length drove the
                                             city to despair, and the
                                             wretched    people    opened

                                             his impatient troops to take
                                             possession of the city; at
                                             the moment of passing be
                                             neath the gate, his horse

                                            The incident impressed his

only spared the brave people of Pavia, but fixed his regal court
there.
    Rosamund had long writhed under her compulsory marriage,
and sought with impatience an opportunity to avenge her wrongs ;
nor was it long delayed.             Alboin, grown weary of a wife who
hated and shunned him, lost no opportunity of insulting her.
One night in the midst of a carousal, when wine had flowed
abundantly and all were plunged in intoxication, Alboin, excited to
madness, commanded his attendants to bring the scull of Cuni-
mund, and having filled it to the brim with rich Falernian wine,
drained it at a draught; then replenishing the fearful bowl, he
ordered his cup-bearer to take it to Rosamund, and " bid her rejoice
with her father." The queen stood aghast at the command ; but,
controlling her horror, she received the goblet with a shudder.
" Let the will of my lord be fulfilled ! " she said, touching it with
her lips, but internally swearing at the moment that the insult
should be repaid with the life-blood of the king.                   Her threat
was speedily executed, and Alboin fell beneath the daggers of
assassins employed by his wronged but guilty wife.
     No sooner were the Lombards established in Italy than they
began to improve the country: the lands so long neglected or
desolated by war were once more brought into cultivation ; peace
was restored, and with it some degree of prosperity.               One of their
kings wisely summoned           his    nobles   around     him, and with their
assistance framed a code of laws.            Under the administration of the
Lombards the north of Italy remained until the time of Charle-

                NATURAL HISTORY OF BIRDS.
                             By Mrs. 11. Lee.
                          No.  I.—VULTURES.
     Birds  which feed on flesh, or eat other birds, small quadrupeds,
reptiles, and offal of various kinds, are called Birds of Prey, and
form two sets, or groups — those which feed by day, and those
which get their living by night : the first are called in English
Diurnal, and the second Nocturnal, from the Latin words sig
nifying day and night. All have four toes, strong talons, thick
legs and thighs, sharply pointed and crook' d beaks, with a skin
which covers the upper part, in which the nostrils are pierced,
and which is sometimes coloured.         They all have large, powerful
wings, fly rapidly,  and to   great  distances at one flight ; and are
among birds, what lions and tigers are among beasts.
     Vultures are diurnal birds of prey, and, with one exception,
have a part or the whole of the head and neck deprived of feathers ;
and these naked portions are often brilliantly coloured.         Their
beaks are crook'd at the end only, and are much more powerful
than their claws, so that they chiefly tear their food with them ;
their feathers are strong, and closely set together ; and their wings
are so long, that when the bird walks it is obliged to spread them
out, which makes it roll about in the most awkward and ludicrous
 manner.    Like other birds of long flight, the breast-bone of vul

                                THE PLAYMATE.                                    119
tures is very large, and their merry-thought semicircular, both of
which support their strong wings. Their sense of smell is very
powerful, and they are able to scent their prey at a great distance ;
they hover round it for some time, making circles in the air ; and
when their brilliant eyes, which see things very far off, assure them
that no enemy is near, they pounce upon                  and eat till they are so
                                                        it,
full that they can scarcely fly away. They often sit in                 a    stupid
state, so nearly approaching to insensibility,          that  they may    be  easily
knocked down without making any resistance.                    If this were not   a
provision made for them           by  their all-wise Creator, we might be
inclined to call them greedy but they eat in this manner because
                                   ;
they do not have opportunities of feeding often, and are obliged to
swallow    a   quantity at one time, to supply their bodies with the
necessary nourishment       :   an observation which may be applied to
beasts as well as birds of prey.
     Another propensity of vultures might be apt to make us call
them disgusting birds, were         it   not that such habits were most va
luable to human beings, in climates where the sun so soon causes
every thing to become putrid — they eat all which                  is  rotten and
offensive that belongs to animal substances, and are often, in con
sequence, called the scavengers of the earth.               They, however, were
for   this  considered    as  blessings     in  ancient   times,  and were wor
shipped accordingly.         Many have been found embalmed in the
tombs of Egypt but that practice was discontinued when the Ma
                   ;
hometans became masters of the country, who only encourage them
for the good they do in removing what              isunwholesome.
     Vultures are found in Asia, Africa, America, and the South of
Europe.       The largest of all   is  the Condor, which lives at       a   greater
 height    than   any   other  bird;    for   it places   its  habitation   on the
 crests of the rocky mountains of that lofty chain in the New
 World called the Andes, immediately below the part where the
 snow never melts, more than four thousand eight hundred yards
 above the sea.      It frequently measures above four yards from the
 tip of one wing to that of the other, when spread out and the          ;
 natives of the countries which      it   frequents have a peculiar cry, which
 always makes these birds display their enormous wings.                     Several
 condors will assemble together and attack and kill oxen, which has
 led to the story that they carry them off, which             is impossible  :   but
 they really   do  take  away  kids, fawns,    lambs, young lamas,       and   other
 weak animals, which several other vultures can also accomplish.
      The King of the Vultures           is   abeautiful creature   ;   the naked

parts of its head and neck are most exquisitely tinted with red and
yellow ; its fleshy crest is red like that of a cock, and it has a ruff
of soft feathers round that part of the neck where the plumage
begins : it is about the size of a large turkey, but its body is of a
longer shape.
     A vulture lives among the Alps which is the terror of the
inhabitants, as it is very voracious, and has been known to attempt
to carry away little children ; it builds its nest in the highest and
steepest rocks, and is the largest bird of prey in Europe.      Its head
is covered with feathers, and forms the exception we have al
ready mentioned ; it has a tuft of bristles over each nostril and
under its beak, and holds its wings half open when asleep.         It has
a cunning method of frightening animals which feed at great heights,

     There    isan old story among the fables of ancient Greece about
a  man called Prometheus, who        said to have ridiculed the heathen
                                      is
gods and goddesses of those times, and to have been so crafty and
 clever that he even deceived Jupiter.     He made man of clay, and

 gave him life     by
                    fire stolen from heaven, which he carried back to
 earth in a  reed hidden in his bosom, and which so enraged the king
 of the gods that he desired Vulcan to make         woman in the same
                                                         a
 manner and thoother heathen deities then gave her all the beauties
          ;
 and accomplishments       which    mortal could possess but besides
                                     a                           :
 these, Jupiter placed in her hands       box full of all the evils and
                                             a
 vices of which mankind can be guilty, with orders to open             and it
 let them out when Prometheus should marry her. Prometheus,
 however, knew better than to fall in love with this Pandora, as she
 was called, and she married his brother which put Jupiter into
                                                  ;
 such a   passion, that he caused Prometheus to be carried to Mount
 Caucasus and there chained to       rock, where
                                         a           vulture was to feed
                                                         a
 upon his liver for thirty thousand years and yet, though always
                                                  ;
 devoured, the liver was never to diminish.       Prometheus, however,
 was released in thirty years         by
                                     Hercules, who killed the vulture.
      The great poet, Homer, in his " Iliad," makes Apollo and
 Minerva witness the single combat between the heroes Hector and
 Ajax, in the form of vultures: —

                   Exalted, Pallas and Apollo, pleased

                 SADDLER MULLER'S WENDEL.
                             By Mary Howitt.
                       Paht I.-CHRISTMAS EVE.
     The final preparations for Christmas       were made at Heinrich
Miiller's, the saddler's, who lived in the Hauptstrasse or high- street.
The Christmas-tree was set up in the parlour behind the shop.
     For days and days, nay, for weeks and months, the mother had
been making preparations for this day, and the father had plen
tifully supplied the money.     There were not in all the town merrier
or heartier people than Saddler Miiller and his family. , His family
consisted of himself, his wife, and his three boys, Fritz, Heinrich,
and Wendel, or little Wendel, as he was always called.           The ages
of these boys were twelve, ten, and eight. All the town spoke well
of them. They attended the Gymnasium, or grammar-school ; and
while the two eldest wore gold ear-rings, because they were to be
tradesmen like their father, everybody had made up their minds,
ever since little Wendel was born, that he was to be a student ; and
this, of course, would make him the gentleman of the family.
     There was something very fascinating about little Wendel. He
had his own way with everybody, and the love and admiration
which his brothers had for him was quite beautiful.             Fritz hu
moured hini, Heinrich humoured him, his mother humoured him,
and so did his father, but nobody ever could see that it did him
any harm.      There was no end to his fun and his good humour,
 and his kindness to everybody.       All the saddler's boys were very
healthy, good-looking lads, but Wendel was the handsomest; his
 long dark hair fell in rich curls on his shoulders, and his oval face
 looked very much like a face in some fine old picture. His mother
 always said that Wendel would be fortunate in life, and that, some
 how or other, he would make himself and his family famous.           His
 father for some time thought of making a soldier of him, and send
 ing him into the Austrian service ; but, luckily, he gave up that
 idea after awhile, and so Wendel began to learn Latin and Greek ;
 and would be, everybody said, when he was a man, one of the
 famous professors in one of the Universities.
      Just at the very moment when the Christ-kindchen, or Christ-
 child (who, by the by, was Tailor Uebele's little daughter, borrowed
 for the occasion), no sooner had she,   I   say, with her silver crown on
  her head, and her silver wings on her shoulders, rang her little bell

                            THE PLAYMATE.                          123
to summon all the family into the parlour, where the lighted-up
Christmas-tree, laden with and overshadowing all the gifts, stood,
than a loud knocking and ringing at the house-door announced a
visitor.    It was odd that anybody should come just then, and more
especially when the snow was falling desperately, and the streets
were already half snowed-up !      It could not be Pelznickel, for he
was far enough out of Germany by that time.       Perhaps it might be
Conrad Bach, the lame journeyman, come about some business, and
now impatient to get back to his own poor Christmas-tree at home.
     Saddler Miiller rushed out to solve the mystery, and then
those in the parlour heard a man's loud voice as the door opened,
and a stamping of heavy shoes to kick off the snow, and they all
recognised that it was no other than Diedrich Herz, landlord of
the Golden Lion of Diirkheim, twelve miles off. Well, that was
a surprise, and a very great one, for nobody thought of his coming !
     Diedrich Herz was brother-in-law to the saddler, and was at any
time a right welcome guest in his house ; but what in the world
was he come for now ?     Oheim, or uncle Herz, was warmly welcomed
by  the  three boys, who were clamorous to shew him all their presents.
     But Oheim Herz, good man ! had brought bad news with him.
Very bad news ! The boys heard him tell their father and mother
that the lawsuit was going on as desperately as ever ; that he had
seen Jurist Gemahlin (the lawyer employed by the opposite party)
that very day, and he had told him that the saddler's hard old
enemy, who had been worrying him at law for five years, had com
menced a new suit, and vowed now that he would not desist till he
had ruined him.       Now was not this bad news ? And all this
vexatious lawsuit was about a little vineyard, which six years ago
the saddler had bought with a little spare money, and on which he
had built a summer-house, hoping not only to have good wine out
of his own vineyard but a deal of pleasure beside ; and now the
old enemy had set up a plea against the little summer-house, which
he asserted stood on half a hand's breadth of his land, and which
had cost the good saddler two hundred and fifty gulden to build ;
and now it must come down ; yes, there was no doubt of it. Far
mer Hardtman, the old enemy, who was as rich as a Jew, would
never rest till he had ruined the poor saddler.
     Was not that bad news for any man to bring to a decent
family on a Christmas eve ? There was no more merriment that
night for any of them.       Old Barbet and Fritz, with a lanthorn,
took home little Christ-kindchen, the tailor's daughter, through

the snow ; and as she had an apron full of gingerbread and apples,
and a pincushion in the shape of a boot, the bad news did not very'
much matter to her. The three boys left their parents and Oheim
Herz to talk over the unpleasant news he had brought ; and then
having put out all the Christmas candles that they might be lighted
another night, went off quietly to bed.
    They all slept in one room ; little Wendel's bed, of course,
standing in the warmest corner, and being the prettiest of all three.
They talked about the bad news which their uncle had brought.
For years and years they had heard about this horrid lawsuit, and
the wicked man, Farmer Hardtman, and his wicked lawyer, Jurist
Gemahlin.    They had never seen Farmer Hardtman ; but what
had they not heard about him ! He was very rich, and lived
somewhere on the plain at a great Hof, as it was called, which means
a farm or grange ; he employed a great many peasants, and, of
course, he was a very hard master.        He was not married, and
never had been ; and that the boys supposed was because he was
so wicked and could not get a wife : no woman lived in his house,
excepting a poor niece, who was not young, and who was deformed
and half blind, and that they fancied must be because they had
used her so ill, and because all her life long she had been crying.
He was a sort of dismal ogre to their imaginations ; and Fritz told
his brothers that he remembered once when he was at Oheim
Herz's, and went out with him somewhere in his wagon, he pointed
out Farmer Hardtman' s Hof in the distance, and that it looked like
a very large and dismal place.   Little Wendel said that he remem
bered when he was a very little child, and his mother had been
shewing him the pictures in the great picture-bible, and telling
him all about Jesus Christ and his goodness, and how strong,
wicked men killed him out of malice and envy, he fancied that
they must be just like Farmer Hardtman ; and he fancied, that if
Farmer Hardtman had had any children he would have said to them,
when they were reading in the Gospel, " Now, my dears, you
understand that Jesus Christ was a very wicked man, and that
healing the sick and raising the dead were wicked actions, and it
was very good of Pontius Pilate and Judas Iscariot to betray and
crucify him; and you must always do as they did \"
    These Wendel said had been his thoughts about Farmer
Hardtman when he was a very little child ; he did not think so
now, exactly ; but of this he was sure that he was a very wicked
and cruel man, and that he could have no pleasure in doing a good

action when he went on as he did, and was plaguing them all so
about a little vineyard and a little summer-house, and said now
that he would never rest till their father was ruined. Yes, there
was no doubt of        it,
                     Farmer Hardtman was       wicked man ;Tand
                                                        a                  if
Jesus Christ had been living now, he dared to say he would have
crucified him      !
    The boys all agreed that he was        very wicked man
                                               a              and     ;
the saddler and his wife, and Diedrich Herz, all three came to              a
very similar conclusion over their supper of liver-sausage    and
potato-salad.
              Past II.— HUNTING FOE THE SEYEN-SLEEPER.
    At Whitsuntide       the boys had    a  holiday, and they went to
spend  it   with Oheim'  Herz  at the merry Golden Lion. That was           a
pleasure  !    At the Golden Lion, where there was always         a  some
thing going on, where their mother had lived when she was          a  child,
and where the old storks that then had         anest in the roof had one
still, coming and going regularly spring and autumn, —was not
that Whitsuntide pleasure
     a                           !And then their uncle would take them
to the vineyard, which had cost their father so much trouble, and
where the summer-house stood, which the law had decided should
come down, and which stood on the very borders of wicked Farmer
 Hardtman's land and they would throw stones on his land, they
                       ;
vowed, just to vex him, though he would never know about it.
     The sun shone splendidly that pleasant Whitsuntide.                The
apple-trees     bythe road-sides and in the orchards were all in blos
som, and the peasants, men and women and children, were at
work in the fields.       The old father stork "sat on the roof-tree,
with one leg tucked up, as the boys came in sight of the house             ;
and Oheim Herz and his wife, who had no children of their own,
made  a   wonderful rejoicing over them when they got in.
     Little Wendel had set his mind on having           seven-sleeper.
                                                            a              A
seven-sleeper, you    must   understand,  is   sort
                                               a    of very little squirrel,
not much bigger than         a mouse  — a little innocent creature that
sleeps  all winter, and  in summer builds its nest and rears its young
in the woods.      Of all things in this world, Wendel wished for           a
seven-sleeper, which he might take out of the nest when quite
young, tame, and teach to love him; and             was therefore agreed,
                                                   it
that when they went to their uncle's they would go to the woods             a
few miles off to hunt for one.      Neither uncle nor aunt saw any ob
jection to    it
              :  why should they? And after they had been         a  day or

126                           THE PLAYMATE.
two they set off to the wood, which was six miles off, taking their
dinner with them.
     It was a wood of many miles in extent to which they went, and
I  only wish    I  could give you an idea of what a pleasant wood it
was.      I have been there myself, and therefore       I  know ; in some
parts   it  was all beech-wood, and there the ground was dry and leaf
less ; and the young, tender leaves made a canopy overhead, as if
of the palest green silk ; after awhile there were long stretches of
pine-wood that looked solemn and mysterious, and tall/thin grasses
grew below, and banks of bluebells shelving to the sun ; and then
there were little rivulets of water that ran murmuring on among
roots and stones, and all kind of lovely water-plants grew there,
and kingfishers and dragon-flies darted about; but nowhere could
they find a seven-sleeper's nest.      No, it was not the right kind of
wood for that !        It was coppice-wood which they needed, where
hazels and young ash-trees grew, and in search of such they went
on and on a far greater distance than they had any idea of, and
until it was getting quite late in the afternoon.         They were many
miles from the Golden Lion, but they were not inclined to turn
back; nor, indeed, did they think about it; and then, just before
sunset, they entered the very kind of wood they wanted, and before
they had gone very far, little Wendel joyfully exclaimed, "There is
one ! there is one !
                         " and pointed to the fork of a young elm, and,
without waiting for any opinion from his brothers, hastily climbed
the tree.
     But he was mistaken ; it was not a seven-sleeper's nest, and,
 what was much worse, by some sad mischance his foot slipped, and
 he fell from the forked bough to the ground.          Could his brothers
 have caught him in their arms they would ; but no ! down to the
 hard, hard ground he came, with a force that made the other two
 boys feel absolutely sick.     It was a terrible cry that he uttered, and
 writhed his poor body as if in agony, and then lay still and pale as
 death.      His brothers thought he was dead ; but he had fainted.
      I  will not attempt to describe to you the dreadful hour and half
 whcih succeeded this time. Evening had set in ; they were a long
 way from any road, and poor Wendel's groans and fainting fits
 almost drove his brothers out of their minds.        They were so afraid
 that he     would  die  in the wood ; they were   so  very sorry for him,
 and they did not know how to do him any good.            In about an hour
 and a half, however, they had managed to carry him to a road about
 a mile off; but where the road led to they did not know, for they

                            THE PLAYMATE.                          127
had never been there before in all their lives.    Little "Wendel tried
to bear his dreadful pain patiently, but he hardly could, and his
brothers cried bitterly because they coitld neither bear it for him
nor lessen it in any way.
      It was now quite dusk, the stars came out overhead, and they
could neither see house nor human being near them.
      " Oh, that it had been I ! " exclaimed Fritz.
      " Oh, that it had been ! " exclaimed Heinrich, without know
                             I
ing what his brother had said, for they could think about nothing
but poor Wendel.
      The road where they were Was one which diverged from the
wood into the open country beyond, and on each side it was bor
 dered with walnut-trees.     In ancient times a large stone crucifix
 had stood at this angle of the road, but now nothing remained of it
 but the shaft, and the broken stone steps, and a stone bench near.
 The boys took off their coats and made as good a bed as they could
 for their little brother, and looked up and down the road in the
 hope of somebody coming.
       Before long they had the comfort of hearing the jingling sound
 of a light wagon drawn by one horse coming on, and as it neared
 they could just see that it was driven by a man in a large cloak and
 a cocked hat.      They ran forward to meet him, and could hardly
  tell their sorrow.    " Would he please to help them ! Would

128                          THE PLAYMATE.
he please to take up poor Wendel, for they feared that he would
die!"                                                .
    Without at all understanding what they           wanted, the man
descended from his wagon, and then seemed         all at once to under
stand and to take into his heart all their great sorrow.     He stooped
down over Wendel, stroked his cheek, and called him "amies
wormchen," which, though literally, is "poor little worm," means,
" poor little dear creature,"
                              spoken in the very tenderest manner.
     It would have done any body good to have seen the man take
off his cloak, and with some hay that he had in the wagon make a
bed for Wendel, whom he then lifted up lovingly in his arms, as if
he had been his own child, and lay him in it.      The boys said that
they   wanted to go to the Golden Lion at Diirkheim.       It was eleven
miles off, the man said, and they must never think of that; he
would take them, therefore, to his own house, which was only a
mile off. Wendel groaned as the wagon began to rattle off again,
and then the man, sighing forth his " armes wormchen," went on
at a foot's pace, the two boys sitting beside Wendel, and crying for
pity and fear.
     The boys hardly noticed what sort of a place the man drove
them to, for they were not in a humour to think of any thing but
their brother. However, when they got inside, they found them
selves in a large stube, or parlour, where a lame, delicate-looking

                         THE PLAYMATE.                           129
woman,    with a very friendly countenance, came forward to meet
them from her spinning-wheel.       She called the man Oheim, or
uncle, and when she saw that he was carrying in a suffering child,
she rushed to an inner room without bidding, and brought out
several pillows and laid them on a wooden sofa to make a bed.
Wendel uttered a loud cry as they laid him down, and again fainted.
The man then raised him, and laying him across his own large
knees, rested his head upon his breast, and the boys both saw with
what kind pity he looked down upon him.       Had he been his own
child he could not have been more tender with him; the woman
mixed brandy and water, which the man gave him with a teaspoon,
calling him the while affectionate names, and saying he would soon
be better.
    When Wendel was a little revived, the man ordered his niece
to make his own bed ready, and there he would carry him.         His
bed was the one in the next room, so he was soon laid upon it ; and
the man called him his little lamb, and his jewel, and said he would
send for the doctor, and he would soon be well.
    They sent for the doctor, and fortunately met him only a mile
or two off on the road.      The boys knew the doctor ; they had
often seen him at the Golden Lion; nay, at one time he had
attended their own family, and might always have done so had he
not offended their father by saying that Farmer Hardtmau was
not a bad man, and that he wished the quarrel might be made up.
He seemed very much astonished to see them there, but he did not
say why.
    Poor little Wendel's leg was broken, and that was the thing
of first importance now. So he and the goodman of the house
set about   attending to it, and the woman waited on them    ; and
everybody spoke so pityingly and so lovingly to little Wendel that
he did all he could to bear the horrible pain without crying much.
    When the leg was set and he had taken     a  composing draught
which the doctor mixed, and which the goodman of the house had
given him to drink, the woman said she would sit up all night
with him and then the two boys began to think that they ought
           ;
to set out to the Golden Lion, with the bad news to Oheim Herz.
While they were considering with themselves what they had best
do, they heard the doctor and the master of the house talking
together.
    " Yes," said the doctor, " as sure as you are living man that
                                                  a
is Saddler Miiller's youngest lad."

     " Gott bewahr  !
                      " exclaimed the man    ;  which means,   " Heaven
forbid."
     The doctor then abruptly turned to the boys and said that he
 had another patient to visit some miles further on, but that he
would come and see Wendel early in the morning, and then take
 the two in his one-horse chaise to their uncle at the Golden Lion.
     The boys were in the strangest perplexity.      The idea had come
upon their minds that they were in the house of the wicked Farmer
 Hardtman, and that this was he. There was J. H. on the stove ; and
there was J. H. on the carved back of the great walnut chair; and
his name was Johannes Hardtman, that they knew. And now a
black cloud seemed to have settled upon his face ; he had never
spoken one single word since his exclamation at the doctor's words.
He sat before them and ate his supper gloomily, as if in brooding
wrath.    What would be the end of it ? They did not dare to
speak  to each other, but their thoughts were very much the same.
 Suppose he should turn savage on poor little Wendel ? Suppose a
thousand dreadful things ! They looked at him, and a shade had
evidently settled on his countenance ; it was not the open, compas
sionate countenance that it had been.          Oh, that some one were
but near to tell them what they ought to do ! Those were their
thoughts as they sat side by side on the wooden sofa, with their
hands on their knees, as quiet and old-fashioned as could be.        So
they sat thinking and full of trouble, until they both fell fast
asleep ; and when they awoke they found themselves in a bed
chamber, laid on a bed, though not undressed.          All at once the
strange and sad events of yesterday came to their mind.            Poor
Wendel's leg was broken, and they were at Farmer Hardtman's;
and Farmer Hardtman it was who had carried and soothed poor
little Wendel, and on whose bed he was laid. They found a Bible
in the room, and in it was written "Johannes Hardtman, given to
him by his dear mother."       Surely, after all he could not be such a
very bad man !
     Wendel was feverish, and had passed a very restless night ; and
the woman said that her uncle had never been in bed, nor had had
a wink of sleep ; he had been with Wendel most of the night.
The two boys sat down and cried ; they were again overcome with
anxiety and distress.    The doctor came, and he looked very grave.
Wendel, he said, was very ill ; the house must be kept very quiet,
and he must be well nursed. Just then Farmer Hardtman came
in, and hearing the last words, he walked up and down, saying,

                              THE PLAYMATE.                           131
" Ja   ! ja ! ja ! ja !
                        " which means " yes, yes," in a very gruff voice.
The doctor said he had sent the news to the Golden Lion, but that
he should stop an hour or two to see how Wendel went on.             That
being the case, Farmer Hardtman said the boys must get ready to go
with him ; he said that they must not go into Wendel's room lest they
should disturb him ; and he seemed so short and stern with them
that they dared not disobey him.       They mounted therefore into his
green wagon as he bade them, and without a word away they drove.
     Before going to the Golden Lion, however, he drove up to
Jurist Gemahlin's and sent for him to the door : the boys now
heard him say, that he would have an end put to the lawsuit ; that
he did not care about it now ; he was willing to lose all the costs,
and the sooner* it was ended the better.          Jurist Gemahlin must
have thought that the farmer was gone stark mad, he looked so
astonished ; but Farmer Hardtman did not care for that either, so
repeating what he had said, and asking the lawyer if he understood,
he drove off, looking as if all the cloud was at once gone from his
countenance and nothing but sunshine remained.           The boys wished
so very much that they might have thanked him, for they under
stood every word ; and so they might have done, for the farmer
would have taken it very well, only they did not know it.           How
ever, all this was pleasant enough : the vexatious lawsuit was at an
end, the summer-house might stand, their father could enjoy his
vineyard, and Farmer Hardtman, after all, was a good man. There
wanted nothing now but that dear little Wendel were quite well.
      Both bad and good news soon reached the saddlers, and in a
very few days Mrs. Sattlerin Miiller was sitting on one side of little
Wendel's bed, and Farmer Hardtman was standing on the other,
with a little seven-sleeper in his cocked-hat, which he had given a
boy half-a-florin to catch in the wood.         The first time that little
Wendel went out was in Farmer Hardtman's green wagon ; the
farmer drove them, and his mother went with them.              They went
to eat sour milk, strawberries, and to drink coffee in the summer-
house at the vineyard; and Saddler Miiller and the two boys were
there, and Oheim Herz and his wife from the Golden Lion, and it
was the happiest little party that ever met on a summer's day.
      There was now an end of all disunion.       In after years, whether
little Wendel belonged to Farmer Hardtman or to his own family it
was difficult to say ; both claimed him, and the claim was a bond of
love between them.        His mother had said truly ; Wendel was born to
be fortunate     —  he was born to be a spirit of love and reconciliation.

            THE NATURAL HISTORY OP BIRDS.
                             By Mrs. S. Lee.
                           No. II.-EAGLES.
     No birds have been more celebrated or talked of than eagles,
which are esteemed the noblest of all the feathered race. This can
scarcely be accounted for, unless it be for their majestic manner of
flying, their grand beauty, and their strength.       Not only have

                             THE PLAYMATE.                            135
 they been sung of by poets, but they have been made the symbols
 of daring and courage in various ways. The Komans carried
 eagles on their standards ; they have always been one of the signs
 of imperial power, and are found in many ancient coats of arms,
which were granted to the bearers for some valorous exploits.
      Eagles are among those birds of prey which feed by day, and
besides the usual term of Diurnse, given to them in consequence,
they are, in spite of their kingly character, called ignoble, because
they are never, like some other birds of prey, used for hunting.
Their beaks are straight in the upper part, very strong, and only
curved at the point, which is very sharp ; their strong legs are
more or less covered with feathers, their talons are very powerful,
and are often called pounces.      Like the vulture, their eyes look
sideways, and are remarkable for their brilliancy.       They (and, in
fact, all other birds) have a third eyelid, which they can, when
they please, draw over their eyes from the innermost corner ; and
 it is probably this protecting skin which enables them to bear a
great quantity of light without being dazzled : and because people
have delighted in giving extraordinary powers to the eagle, they
have converted this into the fable that it always flies in the face of
the sun, and can look at that luminous body without blinking.
      The colours of these birds vary in the different shades of brown,
black, and white, and sometimes all three tints are to be found in
the same bird.     They build their nests on high rocks and moun
tains, and in these eyries, as they are called, missing articles (stolen
from man) have been occasionally found by the daring adventurer
who has climbed up to them.
      The Imperial Eagle has the longest wings, and many exaggerated
stories are told of its strength and power.     The largest of all is the
great Harpy    of South  America,  which  is said to be so strong that
it will split a man's skull with one stroke of its beak. It feeds
principally upon storks, but has been often seen to carry away
fawns and young lamas.        Generally speaking, however, the eagles
of warm climates are smaller than those which inhabit the north ;
those known in Africa are not much bigger than crows, and are
black and white ; and a very diminutive one lives in the East Indies,
which is consecrated by the Brahmins to their god Vishnu.            The
Fishing Eagles, so called because they prey upon fish, abound in
the north, and are of considerable size ; but all kinds will pursue
small birds and young animals : they do not, however, like the
vulture, prefer dead flesh.

 136                            THE PLAYMATE.
      In mythology,     the eagle is termed the bird of Jupiter, and is
 said  to have fed this heathen god with nectar when he was young.
 For this reason it was always a favoured attendant upon him, was
employed in carrying his messages and conveying his lightning,
and it is often represented as grasping the lightning in its talons.
An eagle is said to have borne the beautiful shepherd Ganymede
up to heaven, when Jupiter wanted to make him his cup-bearer ;
and Hebe, the goddess of health and youth, always had one near
to her. Both of these favourites of Jupiter were ordered by him
to feed his eagles, and this story has occasioned those beautiful
engravings which we often see on the stones set in rings and seals
which have been preserved from those days.                   Ancient sculpture
also repeats the same story.
      A friend of ours, who had very large gates to his stable-yard,
was constantly, liable to the entrance and petty thefts of the children
of the village where he lived, and many an idle little rogue did he
rind on his premises, who had obtained access by slipping unper-
ceived through this entrance.           He had dogs, but the children soon
made friends with them, and passed them unmolested.                    At last
this gentleman purchased a pair of the Golden, or common Eagles,
and chained one on each side of the gate.             At first no one liked to
pass   them,  but  as  the fierce   guardians   became     accustomed to those
employed in the yard, they were secured from their attacks.
Strangers, however, never could bribe or coax them into peace, or
perhaps they were thought the more dangerous from their appear
ance than they were in reality ; at all events, intruders were kept
at a distance.     One of the eagles broke his chain and flew away,
but was soon caught again in a high tree, in which the remaining
portion of the chain attached to its leg had become entangled.
     We will conclude this account with Thomson's beautiful descrip
tion of the kingly bird : —
                " High from the summit of a craggy cliff,
                  Hung o'er the deep, such as amazing frowns
                  On utmost Kilda's shore, whose lonely race
                  Resign the setting sun to Indian worlds,
                  The royal eagle draws his vig'rous young,
                  Strong pounced and ardent with paternal fire ;
                  Now fit to raise a kingdom of their own,
                  He drives them from his fort, the tow'ring seat
                  For ages of his empire, which in peace
                  Unstain'd he holds ; while many a league to sea
                  He wings his course, and preys in distant isles."

turf.       No old men resting beneath the memorial-tree, sunning
themselves, and talking with feeble voices, like the aged men of
Troy, compared by Homer to grashoppers; neither is there the
sound of the spinning-wheel beside the open cottage-door, with its
rustic porch and clustering hops.               All are away to the harvest-
field.      Let us go there too. We are bidden guests at Farmer
Drayton's, and our holiday will pass merrily among the reapers.
      " Good morning ! Goody. Where are you going with your

                                                       " To the harvest-
field, young masters.      'Tis a pleasant time, that comes but once in
the year, and we make the most of it.         My master was out before
the sun, reaping in the field beside the river ; but I had to dress
the children and get his dinner, and that makes me late."        " Good
day, then ; we will not hinder you."          Away she goes half run
ning, the children out of breath with delight.         They have turned
into Johnson's field. Let us follow them.          There they are with
twenty   or  thirty others, gathering the scattered ears, as Ruth ga
thered them on the plains of Bethlehem. Look at Goody ! How
diligently she is picking up the ears ! 'The children, too, are all
helping.     Before the season is over, they will collect at least three
clear bushels of wheat ; and if the weather prove showery, and the
waggon is hurried to the barn, they will obtain a larger quantity.
     Farmer Johnson is at the furthest end, watching his reapers.
He looks well pleased, and with reason, for the rustling corn stands
thick and the men work cheerfully. The Lord of the Field (for
such the chief reaper is called), heads the long line of farming-
servants.     When he clasps the opposite ears in his strong arms,
they clasp theirs also ; when he thrusts in his sickle, they do the
same ; and there is presently laid low a wide extent of grain, with
its garniture of flowers, — the corn-cockle, and scarlet-poppy, sweet
basil, and marjoram, herbs Robert and Christopher, Cicily and
William —names by which the old simplers commemorated worth or
friendship, or the villagers of other days associated with the me
mory of benefactors, whose skill and kindness might be shadowed
forth in the qualities of their favourite plants. It seems as if those
who bind up the sheaves have some pleasant or grateful thoughts
connected with the prostrate flowers, for a few are carefully taken
from among the rest and put aside.
                                                             I
     Before the young wheat springs up, we shall hear, fancy, the
church-bells ringing merrily, for there are John Grey and Susan
Bell hard at work. He has just pulled the prickly stems of the
 woolly thistle from the corn she is about to bind. Farmer Johnson
often tells the men and women to mind their work ; but he takes
no notice of John and Sally, though many a kindly word passes
between them, for he knows that more industrious and well-con
 ducted young people are nowhere to be found.
     Hark to that loud holla ! What is it ? The last shout of
 summer from Drayton's farm, on the hill side.             The men are
shouting    at the  top of their voices.

140                         THE PLAYMATE.
     " We   have done, and well done ; and pleased our master too !"
     This is customary in the West of England, when the loaded
waggon passes for the last time through the gate, and the field is
left to the gleaners.   Had we been earlier, we might have seen the
good old man fling many a liberal handful from the sheaves, for
such is his habit, and he loves to repeat the kind admonition given
to the Jewish husbandman,      " Thou shalt not wholly reap the cor
ners of thy fields ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger."
     What a bustle must have been at the old man's house to-day !
The placing of the long tables, and decking them with flowers;
the cheerful looks of the farmer's wife, and the merry faces of the
damsels ; the baking and roasting, frizzling and frying ; the hurrying
hither and thither, the tumbling over the house-dog, and the flying
of the cat before them ; and ever and anon would be heard the
quiet, grateful words, with which the farmer expresses the gladness
of his heart, according to his custom.      There will be no riotous
 doings at his harvest-home; no anxious wives and frightened chil
 dren in the cottages, nor aching heads next day.        Well, now, let
us be gone : we shall be in good time for the mead and home-
 baked cake.
     There sit the farmer and his wife at the head of the oak
 table, like the lord and lady of the May in olden times, and right
 and left many an old neighbour and young friend; his children too,
 and all the farm-servants, with their families.      Right merry are
 they.    Harmless jests go round ; and some sly looks and questions
 as to whether the cottage near the mill-pond is taken.      Now all is
 quiet ; the men and therr wives look serious, and the young ones
 cease  giggling.    The farmer rises reverently, and, doffing his cap,
 thanks the Giver of all Good for the " blessing of an abundant har
 vest."    Then taking up the words of the harvest shout, he tells his
 men,
        "  That they have done, and well done ; and pleased their
 master too ;" and he wishes them long life, and the coming round
 of many a glad harvest-home.

                            By Mrs. R.   Lee.
    " What   a  loud cry, Edward !" said Mrs. Stanhope to her son,
as she came into the room where he was.     " What is the matter ? "
" The naughty cat has given me a terrible scratch, mamma," an
swered Edward, his face still red with pain and anger ; " see, it does
really bleed."    "Yes, I see," returned Mrs. Stanhope; "it is a
very deep and ragged wound ; but we will put a little arnica on     it,
and will soon be healed. You could not, however, have made much
   it
more noise  if  you had been clawed         lion." " It was so un
                                           by   a
grateful of Frisket," said Edward, looking very grave,
                                                            " after

from the lion to our favourite here, all cats are treacherous; and
although their dispositions may be softened         by
                                                    being tamed, we
cannot expect their nature to be wholly corrected, or, perhaps, we
should say, altered    for this cunning was given to them in their
wild state for their own defence, and to secure their prey." " Why

do you call lions cats, mamma?" asked Edward, after a pause, dur
ing which he had been making up his quarrel with his pet.
                                                            " Be
cause," replied   Mrs. Stanhope, "they,       well as tigers, leopards,
                                              as
panthers, jaguars, cougars, and lynxes, all belong to the same
group of animals, called felis in Latin, and cat in English. It is not
because they differ in size and colour that naturalists consider ani
mals as distinct from each other.     Those which have the same sort
of teeth, the same toes, the same habits, and are made within in a
similar manner, are all said to be of the same kind or tribe, and
bear one general name besides their own.       If you are not afraid to
hold your cat's mouth open, you will see that he has much the same
teeth as those in the tiger's skull in papa's study, and which your
uncle brought from India.       Go and fetch       it,
                                                   and let us compare
them. See, the front of the jaws, or the muzzle,      short and round
                                                         is               ;
the first grinders are very sharp    ; then we find one on each side
much larger than the rest — these are called the carnivorous, or flesh-
eating teeth, and the others have several round, blunt projections
on them the eye-teeth, or tusks, are also large and sharp, and well
          ;
adapted for tearing flesh. Then look at the hind feet of puss you see :
the heel  iscovered with hair, which     is proof that he, like the rest
                                              a
of his kind, never sets his heel to the ground his fore paws, his

chest and shoulders, are much stronger than his hinder parts              ;
both being well adapted for springing upon and seizing prey.        The
claws are always kept sharp and ready for use, for when they are
 not wanted they are drawn back partially under the skin, and the
points stick up from the ground and when we say as playful as
                                                              '

 Did you never hear your aunt talk of the panther she once had,
 which used to play all sorts of tricks ?" " No, mamma, do tell me
 one of them," said Edward.      " One of the drollest," resumed Mrs.
 Stanhope,
             " was, when the panther hid himself under sofa, and  a
 watched an old woman who came into the room to sweep the floor
 with a  short-handled brush. This, of course, made her stoop in her
 work, and the panther, seizing his opportunity, leaped upon her
 back, where he stood with his head on one side, wagging his tail,
 looking the very picture of fun.         was no fun, however, to the
                                         It
 old woman, who thought she was going to be devoured; she
 screamed, although she dared not stir    ; the other servants hastened
 to see what was the matter, but the instant they beheld the poor
 creature with her rough playmate on her back, they ran away, and
 not till your uncle, attracted by  the noise, came to the rescue, did

the animal attempt to come down.           The same beast seeing a boy
fast asleep on the step of a door, came very softly behind him, gave
him a blow with his fore paw, and knocked him down ; then ran
and hid himself, expecting the boy to run after and find him, and
begging play by every gesture into which he could twist himself.
But I have now a much more serious story to tell you of a jaguar,
or American panther, the heroine of which          is,
                                                   I  believe, still living.
This lady and her husband were among the earliest settlers in the
town of Meadville, and at first lived in       a  cabin, or small house,
made of logs of wood.        The luxury of glass was unknown in that
wild place among the forests, and, consequently, light and air were
admitted    by  holes which were always open.        Both husband and
 wife had been away from home for day or two, and on their return
                                           a
they found some deer's flesh, which had been hanging up inside,
 partly eaten, and the tracks of an animal, which the husband sup
posed to be those of     large dog.
                         a             This gentleman was again obliged
to leave home for    a night, but his lady remained in the house alone.
 She went to bed, and had not been long there before she heard an
 animal clamber up the outside of the hut, and jump down through
one of the openings into the adjoining room, with which her sleep
ing apartment was connected       by   adoorway without     door.
                                                             a        Peep
ing out, she saw     ahuge panther apparently seeking for prey, and
of course very hungry and fierce. She beat against the partition
between the rooms, and screamed as loudly as she could, which so
startled the panther that he jumped out.          He was, however, soon
in again, and second time she frightened him away in the same
                 a
manner, when she sprang out of bed and went to the fire-place, in
the hope of making       a  sufficient blaze to deter the panther from
entering again but the embers were too much burnt, and would
                 ;
not send forth any flame.       She thought of getting under the bed,
but the animal could get there also, and tear her to pieces before
she could make any resistance.        The only plan which then occurred
to her for perfect security was to get into     a  large sea-chest of her
husband's, which was nearly empty.            Into that she crept   ;    but
there was danger of her being smothered, so she put her hand
between the edge of the chest and the lid, so as to keep the latter
open  a   little and admit air. Fortunately this lid overhung the
sides, which saved her fingers from the panther          he soon arrived,
                                                         :
and after snuffing about for some time, evidently discovered where
she was, and prowled round and round the chest, licking and
scratching the wood close to her fingers. There she lay, scarcely

daring to breathe, and listening intently to every movement of her
enemy.    At last he jumped on the top of the chest, and his weight
crushed her fingers terribly, but she was brave enough to keep them
where they were till the panther, tired of his fruitless efforts to get
at her, and finding nothing else to eat, finally retreated.    She did
not, however, dare to come quite out of the chest until morning,
for she feared, as long as it was dark, that the beast might come
again ; so there she sat, ready to crouch down into her hiding-place
if she heard a noise, till daylight, when she dressed herself as well
as she could with her lame hand, and ran with all her speed to her
nearest neighbours, who lived about a mile distant, where her
fingers were dressed, and some of whom made immediate search for
the panther.    He was soon found close by in the thicket with his
mate,  and was  killed, but the female escaped."
               THE DISCONTENTED BITTERN.
                                A     FABLE.
      A bittern   was dissatisfied with his condition.    He did not
love to be living in  swamps, and eating all manner of reptiles.    He
wanted to live in the orchard like the robin, and be a favourite with
               " Bitterns can sing as well as robins," said he ; " and
every body.
I  have no notion of being confined to a marsh, and catching fever
and ague all my days." So he started for the orchard, partly flying
and partly running at full speed, and determined to build him a
house like the robin, on an apple-tree.      He was engaged in this
business the next day, when some one from the cottage near by
saw him, and shot him, so that his wing was broken.           Then he
was glad to hobble back to his old home in the swamp, and go to
eating frogs and worms again.

    Sometimes, when we complain of our condition in life, Pro
vidence allows us to change     it,
                                 but shews us that we were perhaps
quite as well off before. — Theodore Thinker.

    The two    boys in this picture are not very much alike.                One is
a quarrelsome fellow, always ready to play the tyrant, and he does
so all the more over those boys who are afraid of him.                   When a
boy is not afraid of him, but stands sturdy, then he is much

I love to greet their smiles, mother,                They look as if they were, mother,
   That fall soft from the skies      ;                Bright golden bells that ring,
They seem to gaze on me in love                      And make accordant music-tones
   With their sweet angel-eyes.                        Whene'er the angels sing.
Itseems to me, sometimes, mother,                    Oh    I

  Of radiant pearl and gold,                            Of love and truth are known,

                        THE HUNTER AND HIS BOW.
        A sportsman had           once an excellent bow of ebony, with which
  he could shoot very far and with a sure aim, and which, therefore,
  hegreatly esteemed.            But one day, when he happened to look at it
  attentively, he said,
                               " My good bow, you certainly shoot very well,
  and you look, too, very nice and smooth ;              I think, however, a little
  ornament would greatly improve you.                I               I
                                                       will see if cannot remedy
  this defect."         To this end he consulted the best worker in ebony
  he could hear of, and agreed with him that he should carve a picture
  of a complete chase upon his bow ; and what could be more appro
  priate for a huntsman's bow than such a picture ? The man was
  delighted.
                     " Thou hast well deserved this ornament, my dear
  bow," said he : " now let me try you." He stretched — and the
  bow broke        !

148                            THE PLAYMATE.
                             THE QUEEN-BEE.
          Translated by John Edward Taylor, from the German of Orimm.
     Two king's sons     once went out into the world to seek adventures ;
but they    soon  fell into  a wild and riotous life, and never came home
again.    After a time the youngest son, who was called Dummling,
went out to look for his brothers ; but when he found them, they only
laughed at him for thinking that such a simpleton as he could fight
his way in the world, whilst they who were so much cleverer could
not get on.      However they all travelled on together, and at length
came to an ant-hill.        The two eldest brothers wanted to dig it up,
to see how the little ants would run about in their fright, and carry
off their eggs.     But Dummling said, " Let the little creatures alone ;
I  will not have you disturb them." Then they went further, and
came to a lake, upon which there were many, many ducks swim
ming about.       The two brothers wished to catch a couple and roast
them ; but Dummling again said, " Leave the poor things in peace ;
I  will not let you kill them." At length they came to a bee's nest,
in which there was so much honey that it ran down the side of the
tree.    The two brothers would have set fire to the tree, and killed
the bees, so that they might take away the honey ; but Dumm
ling again stopped them and said, " Leave the poor bees in peace ;
I  will not have you burn them."
     Then the three brothers came to a castle, and in the stables
they saw many horses ; but all were of stone.            No one was to be
seen, and they went on and on through all the rooms, untd they
came to a door at the furthest end, upon which hung three locks.
In the middle of the door was a little wicket, through which they
could peep into the chamber.             There they saw a little grey man
sitting  at  a table;   and  they  called  to him again and again; but he
did not hear.      At last they called a third time ; then he got up
from his seat and came out.           He did not speak a word, but took
them by the hand, and led them to a table covered with all sorts of
good things.       And when they had eaten and drunk their fill, he
took each one to his own sleeping-room.
     The next morning the little man came to the eldest brother,
beckoned to him, and led him to a stone-table, whereon were written
three tasks, by which the castle might be disenchanted.             The first
was as follows,     "  In the wood beneath the moss he hid the pearls
of the king's daughter, a thousand in number: these must be

                             THE PLAYMATE.                       149
 sought ; and if at sunset a single one is missing, he who searched
shall be turned to stone." The eldest of the brothers sallied forth,
and looked about all day long for the pearls ; but when evening
came he had not found more than an hundred ; so it came to pass
as was written on the table, and he was turned into stone.    On the
following day, the second brother undertook the task ; but he had
not much better luck than the eldest, for he found only two hundred
pearls, and so he was changed to stone.     At last came Dummhng's
turn. He searched and searched about in the moss, but, alas ! the
pearls were hard to find, and the work went slowly on.      Then he
sat down upon a stone and began to cry. And whilst he was sitting
thus, up came the ant-king, whose life he had saved, with a troop
of five thousand ants, and in a very short time the little creatures
had found all the pearls and dragged them together into a heap.
     Now the second task was, to fetch the key of the princess's
chamber from the bottom of a lake.        When Dummling came to
the lake, the ducks, which he had before saved, came swimming up
to him, dived to the bottom, and fetched up the key. The third
task, however, was the hardest one — to find out the youngest and
best of the three sleeping daughters of the king. But they were
all exactly alike and in no way differed from one another, except
that, before falling asleep, they had eaten of different sweets — the
eldest one a piece of sugar, the second a little treacle, and the
youngest a spoonful of honey.      Then came the queen-bee, which
Dummling had saved from the fire, and tasted the lips of all the
three ; at last she settled upon the lips of the one who had eaten
the honey, and thus the king's son knew the right princess.     Then
the spell was broken ; all were awakened out of sleep, and those
who had been changed to stone now returned to their proper form.
Dummling married the youngest and best daughter, and became
king after her father's death : but his two brothers married the two
other sisters.

150                         THE PLAYMATE.
            THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BIRDS.
                              By Mrs. B. Lee.
                     No.  HI.— FALCONS, HAWKS.
     Those diurnal birds of prey which can be trained for hunting
are termed Nobiles, or Noble ; and among them are almost all those
which form the falcon or hawk tribe. They equal eagles in courage ;
and although they are inferior in size and strength, they are supe-
perior in docility, gentleness, and entire obedience to the commands
of those who train them for use or amusement.
     The beak of falcons is very strong, and much more curved than
that of any other bird of prey ; it is also shorter, and has a projec
tion from each edge of the upper part, like a sharply pointed tooth.
The wings are long, and end in a point on one side; which shape
obliges these birds to fly in a slanting direction when the weather
is calm, and if they wish to rise in a straight line, they are forced
to fly against the wind.     They do not seek dead prey, and pursue
their game at full speed, falling down upon it perpendicularly with
great swiftness. Old birds differ much from the young in plumage,
and the colours are brown, white, black, grey, and occasionally a
reddish tint ; the female is generally one-third larger than the male ;
the eye-brows of both project very much, which gives them a very

peculiar appearance, and their eyes are remarkably brilliant.          The
size varies from that of a large cock to a pigeon ; the legs are blue
or yellow, and there is great variety of shape in the spots and bands
formed by the feathers.
      In consequence of falconry, or hawking, having been in former
times a sport among all classes in northern nations, many curious
laws were made about the practice of          it,
                                               as at this day we find for
shooting, fishing, or hunting with dogs and   ;       great deal of money
                                                         a
was spent in keeping and training these birds.            In those days        it
was only thought necessary for        nobleman to understand hawking,
                                      a
hunting, and exercises of arms    ;   and he might,      he pleased, leave
                                                             if
study and learning to those who were of            rank beneath his own,
                                                    a
without being remarkable for his ignorance. There are many old
portraits of noblemen and gentlemen, and even ladies (for they
used to join in the sport on horseback), with falcons on their wrists
and King Harold was represented with             bird on his hand and
                                                  a                             a ;
 dog under his arm.         The chief falconer was the fourth officer in
 rank at court, at the time when Wales had kings of its own but           ;
 he was only allowed to take three draughts a-day out of his drink
 ing-horn, for fear he should get tipsy and neglect his birds.
       The expenses of falconry being so enormous, those who infringed
 the laws respecting  it    were often severely punished.     From very   a
 old book we learn, that to steal         hawk, or even its eggs when
                                          a

                                                                  a
 imprisonment, and to pay     a    sum of money.         was the same in
                                                             It
  the time of Queen Elizabeth, with the additions that the offender
  was obliged to find some one who would answer for his good beha
  viour for seven years and
                       ;         if he could not procure any one to do
  so, he was forced to remain in prison for that period.
     A    thousand pounds are said to have been given for            set of
                                                                      a
  hawks, although the birds were procured in England, Wales, Scot
  land, and Ireland; these large sums, therefore, must have been
  paid for the trouble of training them.          Occasionally they were
  brought from Norway, and were then so much thought of, that
  they were esteemed presents fit for        sovereign.
                                              a            King John had
  two given to him as bribe for allowing
                       a                        man to trade in cheese.
                                                  a
       Among    the  different kinds  used  in the   sport, the Peregrine
  falcon was reckoned one of the best, and        now the only one which
                                                    is
is    kept for the purpose in England, and that very rarely.        Henry
   II. said to have sent for some of them every year into Pembroke
     is
   shire. It   however livesin   most of the northern parts of the earth,

152                                 THE PLAYMATE.
and its flight is so rapid, that there are few countries which it does
not visit.
     The Gyr falcon is one of the largest of the tribe ; its legs and
beak are yellow, and it was formerly trained to catch cranes, herons,
and wild geese.      The Goshawk was also flown at the same prey,
but more especially at pheasants and partridges. Among the
smaller trained species was the Kestril, which nests in the holes of
ruins, high towers, or clefts of rocks ; its chief food is field-mice,
and it is that hawk which we see remaining a long time in the air
in one spot, fanning its wings and watching for its prey. The
Hobby, also a small species, was taught to catch larks, and was
thrown from the hand near their haunts, when the poor little crea
tures would crowd together and remain motionless from fear; a
net was then thrown over them, and all were secured.
     The Kite, the Sparrowhawk, the Hen-harrier, the Merlin,
and the Buzzard, do not appear to have been used for sporting.
The first builds its nest in large forests, and has a forked tail.     It
may be known in the air from all other birds by its smooth flight,
for its wings scarcely seem to move, and it appears frequently to
remain motionless for a time.       There is an old saying, that when
kites     fly
           high     will be fair weather; and the famous Pliny, who
                          it
lived in the last times of the ancient Romans, and wrote          agreat
deal about birds, says that the invention of the rudder for steering
boats and ships was taken from the motion of       kite's tail.
                                                    a
     The Sparrowhawk          great enemy to pigeons and partridges
                               is   a                                  ;
and  it and the Hen-harrier are very destructive to poultry.      When
we hear    ahen cackle, and see her cower down upon the ground,
and anxiously cover all her chickens with her wings, we may be
sure that one of these destroyers        in the neighbourhood.
                                             is                     The
Merlin, although small,           very courageous bird, flies low, and
                                    is   a
skims along the tops of the hedges in search of its prey      ;   itkills
partridges           by
                one stroke upon the neck.
     The Buzzards are much less active than other hawks, eat frogs,
lizards, mice, rabbits, birds, worms, and insects   ;and one of them,
which frequents moors and marshy places, never soars into the air.
It   is
     a   very voracious bird, and kills many young ducks      ; its legs
are longer and more slender than those of hawks in general, by
which it     better enabled to find its way through wet places.

 The  one a fine and pretty boy,                 The parents being dead and gone,

   And made in beauty's mould.                     Where much of them he makes.
 The father left his little son,                 He had not kept these pretty babes
   As plainly doth appear,                         A twelvemonth and a day,
 When he to perfect age should come,            But, for their wealth, he did devise
    Three hundred pounds a-year.                   To make them both away.
 And to his little daughter Jane,                He bargain'dwith two ruffians strong,
   Five hundred pounds in gold,                    Which were of furious mood,
 To be paid down on marriage-day,               That they should take the children

      From   the German  of A. L.  Grimm. Translated  by Madame   de Ghatelain.
     A tortoise once lived near a lake, and a very pleasant dwelling
it turned out, for it was surrounded by woods and meadows, where
she found all that was necessary to support life.                   As she lived
alone, and far from all other tortoises, she had formed an intimacy
with two wild ducks, who likewise dwelt on the shore of the lake,
and returned there every night to'sleep.            During the day they swam
about on the lake, and picked up their nourishment in its slime.

  156                        THE PLAYMATE.
      It happened one year that there was a very dry summer, during
 which there was a scarcity of rain for a considerable period ; so by
 degrees the lake that the tortoise inhabited was quite dried up, and
 each day she was obliged to put up with a smaller space, because
 the water daily diminished.     And when the lake had diminished
 down to the dimensions of a puddle, so that the frogs that inha
 bited it could skip from one shore to the other, the two ducks came
 one day to the tortoise and said, " We have bethought ourselves
 during the night what we had better do. The water and the slime
 are daily diminishing, and the lake cannot afford us any longer a
 livelihood, for the little worms are all dying gradually for want of
 moisture. We have, therefore, agreed to leave this spot to-day,
 and to go and seek elsewhere for a dwelling ; we therefore come to
 bid you farewell, and to thank you for the friendly intercourse we
 have enjoyed with you, and for your kind, neighbourly offices."
      On hearing these words the tortoise grew very sad, and she
                                                          "
 gave way to her grief in the following lamentations : — Alas ! what
 an unhappy creature am I, to be thus forsaken by Heaven !        How
much happier are you birds than our species ! When any spot
 ceases to please you, or is no longer able to nourish you, you take
your flight up into the air, and the whole world lies spread out
beneath you, and you can inspect it from on high ; and wherever
you see a place that takes your fancy, you have nothing to do but
to come down and fix your dwelling where you like. How different
and how much less pleasant a fate is ours ! We are destined to
crawl upon the earth, just like the worms, and can see nothing but
what lies quite near us ; and if wc dislike a place, or if it eease to
furnish us with the necessaries of life, we are not free to rise above
the earth, and look down to seek for one that would please us
better.    We can only proceed at a snail's gallop, and it depends
more on chance than on our own exertions whether we manage to
reach a spot that affords us the indispensable necessaries of life,
before we sink with hunger and thirst.      And then we must take up
with what we happen to find.       Alas !
                                          " continued she, " what is to
become of me ?      The lake will dry up completely, and with it my
life must fail ; for we tortoises are accustomed from our youth to
spend half our existence in water, even more than you aquatic
fowls ; for you may be said to be able to live in three elements.
You swim in the water, soar in the air, and walk upon earth ; but
as to me, Lord help me ! I can only move about in water, for on
land   I can get on but slowly.     My death is therefore certain, for

 there is no water for a long way around.          I have in my time been
 some distance about the neighbourhood, and no water was any
where to be seen : and weak and ill as I now am from the failure
of the waters and the heat of the sun,               I
                                                am little able to run about
 still further.   Iknow         I
                             should faint away before I had gone many
 steps ; and now        I
                        shall not even have the comfort of seeing my
friends about me, to solace and advise me."
      On hearing how desperate was their friend's situation, both the
ducks were moved to compassion, and they said to her, " If we
were able to help you, sure we would do so with all our hearts."
      " Oh, do take pity on me, and don't leave me here to die thus
lonely and unbefriended !" said the tortoise.
                                                       " Carry me with you
through the air.            I
                        am not so very heavy ; and as there are two of
you, it might surely be managed."
      " But how shall we accomplish it ?" asked one duck of the other.
      " Why," interrupted the tortoise quickly, " if you keep close to
gether, I   can then sit half on the back of one and half on the back
of the other.     Then if you take your flight, and mind and              fly
                                                                       quite
equally,
       I     may easily   be carried  by you   both."
      " No, no that will never do," said the ducks " for how should
              !                                               ;

how could we          fly
                      so close to each other         We should only beat

us twenty times over."
      " Then there      no hope for me
                       is                    cried the tortoise and nearly
                                                !"                ;
concealing    her entire  head in  her scaly case, she wept bitterly.
      The ducks were again moved to pity, and held council together
fora    good while, when at last they said to the tortoise — Be of
                                                                     ":
good cheer, neighbour we have hit on an expedient for carrying
                                ;
you away."
      The tortoise popped her head out of her scales again, and in
                  :
                       "
quired, joyfully — How so             How will you manage
                                      ?                           it  ? will
                                                                          I
be grateful to you as long as          Ilive."
      " We have turned the matter over," said the ducks, " and we
have found out what to do.         It not that you are too heavy, but
                                           is
the difliculty is, how to take hold of you firmly, without hurting
you. Your homy scales are too thick, and we couldn't open our
beaks wide enough to hold you firmly                 by
                                                 them. Then nothing re
mains but your head, and feet, and tail, and we could not take hold
of any of these solidly enough without hurting you. We have,
therefore, thought of the following means.           We will hold      stick
                                                                          a

158                            THE PLAYMATE.
at each end in our beaks, and you will bite firmly into the middle,
and support yourself by your teeth, and thus we can carry you with
us as we fly up into the air with the stick. It is true we shan't be
able to enjoy any friendly chat on our way, and you too must keep
very quiet, for if one of us was to let the stick go, you would of
course fall to the ground."
    The tortoise was highly delighted with this scheme, and so the
ducks flew away to look for a lake which should become their fu
ture residence ; and when they returned they brought with them a
stick, the end of which each duck grasped in her beak : they then
stooped down to the tortoise, who readily bit into the middle of the
stick ; and the ducks having taken a still firmer hold, up they flew,
and directed their course to the well-supplied inland lake that they
had chosen for their dwelling.
    They had not gone far before they met a troop of magpies and
other frivolous scoffers. When they saw how strangely the tortoise
was carried through the air by her friends the two ducks, they
burst into loud laughter, and flew all round them, and made game
of her in all sorts of ways.
    " So, mistress tortoise," said they, " how nimbly we fly through
the air, forsooth ! and that, too, without wings ! And, prithee, why
have you left your wings behind ?
                                          "
    " But," observed another, " why do her eyes seem starting out
of her head?"
    " She need not close her teeth till one row laps over the other,"
said a third ; " for though we fly too, yet we open and shut our
beaks fast enough."
    " Oh," cried they in a body, " shouldn't care to fly if must
                                           I                   I
be dumb, and not enjoy any thing !"
    These remarks chafed the tortoise exceedingly, still she remained
silent. But the mischievous birds could see by her sparkling eyes
that she was in a passion ; and highly delighted at their success,
they kept calling out : —
                    " Birdie, birdie, light and gay,
                      Drop no feathers by the way ;
                      Taper are your legs and sleek,
                      And so elegant your beak !—
                      Sure your singing must be choice :
                      Come, let's hear your witching voice."
    The tortoise] could scarcely contain herself any longer, on hear
ing the magpies singing epigrams upon her, and her eyes flashed
with rage.

    But her tormentors only continued their gibes with fresh perti
nacity, and sang : —
        " A tortoise there flies,                  Horny back, thou
         Who mounts to the skies.                  Art angry, trow !I
         Four legs, say,                           Wings hast none,
         Whither away ?                            Yet  canst fly.
         Scaly fowl,                               Speech too is gone, —
         Why   dost scowl   ?                      Prithee, say why         ?#"
    The tortoise could not stand this in silence, and forgetting in
her anger that her whole safety depended on holding fast with her
teeth, she exclaimed in      tone of exasperation — "      am dumb in
                                fly a
                            without wings in order to provoke you "
                                                                :       I
order to vex you   !   I                                                          !
    But on saying these words she lost hold of the stick, and down
she fell, and before the words were completely out of her mouth
she had already reached the earth below.      Unluckily she lit upon                  a
rock;   and her fall was so hard, that     broke her scales and caused
                                              it
her death.
    The two ducks rose higher        the air on losing the weight that
                                         in
clogged their flight   ;and when they heard the tortoise speak, and
saw her fall and die on the rock, they mourned their excellent friend,
and let fall the stick on which they had uplifted her and flew away
to the lake, where they took up their abode, and often wished the
tortoise were alive again, and with them      and then they would say
                "

                     No. III.— THE GIUSTINIANI.
    In the fifth century after the Christian era, when Italy was
exposed to the continued invasion of the northern barbarians, a
band of fugitives, closely pursued by Attila, the fierce king of the
Huns, took refuge in the small swampy islands lying in the north
         21.                                              Y

 western corner    of the Adriatic sea. They found in this shelter the
  security which   they needed.    Whilst they rejoiced in the asylum
  afforded by their isolated position, they little dreamt that they
 were laying the foundation of one of the most wonderful and power
 ful states that have arisen in modern times.
      As succeeding swarms from the " Northern hive" descended into
 Italy, they drove the affrighted inhabitants before them, who fled
 in crowds to the islands. They quickly formed themselves into a
 state, established a system of government, and elected a chief for
life under the title of Doge.        Gradually they erected houses and
 churches on the numerous little islands, and connected with bridges
those which lay nearest to each other.         A palace was erected for
the doge, and the city of Venice claimed a place amongst the na
tions of Europe.
      In the time of the Crusades, we find the Venetian amongst the
wealthiest and most important of the Italian republics; already the
Eastern ports were filled with her merchant vessels, and the pirates
of Istria and the Greek coast, who infested the Adriatic and Levant,
had learned to tremble at her name.           Treaties and negociations
had been successfully entered into by several doges with the Greek
emperor and the sultans of Constantinople and Egypt.             As the
passage to   India  by  the  Cape of Good Hope was then unknown, all
the Eastern luxuries, so much sought after by the sovereigns of the
West, were to be transported to Venice, which thus became the
great emporium of trade — the connecting link between the East
and the West.       When Christendom began to arm itself to drive
out the Turks from the Holy City of Jerusalem, the scene of the
life and death of our Saviour, Venice assumed a still higher posi
tion.    She fitted out fleets manned by her bravest sons, and con
ducted by the doge himself.        By her deeds of valour she gained,
not the laurels alone, but the more substantial benefits of victory.
We read, that after the capture of Acre, one quarter of the city was
apportioned as her share of the booty, besides securing many most
valuable commercial privileges and immunities.          In a.d. 1122, a
fleet of two hundred vessels sailed from her port, under the com
mand of Domenico Michieli, the doge, by whose skill and bravery
many Syrian cities were taken, and wealth and fame flowed in a full
tide into the rising republic.       These brilliant conquests, and the
consequent    increase  of power; created for Venice many enemies; and
amongst them, the Greek emperor regarded her with a jealous eye.
Faithless as he was impolitic, Manuel Commenus seized upon the

Venetians resident at the ports of Greece, and threw them into
prison.    Some few fortunately escaped, and bore the news to Venice.
The Venetians, unused to such indignities, were incensed at the
insulting conduct of the emperor.     In a short time the streets were
thronged with people, crying aloud for vengeance, and demanding
to be led against their foe. The nobles and governors, no less
eager to redeem their honour, arranged for an instant attack upon
their treacherous enemy.    Orders were issued for the equipment of
a large armament, and although the coffers had been drained by
recent wars, money was readily advanced by the nobles.         Were we
not acquainted with the internal arrangements of the Venetian
arsenal, we might listen incredulously to the fact, that in three
months one hundred and fifty galleys were ready for action ; but
Venice, recognising in her navy the most important element of her
national safety, watched over it with the most jealous care. The
arsenal was so capacious that it resembled a town : it was sur
rounded by solid walls and fortified by strong towers, so that it
was capable of resisting the attacks of an enemy.          Hundreds of
workmen were constantly employed in building ships, and manu
facturing every article necessary for their equipment — stores of
arms and ammunition for a considerable army were always ready.
Huge dismantled vessels filled the docks, which were surrounded by
store-rooms of masts, cordage, anchors, and arms.         Thus, the Ve
netians could never be found unprepared, and much of their naval
glory and commercial prosperity is attributable to this forethought.
The moment the expedition against the Greek emperor was decided
on, the arsenal became the scene of incessant bustle and activity ;
day and night all hands were in requisition, for idleness in the
service of the republic was deemed a crime.      Every one capable of
bearing arms sought admission into the ranks, and those who were
compelled by age and infirmity to remain at home, bewailed their
sad fate which left them useless to then.' country at such a crisis.
Foremost in the expedition there was one family remarkable for its
enthusiasm in the cause, the antiquity of its descent, and its sad
fate.   The family of the Giustiniani had frequently filled the highest
offices of the state, and in worth and honour were unsurpassed by
any of the Venetian aristocracy.     Stung to the quick by the insult
offered to their country, they swore to avenge it or die.        Not a
single member of this noble house could be prevailed on to remain
behind ; young and old, all insisted on their right to fight for their
country.    Thus was the armament freighted with the whole illus
trious race of the Giustiniani.   Rarely had such a noble fleet sailed

from Venice; and whilst Manuel believed his enemies quailing
before his imperial anger, they were already rapidly approaching his
kingdom, thirsting for vengeance.        The emperor, alarmed at this
formidable fleet, pretended the deepest regret that such an insult
should haye been inadvertently given to his dear friends and allies,
entreated them to grant him time to explain the affair, and promised
to give them the most entire satisfaction.     Had Manuel risked the
chance of a battle, he would, most probably, have been entirely de
feated ; for the Venetians were not only indignant at the insulting
conduct of the emperor, but were possessed of great courage and much
maritime skill. • The wily emperor hoped, by deferring the attack,
to gain time to rally his own forces, and allow the Venetian ardour
to cool in the meantime.        Deluded by his excuses and promises,
they agreed to withdraw to Scio, and there abide the issue of the
negociations.     It was a fatal step for them ; during the winter the
plague broke out, the Venetians were attacked by the disease, and
perished by hundreds : of all the brilliant array which a few months
before had quitted Venice, elated by the prospects of speedy triumph,
but few remained when spring returned, and this miserable rem
nant so feeble and dispirited, that all thought of pursuing the ex
pedition was utterly abandoned.        To conduct the remains of his
panic-stricken army back to Venice was the doge's only aim ; but
on mustering his followers, the number was found to be so small,
that it was impossible to man all the galleys ; many were, there
fore, burned, and the rest steered for the Adriatic.    A deep gloom
had settled on the survivors ; they had scarcely power left to work
the vessels, as with heavy hearts they entered Venice. Their arrival
spread dismay through her streets. Could the few shattered galleys,
now slowly moving through the waters, be indeed all that remained
of that proud armament which had so lately sailed forth triumph
antly ? — where were the brave hearts that then beat high with hope ?
Alas ! few returned to tell of all they had endured.      Not a family
but mourned the loss of some member, and wailing and sounds of
sorrow re-echoed through the streets.        In the Giustiniani palace
there were proud matrons watching with anxious hearts the approach
of that mournful fleet. Where was that self-devoted band of bro
thers, who had bound themselves to redeem their own and their
country's honour ? All, all had perished — not one returned to tell
the mournful tale ! They had died, not in the field of battle, freely
and joyfully giving their life's blood for Venice, but miserably
 smitten down by the hot breath of pestilence, their proud hearts
 crushed beneath the languor of illness, far from their homes, and

had united in the act of patriotic sacrifice, and all had perished.
It was not, however, so decreed. In one of the monasteries of
Venice, buried from sight ao4 almost forgotten, resided a monk,
whose life flowed on in one
monotonous      stream, and
who scarcely cared to claim
kindred with the family
from whom be         had for
years been separated,     At
this moment,     when  anni
hilation   threatene4    the
noble stock, this solitary
branch was remembered ;
he was entreated to quit
his cloister and return to
the world;       a dispensa
tion was obtained from
the Pope, which freed him
from his monastic vows —
and, taking his station as
head of his family, he be
came the regenerator of
his race. The Giustiniani
again rose to be powerful
in the state, and the annals
of Venice record the brave
and wise exploits of se
nators and doges of that
name.
     The miseries of the un
happy expedition , against
the Greeks had not yet ended.        The infection which had destroyed
the army was conveyed to Venice by the returning vessels, and
raged in her narrow canals and streets with a fury unparalleled ; —
thousands perished daily, and the people, exasperated by the de
struction of then' fleet and army, and writhing under this new
and heavy visitation, looked about for some victim on whom to wreak
their vengeance.      Unjustly attributing their disasters to the mis
rule of the doge, they surrounded his palace, dragged him forth,
and murdered him in the public streets.

             THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BIRDS.
                             By Mrs. R.     Lee.
                            No.    IV.— OWLS.
      Owls   are nocturnal birds   of prey, and several peculiar charac
ters shew how admirably they are fitted for the place which they
take in creation. The pupils of their eyes are enormous, and admit
so much light that they are dazzled by day, and are better able to
distinguish objects at night.       The eyes look forwards, and are
surrounded by     circles of feathers ; the beak is curved the whole
way, and the opening of the ears has, in almost every instance, a
piece of skin going half round       it,
                                       like what   is called the flap or
conch of man's ear.
         a                 The  head   islarge, the skull thick, and hol
low places in  it most probably increase the power of hearing, which
is very great, and capable of detecting the slightest sounds.        The
plumage   isloose, soft, and fine, so that these birds make little or
no  noise when   flying.   They can bring their outer toe backwards
or forwards as they please.      They very seldom feed on dead prey,
and eat small birds and mice, particularly preferring the latter, of
which they devour immense numbers. When they have young,
they will bring  a   mouse to the nest every twelve or fifteen minutes.
 They do not stop to pluck off hair or feathers from their prey, and

with the bones, these form lumps in the stomach, which they throw
out by the mouth when they please.          The ridiculous gestures of an
owl are most laughable when attacked by day, or when it sees any
thing new in a full light ; and nothing can be more melancholy
than its cry in the silence of the night : the sound heard so often
near their nests, which has been taken for snoring, is only the cry
of the young birds for food. These peculiarities, and especially the
noiseless flight, which brings an owl close to you before you can be
aware that it is even in existence, have probably caused the nume
rous superstitions respecting      it,
                                    and which we find in most countries
frequented      bythem.    Among these       isthe idea that they foretell
approaching death, and are said to look into the rooms of sick per
sons, and then converse with some one outside.              Mr. Waterton,
who  is so learned   in the  habits  of birds, and  in fact of most other
animals, and has written such interesting accounts of them, built       a
house for owls over   a  ruined gateway, close to his dwelling, and in
spite of the fears of his neighbours, and their assertions that he
would bring ruin and destruction on the whole place, has succeeded
in rearing several families of them      ; so that he watches, and has
made  a  number of interesting observations concerning them.
     The colour of owls varies from white to very dark brown, grey,
                                                  a
and buff, and most are beautifully marked with small or large spots.
The legs of the greater number are feathered to the toes, and several
species have tufts of feathers, called egrets, just over their ears on
the top of their head, which they can raise or depress at pleasure.
Among these      isthe Grand Duke, the largest of all nocturnal birds
of prey, which has very wise and majestic appearance.
                      a
     Owls inhabit most parts of the world, make their nests in ruins,
high towers, and old trunks of trees, and that called the Chat-huant
in France (in England, Screech-owl) often lays its eggs in the nests
of other birds.
     There is   aprejudice against owls, from the story that they get
into pigeon-houses and destroy the young birds but Mr. Water-
                                                      ;
ton thinks, in most of the instances which have been brought
before him, that rats have been the murderers, and not the inno
cent owl.     Certain it     however, that all little birds have
                           is,                                   a   great
enmity towards owls, and will assemble in numbers, and fiercely
attacking their foes, drive them away for no creatures fight more
                                             ;
fiercely than many small birds.
     The owl was the favourite of the heathen goddess Minerva,
and has, in consequence, been often called the bird of wisdom.

168                          THE PLAYMATE.
Notwithstanding which, it is a frequent saying that persons are as
stupid as owls.      On the ancient seals and rings, Minerva is con
stantly represented either with an owl by her side, or in a small
car drawn by two of these birds.         In several of the fables of hea
then times we find offenders punished by being turned into owls.
Among these was Ascalaphus, who was desired by Pluto to watch
Proserpine after he had run away with her and taken her to his
kingdom.       She was to be restored to her mother, provided she
had not eaten any thing in Pluto's dominions ; and when she was
anxious to conceal that she had done so, in order to get away,
Ascalaphus said that he had seen her eat some pomegranate seeds.
This made Proserpine so angry that she sprinkled some water over
him from the river Phlegethon, and turned him into an owl.
     A young lady, who lived in the country, had an owl brought to
her by the gardener, which had been lamed by some accident ; she
petted this bird, made it a sort of nest in an old apple-tree, and fed
 it every day : she did all in her power to tame      it,sat in the apple-
 tree with it,  trying to make it     understand all her kindness, but it
 continued fierce and unsociable till the last few days of its life,
when  it  appeared, after two months' trial, to know and expect her     :
but one morning when she arrived at the tree she found          it   lying
dead on the ground.     A    friend, who saw how sorry she was to lose
her pet, skinned and stuffed    it    for her but there were no birds'
                                          ;
eyes to be had in the next town, and the only substitute for them
were two black cut-glass beads belonging to the young lady's
mother.      These were inserted, and the owl was placed on    a   bracket
in the dining-room.        Some weeks after, when at dinner,    a   guest,
who was laughing at the ridiculous appearance of the owl, which
appeared to be looking all ways at once, owing to its strange eyes,
exclaimed,
              " The birdis   come to life again   !
                                                    " All looked up in
astonishment,      and beheld the feathers move.        The young lady
rushed to her favourite, mounted     a   chair, and found the owl teem
ing  with  life which  was  not   its  own, for
                                              it   was full of maggots.
The inexperienced stuffer had not sufficiently prepared the skin,
and the end of the owl was    a     watery grave
                                              ;    forit was thrown into
the river before the house, as the quickest mode of getting rid of     it
and its devourers.

the top of the crook, your initials.         They are the only letters        I
know how to write. Yesterday evening              was quite finished, and

I could scarcely sleep all night for joy. With the first song of the
larkI    rose to gather flowers to hang on the crook, and meant to
lay it  at   the door of your cot.      But      was in vain that
                                                    it                 rose

                                                          ?   A               I
found this doves' nest in the little wood on the side of the hill but   ;
the birds had built on the top of young oak too weak to bear my
                                        a
weight. So what did        I? Why, fastened one end of cord to the
                                        I                           a
leading   shoot  of the  young oak, as high as my hands could reach,
and the other end to the root of neighbouring tree.
                                        a                      Every day      I
went and shortened the cord, and every day the nest was brought
nearer and nearer to me, without the tree breaking, or the birds
discovering what  I    was about.   All this time the young doves were
growing, and my hopes growing with them.               But when the nest
was brought low enough for me to reach,            took
                                                     I        it,

to set   it at the door of your cot.     But      don't know how
                                                    I                   it    is,

     Chloe. Well, my dearest Myrtil, let us suppose our mutual
intentions to have succeeded.       Take you this crook, and give me
your turtle-doves.

         Myrtil        takes the crook, and gives                Chloe    the doves.

still more,      knew who gave it me.
              if you

as white as the lily you gave me the other day, and as sweet as
yourself".
      Myrtil. Well, my               dearest    Chloe, promise me never to part
from them.
    Chloe. With all my heart ! But you must promise me, in turn,
never to part with my crook.
    Myrtil. Listen to me, Chloe.    Here is the Temple of Love.
Within that Temple receive my promise, and give me yours.
    Chloe. No, Myrtil; my mother has forbidden me to enter                                     it,
excepting under her guidance.     cannot disobey my mother.
                                                I
    Myrtil. You are right, Chloe.       for my own part, would

rather die than disobey my father.      But without entering the
Temple,  here, where we stand, we can swear, in the hearing of the
God of Love, never to part with these dear and precious gifts.
    Chloe. Very well    agree but we must not swear

                             ;              :           we are not                ;

Priest of Love, approaching. How sadly he looks              fear he          !   I            is
about to relate to us some afflicting news.

                                THE PLAYMATE.                              173
              Enter Lysis, with a young attendant Priest.
    Lysis. My dear Myrtil, I can hardly refrain from tears at the
news   I bring you.
     Myrtil. Ah, Lysis      ! I  tremble at your words !       I trust you do
not bring me any bad tidings of my father ?            I have more fears for
him than for myself.
    Lysis. Your father woke this morning with a burning fever
upon him.       The unfortunate old man, weak with age, and bowed
down with suffering, lies at death's door.
     Myrtil. O heavens ! my father will be snatched from me.
(Weeps.)       Wretched, wretched Myrtil ! My father is ill — dying
perhaps — without my having embraced him.               Lysis ! Chloe ! pray
to all the Gods — pray to the God of Love — to restore the best of
fathers to me.      I                               I
                        cannot remain with you — must go — must run
to visit my poor father !                                               [Exit.
     Chloe. Ah, Lysis ! you, who are Love's minister — you, through
whom that puissant Deity informs us with his will, ask, obtain of
him the recovery of Menalcas — obtain of him that the most vir
tuous of our shepherds may long live to instruct his children in the
ways of virtue.
    Lysis. Is it the mere love of virtue that makes you take so
tender an interest in the father of Myrtil ?
     Chloe. No sentiment is so just, so sweet, as that of gratitude.
You know not what           I   owe to the good Menalcas.         When that
terrible hail-storm last year destroyed all our little harvest,
Menalcas replaced what we had lost, twice over.               Since that day,
my mother and         I  have   never retired  to rest   without   invoking a
blessing on the name of Menalcas. Ah, Lysis ! join your vows to
mine : supplicate the God of Love to restore us our benefactor !
     Lysis. Vows, Chloe, suffice not. The Gods will have sacrifice.
     Chloe. Alas !     I  have no offering to present.      My mother keeps
no flock : had we but one single lamb,        I  would already have run to
fetch  it.
     Lysis. Whose are these two turtle-doves        ?
     Chloe.   Mine.
     Lysis. Turtles are the birds of Love. Whenever I wish to
propitiate the Deity, it is my custom to sacrifice a pair of them on
his altar.
     Chloe. What,       Lysis !  do you imagine that      in sacrificing these
birds  I   could obtain the recovery of Menalcas ?
     Lysis. It were clearly the surest method.

174                          THE PLAYMATE.
                                                  Chloe.    O my poor
                                             turtles  !   You are con
                                             demned      to die.     Alas,
                                             alas !   I  had hoped —     I
                                             had promised — never to
                                             part from you. But for
                                             Menalcas — for the father
                                             of Myrtil — for my bene
                                             factor !    Yes, gratitude
                                             should outweigh all self

                                             decided ?
                                                  Chloe.   Yes,   yes;   I
                                             am.
                                                  Lysis. Then we must
                                             not lose a moment. Come
                                             with me, and assist at the
                                             sacrifice.
                                                  Chloe. No, Lysis, no :
                                             spare me that spectacle.
                                             Here are my turtle-doves ;
                                             I deliver them up to you.
                                             Kill them, if through their
death Menalc as may recover.       But let me be absent.       Let me go
and weep alone, at a distance from Love's altar.        {Weeps.)     O, if
you did but know how dear these birds are to me !         If  you did but
know from whom I received them, and the          promise I gave   !   But
the God of Love knows it ; he reads it in my heart ; and the more
grievous this sacrifice is to me, doubtless the more beneficial will it
be to Menalcas.       Farewell, Lysis !   I must needs weep, and my
sobs would but interrupt your prayers.        Farewell, ye too, hapless
birds ! farewell ! Ye cannot suffer more than I now endure.          [She
kisses the turtle-doves, put them into the hands of Lysis, and Exit.
     Lysis. 0 virtuous Chloe ! thy mother ought to be a happy
woman ; and proud, indeed, of such a child as thou !           But I see
Myrtil advancing yonder. (He addresses the attendant Priest, and

puts the doves into his hands.)     Go and wait for me at the Temple,
and make ready the fire upon the altar.
                         [Exit the attendant Priest, bearing the doves.
                             Enter  Myktil.
     Myrtil.  I have been seeking for you, Lysis"; come and rejoice
with me, for there is hope that my dear father will be restored to us.
     Lysis. Would to Heaven he were ! But tell me, what power has
interposed in his behalf ?
     Myrtil. He was almost at the last gasp when        I  arrived at his '
bedside.     My brothers were all kneeling about his couch, lifting
their hands to heaven.     I  burst into the midst of them, and threw
my arms about his dear neck !         Whereupon he began to come to
himself, and rallied all his remaining strength to press me to his
bosom.      You are come then, Myrtil? said he.    I could not have died
in peace had you remained absent.        I could only reply by pressing
him to my breast, and sobbing aloud.        But on a sudden, some God
seemed to have inspired me with a thought.         I recollected to have
heard you speak of an ancient shepherd named Lamon, who lives
in a cave on the summit of the mountain that overlooks our pastures,
 who is reported to have learnt of Apollo himself the art of curing
 all manner of sickness.

  176                                 THE PLAYMATE.
       Lysis.    I  know not      if he   be still alive.
       Myrtil. Well,      I  tore myself from my father's arms.             I ascended
  the mountain, and made all the caves re-echo with calling on the
  name of Lamon.            I   found him at last, seated under an aged oak,
  sorting    the   simples     he    had that morning been gathering on the
  mountain wilds.          I  threw myself at his feet.          My father is dying,
  I  cried aloud ; save him, save him, by your art ! Lamon answered
  me as follows, as nearly as           I  can recollect his words :      My son, it is
                                          I will do all that     I
                                                                    I
. my profession to do good.                                         can to cure your
 father ; and       if the God Apollo grants me success,               will receive no
  other guerdon of you than the crook which you carry in your hand :
         I will hang it up, as a votive offering, upon an ancient bag-tree
         I
  and
  that     have consecrated to Apollo.
        Lysis. Lamon is always himself.                His piety towards' the Gods
  equals   his   charity   towards      his fellow-creatures.
        Myrtil. Most true. But, alas ! in asking for my crook, he
  asked me for the dearest treasure                I  possess.    That crook was the
  gift of my dear shepherdess, and               I   made a vow to die rather than
  part from it. But no : not even my vow, nor my crook, nor my
  shepherdess herself, are so dear to me as my father.                     On hearing
  Lamon' s words, I kept down my tears ;                  I even forced a smile ; and
  though      I  would    rather      have   yielded up ten years of my life, yet
  without a murmur I yielded up my crook into the hands of
  Lamon.
        Lysis. And will Lamon restore Menalcas to health ?
        Myrtil. Lamon saw him — questioned him — and examined
  him in profound silence.              At length he bade us hope. We fell on

   himself affected to tears. He required us all to leave the apartment,
   and remained alone in attendance on my father.                    I profited by this
   opportunity ; and came to announce the good tidings to you, and
   to ask you to make interest with the Gods for our success.
        Lysis. I will to the Temple.               I  must there perform a sacrifice
   that will make you shed tears of gratitude when you shall have
   learnt who it was that offered it.                                            [Exit.
        Myrtil. Ah, Lysis         !  I  will accompany you.           But here comes
   Chloe.      I wish her to hear of my happiness, and partake in my joy.
                                        Enter Chloe.
         Chloe.   I  know all, my dearest Myrtil.             I have    just come from
   your   father's   house.        I  have seen Lamon       — have    spoken with him
   — his hopes are strengthened every hour.

    Myrtil. Ah, my dearest Chloe      to hear this from your sweet
                                          !
lipB, makes the good news ten times   the sweeter.
     Chloe. 0 Myrtil, it was you that saved your father : it was you
that thought of seeking out Lamon in his retirement on the
mountain-top.    I would fain love you more and more for this : hut
my poor little heart has already done its utmost, and,           I
                                                          fear, can
do no more.     But, Myrtil, what has become of your crook ?
   Myrtil. Of my crook ?                             [In confusion.
    Chloe. Yes.   Have you lost it ?   ,
   Myrtil. No, indeed        I
                            have not.
    Chloe. Surely, you have not given it away ?
    Myrtil. Why,   yes,  I
                        have.                                  [In   confusion.
    Chloe. Had any other than yourself told me so,         Myrtil,     I would
not have believed it.
    Myrtil. Ah, Chloe, if you did but know all ! — But what               have
you done with your nest of turtles ?
    Chloe. They are no longer mine.                    [Weeps.
   Myrtil. Why,   what has become    of them ?
    Chloe. They are about to be killed, even now.      [Weeps.
    Myrtil. And what barbarous hand would do such a deed ?
    Chloe.The deed is mine.
   Myrtil. Yours, Chloe ?
   Chloe. Yes.       I
                  gave the birds to Lysis, to sacrifice them to the
God of Love, to propitiate the divinity to accord us your father's
recovery.
    Myrtil. O my     dearest Chloe !          I
                                        breathe again.    You are a
thousand times more dear to me than before; and never

    Chloe. And did not you offer up my crook to the God of Love ?
    Myrtil. No. But Lamon demanded it of me, on the condition
of his intercession with the God of Love for my father's recovery.
Could   I  refuseit, Chloe       ?no O,   !hid my grief — bestowed
                                                  I

done, how is      it that we   cannot suppress a murmur ? Murmuring
is not only wrong, but now all too late ; for the turtles are already
sacrificed — the crook is already consecrated to Apollo: we shall
never see either one or the other more.
     Enter Lamon, Lysis, and           the  attendant Priest, bearing the
                           turtle-doves and the crook.
     Lamon. Yes, my virtuous and tender-hearted children, you shall
see them once more.          The God of Love restores you both your
offerings.     I,   Lamon,    the physician, who by the help of Apollo
restored your father to his wonted health, will take no guerdon in
earnest of my services.          Lysis has told me all. He was officiating
in the Temple, and was on the point of sacrificing the doves, with
the sacred knife in his hand just about to be stained with their blood,
when, on a sudden, a sweet low voice issued, as it seemed, from the
statue of the God of Love.           Go, it said ; go, carry back to the young
shepherdess     Chloe,   the  tender  birds she has offered up to me.      Tell
                                                                              I
her that, without the completion of that sacrifice, Menalcas shall be
restored to health.        Go, assure Chloe, and assure Myrtil, that
watch over their destinies; that they shall speedily be united; and
that  I will render them as happy as           I  render all those, who, whilst
 they reverence me, reverence virtue.
     Myrtil. Ah, Chloe !
     Chloe. Ah, Myrtil !
     Lamon. Lysis will confirm my words, that it was at the very
moment that the voice ceased, that           I arrived with the tidings of the
perfect recovery      of Menalcas ; and brought Myrtil' s crook with me,
and put it into the hands of Lysis.               Be thankful, all ; the Gods
 have shewn much mercy.
     Lysis. Be thankful, all ; and never fail your loves.
              Take back your crook i [to Myrtil] . Take back your
                  turtle-doves [to Chloe].

              Accept an omen from the God of Love !
      [Lysis withdraws the curtain of the Temple and discovers the
         statue of the God of Love, bearing in his right hand a flaming
          torch, and holding a scroll in his left with the names thereon

                            SEPTEMBER.
                             By Mary  Roberts.
     Well, this is a sight worthy of a holiday ! You, Charles, have
never been in the country at the threshing season, and Augustus is
just arrived from the land of rock-giants and icebergs.          What a
                  —
cheerful scene ! the large old barn, with its wide doors thrown
open, and apple-trees beyond, loaded with ripe fruit; threshers
eagerly at work ; winnowing going on in the open space, and a
heap of corn piled upon the floor.     I  love to listen to the sound of
the flying flail, to watch the dividing of the chaff from the wheat ;
the bringing out from its rough close husk that brown ripe grain,
with which so many interesting associations are connected.
     The barn itself is well worth noticing.       Close at the furthest
end grows a fine walnut-tree, of which the branches droop over a
pond where ducks resort ; pigeons are flying in and out of the ample
dove-house affixed to the wall ; and waiting patiently before the
open door, in expectation of a few chance grains, is a fine barn
door fowl, with a family of half-grown chickens. Truly an English
homestead seems to betoken peace and abundance.               Look about
you, playmates ; you have never seen any thing of the kind before.
All round the farm-yard are cow-pens, with their unwieldy occu
pants — quiet, meditative creatures, chewing the cud and looking as
if all pleasant and soothing memories were within them, of green
fields and clear streams, and thoughts of sweet fresh hay, should
snow lie deep upon the ground. Yet, meditative as they seem,
when Tom the farmer's boy passes beneath a trailing load, with
which to fill the racks, first one and then another stretches out her
neck to catch a sweet morsel.
     Holloa, here they come ! what a brotherhood of pigs, rushing
full tilt from the wood, and scampering headlong to the sty, grunt
ing as they run ! They must have heard Tom's voice speaking to
the cows, and this has brought them in such a wondrous hurry.
 Here, too, is Chanticleer, with his feathery dames ; the old turkey-
 cock, gobbling and strutting with his helpmate, a fantastic, conse
 quential sort of personage ; and waddling and quacking, a company
 of ducks from off the pool. Tom is a great favourite with all his
 master's dependants, whether four-legged or feathered,          and the
 sound of bis voice reminds them of the evening meal.

 180                          THE PLAYMATE.
    Now let us go into the barn and watch the threshing             ; the men
will not leave work for some time, and there is plenty of room
for us.
    My father was some years since in Palestine, and he told me that
the ancient custom of treading out the corn with oxen, instead of
threshing, still prevailed in the East.      A smooth flat piece of ground
was selected for the purpose, and across it a primitive-looking ma
chine, with a wooden chair, on which a man sat, was driven back
wards and forwards among the sheaves, till they were broken into
small pieces. The whole was then collected into a heap, and shaken
against the wind by means of a small shovel, the chaff flying rapidly
away, while the corn remained.           You, Charles, who are better ac
quainted with the practices of ancient than modern husbandmen,
can repeat the passage in Homer, which aptly describes this custom :
             " As with autumnal harvest  cover'd o'er,
               And thick hestown, lies Ceres' sacred floor ;
               When round and round, with never-wearied pain,
               The trampling steers heat out the unnumher'd grain."
    Horace, too, speaks of the same custom.              He tells us that the
threshing-floor   was  generally a level, smooth area, enclosed by mud
walls, with a garner on one side.
    How brightly shines the setting sun into the barn, tingeing every
object with a golden hue ! The flying flails, the workmen, the heap
of corn, even the old winnowing machine, seem as if a sudden
change had passed upon them.           One round more and the work is
done.     The threshers are preparing to depart, and we must be
gone.   .

                              THE FLAYMATE.
                      THE HORSE CHESNUT,
      This tree, which is originally a native    of the East, has not very
 long been naturalized in England.       Its introduction here has been
 solely owingTto its beauty, in which, at the
                                                      flowering season, it
 certainly excels every other tree of its bulk that bears our
                                                                   climate.
 In early spring it puts forth large buds, which
                                                        burst into verdure
 among the first greens that enliven the
                                                year; and its ample pal-
mated leaves have an appearance both
                                              uncommon and handsome.
Wot long after, it puts forth its
                                      long upright spikes of white and
variegated flowers, generally in such number as
                                                        to cover the whole
tree, and give it the resemblance of
                                             one gigantic bouquet.     No
flowering shrub is rendered more gay by its blossoms
                                                             than this tall
tree; hence it combines
                          beauty with grandeur, in a degree superior
to any other vegetable of these
                                   climates.     The head is also shapely
and regular in rts growth, and
                                       well adapted to the symmetry

required in walks and avenues.        It has the defect of changing and
losing its leaves early   in   autumn, the natural consequence of its
early spring verdure.     It is also accused of not well resisting tem
pestuous winds.    The wood of the horse-chesnut is of little value;
it    however, of some use to the turner.

farinacious quality,  but   so  bitter as to be unfit for human food.
Deer are said to be fond of them, and sheep will eat them          ;   and
when boiled, they have been used to fatten poultry.          When left to
decay, they turn into      kind of jelly, which has been employed like
                                a
soap  in washing linen.     The bark has considerable astringency, and
may be used for tanning leather.

flight with all speed.

away,

 184                           THE PLAYMATE.
               THE BEAR AND THE CHILDREN.
           FROM   AXDEBSEN'S   "  PICTUBE-BOOK  WITHOUT   FICTUBE8."
                           Translated  by Meta Taylor.
     I will  tell you a circumstance which occurred a year ago, in a
country town in the south of Germany. The master of a dancing-
bear was sitting in the tap-room of an inn, eating his supper;
whilst the bear, poor harmless beast ! was tied up behind the wood-
stack in the yard.
     In the room upstairs three little children were playing about.
Tramp, tramp ! was suddenly heard on the stairs : who could it
be ?   The door flew open, and enter — the bear, the huge, shaggy
beast with his clanking chain ! Tired of standing so long in the
yard alone, Bruin had at length found his way to the staircase.
At first the little children were in a terrible fright at this unex
pected visit, and each ran into a corner to hide himself.             But the
bear found them all out, and put his muzzle, snuifling, up to them,
but did not harm them in the least.          He must be a big dog, thought
the children ; and they began to stroke him familiarly.              The bear
stretched himself out at his full length upon the floor, and the
youngest boy rolled over him, and nestled his curly head in the
shaggy, black fur of the beast.            Then the eldest boy went and
fetched his drum, and thumped away on it with might and main ;
whereupon the bear stood erect upon his hind legs, and began to
dance.    What glorious fun ! Each boy shouldered his musket ;
the bear must of course have one too, and he held it tight and
firm, like any soldier.     There's a comrade for you, my lads ! and
away they marched     —  one, two, — one, two !
     The door suddenly opened, and the children's mother entered.
You should have seen her — speechless with terror, her cheeks white
as a sheet, and her eyes fixed with horror.            But the youngest boy
nodded with a look of intense delight, and cried, " Mamma, we are'
                                "

     Albert Durer,     the author of this picture, was one of the
earliest and most famous of the artists of Germany.     He was the
son and grandson of a goldsmith, but he left his father's craft in
his sixteenth year, to become a student of painting under Michael
Wolgemuth, and a most indefatigable artist in all branches of art
up to the time of his death.   We find his well-known monogram
on paintings, sculptures, engravings, etchings (which process he is
said to have invented), drawings on wood, ornamental designs of all
kinds.    Albert Durer was born on the 20th May, 1471, and died
April 6, 1528, in the fifty-seventh year of his age. Nuremberg
was the place of his birth and of his death. — Felix Summerly.

                     HISTORICAL SKETCHES.
                            By Mrs. James  Whittle.
                        No.  IV.— GUSTAVUS VASA.
      The title of Hero is     one which has by general consent been
 given to men whose       military deeds and success in battle have
rendered them famous ; to such we may yield the palm of valour,
 skill, and personal courage ; but the name of hero should alone be
given to men who unite to these other and, as it seems to me,
far nobler attributes. He alone is worthy of a hero's fame whose
motives are high and pure ; who, revolting from scenes of bloodshed
and slaughter, takes up the sword in defence of his country's rights
and liberties, whose actions have nobler aims than selfish ambition
or worldly glory, and who fights that others may live in security
and peace.      Such we rarely find amongst the warriors of antiquity.
Alexander of Macedon, Julius Caesar, Xerxes, and, in modern times,
Napoleon, scrupled not to shed the blood of thousands of their
fellowmen, to add one province to their empire.            But history's
" ample page" records many examples of heroes truly worthy of
that high name, and such a one was Gustavus Vasa, the subject of
our present sketch.
      Sweden was one of those northern countries which remained in
a semi-civilised state long after the more southern provinces of
Europe had assumed a regular form of government, and adopted
the manners and usages belonging to a more advanced state of
society.     In A.n. 1388, the thrones of Sweden, Denmark, and
Norway were united in the person of Margaret Waldemar, the
ambitious wife of Haguin king of Norway, and daughter of Wal
demar king of Sweden, who from her talent and daring has been
called the Semiramis of the North.           She convoked at Calmar an
assembly    of the nobles   of  the  three  nations, and appointing her
successor, claimed for him the crowns of all the kingdoms. Charmed
with her eloquence and grace, they yielded a ready assent, and
ratified the famous treaty of Calmar, by which these northern states
were declared indissolubly united.        As long as the powerful hand
of Margaret held the reins of government all went on smoothly ;
but under her successor the strong national antipathies which had
been repressed for a time burst forth with increased violence.
The Swedes revolted, and, declaring themselves independent of
Denmark, elected a sovereign from their own nation.

                            THE PLAYMATE.                          187
     In  the bosom  of the community however lurked one who, be
neath his archbishop's robes, concealed a traitor's heart.    Gustavus
 Trolle, the primate of Upsal, had found in Christiern the Second of
Denmark an able abettor of his own ambitious views, and yielded
a ready ear to his proposal of delivering Sweden once more into
the hands of a foreign ruler.      Christiern's tyrannical temper led
him to oppress all who came within his power ; raised by the per
fidy of the archbishop to the throne of Sweden, he scrupled not
to imbrue his hands in the blood of those who opposed his eleva
tion, and endeavoured to secure his newly acquired crown by the
sacrifice of the principal nobles of the realm.     The cruelty of this
act was heightened by the base treachery which accompanied it : he
proclaimed a grand banquet in honour of his accession to the
throne ; and when mirth and festivity had disarmed suspicion, a band
of soldiers rushed into the hall, seized ninety-four of the guests,
and led them forth to instant execution.       Among these was Eric
Vasa, the father of Gustavus.    This wanton and wholesale massacre
of his enemies failed to establish permanently the throne of the
tyrant.     Gustavus Vasa survived to avenge the wrongs of his
country and the murder of his father.       Christiern suspecting him,
gained possession of his person by artifice, and Gustavus was
loaded with chains and thrown into a dungeon.         A Danish noble,
touched by the manly bearing and early sorrows of the youth,
besought and obtained permission to become the keeper of the
prisoner, binding himself, should he escape, to forfeit a large sum
of money to the king. Though freed from the close confinement
of a prison, the spirit of Gustavus chafed under the inactivity of
his life : a sense of injury rankled in his breast, and he longed im
patiently for the moment when he might rise and call on his country
to free itself.   He watched anxiously for some means of escape,
and at length eluded the vigilance of his keeper, and in the disguise
of a sailor fled to Sweden.    It seems an ungenerous return to the
Danish nobleman who had shewn him so much kindness to leave
him thus exposed to Christiern's anger ; but Gustavus was not one
to forget benefits, and when fortune favoured him, he failed not to
testify his gratitude by substantial marks of his regard.    The state
in which he found his unhappy country grieved him to the soul.
Christiern's cruelty had spread terror throughout the land ; not a
home but had been invaded, not a hearth but had been deso
lated, by his ferocious soldiery.    The Swedes, sunk in misery,
dared not even murmur, for all complaints were regarded as

188                         THE PLAYMATE.
rebellion, and every sound of woe was stifled by fear. None ven
tured to appear in mourning for those relatives who had fallen
victims to the despot's sword, and even a silent look of grief
became a cause of suspicion.      Gustavus felt himself avoided by all
whom he had trusted ; and, hopeless of arousing his panic-stricken
countrymen to immediate action, he wandered from place to place
exposed to danger at every step, and seeing in every town and
village the proclamation of rewards for his capture, dead or alive.
He encountered a thousand perils, and met with so many hairbreadth
escapes, that it seems a miracle he survived.   One day, being closely
pursued by the soldiers who were scouring the country in search
of him, he eluded them by concealing himself under some bundles
of hay piled on a cart ; and thus hidden he passed through the
midst of his enemies.     At another time, worn out with fatigue and
hunger, he begged for shelter in the house of a peasant, named
Peterson, who readily opened his doors to the fugitive, resolving
basely to sacrifice his guest and secure the promised reward.      He
placed refreshment before the wearied traveller, and urging him to
partake freely, he secretly left the house, and hastened to the
nearest encampment of troops, to report the prize he held in his
power.      Happily for Gustavus, however, the wife of his betrayer
scorned her husband's ungenerous act, and warning him of his dan
ger led him to the stable, and pointing to the fleetest horse bade
him mount instantly and fly. Peterson, on his return with the
soldiers, was furious at the escape of his victim ; but pursuit was
useless, as Gustavus was already far beyond their power.        These
constantly recurring dangers at length induced Gustavus Vasa to fly
from society and seek refuge in the remotest corner of Sweden.
     There lies between the lofty mountains which separate Sweden
from Norway, a district called Dalecarlia, inhabited by a simple and
half-civilised race, whose principal occupation consists in working
the copper-mines which abound in that country.       Thither Gustavus
fled, and assuming the dress of one of these labourers, he submitted
to all the deprivations   of their life, and worked with them in the
mines.     In this obscure retreat he deemed himself safe from his
enemies, and patiently awaited the moment when he might excite
his countrymen to throw off the tyrant's yoke.
     In spite, however, of all his caution, Gustavus was discovered.
The woman in whose house he lodged perceiving that the linen
he wore under the coarse and ragged dress of a miner was of the
finest quality, imparted the discovery to her friends, and Gustavus

                           THE PLAYMATE.                           189
became an object of wonder and suspicion.       It was rumoured that
he was a foreigner of distinction in disguise, whilst some said he
was one of Christiem's spies.       At length the news reached the
ears of a nobleman, who had met Vasa in Stockholm ; he imme
diately recognised him, and, aware of the risk he ran by acknow
ledging such a dangerous acquaintance, he invited him by night
to his house.     After much conversation, Gustavus, overjoyed at
being once more in the society of his equal in rank and education,
disclosed to him his plan for the delivery of his country.      But he
found in   his auditor no friend  to  so bold an  undertaking ; timid
and irresolute, the nobleman was terrified at the proposition, and
declined all participation in so perilous a scheme.     Vasa then en
treated him to keep silence on the subject, and by the advice of his
friend, who was glad to be rid of so dangerous a guest, he took up
his residence with a clergyman in the neighbourhood.      The zealous
pastor welcomed him with open arms, and when Gustavus unfolded
to him his schemes of redeeming his country from servitude, the
old man's eyes overflowed with tears of joy; and, though his obscu
rity and poverty debarred him from affording any more substantial
assistance, he willingly proffered his advice, and gave his house as
an asylum to the proscribed Vasa.       At length, weary of the long
delay, and seeing no hope of rousing the wealthier and more influ
ential Swedes, our hero, with the courage and determination charac
teristic of a great man, determined to avail himself of the means
within his reach; and rude and uncultivated as the Dalecarlians
were, he resolved to bend them to his purpose, and make them the
first instruments in the great struggle for liberty.   While working
in the mines, he had gained the admiration and respect of his
fellow-labourers, by his courage and recklessness of danger, and
they already looked up to him as a superior.       From his friend the
curate he learned that in a few days the peasantry would assemble
in large numbers for the celebration of an annual festival ; and he
at once determined to avail himself of this opportunity, and endea
vour, by an earnest appeal to the sacredness of the cause, to arouse
the ardour of the people.
     On the day of the festival he appeared among his former com
panions, no longer the poor and ragged miner, but as the people's
friend, the injured and proscribed noble, who burned to avenge his
own and his country's wrongs.       In a few words he made known
 his intention to the assembled multitude, and forcibly representing
 the degraded 'state of Sweden, and the atrocities of Christiern, he

190                       THE PLAYMATE.
called upon them to rise and join his standard, and offered himself
to be their leader.    He was listened to with breathless attention,
but although his eloquence touched their feelings, no voice raised a
cry of assent.  Gustavus felt the silence fall heavily on his heart ;
when suddenly an old man exclaimed, " Let us follow him ! God,
you see, favours the design — the wind blows from the north, and
success must attend the enterprise."
     Thus superstition accomplished what the feeling of injury and
the impassioned eloquence of Vasa failed to effect.      A tradition
existed amongst this poor and rude people, that if at the commence
ment of any undertaking the wind should suddenly veer to the
north, it was a sure omen that God would approve the design.
The voice of the old man was drowned amidst the acclamations of
                                          the surrounding crowds,
                                          and Gustavus immediately
                                          found himself the leader of
                                          an immense though wholly
                                          undisciplined army.    On
                                         wards they marched, gain
                                         ing fresh reinforcements at
                                         every step; for the Swedes,
                                         though cautious in com
                                         promising themselves by
                                         joining an unknown indi
                                         vidual, no sooner saw this
                                         immense host descending
                                         from the mountains like
                                         an avalanche, sweeping all
                                         before  it, than they flew
                                         to arms and joined the
                                         throng.
                                              The fury of the Danish
                                         monarch passed all bounds
                                         when the news of the in
                                         surrection reached him,
                                         and, with his characteristic
                                         ferocity, he caused the un

new act of barbarity only imparted increased vigour to the efforts
of Gustavus and his followers. Every day he was joined by fresh
adherents ; as he approached the towns, the inhabitants rose to
arms, and driving forth the Danes, slaughtered them in the open
country.    Stockholm was the last town they captured; here the
flower of the Danish forces was collected ; but Gustavus blockaded
the city, and soon caused it to surrender.
    Gustavus entered Stockholm in triumph, at the head of his
brave soldiers ; his first act was to repair to the principal church
and publicly to return thanks for the deliverance of his country ;
his next impulse was to remember all who had been kind to him
in adversity, — the Danish nobleman, from whose castle he had first
escaped, — Peterson's wife, by whose timely warning his life had
been preserved, — and last, though not least, the venerable curate
who had sheltered him after his discovery at the mines.     When he
was told that the good old man was dead, he caused a crown of
gold to be placed on the church of his village, that all might see
how gratefully his kind acts were remembered, even in death.
    With one voice Gustavus was elected king; and, yielding to
the entreaties of the people, he consented to guide and govern the
country he had saved. Great as he was as a general, whilst
fighting bravely at the head of his army for the freedom of his
country, he proved himself a still nobler hero when, raised to the
throne, he cast aside all personal ambition, and wearing his new
dignity with modesty and discretion, devoted his energies with
single-hearted patriotism to promote the welfare of his people
and the greatness of his country. We cannot pursue his history
further, and will leave him in his glory, content to know that
under his wise administration Sweden threw off all remains of
barbarism, and rose to the rank of one of the civilised kingdoms of
Europe.     He lived to the advanced age of seventy, retaining his
vigour of mind and body, and devoting himself to the last moment
of his existence to the service of his country. He died amidst the
heartfelt lamentations of his people, who regarded him as a father.

            Tratulated from   the German by   Mis) Margaret Taylor:
    One sultry summer'       morning a little cloud rose out of the
                              8
sea, and glided lightly, like a playful child, through the blue sky
and over the wide earth which lay beneath             it,
                                                 gloomy and parched

by the long drought.       As the cloudlet sailed along, she saw far
beneath her the poor labourers toiling in the sweat of their brow,
whilst she was wafted gently along by the soft morning breeze,
without either care or toil. " Ah !         said she, " could I
                                         "
                                                                but do
something to lighten the labours of these poor men upon the earth,
drive away their cares, give food to the hungry, and refreshment to
the thirsty !
               "
      The day advanced, and the cloud grew bigger and bigger ; and
as she grew, her desire to devote her life to mankind grew likewise
stronger. But the heat waxed more intense upon the earth;
the sun's rays burned like a very fire, till the wearied labourers
nearly fainted in the fields ; and yet they worked on and on, for
they were very poor.      From time to time they cast a piteous look
                                       "                               "
up at the cloud, as much as to say, Ah, that you would help us !
      " I will  help you," said the cloud ; and she began to sink
gently down.      But presently she recalled what she had once heard
when a little child, in the depths of the sea, that if a cloud ventures
too near the earth, she dies.      For awhile she wavered, and was
driven hither and thither by her thoughts ; but at length she stood
still, and with all the gladness of a good resolution she cried, " Ye
weary men who are toiling on the earth, I will help you."
      Filled with this thought, the cloud suddenly expanded to a
gigantic size ; she had never imagined herself capable of such great
ness.     Like an angel of blessing, she stood above the earth and
spread her wings over the parched fields, and her form became so
glorious — so awful, that rshe filled man and beast with fear ; and
the trees and grass bent before her, while yet they well knew that
she was their benefactor.
      " Ay, will help you," said the cloud again : " receive me —
             I                                                         I
die [for you."     A sudden will at this moment darted through her
whole form ; a brilliant flash gleamed across her, and the thunder
reverberated around.      Strong was that will, and stronger still the
love, penetrated by which she fell, and dissolved in a shower that
dropped blessings upon the earth.          The rain was her work — the
rain was also her death, and the act was glorious.         Far over the
land, as wide as the rain extended, a brilliant bow arose, formed of
the purest rays of heaven's height : it was the last greeting of that
pure and self-sacrificing spirit of love.    The rainbow vanished, but
the blessing of the cloud long rested upon the land which she had
saved.

     Here we are at length, in the depth of Hertley Wood ! What
a  wild and beautiful spot !
     And here is the deserted house, concerning which we have
heard so much ; and this wild heathy space, that reaches to such a
distance, was once an extensive pleasure-ground.               An old man
dwells near, a charcoal burner; he lived with the last owner of
Hertley park when a boy, and can tell us a good deal about the
family.    He will pass in a few minutes, for he is as punctual in
his movements as a clock, and this is the way to his cottage.
     And the old man did pass, bowed under the weight of ninety
years.    His hair was white, his dress such as belonged to a gene
ration of forgotten men -y but his clear blue eye told that, however
bent and battered might be the outward frame, the mental faculties
remained unimpaired.
     " Good day, master," said Augustus. " have brought my play
                                                     I

     " Ah, lack-a-day ! " replied the old man : " it makes me sad to
think about it ; and yet, somehow,        I love   to talk of the family — it
brings up pleasant memories now and then, and makes the past
seem present.       Well, then, young gentlemen, to begin my story :
my master, Lord Loftus, for so        I used to call him, being his coach
                      I
man's son, though was but a stripling at the time, ordered several
hogsheads of beer to be brewed on a fine October morning, about
the time his heir was born.          Three of the best were stowed away
in a large cellar, and his lordship said that the light of heaven
should never visit them till his son came of age.            One-and-twenty
years passed    on, and   plenty   of cobwebs,     as  you may well suppose,
were in that dark cellar when the old oak door was thrown open,
 and the bright warm sun streamed upon the three hogsheads
standing side by side.
     " wan-ant you plenty of folks were there on the morrow when
       I
the barrels were tapped on the young heir's birthday.             First came

 cleaned the day before, the walls were covered with oak boughs,
over which hung long trailing wreaths of hops, and on each barrel
 was placed ears of barley, with such flowers as grew in the field.
All the men-servants were in attendance, and standing next my

 lady was young master's nurse, with the housekeeper and lady's
 maid. A most grand-looking personage, truly, was that same
 nurse ; and what with her towering cap and high-heeled shoes, she
 was forced to stoop pretty low under the arched doorway.        She
was dressed in a stiff brocaded silk, and from her elbows hung
 such fine lace ruffles as the grandest lady in the land might have
worn.     Didn't she look proud and pleased ! When all had taken
their standing right and left, the butler came forward with two
men and tapped the barrels.        An old silver tankard, which some
said belonged to the family ever since the Conqueror came into
England, was filled and handed to my lord, who poured out a
power of glasses, which the livery- servants carried round to all the
guests, great and small.      The old nurse was honoured that day,
for my lord drank to her, and thanked her for the good care
she had taken of his son ; my lady did the same, and all the gen
tlefolks.   The old dame curtsied and curtsied, and we thought that
she scarcely knew whether she stood on her head or her heels.
Next day, old and young came to look at the cellar and barrels, and
I  myself tapped one barrel and gave some of that famous beer to
my little brother and sisters.                 I
                                  Ah ! well do remember that day.
     " Now as to the mansion itself, and how it came to be shut up,
'tis no good to make young hearts sad, and my own would half
break in telling it. Pleasant evening to you, young gentlemen;
may you grow up good and happy, and never know what it is to
look upon a deserted home."



                               THE PLAYMATE.                            195
                LITTLE LIZZIE AND THE FAIRIES.
                            By Dinah Maria Mulock.
     Of   all the sweet little cottages that ever were seen, little Lizzie's
 was the very prettiest.       It was far in the country — in the very
 middle of green fields.       The nearest high road was at least half-a-
mile off, and the rest of the way to the cottage you had to come
hy a narrow foot-path, through fields, across a creaking plank-
bridge, beneath which a little stream ran ; over great high stiles,
 such as none hut country children could possibly climb ; and
through gates that nine times out of ten were fast locked with an
immense padlock, and had to be crept under or clambered over,
in the best way you could.
     There was a very little garden round the cottage ; for Lizzie
made the fields her garden.        There, on the sunny green slopes, she
found flowers in every season of the year ; first, daisies and white
cuckoo-flowers ; then primroses, cowslips, orchises, and numberless
other flowers of summer.          Autumn brought foxgloves, cranesbill,
and purple vetches ; so that Lizzie's garden was always in bloom,
without any care of her own to tend it. All summer long the
child wandered about the fields, learning all country lore from
flowers, and birds, and insects.      In the winter- time, when the snow
covered up the green grass, and the rivulet was frozen, and the
only cheerful-looking object in t\e fields was the hawthorn-hedge,
with its scarlet berries, Lizzie used to sit by her mother's side and
learn to spin flax.
     It was by flax-spinning that the widow maintained herself and
her daughter. Little Lizzie lived nearly two hundred years ago,
when there were no such things as looms and weaving-machines,
and all the linen and woollen garments of the country peoplej]were
spun by their own hands, from the fleece of their own sheep and
from the hemp and flax that grew in their own gardens and fields.
This was what Lizzie's mother did. Close by the cottage was a
flax-field, where each year she sowed the seed, and when the plants
were ready to be gathered she took them to be prepared and made
into flax for spinning.         This she brought home and spun into
garments, which people were glad to buy, for they were evenly and
beautifully woven.
     Did you ever see a flax-field ? It is indeed a pretty sight — a
waving mass of bright green leaves and bright blue flowers, in
colour and shape something like harebells; those beautiful deep

196                            THE PLAYMATE.
azure flowers that you find in autumn on wild heaths, only that the
harebells droop their heads, while the little flax-flowers hold theirs
up boldly.    Fancy how very pretty a whole field of them must
look, growing as high almost as wheat, and each plant bearing
numbers of these blue blossoms, with small leaves of the tenderest
green ! No wonder that all summer the flax-field was Lizzid's
admiration and delight.     She would creep through the narrow
walks that intersected        it,
                            too narrow for even her tiny foot, and
watch the plants spring up from the brown mould, and gradually
grow higher and higher, until         by  summer-time they absolutely
overtopped her head, and Lizzie in her walks was completely
buried between two long alleys of blue flax-flowers.
     Many and many time when the plants were young and feeble
                         a
did Lizzie go all over the field, carefully taking away the worms
and noxious insects from the stems, and watering such as looked
delicate and drooping.       Her mother joined in this care of the field,
for she knew its value, and how important to them              it was that
each year the flax should yield an abundant harvest.
     It seemed as   if the plants themselves requited this tender care,
for they grew tall and thick with blossoms, and were the prettiest
sight all summer    ;  and when autumn came there was not           a   flax-
field for miles round that brought such an abundant harvest as the
widow's little field. And she well deserved       it
                                                   ;   for she was  a  pious
gentle  woman,   who   had  the  kindest heart  in the   world, who   out  of
her own poverty found means to help those poorer still, and who
brought up her only child in all good ways.
     The summer was waning fast into autumn, the blackberries and
nuts were ripening on every hedge, and already            a   few fields of
golden
s         wheat had fallen beneath the sickle.            Lizzie's mother
watched her flax-field with anxious eyes, but no thunder-storm
came to break the plants, and they were strong and healthy. Every
morning, as soon as the sun was up, the mother and child went
together to look at the beautiful flax-field.
     One morning, Lizzie woke very early — so early, that what she
took for daylight was only the light of the bright harvest-moon
that peeped through her curtains.        She lifted her head and looked
at her mother the widow still slept the heavy slumber of weari
               ;
ness, for she had walked many miles the day before, and she was
never very strong.      Lizzie watched her, and thought how tired she
was, and what   a  pity  it would be to wake her.
     " Poor mother  !I     will go alone to the flax-field this morning,"


LITTLE LIZZIE AND THE FAIRIES.
                              THE PLAYMATE.                          197
 thought the child ;
                       " and then will come back and light the fire,
                                    I
 and go to the well for water, before she wakes.       Dear mother ! I
 wish  I were old enough to work, and then she should never be so
 weary as she is now."
     So Lizzie crept quietly out of bed, and put on her few clothes —
 no bonnet covered her fair curls, and her little white feet always
 went quite bare.      Yet she was a pretty, graceful child, as ever
 danced over green meadows.        When she had noiselessly closed the
 cottage-door, and was out in the open air, Lizzie felt much sur
prised to find how very early she was up. It was almost dark, for
 the moon had just glimmered in at the child's window before set
ting, and the stars only remained to give light.      Lizzie felt almost
 disposed to go to rest again, but that would be sure to awaken her
mother.      She looked to the east, and saw there the first streak of
 dawn ; so the little girl knew that day-break was coming, and deter
mined to go to the flax-field by starlight and wait there to watch the
sun rise, a sight which her little sleepy eyes had seldom beheld.
     Lizzie had hardly come to the gate when she saw there was a
bright light all over the field, so that she could distinguish it as
plain as if broad daylight.        She looked up to the sky, but the
day-break was still like    a  faint line on the horizon, and the stars
were yet shining overhead.       Lizzie opened the gate and went into
the field, and there she saw the most wonderful and lovely sight
that ever little child beheld.
     All over the field, in countless myriads, were troops of tiny
creatures, like men and women, but so small that Lizzie could have
held one of them in her little hand. On the head of each glim
mered a star, like that which the glow-worm carries, and this light
it was that illumined the whole field. They were dressed in gar
ments which seemed like dragon-flies' wings, of eveiy imaginable
colour; and they crept in and out of the flax-flowers, and danced
about the stems as light and agile as bees and grashoppers.
     The child knew that they were the fairies, the " good people
                                                                       "
of whom she had heard many a time, and whose rings she had
seen on the grass of the meadow, shewing where they had danced
the night before.     Lizzie felt rather alarmed, and would have ran
home again very quickly, but that the gate of the field had closed
behind her of its own accord, and she could not open it without
turning her back upon the fairies — a piece of rudeness which Lizzie
had heard always made the little people very angry.        So she stood
quite still, and in a few moments she heard a whizzing and buzzing

198                           THE PLAYMATE.
like a dozen cockchafers at once, and Lizzie was surrounded by a
whole troop of dapper little elves.        One of them, a queer little
fairy, dressed in bright green, with a blue flax-flower on his head
that fitted like a soldier's helmet, climbed to the top of a tall fox
glove that grew beside the child, and there, standing on the highest
bell, he made a graceful bow, and said in a tone, faint indeed, but
perfectly distinct, —
     " Little lady, we are glad to have the pleasure of seeing you
here."
     "lam not a lady," answered the child, a good deal frightened
and almost beginning to cry.          " I am only little Lizzie, and    I
came to look at my mother's flax-field ; pray do not be angry with
me, kind
            ' good
                   people.'
                             " Lizzie knew that the fairies did not
like to be called by their proper name, but only " good people."
     " We shall not do you any harm," said the elf, with a merry
smile, that made the other attendant fames laugh in a musical
chorus, which sounded like the tinkling of tiny bells. " We only
came to amuse ourselves, and your mother's field will not be any
the worse for our visit, but the better.    Look there, little Lizzie —
you see I know what your name is and tell me what you see."
                                       —
     Lizzie looked, and there were hundreds of fairies busied about
the flax-plants ; some carrying the largest foxglove bells full of
clear water, which they emptied at the roots ; others bearing large
dew-drops, which they shook on the leaves in a refreshing shower ;
others creeping into the flowers, painted them a beautiful blue,
with pencils made of the feathers on butterflies' wings — what skil
ful artists they were ! others gathered all the withered flowers and
dead leaves that lay on the ground or injured the plants, and then
called a whole army of beetles and insects of every kind to bury
them in the mould, where they would only make the flax grow
more abundantly.       And all this time the fairy-gardeners sang so
 sweetly and merrily, that while she listened the child's heart
danced with joy, and all her fear passed away.
     " How good you are to take such care of mother's field, beau
tiful ' good people ! ' " cried Lizzie.
     "Thank you, little maiden," said the fairy-king, for so he
seemed to be, and he bowed again very politely.
                                                          " And do you
know the reason why we do so ? It is because she is so good.          But
I  am too busy to stay and talk longer with you,         little Lizzie; I
have to hold a council of state on a wasp which has been robbing
grapes in a garden that we take charge of, so          I   will send my

daughter, who will talk better with a little girl than       I    can.    Lord-
chancellor Beeswing," said his elfin majesty, turning round with a
dignified air,
                 " call Princess Woodbine hither."
     And in a minute there stood on a lower foxglove a beautiful
fairy-lady.     Her hair, bright and wavy, was bound with a floronet
of honeysuckle buds, of that tender pink with which they are
tinted before they open into flowers.            For her wand the princess
bore one of the largest wide-opened woodbine petals, whose deli
cious perfume was wafted to Lizzie where she stood.                 The fairy-
lady addressed her in a voice of silvery sweetness :        —
      " Little golden-haired child, what do you wish to know of me V
     " The reason why you come to our flax-field, and make it so
beautiful," answered Lizzie.
      " Because your mother is one of the mortals whom we love. She
never speaks an ill word of any one, and her wheel is never still.          She
labours night and day to bring up her little girl in comfort, and be
able to provide her sweet bread and milk, so that Lizzie may grow
 strong and healthy.        She is never slow to give to the poor, so the
fairies take care that she has always wherewithal to give.              There
fore, every night, when her poor tired eyes are closed, and all the
world is sleeping, we come and tend her flax-field, and make it
grow fresh and beautiful."
      " And does she know this ? " asked Lizzie. " She and have        I
 come here together many a time just after sunrise, and we have
 never seen you, nor has she told me that you came here.                Why is
        I
 it that see you, and mother cannot ?          "
      " Because, Lizzie, you are a Sunday-child," answered the Prin
 cess Woodbine ;
                     " all children that are born on Sunday can see
 the fairies : that      is,
                         all good children.       You rose to-day, thinking
 to make all things ready for your poor tu-ed mother before she
 awoke — that was good         ;when you found     it    was so early in the
 morning, you     would    not  go  to  rest  again,  lest you should disturb
     —
 her that was good,jtoo so, when you came here, you were allowed
                               ;
 to see us."
      " And may         come again, dear         good people/ and see you
                 I                          '
 whenever   I  like "?
      " No, little Lizzie,                                                  but
                              you can only behold us once        a   year
                                                                       ;
 whenever you see the flax-field looking blooming and beautiful, you
 will know that the fairies have been there.              And when you grow
 up woman,
   a            if  you   are  as  diligent  and   as  kind  to others as your

make all things prosper with you.       But if you are idle and extra
vagant, or so hard-hearted that you will not shew kindness to
others, then the fairies will go away from you, and you will never
see  them more."
     "I   will try to be good," said little Lizzie, " only do not go
                  ." and two bright tears came to her
away from me                                              eyes, and she
sighed very heavily,    until the foxglove-hell whereon  the fairy prin
cess stood shook so much, that the little lady was forced to spread
her butterfly wings to keep herself from falling to the ground. At
this, Lizzie's tears were changed into a merry laugh ; but Wood
bine was not angry at her mirth, for she was a gentle fairy and
meek-hearted, though she was daughter of the great elfin-king.
      " Tell me beforehand the next time you sigh, little child of
earth," she said gaily ; " for we fairies are not so robust as you.
            J
And now cannot stay to talk with you any more, for the stars
are setting, and we have a long way to journey before sunrise;
only you must promise not to tell any one, except your mother,
that you have seen us, or you will look upon us no more : also,
you must always come alone to the flax-field at the time when you
are allowed to behold us.         And now good-by, good-by, little
Lizzie,  until next  year."
     While the fairy spoke, the eastern clouds were growing brighter
and brighter, until the dawn, the shadows of morning twilight,
grew less and less ; and as Lizzie looked, a faint ray of sunshine lit
the summit of the distant mountain : nearer it came, still growing
brighter, until it touched the valley beneath.     When Lizzie turned,
the fairies were all gone ; the flax-field looked fresh and lovely in
the faint light of morning, and a skylark rose singing from the
midst of it. Afar the child saw what seemed like a swarm of
gnats sailing away in the air, and she knew that it was the
                                                                  " good
people" going home.
     Lizzie grew up to be a woman, and year after year she saw the
fairies, and talked with them.       All people loved her, for she was
good, and kind, and loving, to every one.          The flax-field grew
more productive year by year, and Lizzie never knew what it was
to be poor.      There seemed a blessing upon all that belonged to
her, and she lived long and happy, and died beloved by all.
      Shall I tell you the names of the true fairies that brought such
good    fortune   to the widow and her child ?     They were Industry
and Patience, Benevolence and Household-love.
