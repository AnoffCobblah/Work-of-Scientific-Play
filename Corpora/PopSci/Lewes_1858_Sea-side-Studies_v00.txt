                    PREFACE.
 The    substance of these pages originally       appeared  in
 Blackwood's Magazine          during  the years 1856 and
 1857.     They are now republished with considerable
 alterations and additions, which, it is hoped, will render
 them more useful to the amateur and student of Natu
 ral History.
    I have endeavoured     to furnish the visitor to the sea
 side  with plain directions, by means of which he may
study and enjoy the marvels of ocean-life ; and to pre
sent such descriptions of the animals, and the wonders of
their organisation,  as may interest the reader by his own
fireside.    With regard to the former, having had to
ascertain almost everything for myself,      I  have tried to
make my experience available for others    ; and the remem
brance of early difficulties has suggested the statement
of many details which to the well-informed may appear
trivial, but for which   I   should myself have been very
grateful.    The papers in Blackwood were chiefly writ
ten at the coast, where the command of books was

vill                          PREFACE.
could only be      given sparingly        ;  this deficiency   has
now been supplied, as far as my resources              extended ;
but no gathering of second-hand references              has been
allowed to make the labour seem greater than it really
was.
     A  Glossary of technical terms has been drawn up for
the general reader     ;   and this, together with the Illus
trations, will,  I hope, render the descriptions perfectly
intelligible,  even   to readers       unfamiliar   with    marine
animals.
     There are two aspects in which Natural History may
be    regarded — as an amusement,            and as a science     ;
the one being simply delight in natural objects, the
other a philosophic        inquiry into the complex facts of
Life.     As this latter     was the motive which prompted
my visits to the coast, it has naturally assumed a promi
nent place in these pages         ; and although, throughout, a
style of popular exposition is adopted,           which aims at
being intelligible to all cultivated readers,        I  have also
had a special audience         in view, to whom must be sub
mitted the appreciation of the              new facts   and new
physiological interpretations herein advanced.              Every
competent     person will see that these novelties are the
result of hard work and continuous application            ;  and I
have    been careful to indicate       the amount and kind of
evidence   — Observation,        Dissection,   or Experiment   —
on which they rest       ;  so that the source    of error, wher
ever there is error, may be detected.

   The most startling of the new views, that, namely,
on the identity of Growth and Generation, has re
cently received    striking confirmation in the admirable
researches    of Professor Huxley on the Aphides — re
searches which render the facts I have observed in the
development of Polypes         less  paradoxical than they
originally appeared.

 A   FEW warm sunny days in              April     1856,      which flew over
 our heads like swallows twittering of the coming summer,
 stirred in my bosom        irresistible     longings to quit the moil
 and turmoil of metropolitan               crowds for the bright and
 breezy coast.       As   I hurried      through the noisy streets,         or
 sauntered through the comparatively quiet lanes of Richmond
 and Twickenham, and looked at the summerlike sky above,
 I began to understand the migration                of birds, and felt some
thing of what they must feel, when certain dim imperious
influences urge them to quit their present homes, and traverse
many a weary league of foam, in search of the resting-place
awaiting them somewhere             with a warmer smile.               I grew
impatient to take wing.           I asked     myself constantly —
                            " Why, though ill at ease
                      Within this region  I subsist,
                      Whoso spirits fail within tho mist
                      And languish for the purple           "

4                      SEA-SIDE         STUDIES.
Indeed,   I  languished for the sea with a sort of zoological
calenture.      Ill health was but a minor pretext            ;  the major
pretext was an ever-accelerating desire to become more in
timately acquainted with the organisation of marine animals,
as an aid in those        researches    in General Physiology which
commenced       some   twenty years ago, and had for the last six
years become a passion.
     The sea was an old playfellow            of mine, and from boy
hood our friendship           had been continually heightening.          It
 is almost needless to add that, like most boys who live on
 the coast,   I had early visions of being a sailor         ;   to be a tar
 seemed the culmination         of all earthly ambition   !    Indeed, as a
 preparatory training to that high aim, at nine years old                 I
 declined to wear gloves, and secretly chewed bits of cigar, in
 guise of a quid, as an evidence of nautical qualification.            The
 tobacco was horrible,         but manliness at nine years old dis
  dains nausea, and     I   " stood " to my quid with the unflinch
  ing resolution to be afterwards shown in standing to my
  guns.    To rehearse the intensely nautical flavour of my dic
  tion at that period, and my fatal accuracy in all technical
  terms, is beyond my power.            Enough for the present to say,
  that whatever else      I  learned of the   sea, I learned little of its
  inhabitants.      Star-fishes and jelly- fish could not fail of being
  observed.     Crabs are hunted and tortured by all amiable
  boys  ; and the bone         of the cuttle-fish duly prized.          But
   in regard to its marvels and its inhabitants, the sea was a
   new acquaintance to make.            Mr  Gosse and others had made
  marine zoology fashionable.          The Aquarium at Regent's Park
   had given glimpses       of the wonders and the beauties which

                               ILFRACOMBE.                                  5
abound on the shore           ;   and as a student of Comparative
 Anatomy,      I  had been led to read extensively respecting the
 structure    and functions        of marine animals        ; but of direct
knowledge       I  had next to nothing.           I  had done something
with ponds and their inhabitants, and was now desirous of
ransacking the sea.
    Ilfracombe was the spot fixed on, and a more charming
spot England could hardly furnish.                At first I knew not how
much of the delight with which its beauty thrilled me might
be owing to the mere               effect   of comparison and novelty.
After the metropolis, any broadening blue of                   sea, any bold
headland or straggling reef, seems supremely beautiful — and
novelty is in itself an integer in all travelling enjoyment.
But familiarity only            served     to deepen my        sense  of the
beauty of Ilfracombe        ;   the very last look was taken with a
reluctance springing       from unsatiated desire           ; and on reach
ing Tenby, also a charming                spot,  the overpowering       sense
of disappointment assured                me    that  Ilfracombe     was   the
enchantress       she  had seemed.           I  will not describe      Ilfra
combe, and for two reasons             :  First, it would occupy all the
chapter    ; and, secondly, which          perhaps is as good a reason
as    the other,    I  have     no descriptive       power.      Had   I  the
power, the picture would              be tempting,      for the charms of
the place are manifold.             The country all round is billowy
with hills, which rarely seem to descend into valleys.                   The
paradox may move your scepticism                  ; you may bring excel
lent reasons, physical, geological, and geographical, to prove
that wherever there are hills there must be valleys.                  Never
theless, the abstract force of what must                 be  vanishes before

6                              SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
the concrete force of what is ; and at Ilfracombe you                                             will
find hills abounding, hills rising upon hills, but not always
making       valleys.          What the French picturesquely call the
mouvement du terrain, which suggests                                         hills in motion like
the waves, is here seen on every side                                    ;       and these waving
slopes      are    in springtime pale with primroses, or flaming
with furze.             If   you get sight of a bit of earth to vary the
verdure,     it is of that rich red-brown marl which warms the
whole       landscape.              If    you climb           one        of        those hills,   the
chances      are that you come upon a rugged precipice sheer
over the      sea,      unless a green slope leads gently down to it.
These breezy hills, and the soft secluded valleys (there are
valleys), and the matchless lanes which intersect the land
with beauty, afford endless walks                                 of varied delight.              The
lanes      of Devonshire are celebrated                       ;   but what Shakespeare's
works are to the criticisms which celebrate them, these lanes
are to their reputation.                       Were     I   to enter one               of them, and
begin describing              it,   we should never get down to the shore,
whither    I      see   your impatient footsteps tend.                                 To the shore,
then   !   and as we pass, we can take                        a    glimpse of the town.
    Handsome the town of Ilfracombe                                 is       not   ;   nor, although
picturesquely placed,                    has   it   a   very picturesque appearance,
except under certain lights,                        and from certain points.                      The
colour of the houses                     is   pale dingy grey                ;   the lines are all
rectangular and mean.                          Overtopping               the whole town in
ugliness and pretension, no less than in altitude, are two
terraces, which              make two factory-like                      lines of building on

                      ASPECTS OF ILFRACOMBE.                            7
   Yet, as      I   said, there were    lights under which the town
looked well       ;  but what   will not light transform into beauty    ?
One evening, after a shower,             I was called away from the
Microscope to look at the town under the light of the set
ting sun, some peculiar arrangement of the clouds, with a
vivid rainbow, having thrown a delicious evening tinge over
the houses piled on the sides of the hill, and merged                the
ugliness of their forms in exquisite floods of colour.           In this
light Ilfracombe looked handsome.               It  looked resplendent,
like a stupid man in the splendour of a noble            deed.
   If unblessed        with the fatal (but agreeable) gift of beauty,
the little town of Ilfracombe, as a compensation, is uncursed
with the appearances          of pretension.     Except on those two
unfortunate terraces,         it gives itself no airs of fashion, no
demure hypocrisies         of respectability.    It  has no magnificent
hotels   ;   it has no popular preacher.      It  makes nobody miser
able.   Simplex munditiis ; a plain face, but clean and honest,
sirs  !    I   was continually     reminded of some small German
town, and the simple honesty and obligingness of the people
helped the resemblance.            As we enter from the Braunton
road,   there is a white-washed inn, now untenanted, of the
most primitive structure, and bearing the words
                              BRAUNTON     INN,
painted in tall brown letters, all along the frontage, which            I
never passed without some vague reminiscence of Germany
rising up, so exactly does this turn of the road repeat many
turns of road          I have   come upon    in my wanderings.       An
avenue of mountain-ash, with their bright red clusters bril

liant against the hot blue sky, or rows of plum-trees with
their purple fruit, pleasing the eye and refreshing the palate
during the dusty walk, would have made the illusion com
plete.
    Let us pass this inn, and turn up the steep hill, on the
summit of which stands the handsome church           ; we then de
scend the slope which leads to the Baths.         On the other side
 of the hedge upon our left rise the soft uplands, and a little
behind them the majestic Seven           Tors, which    with their
shaggy heads towards the       sea,  and their soft-swelling slopes
 of green towards the land, remind us of some mighty animal
which has reared itself on its fore-paws to gaze at the yet
mightier ocean.      From these uplands you perpetually hear
the cry, day and night, of the landrail — just like the creaking
of a wicker-basket — so that you begin to wonder when that
unmusical bird takes its repose.         On your right hand, the
clear Wilder-stream     babbles   incessantly to the wild-flowers
nodding over its ripples.       Accompanied by this music we
reach the Baths, and come upon a tunnel, dark, indeed, but
with a gleam of light at the end — so we enter.          How cool,
not to say cold    ! The eye is getting familiar with the dark
ness when we emerge, and what a          thrill runs along all the
sentient paths to our souls as the blue of the sea bursts upon
us  !  We lean upon a parapet of rock to watch the waves
running up the rugged face of the cliffs, and falling back in
spray.    An inarticulate   gasp    does duty for the highest elo
quence.    It  is enough to drink in with our eyes the scene
before us  ;  anything more than an incoherent exclamation
would be out of place.     Another tunnel invites us      ; through

                     THE COAST-SCENERY.                                   9
it  we pass, and come upon a wooden bridge over-arching                 an
ugly-looking spot bearing the name of Tracy's Cave, which
has of course its devout legend to tell,          if you are willing to
listen.   Let the legend be what it may, the place is grim,
and at first we tread cautiously as we pass over the bridge of
logs  ; but soon familiarity reconciles        us to this — as   it does to
small-pox or the income-tax.           Before reaching this spot we
have come upon another opening, leaned upon another para
pet, and had another gaze          at the sunset gleaming over the
sea.    We now step on the wild and rugged shore.
    And what a shore      !   Precipitous walls and battlements of
rock rise on each side, making a bay           ; before us, sharply-cut
fragments of dark rock start out of the water for some dis
tance.    Every yard of ground here is a picture.              The whole
coast line is twisted and waved about             into a series of bays
and creeks, each having a character of its own            ; and whether
we stand on the Tors, and look along the coast — or on the
shore, and look up at the rocks,        it is always  some new aspect,
something charming for the eye to rest upon.
            " An iron coast and angry waves,
                You seem'd to hear them climb and full,
              And roar, rock-thwarted, under bellowing  caves,
                Beneath the windy wall." *
    The rock is grauwacke or clay-slate, with occasional streaks
of quartz,   and the stratification        is very various.       Look at
that reef, round and along which the stealthy tide is crawling             ;
see how the back       of it is ridged with sharp sudden lines
cutting against the sky        ;  or look at that sombre precipice

over which the gull is floating broad-winged, uttering                            its
piteous cry, or startling you with its strange mocking laugh.
A    little farther and the eye rests on a purple-tinted wall of
rock, from the sides of which                jut   ledges covered       with vege
tation.      The soil here is so generous, that nature seems to be
bursting into life through every crevice and on every inch.
     There     is,   however, one serious drawback at Ilfracombe                  —
the complete absence of sands whereon to loll or stroll, or, in
the quiet hours of moonlight, to wander nourishing                             one's
middle age sublime with the fairy tales of science and the
long results of time.                However,         sands   are poor hunting-
grounds    ;    let us take consolation in that, and enjoy the
positive excellences of this place.
     The evening of my arrival was spent in reconnoitring                        the
coast     and its promises.              What     a   flutter agitated me as     I
bent over the many rock-pools, clear as crystal, and some
times enclosing perfect              landscapes       in miniature.      It   seemed
as   if
      I   should have nothing to do but stoop and fill my jars
with treasures        ;   for
                           I     had read in numerous books descriptions
from which the inference was, that nothing could be easier
than collecting " marine store."   " You stroll
                                                along the
beach and pick up so-and-so,"                is   the pleasant phrase of these
writers, wishing, we must suppose, to make science appear
easy.     Now the truth should be told.                   It was     quickly forced
on my conviction that, although after                         a   gale you may go
down to the shore and find many things, mostly dead, which
you   will carry       home      with interest — for " 'tis an ill wind that
                                    "—
blows nobody molluscs                     yet hunting         among the rocks     is
not easy, nor always             safe,   nor certain to be successful.          You

must make up your mind to lacerated hands, even                    if you
escape bruises, to utter soakings, to unusual gymnastics in
wriggling yourself into impossible places.               You   can only
do this at certain tides.        And, after all, you may return
empty-handed, unless you are very modest               in your desires.
 I  did, indeed,     behold a stout gentleman, who had been
reading   Mr    Gosse,   severely deluding   himself into the idea
that he was "collecting," because he was gasping among
boulders with a pickle-bottle in one hand and a walking-stick
in the other   :  but  I am not   firmly persuaded that he carried
home much worth his trouble.
   Let  me mention the proper equipment         for a day's hunting,
and you   will   see that the pickle-jar and walking-stick        theory
is primitive,    and somewhat inefficient.       It    is necessary     to
take with you from London, or any other large town, in or
near which you may live, a geologist's hammer (let              it   be  of
reasonable size), and a cold chisel     ;  to these add an oyster-
knife, a paper-knife, a landing-net, and,         if   your intentions
are serious,   a small crowbar.       We now go to market for a
basket.     It   must    be  tolerably  large,   and flat-bottomed.
Having made that small investment,              we turn into           the
chemist's and buy up all the wide-mouthed                phials he    will
sell us — those used for quinine are the best        ;  but as he pro
bably   will only   have two or three to sell, we must take what
we can get.       The short squat bottles, with wooden caps, now
sold for tooth-powder, are very convenient.              We lay hands
on half-a-dozen of these, and having laid in three or four
earthenware jars (not to be too abstract in our diction, let us
frankly say jam-pots), we return home to construct our

12                            SEA-SIDE         STUDIES.
collecting-basket, which is done in this primitive fashion                             :
A loop      of string serves to keep a large jam-pot at one end of
the basket,     at the other end another loop sustains a large
phial   ;   at one side a loop is made for hammer and chisel                           ;
opposite are two more phials.                     Mr   Gosse, in his    Aquarium,
I   think, describes the basket he uses                 ;   but as you must order
this to be made for you, my plan is sufficiently serviceable,
and costs       no trouble.           The basket ready,               we are       now
equipped.       No      ;   there is still one little implement.               A   piece
of brass wire, the end twisted into a ring of two or three
inches diameter, to which is fastened a canvass bag, makes a
convenient little net to be used in pools too small to admit
the landing-net.
     The brief note in my journal which records the results of
my first visit always amuses                  me when         it   catches my eye      :
" On the rocks.             Found some Actiniae and Serpulae."                     The
idea of finding Serpulae              will    make      even the amateur smile
as he remembers             how difficult     it is to avoid        these swarming
Annelids,     whose         shells,   sharp    as lancets,         cut the hands in
fifty different places before many stones are turned                       ;   but to
my inexperienced eye there were only the empty shells of
Serpulae     to be found, until           I   came upon some           in the water
with their little fans expanded, and these were pounced on
with great eagerness.             The Actiniae spoken of were the com
mon Smooth Anemone — not even the Strawberry variety —                                (if
you   will   face   a   long name,      it    is   Mesembryanthemum)           —and
these which    I    bagged       with great glee,       I    soon learned to pass
by with no more regard than                  if   they had been sea-weed.            So

because       they are abundant, and do not demand                       the chisel.
Perverse, ungrateful             human nature      !       What should we not
think of daylight, or of woman's patient love,                      if it   were not
given with such generous abundance                     ?       Ask the prisoner, or
the man who has scarcely known the mother's ceaseless ten
derness,       the wife's surpassing love.                 The coquette       knows
this by instinct, and she draws adventurous seekers after her.
What     a    coquette     is   the Daisy    (Actinia bellis), who displays
her cinq-spotted bosom, beautiful as Imogen's, in the crystal
pool.      You are on your knees at once               ;   but no sooner     is   your
hand stretched towards her, than at the first touch she disap
pears    in   a   hole.    Nothing but chiselling out the piece of rock
will secure her       ;    your labour   is   the price paid for the capture,
and the captive           is   prized accordingly   ;   if     as much labour had
been given to the Smooth Anemone, she would have seemed
as    lovely in your       eyes.
      There   is   something sad in the fugitive keenness of pleasure.
I    shall never feel again the delight of getting my first Actinia.
No rare species can give that peculiar thrill.                           There    is   a
bloom on the cheek which the first kiss carries away, and
which never again meets the same lips.                             No partridge        is
worth the first which falls by your gun                    ;   no second salmon        is

will revive within            me that flutter which deprived me                 of all
coolness and presence              of mind, as first     I   saw the long grey
serpent-like tentacles of Anthea cereus waving to and fro
in a clear pool           ?   Who will restore the enthusiasm of that
moment when my eye first rested on a clump of Clavelince
(Plate
         I.,   fig. 4), almost as translucent as the water in which
they stood         ?    And wherefore, three       weeks      afterwards, could
I    not be induced to stop and pick up either of these, unless
of very magnificent pretensions              ?     If   nature were not more
inexhaustible than man's curiosity, we should come to the
end    of our hunting pleasures in             a   few years.        As   it    is,   our
lifetime      is   too brief.
     If these      first thrills    can never come back to us, there                   is
ample compensation in the new vistas which                               open    with
increasing knowledge            ;   the first kiss may be peculiar in its
charm, but as the years roll on, we learn to love more and more
the cheek on which we first found little besides that charm.
Knowledge              widens, and changes         its horizon       ;   and as we
travel, we pass under newer skies lighted by serener stars.
In    direct contact with Nature we not only learn reverence
by having our own insignificance forced on us, but we learn
more and more to appreciate the Infinity on all sides                             ;    so
that we cannot give ourselves up to one small segment of the
circle, no matter how small, without speedily discerning that
life piled on life would not suffice to travel over this small
segment        of   a   segment.       And yet the very immensity of the
world of Life           isa   source   of encouragement.            Compared with
what     is   accessible to us, the knowledge,               even    of the wisest,

with what           is     to be known, we compare               our knowledge with
our previous ignorance, the rapidity of progress becomes the
keenest motive              for endeavour.           A    few months at the coast,
under proper conditions,                    will make      us acquainted        with all,
or almost all, the principal forms of life                      ;   and where so much
is   still to be observed,                 each may hope to contribute               some
thing new to the general stock, and thus all be benefited.
     A very         few days of resolute study sufficed to substitute
definite ideas for that haze which necessarily overhangs                              mere
book knowledge, and repeated failures helped to educate both
eye and mind               in the art of finding animals, and of identifying
them.          At    first, not only did      I     frequently mistake sea-weeds
for polypes, but instead of filling jars and phials with                              ease,
as anticipation             had prefigured,        I   often came home with very
meagre results — and this in                   a    place abounding         in treasures.
The truth            is,
             one has to learn many little details about the
animals — where to look for them, how to see them when
there, and how to secure them when seen — before one's basket
returns home well stocked.                         Luck   is   something, of course        :
if   there     is   only one bunch of              sea- grapes      (eggs   of the cuttle
fish) thrown on shore, only one person can bag it.                                   But   it
is   the knowingest hunters that are the luckiest.                           They know
how to profit by good fortune.                         You may perhaps be inte
rested    if
           I        sketch    a   day's hunting, and into            it   condense    most
of the details, the knowledge of which may abridge your own
labours, and increase your success on taking to the sport.

molluscs, we must not be far from low-water-mark.                                            The
morning is brilliant.              A light       breeze carries the large clouds
over the lazy blue, tempering the heat                         of the sun         ;   and    our
spirits are high, as we clatter through the tunnels on to the
shore. There are three              of us   ;   and as we pass that young lady
seated on a ridge, sketching Hangman's                             Head, she eyes us
askance, and although politeness keeps                         in the secresy of her
own bosom the translation of that look,                       I   know how            it would
run in the vernacular : " Well ! how                        people can make them

my word,     a   guy of the first water.           I    know one when            I     see one,
though I     can't describe female costume.                       Her complexion was
dubious, not to say spotty                  ;    and from      it   stood        a    nose   not
aquiline — to tell the truth,               it   was    a   turn-up,   — and probably
some subtle sense of harmony made her                             turn up very much
the sides of her stone-coloured felt hat, which, with its float
ing ribbons and feather, may be said, in painter's phrase, to
have
      " carried off" the nose. also remember the three

flounces of her Manchester muslin, and                        a    general appearance
of flying ribbons and miscellanies.                     If
                                                        I     allude to the personal
appearance       of this future mother of good but not handsome
citizens,   it   is   because her criticism of us forced us to consider
from what pedestal of elegance we were regarded.                                      Not that

                                   OUR    COSTUME.                                17
I    insinuate      any idea of our not having looked somewhat
queer.         Our costume was but indifferently              adapted      to the
drawing-room,            and would have obtained small suffrage                   on
the Boulevard des Italiens, the Prater, or Pail-Mall.                        You
shall judge.        We are a lady and two men.               The lady, except
that she carries a landing-net, and has taken the precaution
of putting on the things which " won't spoil," has nothing
out of the ordinary in her costume.                     We are thus arrayed         :
a wide-awake hat             ;   an old coat,    with manifold pockets in
unexpected         places,       over   which    is slung a leathern        case,
containing         hammer, chisel, oyster-knife,            and paper-knife         ;
trousers warranted not to spoil             ;   over the trousers are drawn
huge worsted stockings, over which again are drawn huge
leathern boots.           Mine are fisherman's boots, and come a few
inches over the knee.               The soles are well nailed, which is of
material service in preventing our slipping so much on the
rocks.         Now these boots, with the worsted stocking peeping
above,        are not,   it is true, eminently aesthetic.            I   will not
recommend them as objects for the                       Journal    des   Modes;
but   if      you consider the imperfect success which will attend
any hesitation as to walking into the water, and through                      —
                                                                            it,
or   if   you reflect on the very mitigated pleasure of feeling the
water trickle into your boots,             — you will       at once recognise
the merit of such boots            as
                                    I    have   just described, covered with
liquid india-rubber, and well greased.                  Never mind the inele
gance     :    handsome    is    as handsome     does   !
     In   this costume we wooed the mermaids.                     We brought      a
crowbar, to turn over the heavy stones which could not other

under such that rarities           will be hidden.     It is nearly half-
past eleven, and the tide          will   have quite run out in half an
hour or more.         We ought to have been here a little sooner,
but there is still nearly two hours' opportunity before us—
so,   to work     !   Over these jagged rocks we spring, stride,
scramble,     and crawl.         Whew   !  there was an escape    !   This
fucus is so slippery and treacherous           : had it not  been   for the
well-nailed soles,       I  should have perhaps tumbled into that
gully,   —and     as the height is six or seven feet, the       fall could
not have been soft.           The mere suggestion has made me a
little nervous, and        I  begin to doubt whether these cockney
legs were meant for such progression, and whether the right
 man is here      in the right place, — when the shout of " Here's
 a  Crass !" banishes all reflections, and in a flurry of scram
bling I clamber to the spot.
    " Where ? Let me see it."
    " In that pool."
     " I  see nothing."
     " That is because      I   disturbed him.     He has drawn in his
 tentacles, and covered himself with a coating of stones, mud,
 and mucus      ;   but take off your coat, tuck up your sleeve, and
 you will feel him at the bottom.             Got him ?"
     " I feel
              nothing but a fleshy lump of something, with small
 stones on    it."
     "That's the gentleman !"
     " He seems
                     very small."
     " Now he's                                                          —
                     shut up   ;  but if you  had seen him expanded

                       CHISELLING ANEMONES.                                 19
    " There    !   Don't place   it too near him      ;   give him room —
an inch all round.          Not too hard   1  Never mind the tough
ness    of the rock — clay-slate isn't made of butter             ;  but with
patience and steady blows                What    !   you've rapped       your
knuckles instead of the chisel?              Well, it does fall out so
sometimes.         While you are hammering,           111   try elsewhere."
    Accordingly       I am left stretched on a sloping ledge, lean
ing into a pool of about a foot deep, where                 I   have to bang
away at my chisel,         not in the least seeing the effect of my
blows, for the crumbling of the rock has made the water the
colour of a London          gutter.    From time to time            I pull my
chisel out, and feel with my hand to ascertain progress.
At    last a piece of the rock comes away,             and    I bring up the
Anemone named Crassicornis —a very ill-favoured gentle
man, to judge by his present aspect            ;   but    I  throw him into
the    jar of    sea-water,  in full reliance on what he will be to
night or to-morrow.           He has cost me twenty minutes' hard
labour     ;  but he was worth it.
    If   you     are   anxious to know       why all this pains was
 taken to chisel away the rock, you may learn a curious fact
 — namely,       that these Anemones, like Achilles, are invulner
 able, except      in one spot.     They   will    bear an extraordinary
 amount of cutting and tearing            if you keep their base un-
 lacerated.        Not only have      I  cut off portions of them for
 microscopic examination, as you would cut buds off a tree,
 but, while       I  write this, there are several of the exquisite
 little Auroras and Venustas which have been cut or torn
 in half by the          splitting of the stones            on which      they
  rested,    and each half is as vigorous as            if  nothing had in
  terfered with its integrity.          In the     course     of some weeks

no one      will   be able to trace in them that they have been
wounded.           The Abbe Dicquemare relates                 how he cut an
Anemone in two, transversely               :   the upper portion at once
expanded        its tentacles,      and began feeding        ;   in about two
months tentacles           began to grow from the cut extremity                of
the other portion, and thus he got two perfect Anemones                        in
place    of one.         And yet these animals, so indifferent                 to
wounds, rarely survive a slight laceration of their base.                     At
least the Crassicornis,          or coriaceous anemone,            does not.    I
have not experimented in this way on the other kinds, and
will limit my statement to the Crassicornis.                        This is the
reason     why a chisel is necessary             for the   " Crass" clings to
                                             ;
the rock      with a vigour which generally defies finger-nails               —
unlike the Anthea or the Mesembryanthemum, which yield
to a very     light fingering.
   I   have got my prize, but have so disturbed the water                    that
it is  useless to remain longer by this pool.                There are plenty
more.       I  poke and peer into them           without result, till at last
a huge     wall of stone rears itself in my path               ;  and  I  suspect
the other side is rent with fissures, rugged with ledges                       of
promise.        It  is   so.   I   squeeze   into one of these fissures,
where various coloured              Sponges,    compound Ascidians,          Ser-
pulae, and Algae,        with drops of water pendent from their tips,
are   just discernible through the darkness.                  In   vain  I strain
my    eyes,   now familiar with obscurity             ; nothing tempts me.
The Sponges         and the Rednoses squirt water at me inces
santly   ;  the Algae drip, drip, drip           ;  sporadic Crabs trundle
away in all directions            ;   but nothing       solicits    my desires.

able to most of those marine animals we are in quest of are
Darkness               and Depth of water.               They are impatient of the
light, and prefer darkness even to many fathoms. When                                   I say
they,     I       mean most Molluscs,                 Crustaceae, Annelids, and Zoo
phytes.             Jellyfish seek the light, and float at the top of the
sunny sea              ;    but we shall find none of them to-day, so that
fissures, caves, and the under side of boulders, must be our
fields.           It       is well for the young hunter to bear in mind this
requisite of darkness.                      Let him turn over all stones, peer
into all fissures, push aside the overhanging Fucus, or long
waving Oar-weed, and                       see   if   the pools beneath do not con
tain what he seeks.                       And when        I   say look,    he must not
understand                  thereby a careless          casual   glance,    but a long
deliberate scrutiny.                     He must allow the eye to rest long
enough on the spot to lose the perplexity occasioned                                    by a
hundred different details, and must let " the demure                                   travel

just climbed up                      a ledge,    and looked      down into         a    pool.

just swallowed                      a small fish,     and is now, while digesting,
opening its arms for more.                        And there, on the green broad
leaves of the Ulva, crawl two Sea Hares (Aplysice).                                         (See

them slugs which had been troubled with absurd caprices
of metamorphosis, and having first thought of passing from
the form of slugs to that                of hares, changed          their weak
minds, and resolved on being camels; but no sooner was
the hump complete,             than they bethought them that, after
all, the highest thing in life was to be a slug — and so as
slugs they finished their development.                 Not, however, with
out further caprices, since, instead of filling its mouth with
teeth      to grind its vegetable food, the Sea                    Hare    trans
poses    its teeth into its stomach, or rather into one of its
stomachs,       and not the one nearest            the mouth, but the last
 of the series, as        it passes into the intestine          ; so that after
the food has undergone preparatory digestion,                      it has to be
further       ground      by these teeth.         This strange animal, as
 harmless as a butterfly, carries a traditional                   terror to the
 vulgar mind.          The Romans believed — what would they not
 believe    ! —that     the mere sight of         it caused sickness, some
 times death       ;  and pregnant women were especially warned
 against it.       Apuleius happened to have a curiosity about this
 animal, for which he was accused                    of magic.*       On every
 coast the fishermen who happen to know anything about the
 Sea Hare (and they know very                little of animals they do not
 sell), assure      you of its poisonous qualities          ; and the bright
 purple fluid      it throws out, when irritated, although perfectly

Whenever you find one crawling on the sea-weed, or left

Few molluscs                 are so easy to dissect               ;    and the attention of
anatomists            will profitably           be directed to              it,   because several
errors are stereotyped in our treatises,                                    which prove that,
since Cuvier, few have minutely examined its structure.
  But to return to our hunt.                              We place these Sea Hares in
a small     jar by           themselves,           and quickly add thereto                   a      broad
white ribbon of tiniest beads, which                             is   coiled up against the
under side of the ledge, and which we                                 see   with joy to be the
spawn of the                Doris —another            sea slug,       if    a   name so         ugly as
that can properly be applied to                             a    creature so attractive.

in the summer                    air.    The longer we look, the more beauties
and wonders we discover.                           I   have      just detected an Asci
dian * standing up like                         an amphora            of crystal, containing
strange wine of yellow and scarlet                           ;   and crawling about the
root of that Oar-weed,                        I     see    various Annelids of great
beauty     ;     we must have the root — the more so that                                    it     bears
some       Botryllus clustering round it.                             You want to know
what   is      that jelly-like globule no bigger than                             a   pea   ?I      can't
answer     ;     but probably the ovum of some fish.                                  At    any rate,
the rule       is    to carry home whatever one does not know, and
identify there,             if      possible   ;   so pop the globule into                      a   phial.
Having made this haul, we may now begin to hammer away

for the Gem.                  There, he is all safe in the jar, and we get
down from our ledge much richer than we got up.                                       It     was a
good find that pool, was it not                          ?     We had been upwards of
an hour peering about,                        without finding anything except a
Crassicornis ; and lo                    !   we come upon a little pool not two
feet    in length, which yields us enough to occupy a month of
careful study.
     The tide is fast flowing                       in, and our jars are still                 half
empty.           We must waste no time in talk.                             Here, give me
the landing-net           ;    I   see       a fish worth        having.        Bravo    !    he is
in the glass jar, and looking at us with strange human look,
not in the least abashed                       by our admiration.               Did you ever
see    anything more exquisite                      ?     It   is a ribbon-fish, but not
the Gymnetrus Banksii.                         It   cannot be more than two inches
and a half long, and a fifth of an inch high                                ;   and note how
the caudal fin, instead of being a climax to the tail, as in
other fishes, forms a delicate                           ridge running          all down the
back.  What a delicate Quaker brown the colour                                          is,    and
how the transparency of the tissues allows us to                                        see     the
pulsating heart       !       I      hope we shall be able to keep                    it     alive   ;
it   will   be the cynosure of our collection.
     Meanwhile one of our party who has been ferreting every
where,      is   now crouching in               a   pool, and presently calls to us
to come and         see   a        Terebella.           (Plate   VII.,   fig.   1.)   In three
rapid strides        we            are there,           crouch down, look where he
points, and see — nothing.

    Whereupon my companion, tucking up his sleeve, plunges
his hand into the mass of sand and shells, and strews the
handful on a boulder, where we soon find the worm twisting
itself into irritated convolutions, as if highly disapproving of
this treatment.       We pop him into a phial with some sand,
and he soon makes himself happy there.                During this capture,
 quick female eyes have discerned, and nimble fingers have
 delicately secured, one of the loveliest of sea-charmers               — an

must call it a tail, although anatomists call it a foot), and
with rows of pink papillae on its back, forming the most
elegant of ornaments (Plate           II., fig. 1.)    The tide may now
 drive in as fast as    it will, we shall go home rich.

     Wearied        with hammering, clambering, and stooping in
this blazing sunlight of a summer noon, we seat ourselves on
a convenient boulder,              for half-an-hour's        repose.   My   com
panion, whose legs are lolling in a shallow pool, brings out

past we do ample justice   (as detestable writers with unerr
ing unanimity             always say       when      they    want to describe
eating and drinking),                and then the blue lazy curl of a
mild havannah rises into the warm air, making contentment
more content.             The waves are crawling over the boulders,
and rushing up the gullies with a soothing sound.                        A   few
white sails         dot the blue breadth before us.               Out there on
the strip of sand in the creek, a row of lazy gulls, motionless
as stones, and looking             like them, seem as if they too were
resting from their hunt.                 A     sense   of pleasant weariness
gives its dreamy calmness               to the scene.         We are silent, or
wander into idlest chat, as               if   we had fairly reached         that
land
                      "   Wherein it seemed always afternoon."
It   was enough that our glance should fall upon the stealthy
sea,   and follow wave after wave as each grew out of the
swell and ran along, a curling line of foam, to plunge upon
the shore.          We wanted nothing more.                 There is a peculiar
charm about the sea            ;   it is always the    same, yet never mono
tonous.       Mr     Gosse      has well       observed,    that you soon get
tired of looking at the loveliest field, but never of the rolling
waves.       The secret, perhaps, is that the field does not seem
alive   ;   the sea is life-abounding.            Profoundly mysterious as
the field     is,   with its countless forms of life, the aspect does

not irresistibly and at once coerce the mind to think of sub
jects mysterious and awful—it carries with it no ineradi
 cable associations of terror and awe,       such as    are  borne
 in every murmur of old ocean—and thus is neither so
 terrible nor so suggestive.    As we look from the cliffs, every
 wave has its history;        every  swell keeps up suspense
 will it   break now, or   will it melt into that larger wave?
 And the log which floats        so aimlessly on the wave, and
 now is carried under         again, like a drowning wretch,—
 is it the fragment of      some ship    which has struck miles
 and miles away, far from all help and all pity,            unseen
 except of Heaven, with no messenger        of its agony to  earth,
 except this log which floats so buoyantly on the tide?         We
 may weave some such tragic story, as we idly watch the
 fluctuating advance of the dark log ; but whatever we weave,
 the story will not be wholly tragic, for the beauty and
 serenity of the scene are sure to assert their influences.       0
  mighty and unfathomable         sea!   O terrible  familiar!    0
  grand and mysterious passion!     In thy gentleness thou art ter

baskets, and      with belated strides hasten over ridges out of
harm's way.        Our return home brings us on to the Capstone
Parade, where our appearance must of course stimulate quiz
zing.    If that   young lady with the sketch-book, who saw us
going out, made private reflections on the imperfect elegance
of our costume,      I   leave    you to judge of the impression we
                                    " swell " with a tele
produce on the mind of that haughty
scope, and a mustache of recent growth.                      He has come to
Ilfracombe with apparently no other object than that of set
ting his mind seriously to these things            :   he   will array himself
in a straw-hat with a pink ribbon, a coloured shirt,               a   shooting-
jacket never meant to shoot in, and thus arrayed he will
show himself and his telescope.               The telescope is indispen
sable.    He will never use        it,   but he borrows from     ita    nautical
air, which   is   quite the right thing, you know.            I   wish I   were
just enough acquainted with that young gentleman to bow
to him —  I   would do     it    in sight of the whole Parade.            As we
pass along, the staring excited by our incongruous                       appear
ance of dirt, damp, and utensils, suggests ludicrous reflections
on the way we all judge of each other, and more serious reflec
tions on the utterly foolish disposal of time which the majo
rity of sea-side visitors make.
     History proves that we English are                a    magnificent race   ;
but  I   appeal to every one whether the concrete                Englishman
he meets abroad, or at the sea-side,            in the least represents his
idea of that magnificent race.                I'm afraid we are disagree
able to the backbone.            At the     coast we are all dismal as      well
as disagreeable.         What an air of weariness hangs over almost

on the beach, their first two or three hours' "sail," from which
they return looking very green — after they have seen the
sunset once, they relapse into utter novel-reading.           Not only
do they here read more novels than at home, but they are
content to read the novels no one reads at home.                Look at
that young gentleman who has brought two volumes with
him to the Parade.        He finds the place so dull that he must
read even when      in the open air    ; yet when at home he has
not the reputation of a severe student        ; he is not known       to
read at his meals, or burn the midnight          oil ; he is rather a
stupid young gentleman,        if  the truth be told, and eyes us and
our jars with measureless                                   " what the

 sense of

days   ;   who enjoyed his dinner at the hotel yesterday, though
the port was fruity       ; enjoyed his breakfast this morning        ;
and now, having read the paper, is sniffing the breezes for an
appetite, and is aglow with the pleasant sensation compounded
of present vigour and boyish associations.          He is too old for
the circulating library     ;  has outlived straw-hats and coloured
shirts   ;  and is supremely indifferent      about telescopes.    He
is happy.       He gives  a genial glance of interest to everything.
He stops us, and politely inquires about the contents of our
baskets, listening to the       brief details with " dear me ! bless
                                       "
me   !   well, how very singular !       and even thinks he should
like to go out collecting himself, — if he were younger.
   If the    promenaders    are not supremely interesting, the scene
itself is worth a visit.    The Capstone Parade, a walk cut round
the Capstone at great expense, offers many pictures.          We are
at the farther end, nearest the quay, and look back upon old
Hillsborough jutting out far into the water, while behind him
looms the giant Hangman, grim as his name, and beyond that
the purple line of another headland.           Between us and   Hills
borough stands       Lantern Hill, a picturesque mass of green
and grey, surmounted by an old bit of building which was
once a convent,     and which looks as      if it were the habitation
of some huge mollusc that had secreted its shell from the
material of the rock.         Indeed the houses all about naturally
recall the curious shells and habitats with which our hunting
has made us familiar.          In these mountainous districts, where
houses and clusters      of houses look so tiny in comparison with
the huge limbs of Mother Earth, one is apt to think of man
as a parasitic animal     living on a grander creature— an epizoon

nestling in the skin of this planetary organism, which rolls
through space like a ciliated ovum rolling through a drop of
water.   In  flat districts a town looks imposing         ;  even a single
house   raises   its head with haughtiness.           There is nothing
around to rival    it in height, and from it we may fondly imagine
earth our pedestal         But our thoughts are otherwise when we
see the house lost on the broad side of a noble             hill ; and still
more when, from a little distance, we           see a number of houses
clustered on the side, clinging        to it like   so many Barnacles
clinging to a rock       ; we then begin to think of our family
resemblance     to all other building, burrowing, house-appropri
ating animals.        In vain does our pride rebel at the thought
of consanguinity        with a mollusc     ;   the  difference between
Brown,    with the house he built, and Buccinum, with the
shell he secreted, lies in the number of steps or phenomena
interposed between the fact of individual existence,               and the
completion of the building.         Brown is aghast at the sugges
tion, and says he hates         metaphysics.       This much he will
perhaps admit, namely, that whatever other advantages                   our
habitations may have over those of insects and molluscs,               it is
clear they have not the advantage             in architectural beauty
subservient to utility.       Consider man from a distance — look
at  him as a shell-fish — and it must be confessed that his
habitation   is surprisingly ugly.        Only after a great many
                                               "
intermediate " steps or phenomena                 does he contrive to
secrete  here and there a Palace or a Parthenon                 which   en
chants the    eye.
   While thus moralising we have reached our lodgings, and
another work begins.           Our treasures must be displayed,

 and, where needful,     identified.    The animals are to be kept
 alive, their wants attended to, and their habits watched,
 that we may form some idea of their theory of life, before
 we dissect them to learn something of their structure.                 Jars
 and phials are emptied into soup-plates of sea-water,                   pre
 vious to a general distribution into pans and vases.                      A
 glass tank is very elegant, but expensive.           It   is ornamental
 in a quite other style than that of wax-flowers, gorgons in
 old china, or dark specimens of the Bad Masters, which by
 many are supposed      to enliven apartments       ;    but   if  you in
 tend to keep animals for study,          I think a glass tank on
many accounts less desirable than several glass vases, which
 are inexpensive and portable.       I  had no tank, and of course
never thought      of transporting     it to Devonshire.             Up to
 this time my Aquarium had been              constituted by finger
glasses,   tumblers,   and glass sugar-basins         ;   these     sufficed
 for the produce of fresh-water          ponds;   but now, on the
 eve    of cultivating    the   more    imposing      acquaintance of
 marine inhabitants,      I adopted    a friend's  advice,        and laid
in a store of glass jars of formidable dimensions — jars such
 as confectioners use to contain sponge-cakes,              almonds, &c.
 These made an additional hamper to my luggage,                    and the
 "glass,   with care," increased my anxiety not a little.                   I
 cannot enumerate the extra sixpences         it cost me to impress
 on porters and railway guards the inherent frangibility of
 glass.    I  made   myself   a   torment to all officials by the
 impressive emphasis       of my anxiety.       And,       after all, the
jars were almost worthless.           Experience        flatly  and per

I quickly discarded all but the smallest,           and bought half-a-
dozen glass jars of nearly a foot high, which have proved
very serviceable.       When an animal dies, and the mortality
is great,  it is  easier to discover and remove the corpse,             and
change the water from a small           jar than from    a tank  :   more
over,   in jars you can keep           your    animals   separate   ;   and
animals are not more amiable to each other than men                   ; the
strong devour the weak without any religious scruples.                   To
the jars   I  added shallow earthenware          pans, for Actiniae, and
some animals which the Actiniae would not molest.
   Our day's produce fairly sorted, the work of identification
begins.      It  is not enough        to know     that we have got a
Polype, an Eolis, or an Annelid before us            ; we also desire to
know what species of each          ;  and this is sometimes        a  work
of long and troublesome investigation,             because  even     if the
species is not one hitherto          undescribed, we may have great
difficulty in identifying it by descriptions.             This tries the
patience, but     it exercises the faculties, and greatly sharpens
knowledge by forcing attention upon details.
   And here a word respecting the books you ought to put
in your box.       For reading, properly so called, the naturalist
has  little time while at the coast       ;   but certain books    will  be
constantly referred to.         All the   books on Natural History,
or Comparative        Anatomy,       you    can  buy,   beg, or borrow,
will  be found of use      ; but if your portmanteau refuses the
burden of many volumes,           it is well you should know what
will  be most serviceable.        First, then, as indispensable, there

 among Weale's series of Rudimentary Treatises.             If you   can

 and Hancock's     " Nudibranchiate     Mollusca," you      will  be set
up.      I say nothing  on works    of Histology or Comparative
Anatomy, because,      if your  studies lie in these directions,
you     will already have     possessed     yourself     of what       is
necessary.
     And now, when all is done, the Microscope is taken out,
and severer studies begin.     The hours     I spent thus, fled like
minutes, and left behind them traces as of years, so crowded
were they with facts new and strange,          or  if not absolutely
new, yet new in their definiteness,      and in the thoughts they
suggested.      The typical forms took possession of me.           They
were ever present in my waking          thoughts    ; they filled my
dreams with fantastic images     ;   they came in troops as        I lay
awake during meditative morning hours          ;  they teazed me as
I   turned restlessly from side to side at night         ;  they made
all things converge towards them.         If I   tried a little relax
ation of literature, the page became a starting-point            for the
wandering      fancy, or more obtrusive       memory      ;   a  phrase
like "throbbing heart" would detach my thoughts from the

 subject of the book, and hurry them away to the stage of the
 Microscope, where the heart of some embryo was pulsating.
 I could   not look at anything           intently, but the chance was
 that some play of light would transform itself into the image
 of   a mollusc or a polype.           The things         I  have seen in

    This intense absorption in one study was wrong, and I
tried to vary my employments ; but intellectual passions are
 not obedient to abstract convictions ; they will exert their
jealous exclusiveness.

 countrymen.       I  utterly declined to look at the Times.
 What cared    I about Palmer and his trial             ?  or about the im
 pending    quarrel with America?                As much       as the stock
 broker   towards    the close        of 'Change,        or the Opposition
 member during the vote of confidence,                 would care for your
attempt to interest him in the " extraordinary little organ
discovered this morning         in the tail of a tadpole — quite un
 suspected by anatomists,        I   assure you."
    I  admit this was exclusive — say narrow,                if you will.    I
had really interest in little but what the Scalpel and Micro
 scope would    disclose.    Everything was new to me, so that
every step was delightful.          When       I discovered what    had long
been known      to others, the pleasure of discovery was some
thing essentially different from that of mere learning                ;   and
when    I was fortunate     enough to discover what had not been
known before, the delight in novelty was heightened by the
triumph (surely not a guilty one            ?)  of amour propre.      Three
months of such study were worth years of lectures and read

ings — although the lectures and readings were necessary
preparations for the full benefit of such study.         But thoughts
of "benefit" are after- thoughts ; —the real incentive to work
is passionate     fondness     for the work itself;      and   I  know
nothing     in the shape of intellectual activity which        I would
exchange for a long day         with the Microscope.       This feeling
is beautifully indicated by M. Quatrefages,           in that page of
his Souvenirs      d'un Naturaliste in which he describes his
residence    on the  little archipelago of Chaussey, where none
lived besides himself and a few fishermen.            At   night, when
the songs and the disputes        of the fishermen gradually lapsed
into silence, and nothing could be heard but the murmurs of
the   sea, he sat  down at his square deal table, covered with the
produce of his day's hunt.            There he sat, before a Micro
scope which opened to him the          world of the infinitely minute,
his pencil sketching the novel forms, his pen hastily tracing
the result of his observations.        And thus the night advanced,
till, with fingers so benumbed that he could no longer hold
the scalpel, he crept into his bed as the fishermen were leav
ing theirs.      The passage is too long to quote, but the reader
can    seek   it in the charming book itself, the work of              a
naturalist   — which    means, an enthusiast.
    Of  late years the Microscope has not only become             indis
pensable     to the scientific student,       but a delight      to the
amateur.        Nevertheless     certain popular    errors still deter
many from its employment            ;  and now that    it is no longer
the costly instrument       it  used to be, those errors should be

will   be found even among microscopists.            On evidence    the

         ERRORS CONCERNING               THE MICROSCOPE.                   37
most conclusive,        I  deny the accusation.      My own eyes, un
happily made delicate by over-study in imprudent                    youth,
have been employed for hours daily over the Microscope
without injury or fatigue.          By artificial light, indeed,     I   find
it very trying      ;   but by daylight — which on all accounts is
the best light for work — it does not produce more fatigue
than any other steadfast employment of the                eye.   Compared
with looking at pictures, for instance,               the fatigue     is as
nothing.       Nor should any uneasiness          be felt at the muscos
volitantes, which may be observed             for the first time after
using the Microscope.             Few eyes are altogether without
them, and      it is erroneous to attribute them to the Micro
scope, because they may not have been previously observed.
The student should early learn to keep the unoccupied eye
open, not to     screw~   it up, and distort his countenance,      because
the sight of other objects confuse him.             In  a  little while he
will learn to attend only to the eye looking through the
Microscope ; and his studies will be greatly relieved thereby.
    It is further said that microscopic observation is apt to be
 very erroneous,        and that we can     see   whatever we wish to
 see.   Undoubtedly         men often do see what they want to see,
 and what no one else can recognise.               But this is not the
 fault of the instrument.          So far from the Microscope being
 in itself deceptive,        I maintain   that  it is   less so than the
 unassisted eye       ;  and for this reason    :  all vision is mainly
 inferential; from certain           appearances      certain forms        are
 inferred  ;  this holds of the eye as well as of the Microscope,
 the optical principles of which are essentially the same              ;  but
 while the physical conditions are similar, the mental con

38                     SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
 ditions attending vision with the assisted and the unassisted
eye are different.    The microscopic observer is on his guard
against fallacies of interpretation which seldom suggest them
selves to   him when observing with the naked eye        ;  and this
 critical caution makes him not only less rash in interpreting
appearances,    but makes him anxious to verify interpretations
by other means.      If the  contradictions of observers be cited
as a   proof of the deceptive nature of the instrument, what
shall we say to those manifold and persistent contradictions
of anatomists using their unassisted eyes?           But in truth,
the controversies of microscopists have rarely turned upon
simple facts of appearance,      they have     been almost wholly
questions of interpretation.
    The scientific Naturalist will not content himself with
Observation, however cautious and patient          ;  to it   he will
add what may be called the great mental instrument, Experi
ment, the instrument by which we verify the accuracy of our
observations and conclusions, and by which Nature is inter
rogated.     Experimental   Physiology is in its infancy    ;  which
is another way of saying that the science of life is in its
youth.     Sciences begin  in casual observation, and systematic
reasoning.     Careless of facts, men are then careful in logic.
They build elaborate structures upon shifting sand.            After
wards arrives the epoch of doubt       ; men become aware how
illusory is the reliance on reasoning, be it never so logical,
unless the data are exact, unless each step has been verified.
The scrutiny of facts becoming more urgent, Observation
ceases to be casual and careless   ; a cultivated caution takes its
place, and conclusions are tested less by      their logical coher-

ence than    by their verified dependence        on   verified facts.
Now the most puissant instrument            of verification is the
Experimental   Method which, by a process of elimination and
exclusion, directly interrogates Nature.
   You thus perceive that time is not likely to hang heavy
on our hands,  while at the coast     ; there is enough to do and
to enjoy.    Dr Johnson      said that he who would acquire a
pure  English style must give his days and nights to Addison.
I  have some doubts whether the prescription            is likely to
be  followed, or,  if followed, likely to effect its purpose    ; but
its language may be borrowed to suit my turn.                He who
would learn the exquisite        delights  Nature    has    for those
who ardently pursue her, and would acquire a deep sense
of   reverence and piety      in   presence   of the     great    and
unfathomable    mysteries which encompass          Life, must give
his   mornings    to  laborious   searchings on the       rocks, his
afternoons to patient labour with the Microscope.

In   the previous Chapter,         I endeavoured       to convey some idea
of the charms which the naturalist and amateur may find in
the dark fissures of frowning rocks, the endless occupation
and amusement of clambering over ridges, creeping under
ledges,   wriggling into crevices, or exploring the under side of
boulders, while a summer sun is gleaming over the retiring
sea,   and the white gulls are hovering almost as lazily as the
whiter clouds hanging in the blue above them.                       Above and
around, the landscape         ;  in pools and crevices, the game             ; and
by your side, pleasant companions eager as yourself.                           My
description of these delights may have been thought enthusi
astic by those to whom such pleasures are unknown                       ;  but   in
truth no enthusiasm is adequate, no description can reach the
vividness of reality; the best description is but thin                         and
meagre,      following    beggar-like in the footsteps of Reality.
The language of enthusiasm may serve to convey to others

an impression that the speaker is moved, but             it necessarily
fails to paint the felicitous details which moved him.
   In this    approximative and confessedly incomplete style,           I
will endeavour to        describe something of the delights which
attend the naturalist when his hunting is over, and his home
is reached.      For, understand this    : the naturalist, and espe
cially the physiologist, has a Morrow to his pleasure, whereas
all other hunters have but a fine To-day.             Far be it from
me to underrate any man's pleasure          ;  nevertheless   the most
catholic may discriminate, and         I must   here discriminate     be
tween the sportsman's possible pleasure and my own.               Brown
is excited when he brings down a buck, lands a pike, or re
covers a snipe which has fallen among the reeds.                He has
his day's sport, has proved his skill — to his own satisfaction
entirely proved it     ;  and now nothing remains but to eat the
 produce.      A  dish the more upon his dinner-table — nothing
 but that   !  Not that   I mean  to speak disrespectfully of dishes      ;
 assuredly not of venison, pike, or snipe, well dressed, well
 served,    well wined, and well companioned.               I have    no
 patience with those who pretend not to care for their dinner,
                                                    "
 on the ludicrous assumption that       "spiritual    negations imply
 superior souls.     A    man who is careless about his dinner is
 generally a man of flaccid body, and of feeble mind            ;  as old
 Samuel Johnson authoritatively          said,  "Sir,  a man seldom
 thinks with more earnestness of anything than he does of his
 dinner   ; and  if he   cannot get that well dressed,     he should   be
 suspected     of inaccuracy in other things."         Homo sum,et
 nihil,  &c. &c.    I respect   man, and   all his appetites.      When
 the man is not basely insensible to the hunger of soul, the

the healthier, all the stronger, all the better for a noble
capacity for food — a capacity which becomes noble when                                        it
ministers to a fine, and not merely a gluttonous                                         nature.
Moreover,          I    observe      this     constant          fact,     which      is worth
flinging at the heads of all super-refined superfine spiritual
                                                                           "                "—

namely, that whenever we get authentic details about a great
man, we always find him to have been a generous eater.                                        If
I,    who write this, must confess to being a small                                     eater, I
must also confess to not being a great man.                                        Had nature
willed it otherwise                                but she did not so will it                     ;
and only gave me sufficient sagacity to perceive that dishes
are   in no sense despicable.
     When, therefore,             I think of the       hunter's finale as merely an
extra dish, and pronounce that to be an anticlimax to his
day's work, instead of being, as my finale                                is,   an ascending
crescending culmination of delight, this reflection                                is   not sug
gested by any scorn of eating in itself, but                              is    suggested      by
the obtrusive fact, that eating                   is    at the best
                                                        finite plea            a

great pleasures must possess.                      It      is   vigorous in sensation,
but   it   is    circumscribed       ;   it   throws out no feelers into other,
wider regions          ;   it   generates no thoughts            ;   it   leads nowhither       ;
it   is   terminal.        Therefore,    I     say the finale           of the table      is   an
anticlimax for             a    hunter   ;   unless,    indeed,         he   is    hunting for
subsistence,           and then of course his finale becomes proportion
ately aggrandised.

ment     ;    my finale was not final.           If,   as   a   matter of fact, the
dissecting-table was the scene on which my captures made                              a
last appearance, this last appearance was the end of                            a   long
series       of episodes intermediate between               the capture of prey
and the incision          of the scalpel.         And even this finale was
not, strictly speaking,          a   finis;   for when the last shred of
delicate tissue had been examined under the Microscope,
when various parts of the animal had been made into " pre
           "
parations    for after-study, when everything to the physical
eye may have seemed concluded, no end was reached,                                   no
dead wall        of terminal blankness       ;   on the contrary, the meta
physical eye followed the devious paths of speculation, into
which new facts conducted             ;   and thus the feast of reason and
the   flow of physiology, generated pleasures superior to the
pleasures        of the ordinary          hunter       by quite transcendent
degrees.       I   dined as well as Brown, thanks to my poulterer
and fishmonger.            If   the truth were known, my game was
perhaps better than his.              We both dined,
                          " But oh

   Table for Table, then, finale for finale,                    it   is   clear that my
hunting was superior to Brown's in having                           a   grand climax   ;
butI         had already distanced him by many lengths before we
came         to that winning-post of the table.                     Brown lands his
pike, and carries         it   home with     a   careless ostentation, and an

eyes   follow him through the village.       He stands      on his  lawn
and holds up the fish before the window, to receive the facile
admiration of acquiescent      Mrs B.      And   here his sport ends
till dinner.     Now, although    I carry  home a basket       of marine
animals with none of that effect upon the popular                  mind
(indeed the popular mind is terribly apt to eye my costume
and basket with ill-concealed contempt), and although my
servant can't for her life think what master does with them
things, not she      ;  yet, when Brown      and    I are both     fairly
housed,     his delight runs down like a         clock-weight — mine
ascends    like a windlass.   The amusement of distributing and
 identifying    the animals   I have   already noticed     ; so we   will
 suppose    all that over, and that the fatigues of the day have
 been snored off     with great frankness.     The morrow begins.
    My first thought on descending in the morning is to
 glance    with fond anxiety at my animals.           While the urn
 is musically hissing, and the coffee percolating,           I  am care
 fully inspecting vases and pans, removing a bit of dirt here,
 a decayed weed there,       placing a small stone more conve
 niently there, poking a sluggish Doris (Plate II., fig. 2), to
 assure myself that he is alive, rescuing an Actinia from the
 crowding     propensities of its cousins,    or — sadder office still   !
 — discovering      and removing     those  of my pets who have
 been inconsiderate enough to pay their debt to nature's laws.
 This last is    a very necessary  bit of work, for these amiable
 creatures,    when dead, are capable       of stinking with some
 vigour, and corrupting the water in which their companions
 live.     Breakfast    was always     ready before      I   had fairly
 finished my overseeing,       for the parishes were numerous,

and some of the parishioners            apt to skulk out of sight.
During the pleasant hour of breakfast, and the cigar which
followed,    I  contemplated my treasures with a placid              eye.
Picture to yourself a large and airy room, made out of two,
in an elegant villa:       on the    sideboard stand four or five
glass vases, various in size and in contents         ;  from this the
eye travels to a table, opposite the window which opens on
a balcony sheltered by a verandah            ; this table is covered
with    bottles,   phials, troughs,     microscope,    dissecting-case,
note-book,     &c, all in that state of imperfect order deno
minated higgledy-piggledy.          Three soup-plates occupy the

extreme end of the table,         and,     carry the eye       into the
balcony, where three yellow earthenware pans, and a white
foot-pan mimic, tant bien que mat, the shallow rock-pools of
the shore.      If the eye so carried into the balcony happen to
be in the least a conventional eye — one never so well pleased
as when resting on the elegancies of surface civilisation            — it
is possible, nay,     it is extremely probable, that it will rest
upon these pans with a very mitigated admiration.                Even   I
will  confess they are not     strictly ornamental. Without hav
            "

 on walking up an elegant garden to an elegant villa,             if  the
 eye falls upon yellow       pie-dishes and white foot-pans sym
 metrically    insolent   under    a verandah.     As to Gillow of
 Oxford Street, be sure he would feel his hair turning grey
 at such a sight.      And  I  know many persons of irreproach

 and glad to own me among their visiting acquaintances,              who

 raged.    But look inside my pans and pie-dishes, and if you
 are not pleased    with the beauty of those exquisite animals,
 and those    charming weeds,       I  set  you   down as one who
judges    of books by their binding, not by their contents.
 Observe,   I   do not take my stand on          these pie-dishes.   I
 should greatly prefer a tank, either of glass or stone          ; but
 one can't improvise a tank at sea-side lodgings, whereas pie-
 dishes are attainable.
     From the glimpse just given            of my before-breakfast
 occupation, you begin to suspect          something of what was
 meant by the intermediate episodes between the capture and
 the scalpel  ;  you  see  that the mere keeping and watching of
these animals     will  be a source   of pleasures unattempted yet
 in prose or rhyme.         One gets interested in anything which
 solicits attention,    and in proportion      to   the solicitation  ;
hence our fondness       for animals and children.        Nay, do but
watch     a man    walking round his garden,         pulling out this
weed,    and brushing       off that insect, trimming this branch
and trailing up that cluster, — see what an incessant pleasure
it is to him.        Now deepen this pleasure by a scientific
interest, which makes every detail of manners, and every
newly-observed       point    of structure, the starting-point     for
fresh speculation, and you        will form  a faint idea of what it
is to keep pans and vases full of animals.
     You doubtless know the Hermit-crab,              by naturalists
named Pagurus         ?   Unlike other crabs, who are content to
live in their own solid shells, Pagurus lives in the empty
shell of some mollusc.          He looks fiercely upon the world
from out of this apparently inconvenient tub, the Diogenes

                             THE HERMIT-GRAB.                                  47
of Crustacea, and wears an expression of conscious yet
defiant theft, as       if   he   knew the rightful owner of the shell,
or his relatives, were coming every moment to recover                          it,
and he, for his part, very much wished they might get it.
All    the fore part of Pagurus, including his claws,               is   defended
by the solid armour of crabs.                 But his hind parts are soft,
covered only by          a    delicate membrane, in which the ana
tomist, however, detects shell-plates              in   a   rudimentary con
dition.      Now   a   gentleman so extremely pugnacious, troubled
with so tender          a    back and continuation,         would fare ill in
this combative world, had he not some means of redressing
the wrong done him at                birth; accordingly           he selects   an
empty shell      of convenient       size,   into which he pops his tender
tail, fastening on by the hooks on each side of his tail, and
having thus secured his rear, he scuttles over the sea-bed,
a    grotesque     but philosophic           marauder.           You ask how
it   is   that this tendency to inhabit the shells of molluscs
became organised            in the hermit-crab?         Either we must sup
pose      that the crab was originally so created,—designed with
the express      view of inhabiting shells, to which end his struc
ture was arranged;            or—and this     I   think the more reason
able      supposition—that the hermit-crab originally was fur
nished with shell-plates for the hinder part of his body, but
that these have now become rudimentary                      in   consequence   of
the animal's practice of inhabiting other shells,—a practice
originally resorted to, perhaps, as           a refuge from more powerful
enemies, and now become an organised tendency                     in the species.
     Be this as    it   may, the hermit-crab       will not live long out
of an appropriated shell;             and very ludicrous was the scene

48                      SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
I  witnessed between two taken from their shells.               Selecting
them nearly equal in size, I dropped them,              " naked as their
mother bore them," into a glass vase of sea-water.              They did
not seem comfortable, and carefully avoided each other.                   I
then placed      one   of the empty shells (first breaking off its
spiral point) between them, and at once the contest com
menced.        One     made    direct  for   the shell, poked into       it
an   inquiring claw, and having satisfied his cautious mind
that all was     safe,  slipped in his tail with ludicrous agility,
and,    fastening on by his hooks, scuttled away, rejoicing.
He was not left long in undisturbed possession.                 His rival
approached with strictly dishonourable intentions             ;  and they
both walked round and round the vase, eyeing each other
with settled malignity, — like Charles Kean and Wigan in the
famous duel of the Corsican Brothers.                 No words of mine
can describe our shouts of laughter at this ludicrous combat,
—one      combatant      uneasy    about his     unprotected    rear,  the
other sublimely awkward in his borrowed armour.                   For the
sake    of distinctness,     I will take   a  liberty with two actors'
names, and continue to designate            our two crabs as Charles
Kean and Alfred Wigan.                C.  K,     although   the blacker,
larger, and stronger of the two, was at the disadvantage of
being out of his shell,          and was slow in coming to close
quarters    ;  at last, after many hesitations, approaches,           and
retreats,     he made     a rush behind,       seized  the shell in his
powerful grasp, while with his huge claw he haled Wigan
 out, flung him discomfited aside, and popped his tail into the
 shelL     Wigan looked piteous for a few moments, but soon,
 his  "  soul in arms and eager for the shell," he rushed upon

 his foe  ;  and then came the tug of crabs           !     C. K. had     too
 firm a hold    ;  he could not be dislodged.        I   poked his tender
 tail, which      was    exposed   through the broken shell, and he
 vacated, leaving      Wigan once more in possession.           But not for
 long.    Once more       Wigan was clutched, haled out, and flung
 away.     I then placed a smaller shell, but perfect, in the           vase.
 Kean at once quitted his dilapidated roof, and ensconced
 himself in this more modest cottage, leaving Wigan to make
 himself comfortable in the ruin         ; which he did.
    The fun was not over yet.           I  placed  a  third hermit-crab
 in the vase.       He was much smaller than the other two, but
 his shell was larger than the one in which Kean had settled,
 as  that unscrupulous crab quickly perceived, for he set about
 bullying the stranger, who, however, had a shell large enough
 to admit his whole body, and into it he withdrew.                    It was
 droll to   see  Kean clutching the shell, vainly waiting for the
 stranger to protrude enough of his body to permit of a good
 grasp and a tug       ;   but the stranger knew better.           He must
 have been worn out at last, however,           for although      I  did not
 witness the feat, an hour afterwards, when            I  looked at them,
 I  saw Kean comfortable         in the stranger's house.        I  changed
 them again     ;  but again the usurpation was successful.               On

by constant defeats that he is thrown into a fluster                 if even
an empty shell is placed near him            ; and although without         a
shell himself, which must make him very cold and comfort

for his nerves   :  one must almost question his perfect sanity;
he is not only beside        his shell, but beside         himself.   The
approach of C.       K. throws him into           a trepidation,    which
expresses   itself in the most grotesque efforts at escape."
   I  tried a new experiment.         Throwing a good-sized whelk
into the vase,     I  waited to    see    Kean devour the whelk in
order to appropriate his shell         ;   for the house he last stole,
though better than the previous houses, by no means suited
him.      Mr Bell, in his History of British Crustacea, conjec
tures that the hermit-crab often eats the mollusc in whose
shell he is found — a conjecture              adopted by subsequent
writers, although     Mr Bell owns that         he never witnessed the
fact.     My observation flatly contradicted             the conjecture.
Kean clutched the shell at once, and poked in his interroga
tory claw, which, touching the operculum of the whelk,
made that animal       withdraw and leave an empty space, into
which Kean popped his tail.              In  a few minutes the whelk,
tired of this confinement in his own house, and all alarm
being over, began to protrude himself, and in doing so gently
pushed C.     K   before  him.    In vain did the intruder, feeling
himself slipping, cling fiercely to the shell          ;   with slow but
irresistible   pressure   the mollusc         ejected  him.     This was
repeated several times,    till at length C.     K.  gave up   in despair,
 and contented himself with his former shell.              Thus, instead
 of eating the whelk (which,         I    may remark in passing, the
 crab never does, even in captivity,            where food is scanty),
 he had not even the means of getting him              out of his shell,

                    MANNERS         AND MORALS.                         51
and the conjecture of our admirable naturalist must be erased
from all Hand-books.
    These traits of manners and morals pleasantly vary our
graver observations      :   but  it is only with the higher organ
isms that we can be so amused;                  the lower organisms,
although they have their manners and their morals, are too
far removed from us to be intelligible.           I have  no doubt the
mollusc is a moral individual, but you cannot consider him
one greatly impassioned        ; an oyster or a limpet probably has
his theory of life   :  but you cannot appeal to his finer sensi
bilities through the medium of music, poetry, or painting.
 I have some doubts even         of the crab in these regions of cul
ture   ; but  if he cannot soar so high as         Art, we    see  how he
 touches the confines      of Wit by his feeling for the Grotesque.
 Fish, too, are funny, and far more educable than people sup
 pose.    Your fish has a sense of the proprieties        ;   he will even
 condescend    to conventionalism in costume.           At    least, one   I
 had at Ilfracombe did so.          A  queer little dolphin-like fellow
 he was, who, after swimming           about the vase for some time,
 would sink to the bottom, and there, curling his tail round
 him, as a cat does when making               herself comfortable, he
 would look up with his impudent unabashed               eyes, and pant
 away, as   if fatigued with     his gambols.      This curling of him
  self whenever at rest was very comical, and he looked                as if
 he knew it.     When    I  had him, he was in full black — evening
  costume  ;   but on descending         next morning       I  found him
  arrayed  in an entire suit of light brown — cool morning
  summer costume      ; in the afternoon he again presented him-

  52                     SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
  self in full black  ;  and the next morning he was dead.            I
 grieved for him, and, as a consolation—dissected him.
     This was my constant solace, when       I  found-as, alas! I
 often found—that some of my pets had departed.                   The
 zoologist softened, the anatomist was resolved.           I had lost
 a pet, and gained a "preparation."      Grief gave way under the
 scalpel.    Science dried afflicted eyes.     Nay, shall    I confess
 it?    Many a time     I have had the unfeelingness to eye a pet
 with an undertaker's glance, almost wishing it would die, for
 the sake of its corpse.       And when this     was the case, you
 may be sure      I bore the announcement of mortality with
 something of that fortitude displayed by legatees when a
choleric old gentleman, or a lady of starched and vigorous
virtue, departs this life, leaving a trifle   in the   3°/U.    Death
was no finale to me.        The closing scene was only the close
of an act, after which the curtain rose once more, the drama
culminating     in interest.   A  thousand problems assailed the
mind, a thousand strange thoughts arose           as  I   penetrated
deeper and deeper     into the mysteries of these various organ
isms, and mused upon their many paradoxes.            Here was an
animal without a heart      ; there, one without a liver—nothing
but quantities of hepatic cells distributed along the course of
the alimentary canal. Here was an animal breathing by means
of his legs   ; and here one not breathing at all.      Here was a
mollusc with its intestine passing through         its heart; here
another with teeth in its stomach      ; and here an animal (the
Phy8alia) digesting its food before swallowing it—that is to
say, performing     the act of chymification before the act of
 deglutition.    Here was an animal of two sexes, and here one

of no sex at all, — or, more correctly speaking, of the female
sex only, the male being non-existent.                    But the most piquant

or gills, of a fish, lives a lazy life at the fish's expense, and
the male lives upon her as she lives on the fish (not unlike
some disreputable males              of the human species), and this male
is himself infested with parasitic Vorticellae, so that we find
parasites of parasites of parasites !

             And  these again have other fleas, and so ad infinitum."
    Paradoxes like these — and they might be indefinitely multi
plied — titillate curiosity, but they do not form the real attrac
tion of our studies          ; they excite a smile, or a passing wonder
ment, which is as nothing compared with the deep, abiding,
almost awful sense of the mystery and marvel of Nature.
The crowning glory is the knowledge which ever opens into
newer and newer vistas, quickening our sense of the vastness
 and the complexity of              Life.     For it is eminently the             case
 with these studies, that they intensify and exalt our concep
 tions of the incommunicable grandeur and infinity of Nature.
 Many eloquent pages have set forth the effect produced upon
 the  mind by the study of Nature, the enlarging influences of
 contact with and contemplation                    of her phenomena,           so  dif
 ferent from the fleeting fashions and miserable pretexts of
 much that passes as civilisation,                  so   full of rebukes to our

foolish pride and pretences         ; so full of lessons to us to be in
earnest,     and to trust in simple earnestness.           But although
contact with all reality          must necessarily have       something
of this influence,      I  should say, speaking from my own expe
rience,   that this is true in quite another sense to those
minds familiarised         with the phenomena of life manifested
by the simpler          organisms.      Here the Microscope is not
the mere extension of a faculty,             it is  a new    sense.      At
some     distance from the Alps we discern their masses of
purple grandeur, but that is all we discern           ;  on approaching
nearer, these purple         masses assume      shapes more and more
definite, although        their varied architecture is still hidden
from us    :  we see none of their ravines and valleys          ;  a  little
nearer,    and we detect these, but discern none of the chalets
nestled in the valley, or scattered         over the mountain-sides         ;
nearer    still, we    see  the habitations, and the cattle,     and the
men    ; yet nearer,     and we discriminate individualities         ;  but
we have       still to advance, and patiently watch, before the
tragedies and comedies acted in these scenes can become in
telligible to us.       Thus with each step we have changed our
conceptions of the Alps.          Thus with each step do we change
our conceptions of Nature.            We all begin, where most of us
end,   with seeing things removed from us — kept distant by
ignorance and the still more obscuring screen of familiarity.
We then learn to observe something besides these broad gen
eral outlines which constitute the scenery of our existence, and
learn to admire the magnificence of Nature.             The observation
of one detail is      a step  to the recognition of many.         In this
stage we resemble the traveller who has discovered the                Alps

 to have valleys and habitations.           If the  Microscope be now
 placed in our hands,      it brings     us into the very homes        and
 haunts of    Life; and finally, the high          creative    combining
 faculty, moving amid these novel observations,            reveals some
 thing of the great drama which is incessantly enacted in
 every drop of water, on every inch of earth.            Then, and only
 then, do we realise        the mighty       complexity,     the infinite
 splendour of Nature     ;   then, and only then, do we feel how
 full of Life, varied, intricate, marvellous, world within world,
 yet nowhere without space to move, is this single planet, on
 the crust of which we stand, and look out into shoreless
space,   peopled by myriads           of other planets, larger, if not
 more wonderful, than ours.         And if with this substitution of
definite and particular ideas for the vague generalities with
which at first we represented Nature — if with increase of
knowledge       there comes,      as necessarily     there must come,
increase of reverence,        it is evident that the study of Life
must of all studies best nourish the mind with true philo
sophy.
   The facts are the least of the attractions in this study,
although they are the bricks with which you build.                 If you
happen to be of a speculative turn, every fresh observation
will start new trains of thought.           Walk up to my working-
table, and take the first phial or trough chance may present.
You have     chosen a phial     in which a quantity of thread-like
worms are wriggling like uninspired Pythonesses.                 You are
mistaken in supposing them to be worms, — they are nothing
of the kind   ;  they are not even individuals.        In spite   of your
stare, I repeat the statement       :  they are not individuals, they

56                                SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
are organs.            Why then do they live and wriggle? and of
what are they organs                   ?    The first question is easier to ask
than to answer.                  The second is as easy to answer as to ask                   ;
so,    like an adroit teacher, who evades difficulties to drop with
confidence        on what is easy,              I   will answer it.       In the   preced
ing Chapter          (p.   24)I    recorded with some minuteness the find
ing of      a   Terebella buried in the sand, its long thread-like
tentacles waving in the air being all that was visible, until
it    was dug up.             Those tentacles              are what you have         in the
phial before you.                  While examining the worm,                 I   observed
that one of its tentacles had been torn off, and was wriggling
with independent vivacity                      I
                                               :        bethought me of trying how
long these organs would live separated from the body                                   ;   so,
cutting them all off,             I        placed   them in this phial.         This was
on the 21st         May       ;   on the 25th some died             ;   but to-day   is    the
27th,       and there are still several vivacious.                           What would
your friends, who constantly compare                              the vital mechanism
to    a   watch or     a   steam-engine,            say to this    ?    The main-spring
was broken long ago                    ;    the watch        is   in shreds, yet are its
wheels as active as ever.                     Do you not perceive the error of
the       analogy   ?       Do you not              see    that every part of      a   vital
organism must be vital, having its own vital properties, and
being, in       a   certain sense, independent of the whole, although
also dependent             on     it
                                   ?
      Nor    is   this by any means                 a   solitary instance.     Even those
physiologists who compare the organism to a mechanism are
familiar with hundreds of facts of independent vitality.                                   The
one       just cited    is,   however,        one of the most remarkable           I   have
observed, on account of the length of duration.                              The other day

I   was examining one of those white filaments which certain
Actinice copiously throw out when disturbed.                                 The filament
is nothing but a delicate                   membranous tube covered with
vibratile cilia, and enclosing,                  I    believe, a       still more delicate
tube, filled with granules and those thread-capsules which
anatomists declare               (erroneously, as           I   shall prove hereafter)
to be the urticating or stinging cells.                         Such is the structure
of this filament, which, although                      it had long          been removed
from the animal, was twisting and twirling itself like a
worm in an unhappy state of mind, and moving across the
stage    with motions it was impossible to distinguish from
voluntary          motions.       I   then crushed              it into many minute
fragments      ;    but long afterwards                I    observed some of these
moving about like so many animalcules.                                   Another day         I
observed      what seemed a tiny white annelid crawling                              at the
bottom of a vase             ;   on securing          it,
                                                       I    found      it   was one of the
Actinia's filaments.
    It   may be answered                  that this motion was not life               :    in
both cases         it   was only ciliary action.                   But do not let us
cheat ourselves           with phrases.          What        is   the motion of early
embryos but ciliary action? and what                              is   explained by the
phrase?             see    movements             as     spontaneous as those               of
animals   ;
            I I     see   these movements so directed that obstacles
are avoided        ;    and you want to put me off with                         a   phrase.
Where then does life begin                   ?       In that foot-pan you            see   a
dozen lovely            Medusoe,          swimming          to and fro with their
laborious     pulsating movements — are those                            movements the
finger-posts        of vitality       ?    Well, then, now attend               :   yester

the exquisite      fringe         of     tentacles which              hangs from the
border of the disc,           I    observed         every       one   of these polyp
like tentacles     move       to and fro, now protruded, now with
drawn into the substance                 of the disc, each with indepen
dent action, and this on a portion                         of the disc which had
been    many hours separated                   from the animal.           The fringe
does no more       when the animal is vigorous on the warm
surface   of the tranquil sea             ;    it   does no less now that the
animal is in shreds.               Look in that saucer, and you will
observe      the fragment of another Medusa ; the animal                              is
dead, and almost melted away.                        I   have already cut out two
of the ovarial chambers, yet you                         see the   oval tentacles are
twisting about as if seeking prey.                       This is not ciliarity, but
contractility.     This is life, unless you restrict the term life
to the meaning       it carries in its highest formula.                       If   it is
motion,   it is vital motion.
     Can motion, alone, be taken as the index of life                         ?     Cer
tainly not.      But let us try to be precise in our language.
Life is a complex term, indicating complex phenomena.                                In
its highest formula, expressing all the requisite generality of
what is included in the term,  it indicates the triple unity
of Nutrition, Reproduction, and Decay.    An animal grows,
reproduces, and dies      ;       these are the three capital and cardinal
facts   of its organism.            Out of these issue many derivative
and secondary phenomena,                      one   of which is Motion.              In
some    animals, motion            can        scarcely     be    said   to have     any
existence.     The Ascidians, for example,                       although of rather
complex structure, have nothing which approaches                            it,   unless
we should so designate              the occasional           contraction and       clila

 tation of their two orifices.        We may therefore conceive Life
 without     Motion, and Motion without Life            ;  and thus, with
 some plausibility,     ask whether the movements exhibited by
 the tentacles of the Terebella           and Medusa ought to be
 received as indications        of life ?  Here     I get myself into a
 fix.   The thought arises that what           I   observe in these ten
 tacles is owing to a surplus residue          of vitality, retained by
 them, not to any central source of self-renewing vitality,
 such    as  the organism possesses        ; consequently, inasmuch
 as   these    tentacles   neither     grow,    nor    reproduce    them
 selves, they    fail to fulfil the primary conditions of Life         ; in
 other words, they are not alive, in spite of movements,
apparently spontaneous,           during  a whole week        of indepen
 dent existence.
    In  arguing with oneself, one has always a respectful anta
gonist, to whose objections every attention is given.                Hav
ing given due attention to myself,            I   now turn round upon
 myself, and remark with some emphasis                :   Very true  ;  but
 you overlook the important fact that in speaking of Life as
the triple unity of Nutrition, Reproduction, and Decay, you
are speaking of the whole organism               ;  whereas    in the ten
 tacles of Terebella and Medusa,             we were considering an
 organ, not an organism         ; and to apply your definition to an
organ, would be to deny its vitality altogether. The animal
cannot      be   considered as wanting       in either of the triple
terms    ;  but the very essence of an organ is that it special
ises a function     —that    is to say, takes upon itself to do some
thing for the benefit of the whole animal, in return for
which it is absolved from doing many things which the

earliest states of Society, all do everything, each does alL
There is no separate                  digestive system, no separate respira

part of the animal assimilates,                          respires,     contracts, moves               ;
just   as       in barbarian tribes every man is his own tailor, his
own purveyor, his own architect, and his own lawyer.                                             At
last the principle of Division of Labour emerges                                    ;   then that
which is true of the whole organism                               ceases    to be true        of an
organ       ;   and we have no more right to demand that an arm
should digest food, than that Moses & Son should preside
over    the deliberations                of Downing Street, or cook the
Whitebait dinner             ;   we have no more right to ask the lungs
to produce offspring, than to ask                          Mr Cobden to take                   com
mand of the Baltic fleet, and                            Mr Bright to perform the
operation for stone.                  Each no longer does all.                    When, there
fore, we look at these arms                     of the Terebella, which wriggle
after a week's            separation from                  the body, we                 see   them
manifest as much of life as they manifested a week since.
They would grow                  if   they had food           ;    unhappily            they have
lost the power of preparing food, and they die at length
from starvation.
     But put down that phial, and look at this which contains
another and far more beautiful species of Terebella, by name
Nebulosa.           (Plate       VII.,   fig.   1
                                                    .)   It   makes        itself a solid tube
of earth, which it cements by a mucus exuded from its sur
face, and        in this tube, but not attached                      to     it,   the Terebella
lives, merely putting forth its long tentacles into the water.
I    have taken      it   from its tube to watch its beauty and                                  its

  manners.           Professor Rymer Jones, in the last edition of his
  Animal Kingdom,                says,    that     "our knowledge of             these
  animals has been until recently very limited ;" and he adds,
  " the zootomist who should
                                             enjoy favourable opportunities
 of inspecting the larger species in a fresh state, could hardly
 make a more valuable contribution                      to our science than by
 giving an account of the organisation of these interesting
 animals."           My opportunities of observing the larger                  species
 have been         null   ; but having dredged up many of the smaller
 species     off Tenby and Caldy,                I  studied those with great
 eagerness       ;   and although my observations had, for the most
 part, already been included in the more elaborate                           investi
gations       of Milne Edwards              and     Dr Williams,       I  have     yet
something new to offer, little though                   it  be.
    No one,        I  believe, has yet recorded           the fact of the Tere-
bella multiplying itself by the process of gemmation, which

process,     it begins to form          a second head near the extremity
of its body.            After this head, other segments                are  in turn
developed, the tail, or final segment, being the identical tail
of the mother, but pushed forward by the young segments,
and now belonging to the child, and only vicariously to the
mother.        In this      state we have two worms and one tail.                   It

is as  if  a head were suddenly to be developed out of your
lumbar vertebrae, yet still remain attached to the column,
and thus produce a double-headed monster, more fantastic
than fable.     Or suppose you were to cut a caterpillar in half,
fashion a head for the tail half, and then fasten this head to
the cut end of the other half—this would give you an image
of the Syllis budding.      But in some worms the process does
not stop here.       What the mother did, the child does, and
you may see at last six worms forming one continuous line,
with only one tail for the six.     The tail indeed is the family
inheritance    ;  but reversing the laws      of primogeniture,   it
 always descends to the youngest     :  like that elaborate display
 of baby linen which was worked with such fondness for the
first-born, and has become in turns the costume of successive
 pledges, as they appeared on      this scene of life with a con
 stant diminendo of interest     in all but parental eyes. Such,
 in a few words, is the budding of Annelids. I omit differ
 ences, and many curious       details, only desiring to fix the
 reader's    attention   on the cardinal fact.      The separation
 finally takes place, and then we perceive the children and
 grandchildren are not quite the same as their ancestor.        The
 fact has not been     observed at all hitherto     in the group of
 Annelids named Tubicola; yet two of my Terebellaa gave
 me a sight    of it.  The first died before the separation took
 place.     The second, after a day or two's captivity, separated
  itself from its appendix of a baby, and seemed all the livelier
  for the loss of a juvenile which had been literally in that
  condition of "hanging to its mother's tail," which         I have
  heard applied in metaphorical sarcasm to small boys anxious

days.
     This spontaneous self-division of worms is a curious fact,
first observed       and accurately described               by the Genevese
naturalist,     Charles Bonnet, * whose discoveries in reproduc
tion we shall have to consider in a subsequent                    Chapter.          He
found the fresh-water Nais frequently double,                       and saw the
separation take place.             He also cut the worm into several
pieces, and observed          each piece reproduce its head, and grow
into a perfect worm.              One observation he made is worth
repeating here/f            He cut a Nais transversely, but not
entirely     in two     ;  that is to say, the two portions were
held together by a mere thread               ;  in less than an hour after
wards the two were again perfectly united, and no trace
remained of the operation, except a slight constriction, and
an    interruption in the continuity of the vessels and viscera.
This interruption          was very similar to such as he had ob
served    in several worms in their ordinary condition                      ;  and      if
we compare the observation with that made by M. Peltier,]:
we shall       see   that they confirm             each   other.       "In       those
 species," says M. Peltier, "which have a dorsal contractile
 vessel.   in which the course of the nutritive fluid can be
 traced,    we   see   that in proportion              as the     fluid    becomes
 poorer,    the contraction          becomes      feebler,     and is arrested
 at the point where the fluid, having been already absorbed,
 ceases to arrive.          Here we      see   in the middle of the body,
 at the very point where the                nutritive fluid is arrested, a

constriction of the dorsal vessel, and two large absorbing
vesicles    are  formed,       which collect, for the     benefit of the
posterior half of the animal, the aliment no longer furnished
by the anterior half.           As  soon as these vesicles       begin to
act, the posterior       half of the dorsal vessel reassumes its con
tractile movements.            These contractions have their origin
in the vesicles, and have no connection with the anterior
half, nor are they synchronous in their movements                 with it.
In front of     these vesicles     a constriction    takes  place   which
finishes by separating the two portions               into two distinct
animals.      If  one of these be kept alive       in the same drop of
water for some days, the aliment gradually diminishing, the
process is repeated,         and this again may be repeated, so that
six distinct individuals are produced from one, solely by the
deficiency of food, which causes a constriction of the dorsal
vessel."      What an argument in favour of those who main
tain starvation to be a cause of over-population              !   Quatre-
fages has noticed an analogous case in the Synapta.                "Hun
ger is the sole cause of the spontaneous amputations," he
          " It would incline one to
says.                                    say that the animal, feeling
himself unable to find food for his whole body, successively
suppresses those parts which cost too          much."*
    It is right to add, that a very great authority on all ques
tions    relating     to the Annelids — Dr Thomas Williams of
Swansea — emphatically denies the whole of the " fables "ori
ginated by Bonnet, and accepted by all successors.              He says-f-

there is not one word of truth in the statements,                 and he
laughs at Professor Owen for repeating them.              I have    exam
ined the point, as regards the Nais, since reading his denial,
and am at a loss to understand how that denial could have
been made in terms so sweeping.           In the Nais proboscidea
the spontaneous separation is preceded by the formation of a
head,with the unmistakable proboscis        ; as anyone may observe
who will collect a few specimens from a neighbouring pond.
    The  Nais proboscidea is      a convincing      instance, because
the long proboscis may easily be seen projecting                from the
 segment where       the   separation   will take      place  ;   and its
 presence removes     all possible doubt as to the formation of a
new head.        Disposed as    I am to allow due weight to the
opinions of     Dr Williams,   I am surprised to find him saying           :
" The
        tail-fragment never, as can be proved by easy observa
tion, produces a single new ring or segment                of the body.
 If  this be true, how completely improbable               must be the
 statement, that the headless piece is capable of constructing
a new head      !"   No one can read Bonnet's own account of
his    observations    and    experiments,     recorded with         great
 minuteness      and   precision,  without      feeling     considerable
surprise at such a remark.          If  Dr Williams were          correct,
his contradiction      would for    ever throw       a   doubt     on  the
observations      of any naturalist; because if Bonnet is not
to be trusted, on a point so easy of verification, when his
statements are so precise, and his observations            so  numerous
and minute, no one can be trusted.            Fortunately,      however,
Bonnet is rigorously correct.         I  have verified his observa
tions under the impulse of       Dr Williams's denial      ;  and at the

very moment of writing this,                 I  have two Naids        in separate
 vessels,     who      have  reproduced         their     heads   and probosces
 under the following           circumstances.             The two worms were
 first cut in half, the fragments which bore the heads were
 thrown away, and those which bore the tails were placed                        in
 vessels,    with nothing but water and a little mud, in which,
 as   I had scrupulously ascertained,               no worm or other       visible
 animal was concealed.               In    a few days the complete heads
were formed          ; and, what is more, the heads were examined
daily during their formation.                 When the animals were quite
perfect     I   once more cut them          in two, threw away the head-
fragments, and replaced the tail-fragments                      in their vessels.
A    second      time the heads were formed.                  A  third time the
experiment was repeated               ;  and the worms are now lively,
after their fourth          section,      so that before        this passage    is
printed,       I   have little doubt they             will present the fourth
reproduction of head and proboscis.*
    Amateurs are not fond of worms                     ;  nor, until they have
seen Serpulce, Sabellce, and Terebellce expanding and                     waving
their beautiful tentacles in the water, can they understand
why we should take so much trouble to secure them.                           And
yet, apart from their beauty, the worms deserve our study.
Their structure is full of interest.
    Let us for a moment consider their blood.                        That some
animals have red blood, and others blood not red (which
made     Aristotle say that some have blood and others none
at all), you         know perfectly well            ;    but that the worms
   * One died a few days afterwards,      but the other made itself a new head as
before ; it died, however,  after a fifth division.

have blood of various colours, is probably news to you.
Swammerdamm*          was the first who broke down the Aristo
telian division, by showing that the blood of the earthworm
was red     ; and Cuvier extended          this observation to a whole
class of worms, to which he gave the name of Vers                      &  sang
rouge    ; but this was vehemently criticised by De Blainville                   ;
and recent researches,        especially those of Milne Edwards,
Quatrefages and Williams, have shown that a great diversity
in colour exists.        Thus the Sea-Mouse (Aphrodita)                     has
colourless blood   ; the Polynoe pale yellow            ; the Sabella olive
green;     and one species       of Sabella dark red.              But this
difference of colour is trifling compared with the absence                    of
corpuscles from the blood of all Annelids.                  The corpuscles,
 as   you know, are the floating solids of the blood, and on
 them devolve the most important                physiological    functions        ;
 but the blood of all Annelids is entirely destitute of them                      ;
 and   Milne Edwards, in noticing the fact, remarks that this
 liquid resembles the imperfect blood of the vertebrate embryo
 in the early periods of development.-f-
     There is one remark       I wish to make in passing, respect
 ing the colourless blood of the majority of invertebrate
 animals, and that is the proof            it affords of the error, not
 uncommon, in attributing the colouring matter of animals
 to the colouring matter of the blood.             It  is now known that
 the colour of the muscles is due to a peculiar pigment, far
 more than to the blood which is             in them.      It is quite clear

that the purple fluid ejected by the Sea Hare, or the inky
fluid ejected by the Cuttle-fish,      cannot derive their colour
from    colourless blood.      There     are   muscles    in   several
Molluscs   — for instance,  those of the oesophagus      in the Slug
and Water      Snail — which are of reddish hue, yet the blood
of these animals has no colour.         And, as a final argument,
the integument of the Anemones is richly coloured, yet they
have no blood at all.
    To return to our Annelids.        If  we grant that the fluid
hitherto   universally regarded as blood is truly blood, we
shall have to acknowledge that these Annelids               have  two
different kinds of blood   ;  for over and above the fluid which
we see circulating    in the vessels, there is a fluid circulating,
or more correctly speaking,     oscillating, in the general cavity
of the body, and this fluid carries with      it what are called   the
blood-corpuscles.      It consists of albumen and sea water           ;
and is by Dr Williams named the " Chylaqueous fluid," the
simplest form in which blood makes its appearance, distin
guished    from    the "Blood-proper," in not being            a fluid
circulating   in a system of closed vessels, but a fluid which
carries the chyle directly to the tissues.          An image may
render the mechanism intelligible.           Suppose a worm sus
pended    in a phial of water.      Let the worm represent the
intestinal   canal, and the glass   phial represent the external
integument, the water will then represent the chylaqueous
fluid, which moves with every motion of the intestine, and
fills up every cavity made by its motions.         The albuminous
and corpuscular nature of the chylaqueous fluid prove            it to
 be  subservient to the purposes of nutrition.        It   also serves

           TWOFOLD          RESPIRATION OF ANNELIDS.                    69
another purpose, acting as an internal skeleton.                 You  are
surprised       at the idea of a liquid skeleton ? yet you sit on a
cushion     of air, without the least astonishment.           The fact is
positive    :   the Annelid employs its chylaqueous fluid as a
fulcrum by which it moves            ;  let the fluid out, and all power
of locomotion vanishes.
    The two bloods have two methods of aeration.                     The
" chylaqueous fluid" rushes into the lovely tentacles which
in many species wave above the head, and there is aerated,
aided by the action of the cilia which line the inner surface
of the tentacles.        The " blood" is carried to those arborescent
tufts, without cilia, which branch from each side of the head
beneath the tentacles.          But although the respiratory process
does undoubtedly          take place in these organs, yet in animals
so   simply constructed, each organ performs more than one
function.        Let us hear Dr Williams on the tentacles : —
    "From their extreme length, and vast number, they
 expose an extensive aggregate              surface to the agency of the
 surrounding        medium.       They consist of hollow, flattened,
 tubular     filaments, furnished with strong muscular parietes.
 Each of these hollow band-like tentacles may be rolled longi
 tudinally into a cylindrical          form, so as to enclose a semi
 circular     space,  if  they only imperfectly meet.        This inimi
 table mechanism enables each filament to take up and firmly
 grasp, at any point of its length, a molecule of sand, or,              if
 placed   in a linear series, a row of molecules.          But so perfect
 is the disposition      of the muscular fibres at the extreme end
 of each filament, that       it is gifted with the twofold power of
 acting on the sucking and on the muscular principle.                  In

70                       SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
addition to the two important uses already assigned to these
tentacles, they constitute also the real agents of locomotion.
They are first outstretched by the forcible ejection into them
of the peritoneal fluid, they are then fixed like so many
slender cables to a distant surface        ;  and then, shortening in
their lengths, they haul forward the helpless carcass of the
worm."*      The carcass of the worm is by no means so help
less as here   described.       It  is true that the tentacles are
employed to drag the animal along.               You   observe how that
one is crawling     up the sides of the glass, and now hangs
suspended   to the floating weed        : but you may also observe
him wriggling about his body with great activity, and by
these contractions       he is enabled       to make      progress, even
when deprived of his tentacles.
   There is a more serious objection, however, to be made to
the passage   I  have     just abridged.        Dr Williams —in     com
mon with most,      if   not all, anatomists — speaks of the mus
cular parietes of these tentacles.           I venture   to suggest that
there is great inaccuracy in the term          ; and that the existence
of these muscles is a pure assumption, assumed to explain
the Contractility of these organs, in the same way as a
nervous system is constantly             assumed      to explain    some
phenomena of Sensibility, although not a trace of a nerve
can   be detected    by the highest powers of the microscope.
The assumption is in each case perfectly needless, and very
misleading.    It  is against all philosophy thus to assume the
existence  of a tissue no one can detect, to explain a pheno
menon which may be otherwise explained.                 Nor is anything

a phrase.      If I   were to declare               that gun cotton contained
nitre, because gunpowder contains it ; and                             if,   when my state
ment was answered by repeated analyses proving no nitre to
be there, I   were to reply,         "the nitre may not be detected by
your analysis, because          it   is   in   a    diffused state," you would
shrug contempt at such               chemistry.               But this          is    precisely
analogous to what          is   done      daily with respect                       to nervous
tissue.     Men assume that all animals must have nerves                                           ;
if   the nerves are not visible,       it      is   because they are "diffused."
Now, this reasoning         is   not only vicious as logic,                         it   is    par
ticularly vicious in Biology,               where            structure          is    of equal
importance      with composition.                   Nerve         is   a     specific      thing,
having    a   specific composition, and                  a    specific        structure       ;   to
talk of this thing as " diffused,"                  is   to talk of           it   as wanting
one    of its constituent characters                ;   it   is   like talking of fluid
crystals, or square circles.           All      this     Dr Williams,           I     am sure,
would be the first to admit, for he doubts the existence of
nerves even in the Echinodermata                        ;    and  I          would ask him
whether     the tentacles of the Terebella are not assumed to
have muscles,       in accordance with the current notions that
wherever      there   is   Contractility the existence                             of muscles
must be inferred      ?   I   put the question as                  a     question merely.
My own observations utterly failed to                         detect muscular fibres
in the tentacles of the species           I     examined.               On one occasion,
indeed, they presented the aspect of circular fibres, which                                       I
thought     must be the muscles                 Dr Williams                  refers   to   ;   but,
on applying     a   power of 300 diameters, these fibres resolved

 themselves into simple corrugations of the investing mem
 brane   ; and    I  can very confidently assert          that in no single
 species of Terebella which            has fallen   in my way, was there
 the slightest trace of muscle.
     But enough of anatomy for this morning                   !   The lovely
 lanes   of Ilfracombe invite us, and we may cool our over
 heated    brows by a delicious breeze blowing over the Tors                 ;
 or perhaps the noble sweep of Tenby sands seduces us to
 walk to Giltar Point.           A    bottle or two      will   be useful in
 either expedition      ;  a small basket     will   be  worth the trouble
of carriage     if  we take the sands, for there was a gale last
night, and who knows what may have been thrown up by
it  ?   And if you trust to your hands to carry all you may
find, you will, perhaps,         be the
                                           " observed of all observers,"
as   I was, carrying a large Cuttlefish in each hand, while some
                                                                " Them's not
compassionate sailors superfluously assured me,

good to eat, sir        !     Another day       I  transported a Dogfish
through the streets       —much       to the horror of all the flounces,
and the ineffable scorn of all the pink shirts and telescopes.
You may be as indifferent to the stares and the scorns of
flounces and telescopes as         I  was, but    still I  say, out of mere
convenience,      carry a phial,     if not  a basket.      On one memor
able afternoon we came upon, and almost stepped upon, an
adder lying just outside the hedge.                   All is grist to the
anatomist's mill, so        I cut off the adder's head, and wrapped
it in my pocket-handkerchief.                 Presently     we    came to a
pleasant pond, the surface of which, with its varied greenth
of scum, was so full of promise that there burst from me                   a

                         MYSTERY OF A POND.                                73
countryman, taking his siesta by looking                 at  nothing    over
a gate.
                              "
    " Here's a
                   pond     !   I  exclaimed,    when reason        got the
better of emotion.
    " Ah ! "                         companion,      profoundly      sympa
               responded my
thetic.
   The countryman             was bewildered.      Were we insane? or
only Cockneys         ?    There was a pond, sure enough,             and as
dirty a bit o' water as you'd wish to              see ;  and what then      ?
Were     we     frogs     from    the   desert,   that    a  pond     should
agitate us   ?
    While he was cracking this very hard nut, harder than his
own Devonshire skull,           I had emerged from the bitterness of
self-reproach at having forgotten a phial, into the clearness of
triumphant       resource.       Seizing a large dock-leaf and con
verting   it into the rude        resemblance     of a bag,   I hooked    up
with my stick a string of tempting scum, packed                     it up in
the leaf, and walked away wealthy.                To his dying day that
countryman       will recount,      to all who   will listen, the incon
 ceivable fancy of the gentry folks, who carried off the                filth
 of a pond in a dock-leaf.           A queer start, warn't     it ?
    Where shall we ramble          ?   At  Ilfracombe      the question is
really puzzling,         because so many lovely walks solicit           you.
 Go where you will, you cannot miss a lovely walk, that is
some comfort        ;   but there is an embarrassment of riches.
 Towards the close of spring, when the trees are in full leaf,
but still keep their delicate varieties of colour — varieties lost
 in the fulness of summer, to be regained with even greater
 beauty in autumn, — at this time, when the furze is in all its

  74                     SEA-SIDE       STUDIES.
 golden glory, perpetually       tempting one to pluck a tuft of
 blossoms as the largest specimen ever         seen, and scenting the
 air all round, Ilfracombe is enchanting.          So it is in summer     ;
 but the loss of the furze is almost like the fading away of
 the evening red.      Contemporary with the furze is the lovely
 primrose, here seen to perfection, covering the hill-sides with
 pale stars,   almost as plentifully as buttercups and daisies
 elsewhere.     In  such  a season, the walk to Lee seduces         with
 its beauties   of rocky coast and wooded inland hill; or the
woods ofChambercombelure             you into their coolness.     When
the sun is    broiling in cloudless blue, the coolness of a wood,
in which the sunbeams         only nicker through branches, and
elicit all their beauties, forms a pleasant retreat        ; and before
you reach Chambercombe the eye has been delighted with
perpetual landscapes.       There is a lane leading into a farm
yard — a Devonshire        lane,    remember — which          will long
hold a place in my memory.            Close to the gate of this farm
yard there is a spring which is a perfect miniature of some
Swiss " falls." It spreads itself like a crystal fan on succes
sive ledges of the hedge-bank,       until it reaches  a  much broader
ledge, where    it forms a little lake on a bed of brown pebbles        ;
then down it goes again      till it  reaches the road, where    it runs
along a tiny, happy, babbling stream.             One of the endless
charms of these lanes — as of all mountainous districts             — is
the frequency of the springs, glossy with               liverwort and
feathery with fern, making a pleasant music day and night.
Passing through the farmyard, where the pigs wallow, and
grunt sensual satisfaction, and the cows look at you with
bovine stupidity,     you come upon a widening             of the lane,

                        ILFRACOMBE           LANES.                      75
where several      gateways meet, and here the exquisite wild-
flowers, everywhere so abundant, seem more than ever                luxuri
ant.   What a perfect bit of foreground is that           ! A  few rough
mossy trunks lying against the tufts of fern, and a quiet donkey
stretched across the lane in "maiden meditation, fancy free              ;"
it is one  of those exquisite nothings which somehow affect
you more than a fine landscape.              At least it  so affected us   ;
and this was surpassed a little further on, when we came to
a  spot where a brook runs brawling across the lane, and a
wooden bridge allows those to pass who prefer not wetting
their feet.    A    rough hurdle is fixed up where the brook
gushes from the field       into the lane, over brown stones, which
it polishes into    agate.     Against the little bridge rises a tree,
and all round its roots by the brook side are varied tufts               of
fern, and gems of wild-flowers.                 I
                                           How wished to be a painter
that  I                           " bits " as these, and not let enthu
        might sketch such
siasm evaporate       in ohs    !   From this brook a step or two
brought    us to a shabby house,            bearing the reputation of
being haunted, its broken windows                rag-mended.      I  never
saw the ghost     ; but   I  always saw a huge, divinely-awkward
puppy, as happy and affectionate            as puppies usually are.       I
could not get my companions to sympathise with me in my
love  for puppies in general, or in my wish to encourage the
advances   of this one in particular.         Be gustibus.      There are
people who don't       like poetry    ;  there are others indifferent to
puppies.     After   a  valedictory caress to this floppy acquaint
ance, we passed on into the woods,             and while seated under
delicious " umbrageosity,"          I  soothed   myself with a Latakia
cigar, and contemplated a beautiful             caterpillar spending its

76                       SEA-SIDE       STUDIES.
transitional life on a branch, happily knowing nothing of tran
sitions.    Pleasant     was the murmurous          sound of insects,
pleasant   the ripple of water, pleasant the glinting sunlight,
and the broad reposing shade, but above all was the charm
of interchanging     thoughts.       Yes, Nature is very lovely, and
speaks to us    in soothing tones       ; but Human      Nature has a
holier accent still.
     Another favourite walk was to Watermouth              and Berryn
 Narbor, over the edges of majestic cliffs, revealing inlet after
 inlet, each differing in its wealth of colour, each a picture,
 till we                                        " meadows,"
          pass into what are called the                         really a
 noble park, through which runs a stream fringed with wild-
 flowers, and clear   as    crystal  ; every twenty or thirty yards
 the stream falls over an artificial precipice of stones, making
 a dulcet music.     The slopes on each side are richly wooded          ;
 and the sequestered         silence  of this spot adds to its many
 charms.    Who has not felt the deep peace which settles on the
 soul, when one is lying in the long grass beside a stream, under
 a summer sun, no sound of traffic, contention, or care to vex
 or sadden   ?  Who has not sat upon a gate, less to rest than to
 enjoy the peaceful       idleness of noon, and looked upon the
 marvellous forms of life active around him, dreaming all
 the while of pleasant scenes, which revisit the memory, or of
 pleasant hopes rising,         "like exhalations of the dawn."       In
 such   a mood we one day rested            on a gate under the trees
 beside this stream    ;   presently a blind man felt his way also
 to the gate, and rested there.         We spoke to him     ; he told us
 with that sluggish iteration characteristic of the countryman,
that this was a fine healthy spot         .   .  . yes, a very healthy

                             PLEASANT RAMBLES.                                   77
spot        ...        a healthy spot.        And he held down his head               ;
alas   !    it was   useless       for him to hold it erect, fronting the
lovely scene. Saddened by his presence, we soon moved on, and
returning over the cliffs, we came upon another human being,
with eyes closed to the beauty around, but closed in sleep,
not blindness.           A   little girl, not more than eight years old,
was stretched along the path, her rosy cheek                  resting on her
little arm, which rested on the bare rock. How fast she was !
but as Shakespeare says, " Weariuess will snore upon a flint,"
and here        was wearied innocence sleeping on a flint,                      the
summer sun pouring down its rays upon her, and also on
the milk, which stood in a can by her side.                    Whether          the
milk was as much benefited by this rest in the sun on its way
to Ilfracombe, the consumers thereof must say.                     All I    know
is,   that the picture was very touching, and             I   placed   a    penny
in the child's half-closed hand that she might find                         it   on
awaking.         She would think some fairy placed            it   there.
      On reaching home there was dinner, to which two words
had        to be said,   not contemptuous, believe            me   ;   and then
coffee and cigar,        with the serenities thereon attending              :   and
then    a    stroll among the vases, for the inspection of my pets                ;
and    a     stroll in the garden where        I    could inspect the pans
under the verandah             ;   and then study   ;   and then with limbs

Only three days ago a brother naturalist sent me a couple
of dozen Sea Anemones, stowed among weed in a tin can
ister, which formerly contained a powder unblushingly                     sold
behind a Christian counter as veritable coffee.              The process
is simple enough, when         tin canisters are at hand, little as the
excellent Rowland         Hill  contemplated such an adaptation of
his postal reform to the exigencies             of naturalists   ;   but the
process is less simple when you are temporarily abiding                   in a
place    so utterly     provincial   that little in the nature of tin
boxes     is to be had for money, and nothing at all for love.
Such     a place   is Tenby.
   But, first, let me tell you what made me desiderative of tin
boxes, and indignant         with Tenby for its want of resources.

                          THE MORTE STONE.                                        79
At Ilfracombe the orange-tenacled and orange-disked Ane
mones, by Mr Goss christened Actinia aurora and Actinia
venusta, are unknown, and, of course, prized all the more on
that account.       Is not everything valued for its rarity              ?   There
is,   however, not many miles from Ilfracombe,                 a   terrible reef
running far out into the          sea,   bearing the sombre name of the
Morte Stone, on which many               a   tall ship has been wrecked,
and which, inaccessible from the land,                   is   visited only by
naturalists and gulls.          We — mean the naturalists, not the
                                     I
gulls — found Morte Stone well worth the visit                     ;   and while
scrambling over its desolate ridges, the spray of                  a   heavy sea
dashing from either side in our faces, and                     a   noonday sun
pouring down its fierce passion upon our heads, as we clam
bered over rocks so black           with mussels that you could not
for yards have inserted         a   penknife between           them,    A., with
his coat off, emerged from under             a   ledge, meeting B., no less
jubilant, both holding up specimens of the orange-tentacled
Anemone, hitherto supposed to belong exclusively to Tenby.
This was the first time       I   saw the sunset-flame on the tentacles
of this Anemone      ;    and when at Tenby, remembering the de
light with which B. carried home the novelty,                   it   was natural
that  I   should wish to send him         a   few of the beauties expand
ing their tentacles in my vases.             But how     ?    One cannot wrap
a   moist and mucose          animal in note-paper, and expect               it   to
reach its destination like an invitation for dinner, or the
             "               "
request for   atrifling loan   and the damp sea-weed which
                                     ;
will keep the animal alive, requires some covering to keep                        it
self damp.   I    tried   a   card-board box, well padded with weed,
wrapped     it   in paper, and committed          it   to the tenderness of        a

  80                       SEA-SIDE     STUDIES.
 paternal Government and a reformed Post-office, with this
 warning inscribed in majestic calligraphy             —
                    WITH CARE      : LIVE ANIMALS         !
 I  thought the Lacedemonian brevity and the note of admira
 tion might have their effect.         But,     it is painful to     confess,
 that Post-office clerks appear to be imperfectly versed in the
 rudiments of zoology        ; or perhaps they pay slight attention
 to the literature of Inscriptions        ;  at any rate they stamped
 with a vigour which completely squashed the card-board box.
     The next time,     I  determined to follow my friend's advice,
 and send the animals in a tin box, which, of course, seemed
 the easiest thing in the world, until the trial was made.                     I
 ransacked Tenby in vain.          I  asked everywhere —          I asked at
impossible shops — I even tried the bootmaker               :   he could not
 supply me.     I  offered money, and hinted            love  ;  but no tin
box could Tenby produce.           The article was mythical.             Tenby
had mustaches       and parasols     in prodigal abundance           ;   pony-
chaises and sailing-boats        obtruded themselves at every cor
ner   ; the streets were full of formidable young gentlemen
from the fashionable parts (of Bristol),               and nurserymaids
with prize babies     ;   these, and much more that was sublimely
useless,  Tenby had at your service           ;  but a tin box      it knew
not, except by vague report.           Tenby has not even a banker              ;
to get a cheque changed you must ride to Pembroke                      ;  why,
then, expect     it will     have  a tinman       ?   Imagine my impa
tience, my disgust      !   I'm afraid  I   used    strong language.         At
last a brilliant conception made my pathway clear.                         In a
grocer's shop there were cases of ginger-nuts for sale                ;   these

                   ANIMALS SENT BY POST.                               81
cases were    of tin  ;  they were larger, much, than my require
ments   ; but this was no occasion for drawing fine lines.           The
nuts were edible, the case transportable.           An investment was
straightway     made, and my agitated mind was once more                at
peace.
   The case was large enough to contain, besides a quan
tity of Anemones, a wide-mouthed bottle, in which                  I  had
consigned a fine specimen            of that boring      bivalve named
PJiolas d&ctylus (Plate II., fig. 3), three of which had been
brought to me in a lump of wood, wherein they had bored
themselves    a local habitation.       Although these Molluscs live
in rocks and wood, they seem to flourish perfectly when
removed, and left       in sea-water.     I  risked one in the experi
ment,   and was      uneasy,    next morning,       at finding   he had
elongated himself to more than half again his original size              ;
but observing the currents still active from his siphon, and
that, on being touched, he shrunk           to his original size     with

clusion supported         by observing     precisely the same phe
nomena    exhibited by the two Pholades still in the wood.
As, therefore, the Pholas lived out of his woody home, and
as I had three specimens,        I  could do no less than send one
of them to an amateur        ;  and thus   it  came that   I despatched
the   wide-mouthed        bottle   in the tin     case,  which   arrived
without accident.        After keeping my two borers for some
time, one of them fell a       victim to anatomical curiosity        ; as
for the third, Vappetit vient en mangeant,              and  I dissected

of which there are several different kinds, all curious to the
philosopher, but none very interesting to keep.                     One species,
the     Teredo navalis (Plate    II., fig.    5), is a formidable fellow,
unloved of shipowners, since many a ship has been known
to split in the open     sea,   no one on board having suspected
that the planks had been thoroughly                    drilled through and
through by this patient borer.            The hardest oak, nay, even
teak and sissoo woods, are no obstacles to this mollusc.                          The
chemical process which protects timber against decay is no
protection against the Teredo.               The animal always tunnels
in the direction of the grain of the wood, and if in its course
it   meets     with another gentleman engaged in the same pro
cess,    it alters the direction of its       course, so that a piece                 of
wood attacked by many Teredos becomes completely honey
combed.         In dockyards the    defence       has been to cover the
woodwork         under water     with iron nails             ;    and you may
imagine how necessary           some protection          is,      since    not only
have docks been         perforated, but many years ago Holland
was thrown into terrible alarm by discovering that the piles
of her embankments had been riddled by these silent mol
luscs,       and all Europe thought       that the United Provinces
were doomed.          Other borers choose rock for their opera
tions    ;   and many   a   solid-seeming mass          is       so perforated by
them,        that the dashing of   a    stormy sea may scatter                   it   in
fragments along the coast.             The fact of boring                 is   familiar
enough to every one who has noticed the Red-nose                                (Saxi-
cava rugosa)        peering from    a     thousand holes in the hard
limestone, and squirting          water      as   it   retires on the first
application       of the hammer    ;   but while        the fact          is    undis-

puted, the source of the animal's power is still an unsettled
question.
   How these bivalves bore their way has been a mystery,
mainly because zoologists                 have allowed themselves to be
thrown off their balance by contemplating the stupendous
results produced by creatures                    so insignificant.            But after
learning         the   history   of the formation            of coral reefs and
islands, we begin             to appreciate the influence of minute
agencies continued through long spaces of time.                              The Teredo
and the Pholas have no powerful                          organs,   but they have
patience     ;    and as far as     I    understand the matter,               it is clear
that the disputes on this subject have been perplexed by the
desire to bring forward some organ so powerful                                as at once
to explain the animal's success in boring.                         Thus the latest
writer, M. Aucapitaine,* imagines he explains the phenome
non, by bringing forward the hypothesis of an acid secreted
by the animal, which corrodes the rock, or wood, and which
is then rasped away by a slow rotatory motion of the shell.
The boring is thus supposed to be a combination of chemical
and mechanical agencies.                 There    is,   however, one little diffi
culty in accepting this explanation, which the author has
overlooked, as speculators are wont to overlook fatal objec
tions   :   the existence        of this acid has yet to be proved                  ;   its
presence     is    indispensable to the theory, but, unfortunately,
the fact of its presence          is    hypothetical.        And when we have
got tangible hold of the acid, we must prove that, while                                it
has the property of attacking wood and rock,                        it       has not the
property of attacking the calcareous shell of the animal.

     Very different, and far more philosophical, is the explana
tion of Professor Owen, whose opinion on all points carries
authority.           He shows*         that the combined action of                              the
muscular disc and the valves of the shell                                  will produce the
phenomenon.              It   may be paradoxical, and you will probably
shake a dubious head               on seeing           the cavities bored by these
Molluscs, and on being told that the soft muscular disc of
the animal perforated them                   ;   you have no conception that,
by licking limestone with never so much energy, you could
                                                    " it is
wear it away ; and yet, as Owen quietly remarks,
certain that the perpetual renewal of a softer substance                                        will
render it capable             of wearing away a harder one, subject to
the friction of such softer surface, and not like                               it susceptible
of being repaired."              Yes, here lies the whole mystery                           :   the
soft muscular             disc is perpetually               renewed, and the hard
limestone has no self-renovating power                                ;   and thus, just as
falling water wears away granite, by the incessant repetition
of gentle blows, so do these Molluscs excavate rock, or wood,
by the incessant repetition of muscular friction.                                -J-

the excursion,              but he must wait till it be made                      ;   for    it

destruction               of these        vermin     defied   all       ingenuity,     until
Embryology came to our aid.                             I   carefully      abstain from
mentioning             the unusual term in his presence, but address
a question to him               :   —
      " Are         these animals         of separate sexes
                                                                   "
                                                               ?
      He looks rather huffed, as he replies                         :
                                                                        " How should             I
know          ?    and what does          it matter ?"
      "It matters           everything.            And for your satisfaction           I can
tell you that they are of separate sexes."
      "Humph!"
      "   A       French naturalist,             Quatrefages by name, has found
that at certain seasons the female                          carries the eggs in the
folds of her respiratory organs."
      " The         deuce she does         '."
      " And there they remain till the milt of the                             male, float
ing in the water,                    is   washed over them,              and fecundates
them.              Now this same Naturalist has brought his know
ledge to bear upon the very question you are so interested
in.        He finds that            a   weak solution of mercury thrown into

the water destroys this milt, and consequently prevents the
fecundation of the eggs, nipping the young molluscs in the
bud.      By thus becoming a zoological Herod, and destroying
the innocents wholesale, in a few seasons you may clear the
docks of every individual Teredo, and your ships            will be
 safe."
    I  see  by the intelligent twinkle of his eye that he has
seized this notion    with decisive approbation, and from this
moment begins to think there may be some use, after all,
in Natural History.       I almost feel tempted to show him my
Pholas, although it is not a very interesting animal to watch.
There is a somnolent lethargy, an otiosity of do-nothingism
in its demeanour, surprising in one who bores through rocks
as we tunnel the    Jura.   He will not even bore now.       I have
tried him in vain.      He lolls his great length at the bottom
of the pan, and declines the lump of wood placed before him.
In   fact, he does nothing but suck    in the water at one tube
of his siphon, and squirt it out of the other.       Do observe
that siphon or double tube, like a double-barrelled gun, the
lining membrane       of which   is covered  with vibratile cilia.
The incessant action of these cilia draws the water in at the
orifice of the upper and larger tube, along which         it passes
and reaches the gills, where the blood is aerated     ;   and  then
the water makes its exit from the under tube, in a steady
current, visible to the naked eye.      How this is performed is
to me a mystery, for my dissections wholly failed in tracing
any direct communication between the two tubes          ;  but that
there must be some indirect communication is certain, since
the evidence of the two currents, one of entrance, and one        of

  exit, is unequivocal*            Look at the orifice of the upper
  tube,    what     a    beautiful    arborescent fringe         encircles     it  !
  You may        see  a picture     of it in Mr Gosse's           Rambles       on
  the  Devonshire Coast very well delineated.                "The tentacular
  filaments,"     he   says,    "are numerous, each forming              a  little
  tree with pinnate branches,             bearing no small resemblance
  to the flower of feathery branchiae that expands                   round the
  mouth of a Holothuria.             These branched tentacles          are ordi
  narily bent down across the mouth of the tube, the long
  est   of them just meeting in the centre               ;  alternating    with
 these are placed others of similar structure              but inferior size      ;
 and the interspaces are occupied by others smaller still, and
  simply pinnate       ;  so that when the whole occupy their                  or
  dinary transverse position,             the smaller      ones   fill up the
 angles of the larger, and the branches of all form a network
 of exquisite tracery, spread across the orifice, through the
 interstices      or meshes       of which      the   current     of entering
 water     freely percolates,      while they exclude all except              the
 most minute floating atoms of extraneous matter."
     The boatman has just called to say the boat is ready, and
    * This disputed question has been finally settled by the investigations of
 Messrs Alder and Hancock, who find the communication takes place through
 minute apertures between the meshes of the gills themselves.      " Each of the
gill-plates consists of two lamina;  united at the ventral margin, and likewise
attached to each other in transverse   lines running across tho gills throughout
 their whole extent, and forming, in the interspaces, a series of parallel tubes
 which open into the dorsal chamber, and are thus in communication with the
excurrent siphon. The minute reticulated blood-vessels          of the branchial
lamina; forming the walls of these tubes, are found, when examined by a high
power of the microscope,     to be open between the meshes, which are minutely
ciliated, allowing the passage of the water into the tubes, and from thence
into the anal chamber." — Report of British Association, 1851 ; Sections, p. 76.

the Dredge at our service.             In the previous Chapters I           de
scribed our hunting on the rocks, and picking up what gales
might have thrown upon the shore               ; and the amateur gene
rally contents himself with these resources, unless his desires,
enlarging with his knowledge, urge him, as they did me, to
follow more ambitious naturalists, and try dredging.                        He
knows that in depths never laid bare by retiring tides there
are animals     of price.      He knows that the oyster-beds are
hunting-grounds        where     a single venture          will bring him
more than a month can properly examine.                     It  is true that
he may also       know that he will be sick              ; but, as Schiller
says, —
          " Es wachst der Monsch     mit seinen grossern Zweckrn ;"
           (Our  stature heightens   with our heightening aims), —
and the hope of Molluscs makes man's stomach equal to the
occasion.    Our boatmen told us of one well-known                      Ana
tomist, who went out every day during his stay at Tenby,

 matter   how     calm the sea        ;   always     suffering, but     never
 daunted by wind or storm.              Very amusing it was to notice
the puzzlement         of these      honest boatmen at what                they
 evidently considered a sort of inexplicable eccentricity in
 our thus throwing away our days,                  our money — and our
breakfasts — in the        pursuit of worms,             oyster-shells,     and
 weeds.    Had we gone fishing, they could have entered into
 our hopes and enthusiasm          ;  had we sought for pearls in the
 oyster-shells, their sympathy would have been ready                     ;  but
 that any sane man should be anxious for the rubbish which
 they nightly threw away when their nets were hauled in,

and this not to eat the worms, not to sell them, but to put them
in vases, and finally cut them open, that was inexplicable.
    As we sailed through the sparkling waters, wafted by                                a
pleasant breeze, we talked to the men, and tried to make
them understand              the kind        of things which they might
always bring us, and be certain of purchasers                       ;   but although
willing to oblige, and not at all indisposed to accept silver
for a little trouble, although one of the men had once picked
up a bunch of sea-grapes                  (eggs   of the cuttlefish), for which
a   gentleman         gave    him     half-a-crown           (a   mad gentleman,

no bribe       will move          them.      They cannot realise            to them
selves the conception that what they have                         for years thrown
away as rubbish,             can     possibly      contain        anything     worth
money.        I repeatedly urged            on them these simple instruc
tions   :    Bring me anything alive (except fish) that you find
in the net, and the chances                  are that    I    shall buy it.         One
Calamary (Loligo) was all that came.
    We have        reached         the oyster-beds, and the Dredge is
dropped into the water, plunging                     some fifteen or twenty
fathoms,      like a diver knowing what is required of him.                          On
we sail, the line       running out, the dredge raking the oyster-
beds, and considerably retarding our progress                           in spite of a
stiff breeze. At length it is time to haul in,                          and the men
pull strenuously, till the Dredge appears, and                          a portentous
mass        of oyster-shells, dirt,           stones,    and       Sea-Urchins         is
emptied in the bottom of the boat.                      We pounce on         it,   while
the Dredge       is   once more cast         into the water.

pleasant    serenity, and the well-known              head-swimming and
nausea which      ensue,     categorically tell us that, let Schiller
declaim as he will, poetry won't control the liver                 ;   and how
ever successfully   Britons may rule the waves, the waves are
extremely disrespectful to their rulers.                   Que voulez-vous         ?
The brain may be confident, but the liver is upset                     ;    heroism
is futile against a chopping         sea.         We can't pretend to be
superior to these weaknesses,         and so we resign ourselves to
sitting quiet, while the boatmen turn over the mass, and
hand us       objects for     inspection,         upon     which       we    decide
whether they shall be placed in the bucket of sea-water, or
returned to the oyster-beds.
     Very droll it was, even in my languid state, to observe
Jack stooping and fumbling among the oyster-shells, not
knowing what his insane party might possibly think worth
carrying home, and for his part thinking the whole as big a
heap    of rubbish as ever he saw.
     " This here
                  any use, sir?" he inquires, handing me a huge
oyster with an unexpressed sarcasm in the question.                          I   turn
my green countenance           towards      it,   and suddenly forget the
qualms,     exclaiming   —
     "
         Use, my dear fellow     !   of course        it   is.   Why,       it   is a
perfect colony    of animals."

    " Well, sir,
                 you knows."
    And he drops it into the bucket, plunging his hands                                     once
more among the mass.                      That oyster, besides the Polypes
and Sponges growing on                    it,   bore at least       a   dozen Terebellre,
an Ascidian of exquisite colour, innumerable                                  Serpulae, and
a   beautiful Sabella.
    "              what          that you're going to throw away
                                                                                        "

    " Only     a   bit of dirt, sir."
    " Let me        see   it.   I      have     known bits of dirt turn out to
be curious animals."
    Jack, now fairly bewildered, and expecting probably that
the next thing he               will   be asked to hand me              will be     a   bubble
of foam, stretches out his honest fist, and places on the seat
a   small lump of sand, having no definite shape, and looking
no more like an animated creature                        than the mud-pie which
ingenious          youth delights             to construct.         I        know   it      at   a
glance to be an Ascidian (Molgula arenosa),                                   for only last
week,      while        scrambling        over the rocks,           I        looked into         a
shallow pool, on the sandy bottom of which there was one
of these sand-lumps alone in its glory.                          I      cannot tell what
made me suspect             it    to be an animal.              The mind          sees      what
the eye cannot.             Do we not distinguish               a   friend by       a   certain
undefinable something long before he                           is   near enough for us
to distinguish his dress or his features                         ?          With the        same
mental perception one learns to distinguish an animal, even
when one has never seen                 it    before.   I     had never seen or read
of this Ascidian.          I      did not know          it   to be an Ascidian          ;   but,
detaching      it   from the rock,            I   popped       it   in my bottle, con
vinced that        it   was an animal of some kind                      ;   and on coming

home,       I   began to scrape away the sand                        till   I   came down to
a membrane.                   I    then cut the mass open, and found an
Ascidian, which had so completely coated itself with sand,
that sand became its integument.
     Having turned over the heap, and shown me one by one
every shell or weed,                      Jack now began to           clear the boat, and
to haul in the Dredge once more.                                 After a few hauls, our
bucket was sufficiently stocked,                            and we sailed homewards,
skimming the surface with a net in the hope of capturing
some       jellyfish, but none appeared.                        We ought to have been
in high spirits           ;       but whatever consolation may have been                     in
the thought of the bucket, we were not hilarious,                                   I    pledge
you my word, as we scudded                            along, green and silent.             We
reached the pier-steps at last.                            Jack carried the bucket after
me, and the perplexed vassal at the lodging-house                                    brought
down a foot-pan, into which the contents of the bucket were
emptied.            I   should not like to inquire too closely into that
vassal's private opinion                        of me and my pursuits.              The next
day, when           I met     Jack, he was gratified to learn that the result
of our dredging had been highly satisfactory, as indeed it
was    ;   for besides abundance of known animals,                               I had   found
two entirely new genera of Annelids.
     Sea-sickness         is not an agreeable sensation.                        While endur

                  FASCINATION OF THE SEA.                                      93
or Germany, where we have been before,                   it may  be expected
that the more powerful           attraction    of marine treasures will
entirely conquer hesitation.
   The fact is, the sea is a passion.             Its fascination, like all
true fascination, makes          us reckless    of consequences.             The
sea is  like a woman       :  she lures us, and we run madly after
her  ; she ill-uses us, and we adore her           ;   beautiful, capricious,
tender, and terrible     !   There is no satiety in this love           ;  there
never is satiety in true affection.          The       sea  is the first thing
which meets my eyes in the morning, placidly sunning herself
under my window          ;   her many voices beckoning                 me, her
gently-heaving      breast alluring me,         her face beaming with
unutterable     delight.      All   through the day           I wanton with
her; and the last thing at night,          I  see    the long shimmering
track    of light from the distant beacon thrown across her
tranquil surface — dark now, and solemn, made more desolate
by the dark and silent hulls of anchored vessels, but beauti
ful even in her sombre and forlorn condition.                      I  hear her
mighty sighs answering the wailing night-winds.                      She lures
me to her.      I cannot      go to bed.     Let me wander along the
sands and gaze upon that solemn gloom, stretching mysteri
ously afar.     I walk down to the quay              ;   all is silent, except
in one boat, where a knot of men are just about to start for
their night's fishing.          They   will  be out all night,           toiling
through     the terrible waters to gain a few shillings.                   I  bid
Jack   bring me a cuttlefish if he can.
                                                       " Good night, sir." —
 " Good night, and good cheer."             And away the boat speeds
 into the night.      It   is soon invisible    ;    the plash of the oars
 ceases to reach my ears.          There is something pathetic in the

 34                       SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
 thought of these men nightly braving what they brave, and
totally insensible to the poetry of their situation, which
might make       it something better than a mere venture for a
few pence.       My thoughts are sad to-night.                I wander on,
and the waves come to greet me, but the image of that boat
disappearing through the darkness               will not  leave me.    Life
 seems    so sad, so transitory,        so ineffectual, and Nature       so
 pitiless and calm.
    The next morning          all such thoughts have vanished like
uneasy dreams.            Nature     is   joyous,     clear,   sunny;   my
mistress yonder is sparkling and singing in the light              ;  white
sails dot the distance      ;   the busy hum of men rises on every
side.    I  go out on the sands, and at my feet the tide            throws
a Calamary     (Loligo) with which          I  rush back to my lodgings
in great glee.      A   pie-dish of sea-water receives the welcome
Cephalopod     ; but he is dead, and        will show    none of his ways.
Yet what is this       ?  the colour-specs are coming out on the
skin, like stars      appearing      at night,      and now the whole
surface, which was pearly-white,             is of a variegated hue.      I
had heard of this before, but actual observation gives one
very different feelings from those of mere acquiescence                in a
fact.    The colour-specs continued to come and go, much to
my puzzlement       ;    nor could     I   gain much light from any
books at hand.           M. Alcide d'Orbigny,           who has    studied
Molluscs     for  twenty      years,     especially    the   Cephalopoda,
ought, of course, to be consulted, and you shall hear what
              " The colour is as
he says    :                             unchangeable as the diverse
impressions of the animal.              It consists of a complicated
system of      globules of various           colours,   red,   brown,  and

            CONTRACTILITY           OF COLOUR-SPECS.                        95
yellow, placed under the first layer of the epidermis.                  These
globules have each a pupil which contracts and dilates, form
ing now a large irregular spot, and now diminishing to a
mere    point.    It  is easy to understand, therefore, how the
animal which, when the globules are dilated, is of a dark
colour,   becomes      almost white when           these     globules      are
contracted.     The contractability       of these globules therefore
always depends on the        will of the animal       ;  and he varies his
colour from brown to white with remarkable vivacity accord
ing to his own will." *
    Attention is called to this passage, as one among the
numerous illustrations        of that serious want of a doctrine
to   guide    investigations,     which     is the greatest obstacle
 Zoology has now to contend with.             The mass of facts which
 has been    accumulated is of astonishing              extent    ;  but the
 philosophy which should be evolved from them, which should
 co-ordinate them, and serve as a torch to guide zoologists in
 all inquiries, is still in the most meagre condition.                To con
 fine ourselves, for the present, to the case before us, is             it not
 remarkable that a man so eminent as M. d'Orbigny should
 have written,    and some other men acquiesced in,                 a passage
 so  preposterous as the one just cited        ?    Where was the bio
 logical philosophy      which    could conceive         the contractility
 of pigment globules as dependent               on the       "will of      the
 animal ;" especially when such a leap in logic had to be taken
 as is taken at the
                         " therefore ? "
                                             Physiologists are, indeed,

 what they do not understand            ;  but we must marvel that

 direct observation did not utterly discountenance its intro
 duction    here   ;  for   it is quite certain that hundreds must
have   seen,   if they did not observe, what most attracted me
in the matter, namely, the appearance and disappearance                             of
 the colour-specs      in the skin of the dead animal                  ;  and even
the most metaphysical of zoologists would hardly attribute
volition to a corpse.          The observation of this one fact might
have led to further          investigation.        On placing a small strip
of the skin under the Microscope,                  I  was surprised to find
two or three of these colour-specs expanding and contracting
with great vigour.            At   first  I  thought      it must   be an optical
illusion, but on close attention                it became       too decided for
doubt    ; and not suspecting the truth,             I concluded         that some
animalculae      were imbedded in the tissue,                    and that      their
movements produced this apparent activity of the globules.
To    settle   these doubts,          two other strips underwent                exa
mination     ;  in both of these, all, or almost all, the specs
were in activity, shooting out prolongations, and retracting
again —two specs sometimes                  seeming to run into one, but
really overlapping each other, and sometimes                         a point     not
bigger than a millet seed expanding to the size of a sixpence,
growing fainter in colour as it expanded.                     This was decisive.
If the   globules in a strip of skin taken from the dead animal
manifest precisely the same                  contractions       and expansions
which they manifest on the living animal,                        it is clear that
their activity does not depend                               " will "— a conclu

     But it is not in Zoology only that logic is courageously
 assaulted by our " large discourse of reason." If " reason

away, informed              us      that    the    howling came from three
itinerant preachers about to edify a group of fishermen on
the quay.         I   begged        him to shut the window                 ; this being
my protection against the outrage of a German Band, which
Sirilia CiUriort,   i. p. 15, says that the expansion of these colour-specs is due to
an expansile   liquid, allied to blood —espansile umore {cmatosina I) which is con
tained in the vesicles, and which is probably in relation with the blood-vessels
and the rete   Malpighi ;     and he suggests that its contractions and expansions
may depend on respiration.           But the fact, recorded in the text, of a strip of
skin taken from the dead animal exhibiting the same contractions and expan
sions as those   exhibited by the skin of the living animal, shows that the con
tractility  of these vesicles is independent of any such cause.              Kolliker   has
shown that the contractions are produced          by pale muscular fibres.   Some doubt,
however,   is permissible respecting their muscular nature.             As Charles Robin
says, they are perfectly homogeneous          and extremely fine ; moreover,      they  are
not capable of being isolated as fibres,       " en  sorte qu'il serait plus juste de dire
que les chromatophores (coloured           specs) sont entoures d'une substance      homo-
gene contractile, fibroide     ; les fibres non isolables,  et dont par suite le diametre
exact ne peut etre donne1,    sont disposers par faisceaux." * No one has explained
how these retain their contractility so long after all the other muscles.

save the Queen        never anything else, and always pitilessly
out of tune.    But P.'s sense of the ludicrous overcame his
musical susceptibility, and condemned us to hear the hymn.
Shortly afterwards, the preaching began, and as we ascer
tained that   it was Mormonism           then being expounded,      we
resolved to go out and be edified.          It was worth the effort.
Standing    on a chair was a young             man, scarcely     above
twenty,    swinging    his arms about, and flinging forth            in
harsh ejaculations a torrent of repetitions and abstractions,
quite distressing to listen to, from the total want of any
thing that could arrest the interest of his audience.           Open-
air preaching is meant to coerce the attention of those who
will not go to church        ; but this    Mormon      preacher never
once alighted upon a phrase which          could awaken an idea in
the minds of those he addressed        ;  so that we marvelled    why
he should have      been    chosen   as a preacher       of a doctrine
which addresses the worldly interests.          On each side of him
stood an   Elder— and     I  wish  I  could paint the portraits       of
these   Caryatides    of imbecility.       One was      a well-washed
middle-aged man, who may have been a sentimental tailor                 ;
he rested his elbow on the chair which            served as a   pulpit,
and,  inclining his head, allowed his finger to indent his
cheek.   The other was a short, tawny,              grey-haired   man,
who must have been a cobbler troubled with metaphysical
misgivings.    It  is to be presumed that they were edified         by
the preacher's rhapsodies and repetitions         ;  the audience was
utterly unimpressed.        Indeed there was what P. called            a

                foreground      of boys and girls, fighting, laugh
ing, jeering,  beating tin kettles, and otherwise exhibiting
the moderate     sensibility of their fibre religieux     ; but      the
background of men and women (of course with babies) was
more orderly.
   They listened in respectful silence, but with no appearance
of sympathy.      A grey-haired fisherman standing beside me
said to a woman at his left :
                                    " He doesn't
                                                    speak according
to Scripter.     Some things      is according to Scripter      ;    but
some is not."    He spoke in a quiet assured tone of authority,
and his was the only criticism       I heard.
   This is a digression, and has only a remote connection with
the imperfect logic of zoologists, a subject on which,       if  I had
greater authority,  I  would discourse at length.        Not    that I
suppose   zoologists to be less logical than other men            ;  but
simply that the Science of Life being so much more difficult
than any of the Physical Sciences,        it is more in    need     of a
rigorous code of principles     ;  whereas    at present the Astro
nomer, the Physicist,       and the Chemist, are subject to re
straints which the Biologist seldom condescends to            regard.
No speculative Chemist is allowed to call a substance an acid
which   will unite with    no base,    which exhibits none of the
properties of an acid   ;  no Physicist is allowed to assume the
existence of electricity, where none of the conditions of elec
tricity exist, and none of the phenomena (except those to be
explained) are manifest.       But we who study Biology in any
department, whether Physiology, Zoology, or Botany,                   are
allowed by the laxity of current practice, and the want of a
doctrine, to call a coloured spec an eye, in the absence of all

proof of its having the structure or properties of an eye                             ;
we are allowed to assume the existence of nerves, where no
trace    of a nerve is discernible             ;   we are allowed to drag in
"electricity," or the "will," as efficient causes of anything
we do not understand              ;   and we fill Text-books and Treatises
with errors which give way before the first sceptic who
investigates them.
      We are very sheep in our gregariousness in error.                      When
one bold or stupid mutton takes a leap, all leap after him.
It    is rare to find men doubting facts, still rarer to find them
doubting whether the facts be correctly co-ordinated.                           Our
books are crowded with unexamined statements, which we
never think of examining.                    Do we not all believe that the
magnificent Cleopatra, regardless of expense, dissolved in her
wine-cup a pearl of great price, as if it had been a lump of
                    " fact " familiar to
sugar ? Is not the                        every one ? Yet, if
you test    it,   you   will find the fact to            be that pearls are not
soluble in wine         ;   the most powerful            vinegar attacks them
but very slowly, and never entirely dissolves them, for the
organic matter remains behind, in the shape of                           a   spongy
mass larger than the original pearl.
     "Forewarned,           forearmed."         Students once having           their
attention called to the necessity of scepticism in Zoology,
will    soon find abundant occasion for its exercise.                   We should
as much as possible keep the mind                   in   a   state   of loose moor
ings, not firmly anchoring on any ground, unless our charts
are    full of explicit detail         ;   not believing      (but simply acqui
escing, and that        in    a   provisional      way) in any fact which        is
not     clear in the light of its own evidence,                       or which, in

 default of our having verified     it for  ourselves, has the trust
 worthy verification of another.       This sounds like a truism,
 but  it is not my fault if it  be necessary to enforce a truism.
 The adoption of such a rigorous scepticism would revolutionise
 Zoology.      It will not be adopted by the majority, because        it
 will give great trouble, and men dislike trouble            ; but the
more restless and rebellious spirits, of which there is always
a proportion in every sphere, will " scorn delights and live
laborious days," in subjecting accepted statements to rigor
ous verification.
    I came down to the coast       as an amateur,       ignorant, but
anxious to learn, and not simply to seem to learn.             For this
purpose     it was not enough that      I  should know what was
said respecting the simpler organisms, but          it was    necessary
I  should, as far as possible, understand the grounds on whicn
each statement was made.          Many and many an hour was
spent, but not uselessly,    in verifying what every tyro knew
to be the fact    ; but also many an hour was spent in making
clear to myself, not only that certain accepted statements
were errors, but how they became accepted.            As   an example
I will   mention the respiration of sea-slugs (Eolids),          in the
investigation of which     I was favoured by fortune      as not many
are favoured, namely, by having abundance              of material to
work on.
    There had been a heavy gale all night, and the wind was
still high   ; down we went to the Tunnel Rocks to watch the
tide come in.       It was a glorious    sight to contemplate the
impetuous sea plunging upon the shore with ever-accelerated
velocity, rising in wrath,      and leaping over the reefs with

  mighty bounds, roaring, hissing, groaning, sighing.             We
  stood with our backs leaning against a wall of rock, the spray
  leaping up into our faces.     At  length a black mass appeared
  upon the swelling height, to be lost again in the ridge          of
  foam, and then to reappear ; onwards     it came, struggling with
  the waves which tossed it and tumbled it to and fro, till we
  descried   it to  be a bit of wreck.    In   one instant the sense
  of the picturesque was submerged by a rush of zoological
 expectation.      We sprang down on the shore, anxiously await
  ing till the prize should be flung at our feet.      It turned  out
 to be the bit of an old cask, which must have been long under
 water, for    it was as black as ebony, and  literally covered with
 Polypes and eggs of Eolids.       You may      be sure  it was wel
 comed with jubilant        shouts, as were the masses of weed
 thrown up at the same time, also covered with Polypes and
 ova.    We departed with the feelings of men who have just
 heard of a legacy.        Next morning     I  found the treasures
 greater than our expectation;         not only were there thou
 sands of ova, but scores of delicate and tiny Eolids of         dif
 ferent species were found floating in the water, or crawling
 among the Polypes.        It took hours  to remove these delicate
 creatures into separate vases and bottles, and then to con
 template them with hungry enthusiasm—which                 you will
 appreciate    if you  have been ever fascinated    by the study of
Development, and suddenly seen abundant material within
reach; or,     if you have been anxious to solve some problem
 which only abundant observation could help you to solve.
I was troubled      about the respiration   of the Eolis, not feel
ing at all satisfied with what is taught in the schools        ; and

                               THE EOLIS.                                 103
here   were   more Eolids thrown into my hands than most
men ever see     in a lifetime.
   The Eolis (Plate        II., fig.   1) is a sea-slug,    but in spite
of this ill-sounding       name,    the sea has few creatures           more
elegant in form, more exquisite in colour.              In size   it  ranges
from one-tenth of an inch to three inches in length.                     The
commonest and least            handsome species,        E. papillosa, is
about an inch or an inch and a-half long, the back being
densely studded with            slate-coloured club-like      projections,
called branchial papillae,         so  like in colour to the rock it
crawls over, that often only an experienced eye can detect it.
The more elegant species, such as           Eolis pellucida, or     elegans,
or Lansbergii,      should be sought for every Aquarium,                 care
being taken to keep them out of the way of the Anemones,
which they mercilessly attack.             Believe in no woodcut repre
sentations of these exquisite creatures              ; all woodcuts are
libels.     The    plates of Alder         and Hancock's      magnificent
monograph approach as near to the beauty of nature as can
be expected     of plates    ;  but even they necessarily fall short
of the delicacy of tissue and witchery of colour often dis
played by these animals.             There is nothing but actual pos
session    which ought to satisfy you            ; and possession is not
difficult.    Order   Mr Alford Lloyd — that enterprising            devotee
to the wants of naturalists and amateurs* — to get you a few
specimens,     and  it will not    be long before   your eye is delighted
with the beauty of the animal             I am now about to dissect in
your presence.
   We delicately lay open the back to expose the stomach,

  which lies on the dorsal, not the ventral surface.         We shall find
  the Eolis rejoicing in a digestive apparatus as perfect as that
  of Alderman        Smith,   but somewhat different in structure.
  Stomach, properly so called,       it  can hardly venture to claim        ;
 for that pyriform pouch which you observe, is rather an
 expansion of the intestinal           tube than       a  distinct organ.
  Observe how this tube is continued along the whole length
  of the body   ;  in some species it is wide and tapering, in the
 one before     us   it is  more  constricted   ;  and be particular in
 noticing    how this tube gives off pairs of branches,              which
 again subdivide into smaller            branches,    and run      up into
 those club-like projections, called dorsal or branchial papillae,
 the cavities of which they almost entirely fill, sometimes               as
 mere   dilatations,      sometimes     with shrub-like arborescence.
 Having thus traced the stomach, the intestine and its rami
 fications, we must now look out for the next important
 organ of the digestive apparatus, the Liver.                It  is useless
 seeking for it    ;  the Eolis has not reached that stage of animal
 development which          imperiously    demands       a special  biliary
 organ  ; it  can transact all digestive requirements by the            aid
 of biliary vesicles scattered       along the lining membrane           of
those intestinal branches which we saw            filling the cavities of
the papillae.      In a word, we    here meet   with the rudimentary
and initial condition of the liver, nothing more than a few
hepatic cells.
    You understand, therefore, that these papillae covering the
back, and    bristling up like quills upon the fretful porcupine
when the Eolis is irritated, are hollow tubes, containing pro
longations of the intestine, and biliary cells.          By many anato-

 mists    it is thought that       these tubes are     biliary ducts, and
 perhaps in some species this may be           so, but that      it is not  so
 in all,  I    have positive evidence.      I was one day examining
  some Polypes under the microscope,           when my attention was
 diverted by something granular, contractile, indistinguish
 able   in shape.       On extricating   it from   the branches        of the
 Polype,     I   found it to be a white oblong jelly-like creature,
 about the size of a pin's head.             Replacing      it under the
 microscope,       I saw that it was   an Eolis, but whether         of a yet
 undescribed species, or only the young of some known species,
 my very imperfect knowledge did not enable me to decide.
 The extreme transparency of its tissues was such that                       I
 could observe        it with satisfactory precision.         It   had only
 eight papillae on either side, but these were very large, each of
 the central ones measuring at least a sixth of the whole animal.
 This was another fortunate circumstance, enabling me to
detect the passage of the dark granules which almost filled
the cavities, to and fro from the intestine, with which these
cavities were in direct communication.              All    doubt was im
possible     :  there was the food oscillating       from the intestine
into the papillae, and back from the papillae into the intes
tine  ;  and this oscillation,     I observed, did    in nowise depend
on the contractions and expansions of the papillae, but wholly
on the contractions and expansions of the body                 ;  for some
times the granules ran up into the cavities when the papillae
expanded, but sometimes they remained in their previous
position.
    You    see   that the papillae   are gastro-hepatic organs, or, to
speak less technically,        that they are parts of the intestinal

106                     SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
and biliary apparatus      ;  but you       see  nothing    to warrant    the
accepted notion that they are respiratory organs.                 I certainly
saw nothing of the kind.            It was a doubt which early forced
itself upon me.         Zoologists class the Eolis among Nudi-
branchiates, but      I  could detect nothing like a gill in these
said naked-gilled molluscs        ;  and a series of dissections served
to transform doubt into a conviction, and satisfactorily proved
                                        "
the term " branchial papillae               to be altogether erroneous.
These papillae have neither the specific                 structure, nor the
anatomical connection of gills.               Various as gills are, they
have uniformly a system of vessels carrying                    the blood to
them for aeration,        and a system of vessels              carrying   the
aerated blood from them.            Have the papillae of the Eolis such
vessels  ?  Nothing of the kind.           The blood they receive, which
is not more than other parts of the body, is received into
 sinuses, as  it is in the peritoneal cavities ; and it is not more
 aerated   there than it is in every other part of the mantle
 from which the papillae rise.            If, therefore,   we can detect in
 these papillae neither the ordinary structure              of gills, nor the
 vessels which carry blood to and from gills,                it is eminently
 unphilosophic to call them gills, and to class the Eolids among
 Nudibranchiates.
    Do but examine one of the other Nudibranchiates — say a
 Doris — and you will there find the very characteristics want
 ing in the Eolis.           It  has    a   gill, distinct, unmistakable;
 although even here the gill performs but a small part in the
 aeration of the whole           blood.       According to Alder and
 Hancock, only that portion of the blood which supplies the
 liver-mass goes to the         gill ; but small     as the part may be,

             HOW    DOES     THE EOLIS BREATHE?                    107
 the organ is distinctly recognisable, and to compare          it with
 the dorsal papillae    of the Eolis is to demonstrate that two
 such dissimilar organs cannot play the same part.            Indeed,
 the Doris seems to me higher in the scale of organisation
 than the Eolis, although less active in its movements.              It
 has a specialised   liver, a more perfect vascular system, the
 commencement of a respiratory system           ; and  it has not the
 arborescent intestines which the Eolis has in common with
 the Planarice and Pycnogonidce.           I  should propose, there
 fore, to remove the    Eolis from the Nudibranchiates, and call
 it Abranchiate.
     How, then, does the Eolis breathe ?         He does not breathe
 at all.   But lest this paradox should disturb you too much,
 I will soften the blow by adding, that when we talk of an
 animal breathing, we mean, or ought to mean, that it employs
 an organ, or group     of organs, for the aeration of its blood        ;
 and when the animal is of so simple an organisation that            it
 possesses no such    organ, although the aeration takes place
 quite as well,  it does so   in a different manner.      Respiration
 as an  animal function, and Respiration as a general property
 of tissue, are incessantly confounded       in our loose language     ;
 but the distinction should always be borne in mind.              The
 ultimate fact of Respiration is the interchange of gases, and
 this may be effected in many ways         ;  but although the final
result is similar, there is great difference between the property
which all living tissues, animal and vegetable, have of ex
changing    carbonic acid for oxygen, and the function of the
special apparatus by which the exchange is brought about              ;

property of Assimilation, and the special function of Diges
tion.    The Eolis we are considering          must have its blood
aerated   ;  but the means by which it is aerated do not come
under the term " breathing."         In many of the lower animals
aeration is performed entirely          by the surface,    the air or
water directly bathing the delicate tissues, and bringing to
them the necessary supply of oxygen, without the interven
tion of any special apparatus        ;   just as food is brought to
their tissues without the preparatory labour              of arduous
digestion.      The Eolis has not only a delicate surface, covered
with vibratile     cilia, which permits the aeration of all the
blood circulating      at the surface,   but it has also a system of
aquiferous pores round the margin of its broad foot, or fleshy
disc,  through     which   water is carried into the peritoneal
cavities and there aerates the blood, — at least       I assume   this
latter part of the description to be true of all Eolids, as      it is
of the Doris, although        I only observed      the pores in one
species,    not having thought of seeking them until my last
animal was under the scalpel.
    Having made thus much clear to myself,            I found  that  I
was not so heretical as     I fancied, but that, for the main facts
on which my argument rested,           I  could claim the authority
of even Alder and Hancock.            These admirable authors dis
                "
tinctly say, the respiratory function appears to be partially

But as the blood in its return to the heart appears to pass
almost entirely through the skin, which is thin and delicate,

and also covered with cilia, there can be little doubt that the
whole surface      of the body assists in aeration."       After this,
it seems to me that these authors need        only reflect a moment
on the absence      of gill-structure  in the papillae, to perceive
at   once    the impropriety      of designating those      organs as
branchial, and of including the Eolis among Nudibranchiates.
For although the papillae expose a large surface to the air,
they only do so in common with the rest of the integument              ;
mere extent      of surface does not constitute a gill   ;  nor  will a
merely respiratory surface constitute         one.    The    frog, for
example, respires      by the skin, as well as by the lungs, but
we do not call its skin a lung, because a lung has a specific
structure, widely differing from the structure of the skin.
    In their   magnificent monograph, Messrs Alder and Han
cock say   :
               " The order Nudibranchiata is restricted to those
animals bearing the character assigned           to   it by Cuvier     ;
namely, the possession        of distinct external and uncovered
gills."    But we have just seen that it is precisely this
character which is      wanting in the Eolids    ;  nor do    I under
stand   how these learned authors come to include Eolids
among     the    Nudibranchiates,    unless they also proposed to
annihilate the very terms of their definition.         If  the Eolids
have   not distinct external and uncovered gills — no gills at
all, in fact — they cannot lawfully claim a place among the
Naked-gilled Molluscs.
    The reader     will understand that at the   coast, where these
dissections were made,       I  had but a scanty supply of books
 to aid me, and that on returning home a diligent search was
 made,  with a view of ascertaining what had been already

noted on this point.             Owen and Siebold assured me that               I was
right in denying the Eolids anything properly to be styled a
       The former        " In certain small shell-less marine

genera— e. g. Rhodope,                 Tergipes,        Eolidina — no distinct
respiratory organs have been detected                    ;   these form the     order
Apneusta."             Professor      Owen     enters        into no details     ;    he
simply asserts the fact, that no distinct organs exist.                              Sie
bold follows Kolliker, who establishes the order Apneusta,
" in
     opposition to the other Gasteropoda, which have dis
tinct respiratory organs."               But the only reason adduced by
him seems to me far from cogent; and                           I   can understand
how Alder and Hancock, who must have been perfectly aware
of the position taken by Kolliker and Siebold, might alto
gether disregard it.              Siebold says that the opinion respect
                                         " is untenable, since
ing the branchial nature of the papillae
it   has been shown that they contain prolongations                           of the
digestive         canal."*       I   believe   it to     be untenable,        simply
because the papillae contain none                   of the distinctive characters
of gills      ;   did they possess these, the fact of their also con
taining       digestive prolongations would not deprive them of
their rank as gills          ;   any more than the fact of the heart, in
some Molluscs,           allowing the intestine to pass through                       it,
deprives      it   of cardiac dignity.
     Quitting this discussion for topics more surprising, let us
fix our attention on one fact, cursorily indicated on                     a   preced
ing page, namely, the existence, in the foot of the Doris, of
a    system       of pores through which the water enters into the
general cavity of the body.                    It    is
                                                     a       fact which   has        not

                     WATER        ENTERING THE BLOOD.                                           Ill
excited sufficient notice.                    Consider    it,   for   a    moment, and
you will remark that water entering the general cavity must
mingle with the blood, and that largely.                          But
                                                                                 if

thus freely with the blood, on its entrance,                           willIt it it   not also
on     its exit carry away          a   portion of the blood           ?            will, and
does, as any one may prove experimentally.                                  Agassiz             has
described       it   in detail, apropos of the Mactra* and suggests
that the pores of the fish may have                      a   similar office.               In the
Actinice and Accdephce                   the free passage of water to and
fro    is   well known.          In     several    Annelids (Eunice, Nereis,
&c.),  I     have    little doubt that the openings which exist on
each side        of the body, between every two feet, and which
permit the passage of the ova into the surrounding water,
are aquiferous tubes, through which the water passes to and
fro.        These openings were first described                       by Kathke'           ;   and
Siebold admits that through them the water may probably
pass.        M. Quatrefages,            however,    a    great authority               on the
subject of Annelids,              is    disposed to deny the existence                           of
                            " J'ai vu chez l'Eunice

fortunate         enough to         have seen, has              several      times been
witnessed by me.            I    have seen the eggs issuing from these
openings, the existence                of which he        is    inclined to dispute               ;

and inasmuch as these            eggs     may be           seen   floating       in the
general cavity of the body, before they issue through the
openings at the side, there seems little room for doubt on
the point.     As to there being           an habitual            communication
between the general cavity           and the external water, through
these openings, M. Quatrefages peremptorily denies                           it,   with
out assigning his reasons.           His   mere assertion            is   of weight   ;
but for the present    I    am strongly           inclined to believe there
is   an habitual   communication, because, besides                        ova,
                                                                             I     have
seen the diffusion     of chylaqueous globules in the water, on
the glass slide bearing     a   Nereid.
     That an animal should suck up water into his body                                is
intelligible enough    ;    the water may serve for purposes of
aeration, nutrition,    locomotion,         &c.   :   it     may give the blood
its oxygen, the tissues its organic substances                        in solution,
the shell its salts, and      it     may serve as             a   fulcrum for the
animal's progression.        But when           it    is   pressed      out of the
body — as in some animals            it    is   with great frequency and
rapidity — will there not be         a    spontaneous phlebotomy, of a
rather dangerous nature          ?       That   is    the question.              Wiser
heads may answer       it
                        ;    enough for me to have propounded it,
and to have called the reader's                 attention to        a     point very
interesting in the history of the development of the animal
series.     Hereafter (Part      III.,    Chap.       II.)    we shall have           to
consider,    more closely, the relation of sea-water                      to the cir
culating nutritive fluids    ;    for the present let us be content
with the idea that, in at least three divisions of the animal
kingdom, water directly mingles with the blood, and quits

SUDDEN    ENTHUSIASM     FOR      THE   ANEMONES   — IMPERFECT      STATE    OF     OUR
     KNOWLEDGE— LITERATURE OF THE           SUBJECT— NO DISTINCTION          BETWEEN

     AND INSTINCTS   —IS IT VIVIPAROUS ONLY?— VARIATIONS               OF COLOUR.
Since the British mind was all alive and trembling with
that zoological        fervour excited by the appearance                      of the
hippopotamus         in Eegent's Park,             no        animal has touched
it to    such   fine issues       and    such exuberant enthusiasm as
the lovely Sea-Anemone, now the ornament                            of countless
drawing-rooms,         studies,     and back parlours, as well as the
delight of unnumbered amateurs.                    In glass tanks and               ele
gant vases of various device,              in finger-glasses and common
tumblers,       the lovely creature may be seen expanding its
coronal of tentacles, on mimic rocks, amid mimic forests of
algae,   in mimic oceans — of pump-water and certain mixtures
of chlorides and carbonates, regulated by a " specific gravity
test."    Fairy fingers minister to its wants, removing dirt
and slime from its body, feeding       it with bits of limpet or raw
beef; fingers, not      of fairies, pull it about with the remorse
less curiosity    of science, and experiment on                  it,   according to
the suggestion of the moment.                At    once pet, ornament, and
"
    subject for dissection," the Sea- Anemone has                   a    well estab
lished popularity in the British family-circle; having the

116                            SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
advantage over the hippopotamus                    of being somewhat less
expensive,         and less troublesome, to keep.             Were Sea-cows
as    plentiful as Anemones, one could not make pets of them
with the same comfort.                  There would be objections to Potty
in the drawing-room.                   There would be embarrassments             in
the commissariat.                       be insurgents among the
                                    There would
domestics      ;   for the best-tempered Jane might find it impos
sible to endure the presence of such a pet, and might reso
lutely refuse to bring up his water, and clean out his crib                          ;
whereas, although the red-armed Jane thinks you a little
cracked when you introduce " them worm things" into your
house, she keeps her opinions                 within the circle of the kit
chen, and consents to receive her wages                   without a murmur.
     It   is difficult to say what occasioned             this sudden      enthu
siasm for Anemones              :   lovely, indeed, but by no means the most
lovely, and certainly not the most interesting wonders                           of
the deep.          Mr   Gosse by his pleasant books, and         Mr Mitchell
by his tanks in the Regent's Park Zoological                   Gardens, have
mainly contributed to the diffusion of the enthusiasm                      ;   and
now that enterprise has made a commercial branch of                        it,   we
may consider the taste established,               for at least some years.
     One good result of this diffusion             will   be an extension        of
our knowledge, not only of these, but of many other of the
simpler animals.               For several years the writings of zoologists
have given         a   place    to observations on the Anemones            ;   but
the observations have been incomplete, and all handbooks
and treatises which repeat these observations are, very natu
rally, crowded with errors.                 To give the reader an idea of
the state of current opinion               on this one topic,   it   is   enough

                   ERRORS ABOUT ANEMONES.                                     117
to mention that in one admirable handbook, the second page,
devoted to adescription of the habits of the Anemone, contains
six distinct errors: yet this is no fault of the compiler; he
states    what preceding writers state, and his excellent sum
mary of what is known bears the date of 1855.                       If the habits
have been so imperfectly observed,                  you may guess what a
chaos the anatomy          and physiology          of this animal present.
Such being the state of the case, we may hope that the wide
diffusion of a taste for vivaria            will in a little while furnish
Science with ample material              ;  and meanwhile, as many of
my readers are possessors of vivaria, actual or potential, and
will certainly not content themselves with blank wonder
ment, but will do their utmost to rightly understand the
Anemones,        even   if they make no wider incursions on the
domains of the zoologist, they              will perhaps      be interested     if
I   group together the results of investigations, pursued at
Ilfracombe       and Tenby during            the summer of 1856, and,
with    less energy, because      with less prodigality of specimens,
during the autumn and winter at home; adding thereto
some corrections derived during the spring and summer of
1857.      In   the present state of knowledge, the independent
observations of every one who has had any experience can
not but be welcome.
    The literature of the subject is extensive                   if   we include
all the passing notices        made        by naturalists from Aristotle
downwards ; but the capital works are few.                     What Aristotle
says   of them is accurate enough for the most part,* although

probably other passages, but these are all   I have  been able to find.

118                         SEA-SIDK STUDIES.
the details are scanty.              Owing to his commentators being
less accurately informed than he was, they have misunderstood
the passage wherein he speaks of the sea-nettles                           quitting
their rocks in quest of food at night, and have supposed that
he alluded to the Medusae.                 But by axaXrtfn he indubitably
meant the Actiniae as well as the Medusae;                     and he was right
in saying they sometimes               quitted the rocks to which they
had fixed themselves.               Rondelet adopted Aristotle's term of
 Urticce marines, adding to               it the epithet of        adfixce, to dis
 tinguish them from the errant Medusae.                       Reaumur in 1710
began to investigate them more seriously than any of his
 predecessors        had done    ;  but the Abbe* Dicquemare must be
 counted as the first            good authority on the subject.                  He
 furnished        the most extensive and reliable information,                     in
 three papers of the Philosophical Transactions for the years
 1773, 1775, and 1777.                The name of        Actinia was adopted
 by Linnaeus           from     Patrick Brown,           and     has since     been
 universally accepted.             The reader will understand, therefore,
 that Sea Anemone and Actinia are convertible terms, and
 may be employed indifferently.                    In   1809,     Spix published
 an account of the anatomy of the Actinia, which was, how
 ever, very faulty        ;  its announcement of the discovery of a
 nervous system           has long been rejected.               It  was not even
 accepted by        Delia Chiaje, the next writer of authority, whose
  Memorie sulla storia            e  notomia degli animali invertebrati

portant publication, was that of Professor Rapp,* which may
still be read with profit, and was only displaced by Dr John
ston's elaborate History of British Zoophytes ; and this in
turn will have to give way to Mr Gosse's " Monograph on
Sea Anemones," when that much-expected                                                  work makes its

his Tenby, contain valuable notices.                                          Mr Tugwell's Manual
of    the    Sea Anemones usually found on                                        the   English Coast is
specially addressed                       to amateurs,              and contains useful infor

excellence.                  Of   a rigorously scientific character are the two
memoirs published by M. Hollard, one " On the anatomy of
the Actinia,                "f and      the other Etudes Zoologiques                           sur   le genre

to be refused.              It   is
                                 a    book to make a naturalist languish with desire.

This work contains                three    coloured plates, which were thought admirable in
those       days,      but which our progress                in the art of illustration          throws into
the shade.

works just mentioned are,                    I   believe,    all the reliable original
sources      of information             on the structure          and habits of the
Sea     Anemones        ;   and they all contradict each other with
great freedom, so that the student need not be surprised                                      if
he, in turn, is forced to oppose a flat denial to many a posi
tive assertion.             In the      course       of the present volume such
flat denials     will   be frequent.
   It   must be assumed                 at starting          that the reader knows
what a Sea Anemone                is,   in aspect at least.          No description
will avail, in default of direct observation                        ;   even pictures
only give an approximate                     idea   ;   while   to those who have
seen neither picture nor animal      will be of little use to
                                                        it

                                             is    a
one extremity to            a   rock, while the free end                is   surmounted
by numerous tentacula arranged in several                                rows, which,
when expanded, give the animal the appearance of                                 a   flower."
Assuming,        then, that you know the general aspect of the
Actinia, you may follow                      my description        of the animal's
bearing and habits.
  How do     I    know that             it   is    an animal, and not            a    flower,
which   it   so much resembles               ?      No one yet has been able to
distinguish, in the face of severe critical precision, between
the animal and plant-organisation,                       so as to be able authori
tatively     to say,        "This       is       exclusively    animal."         To dis
tinguish     a   cow from        a      cucumber requires, indeed,                   no pro
found      inauguration           into

whatever is hanging         over the assertion) that the cow and
cucumber are not allied — no common parentage              links them
together,      even   through   remote relationship     ;  but   to say
what is an animal, presupposes            a knowledge      of what is
essentially      and exclusively   animal   ;  and   this   knowledge
unhappily has never yet been reached.             Much hot, and not
wise, discussion has occupied the hours of philosophers in
trying to map out the distinct         confines of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms, when all the while             Nature knows of
no such demarcating lines.         The    Animal     does   not exist    ;
nor does        the  Vegetable  : both   are   abstractions,    general
terms, such as Virtue, Goodness,         Colour,   used   to designate
certain groups of particulars,        but having      only   a   mental
existence.       Who has been      fortunate    enough to      see   the
 Animal      ?  We have seen cows, cats, jackasses, and camelo-

 menagerie.       If you are tempted to call this metaphysical
 trifling,   I beg you to read the discussions published on the
 vegetable     or animal nature of Diatomaceae, Volvocinae, &c.,
 or to attend to what is said in any text-book on the dis
tinctions between animals and vegetables, and you will then
see    there is something more than metaphysics in the para
dox.       In the simpler organisms there is     no mark which can
absolutely distinguish       the animal from the vegetable         ; and
if   in the higher organisms a greater amount of character
istic differences may be traced, so that we may, for purposes
of    convenience,     consider a certain     group    of indications
as entitling the object to be classed            under the Animal
division,      we   must never forget      that  such     classification

are   purely     arbitrary,          and as the philosophers                say   — sub
jective.
   Now what are                 the characteristic           marks        of the Sea
Anemone, which entitle                   it to    be removed from the hands
of the botanist,           and placed in those                    of the    zoologist     ?
Rymer       Jones declares               that its       animal    nature     "is    soon
rendered evident," this evidence                       being the manifestation of
sensibility.         "A    cloud veiling the                sun    will    cause    their
tentacles to fold as though apprehensive of danger from
the passing shadows."                    Unhappily,         the fact alleged is a
pure fiction     ;    and, were          it true, would not distinguish the
Actiniae from those plants which close their petals in the
dark.      A   fiction, however,           it    is,   as any one may verify.           If
Actiniae have been seen to fold up their tentacles when                                 a
cloud has passed before the sun, this has been                        a    coincidence,
not   a   causal relation       ;   so far from          light being the necessary
condition of their expansion, they are in perfect expansion
in the darkness        ;   and      if   the venturous naturalist will, with
the solemn chimes of midnight                          as accompaniment, take        his
lantern on the rocks, he                 will find all the Anemones in full
blossom.     I       said that Rapp             might still be read with profit.
Hear him on this point.                          " Many Zoophytes,
                                                                   although
without eyes, possess the power of distinguishing light from
darkness.       This has long been asserted                        of the Actiniae,
nevertheless,        on some species,           it   appeared to me that          neither
light nor       darkness            exercised          any appreciable influence.
Actinia plumosa, which              I     often watched on the western coast
of Norway, expanded                  its tentacles equally in the dark, as
when  I     removed        it   suddenly from darkness into direct sun

light.         The     Actinia depressa suddenly                     collapsed       when
direct     sunlight was allowed to fall on it."                           I   have re
peatedly tried the experiment of over-shadowing the pool
in which the Actiniae were expanded, but never saw them re
tract their tentacles in consequence.                  The reader        will not     sup
pose that        I   mean to deny the sensitiveness                   of the Actiniae.
I am     merely answering an argument which several writers
have repeated            respecting the alarm felt by the Actiniae
when a cloud veils the sun, or                 a   shadow affects them.
     But the Anemone must be an animal, you suggest, be
cause    it is   seen to catch and swallow other animals.                            This,
however, is no proof.                 Although the Anemone entraps its
prey, or anything              else that may come             in contact with its
tentacles, this          is    no     proof    of animality       ;     the sensitive
plant, known as the Flytrap of Venus (Dioncea muscipula),
has a precisely analogous power                    ;   any insect, touching the
sensitive hairs on the surface of its leaf, instantly causes the
leaf to shut up and enclose the insect, as in a trap                             ;   nor is
this all   :   a mucilaginous secretion acts like a gastric juice on
the captive, digests                it,   and renders    it    assimilable by the
plant, which          thus feeds on the victim, as the Actinia feeds
on the Annelid or Crustacean                  it   may entrap.          Where, then,
is   the difference      ?      Neither seeks its food           :    place   the food
within    a    line's breadth of the tentacles,                or of the sensitive
hairs, and so long as actual contact                    is   avoided, the grasping
of the food will not take place.                       But you object, perhaps,
that this mode                of feeding      is   normal      with the Actinia,
exceptional          with the Flytrap.                 The plant, you say,              is
nourished by the earth and air, the animal depends on what

124                     SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
it can secure.        Not   so.   For granting — what, in fact,               I
sturdily dispute— that the Flytrap is in no way dependent
upon such insect food as may fall into its clutch, we shall
still observe the Actinia in similar independence.                  Keep the
water free from all visible food, and the Actiniae continue
to flourish and propagate just as             if  they daily clutched an
unhappy worm.          The fact is well known, and is currently,
but   erroneously, adduced         as   illustration of the animal's
power of fasting.        But there is no fasting in the matter.
In this water     free from visible       aliment there is abundance
of invisible     aliment, — infusoria,       spores,    organic particles,
&c. which the animal assimilates, much                in the same way as
plants assimilate the organic material diffused through the
soil and atmosphere.        Filter the water carefully, and remove
from   it all growing vegetation, and you will find the animal
speedily dying, however freely oxygen may be supplied.                      It
is on this account that when we make artificial                    sea-water,
it is necessary to     allow  algae   to grow in       it for   some two or
three weeks before putting in the animals                 ;  the water be
comes charged      with organic material.
   Mere sensibility      and capture of food, therefore,             are not
the distinguishing      marks we seek, since the plant is found
to possess them as perfectly as the animal.                 Is spontaneous
locomotion      a sufficient    mark   ?    No    ;  and for these        two
reasons   :   Some animals have no such power                ;  some plants,
and all     spores,   have   it.    There      are   animals       which   no
botanist    has   ever   claimed   — the      Ascidians,       for  example,
which can scarcely be said to exhibit any motion at all (the
rhythmic     contraction    and expansion of their orifices not

deserving the name)                  ;   their whole lives are spent rooted
to the rock or shell, as firmly as the plant is rooted in the
earth.         Nay, even with regard to the Anemones, it is said
by  Dr Landsborough, Dr Carpenter, and others, that they
will not move towards the water, should the vessel be
gradually emptied, or the water evaporate, not even                                if their
tentacles          can    reach      its surface.        This is incorrect      ;   but    I
mention        it   as one       of the difficulties which would meet the
student in the way of distinguishing                             the Anemone from
plants.            It    is   one    of the       many      inaccurate      statements
grounded on imperfect observation, which are repeated                                     in
hand-books.               The       original    observer probably           noticed       an
Anemone some time out of the water, making no effort to
return     ;       had the observation               been    continued,      the doubt
would have been solved.                         Some Anemones, especially the
Common Smooth species (Mesembryanthemum),                                    are accus
tomed daily to be left out of water by the receding tide, so
that in captivity they may be supposed                             rather to enjoy an
occasional          air-bath.        I   have    repeatedly seen mine crawl out
of the water and settle on the edge of the glass, or pan, high
and    dry     ;    but they descended again after a few hours.                        The
locomotion of the Anemones                        is,   however,    various in various

a    distance       ;   they can even change                their place      by gliding

upon the disc that supports them, or detaching themselves
entirely, and swelling themselves                     with water, they become
nearly of the           same specific          gravity     as    the element they
inhabit, and the least agitation is sufficient to drive them
elsewhere.        Reaumur even asserts, that they can turn them
selves so as to use their tentacles as feet, crawling upon the
bottom of the sea; but this mode of progression has not
been observed          by subsequent naturalists."                    Yes,  Dr John
ston once saw        it   ;   I also witnessed an Anthea moving thus                       ;

and this      it probably        owes to its more solid tentacles.*
    Again the question recurs, How then do we know the
 Anemone to be an animal                   ?— in     other words, what charac
teristic marks guide zoologists in classing it in that division                            ?

 however, suffice, and            if you please we         will continue to        speak
 of the Anemone as an animal, and, what is more, a very car
 nivorous animal, eating most things that come within reach,
   * Rapp, loc. eit. p. 44, says he has often witnessed it        ; but he only mentions
 the Anthea     as possessing      the power.     Aristotle,  as  we  have  seen,   makes
special mention    of it.
   f  It is unnecessary     to particularise these anatomical marks, which will occur
 to the mind of every        student, as belonging exclusively to that division of
animated beings which manifest the group of phenomena baptised by the name
of Animality.     Wherever you find muscular tissue, or an alimentary canal, you
are absolutely certain that nothing belonging to what finds its place               in the
group of marks which indicate the vegetable kingdom, is before you.               In  func
tion there is often considerable       resemblance    between    Plant and Animal     ; but
in structure the differences       early manifest themselves, growing greater as the
scale ascends.   Although, therefore, at the bottom of the scale no distinguished
characteristic isolates     animals   from   plants,  as we ascend the scale       we find
many definite marks by which the two groups may be known.

               VORACITY OF THE ANEMONE.                              127
from limpets to worms, from fish to roast beef.           It has   even
a reputation for voracity, not to say gourmandise            ; in the
matter of shell-fish     it would put     even Dando to the blush.
Dr Johnston, in his valuable History of British Zoophytes,
relates this anecdote   :
                           " I had  once brought to me a specimen
of Actinia crassicornis that might originally have been two
inches in diameter, and that had somehow contrived                    to
swallow     a valve  of Pecten maximus of the size of an
ordinary saucer.     The shell fixed within the stomach was so
placed as to divide   it completely into two      halves, so that the
body stretched tensely over had become thin and flattened
like a pancake.     All    communication       between the inferior
portion of the stomach and the mouth was of course pre
vented  ;  yet instead of emaciating and dying of an atrophy,
the animal had availed itself of what had undoubtedly been a
very untoward     accident,   to increase   its enjoyments and its
chance    of double fare.     A  new mouth furnished with two
rows of numerous tentacles was opened upon what had been
the base, and led to the under stomach          — the individual    had
become a sort    of Siamese Twin, but with greater intimacy
and extent in its unions."       Such is the blind voracity of this
animal, that anything and everything is carried straightway
into its stomach to be there tried, and rejected only on
 proved incompatibility.
   One day, while sorting and distributing to their respective
jars the animals captured during the morning's hunt,             I  was
called into the balcony by the agitated entreaties of lovely
Sixteen, exclaiming,      " Oh, do come      ! do come, and rescue

128                        SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
the rescue,        and found a large beetle            struggling    in the
clutches     of a green Anthea not much larger than himself.
" The beetle is the victim,"          I quietly told Sixteen, who, not
having profound sympathies with beetles, was pacified as
she    saw the struggling            insect  slowly    passing     into   the
stomach      of the Anthea, his struggles growing               fainter and
fainter, and finally ceasing altogether,          till at last we saw    him
with head and thorax engulfed in the ravenous maw, his
abdomen       sticking up in the air.
    A  question of great interest and some intricacy here pre
 sents   itself  :   Was     the beetle   paralysed by some peculiar
 poison secreted        from    the tentacles     of the Anemone? — a
 question which          opens     into this    wider    one  :  Have     the
 Polypes      the mysterious        power,    almost universally        attri
buted to them,          of   paralysing     with a touch the victims
 they may grasp, so that, should the victim escape from the
grasp,    it is only to    die presently from the fatal touch        ?   The
power of fascination possessed by some animals, of poisoning
possessed      by others,      of electrical discharges possessed by
others, naturally lead men to interpret certain observations
made on the Polypes, as proofs that they, too, possess                  some
such power       :  and this suggestion gains a more ready credence
from the tendency in most minds to welcome every unex
plained phenomenon as indicating                 an occult cause.        This
 witch-like     power of fascination, — this power of paralysing
with    a   touch, appeals       to our imagination,       and gains easy
access to belief.        But the spirit of scientific scepticism forces
me to declare         that, as far as my observations and experi
ments extend,         there is nothing       like evidence in favour of

this power, much evidence against it.              Some Anemones cer
tainly appear to sting — as some jelly-fish sting — although the
majority have no such effect upon our hands, which every one
knows who has handled them.               I  never perceived this sting
ing sensation myself             and Dr Landsborough                   " From
                             ;                                says  :
my own experience           I   can say nothing      as to     this stinging
power    ;  for though    I    have handled not only the commoner
Actiniae, but also the larger and less common Anthea,                          I
never    felt anything      approaching to stinging          ;   but  I  never
touched a tentaculum          without perceiving the tip of it had
 some prehensile property           by which it took a slight hold of
the skin     of the finger, causing a kind of rasping feeling when
 withdrawn.        It may   be,   however, that the fangs had not fair
 play with my fingers,          if somehow or other they are sting-
 proof." *     He then makes the following quotation from Mrs
 Pratt's    Chapters on the Common Things                 of    the Sea-side,
 which     I  reproduce as positive and direct testimony                 :

 appears that different persons are variously affected even by
 touching the same Actiniae.             The author had placed             in a
 vessel  of sea-water a fine specimen of the fig marygold sea-
 anemone, which        she was accustomed          to touch many times
 during the day.        The tentacula closed immediately round the
 intruding finger, producing only a slight tingling.                  Her sur
 prise was great at finding that the same anemone,                   on being
 touched by another person,           communicated a more powerful
 sensation,     which her friend        assured    her was felt up the
 whole of the arm.        More than twenty persons touched this

Anemone         ; and the writer was amused                  by observing how
variously they were affected, some being only slightly tingled,
while others started back as                if stung by a nettle."        I think,
in the face of testimony so precise as this, we may waive
all negative          evidence,      and accept      the fact of stinging as
proven*
    But now comes the question                   :  Is this stinging produced
by poison-vesicles and spicula, as the great majority of
writers maintain ; or is it no more poisonous than the
pricking of a thorn?                    Those who maintain            the former
opinion, explain by           it the alleged     cases of paralysis exhibited
by the animals which have escaped in the struggle                       ; and the
incident just related of the beetle killed, but not swallowed,
seems entirely to favour such                  a conclusion.       Nevertheless,
from       subsequent investigations,              I  am led to oppose          the
opinion        in  toto.        Sir John Dalyell — one of the                 best
authorities      —thinks       that the Anemone conquers its prey by
mere strength, and not by any poisonous fluid.                        He is some
what exaggerated,            however, in the statement of his opinion.
"                                " can
   Nothing," he says,                     escape their deadly touch.        Every
animated being that comes in slightest contact is instantly
caught, retained, and mercilessly devoured."                         This is mere
rhetoric     :   animals, even such as form their natural prey, con
stantly touch the tentacles — nay, are even caught, and yet
escape.        "Neither strength nor size, nor the resistance of
the victim, can daunt the ravenous captor.                        It  will readily
grasp an animal which,                  if endowed     with similar strength,

advantage,     and resolution,       could certainly     rend its body
asunder.     It  is in the highest degree carnivorous.            Thence
do all the varieties     of the smaller finny tribes, the fiercest of
the Crustacea,      the whole      vermicular     race, and the softer
tenants among the testacea, fall a prey to the Actiniae."            One
is astonished to meet with such a passage from so accurate
an observer.        It  is pure exaggeration,        which   succeeding
writers have accepted as literal truth.             Thus, Rymer Jones
             " no sooner are the tentacles touched
says, that                                                 by a passing
animal, than      it is   seized  and held with unfailing pertina
city."    Had the learned professor given his attention to
Anemones he would know that, so far from the grasp being
"unfailing," it as often fails as succeeds, when the captive is
of tolerable activity       ; and very noticeable is the fact, that
when the animals escape, they escape               unhurt:     a fact  in
direct contradiction to the belief in a poison secreted by the
tentacles.
    I resolved to bring this question to the test, and dropped
a  tiny crab, rather smaller than a fourpenny piece, on the
tentacles   of my largest Crassicomis (nearly as large as a glass
tumbler).     He was clutched at once, and the tentacles began
to close round him      ;  he struggled     vigorously, and freed him
self after a few seconds.           Placed there a second       time, he
again got away.        I waited to see if any symptoms of paralysis
would declare themselves after this contact, but he was as
lively as ever.     Later in the day      I  placed him on the tenta
cles  of the voracious Anthea, the most powerful of all the
Anemones, and the only one which seems to sting               ; but the
crab was too active, or too       little appetising   ; he got away as

132                              SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
before.     I    tried another Anthea and a Daisy                      (Actinia bellis),
but with the same result.                  In each    case the crab was clutched,
but in each       case he        got away unhurt.               I   then chose another
crab, not more than              half the size of the former, and certainly
no match         in point of strength for the Anemone, yet after
being embraced and carried to the mouth,                             I observed      the crab
slowly appear from the unfolding tentacles, and scuttle away
with great activity.
     This experiment casts a doubt on what is asserted by all
writers, namely that Anemones feed on crabs.  Rymer Jones
             "
records that   they will devour a crab as large as a hen's
egg."       Has any one ever seen a live crab caught and eaten
by an Anemone            ?       I   confess never to have             seen    it,   and the
experiment just related disposes                      me to doubt         :   although      it
is    quite possible that my Anemones were dainty, because not
hungry, and refused food which, under less epicurean condi
tions, would have been welcome.                           If   any one has seen the
Anemone feeding on live crabs, that                        is   enough.        Meanwhile
I   think   it   right to propound the doubt, and to add to                           it   this
subsequent observation                 :   I   took   a    tiny Crustacean, of the
shrimp family, about half an inch in length, and dropped                                    it
in    a   vase    containing          some Daisies.             It    soon touched the
tentacles       of one of these, was drawn in, but almost imme
diately escaped.             It      then swam about until               it   touched the
largest Daisy, and was quickly                        engulfed.          As   it     had en
tirely disappeared,          I       expected   it   would be certainly killed              if
not eaten, but in            a   few moments         it   made its way out unhurt,
and swam away.               These Daisies had not been fed for at least
a    fortnight    ;   they had subsisted entirely on the invisible ali-

ment floating in the water                 :  yet they either could not, or
would not, eat this Crustacean.
   No one can have taken Anemones from the rocks without
observing fragments of small crabs, and sometimes whole
crabs,     as  big as crown pieces, in their stomachs                         ; but the
question whether            these      crabs     were captured alive by the
Anemones          is not thereby answered.                       Without absolutely
denying that the Anemone                     does thus capture them,              I am
forced     by repeated        observation and experiment, to declare
that the evidence          all points in the direction of a denial.                    I
remember once accidentally dropping                             a   tiny crab on the
expanded oral disc of a Crassicornis, whose mouth was wide
open   ;    and very amusing           it was to        see the    little creature rush
into the open mouth, settle himself comfortably there, and
begin twittering his antennae, as crabs do when their alarm
subsides.        The Crass never moved                   :  owing to the insensibi
lity of the stomach, he was quite undisturbed by this refugee
— in this by no means resembling the Cyclops of Euripides,
 who energetically repudiates the idea                            of swallowing      the
 satyr   :
                " You   in my stomach    ?    Horror,    if I had !
                                                                             *
                   Your capering antics    there would drive me mad."
 The crab remained twittering for some minutes.                               I touched
 him, and he retreated deeper down into the cavity.                             Looking
 into the pan some time after,                 I  found he had crawled away,

him.      I    then gave him to another Crass, who swallowed
him, but in a little while slowly unclosed his tentacles and let
him escape          ;   being apparently of the Cyclopean opinion that
the capering antics would produce a gastric fever.                                       Now,
it is quite possible that the Anemone, having clutched the
carcass   of a dead crab washed on to its tentacles, and having
swallowed       it,     as   it   swallows most objects once clutched, may
retain the carcass in its stomach, and quietly digest the flesh
thereof, as far as digestion                    is   possible, * yet be unwilling to
retain the live crab under similar                            circumstances, because of
the incessant struggles of the victim                          ;   and I    direct the atten
tion of students to the point, because                             if    any one witnesses
the capture and digestion,                        it   will   be enough to destroy all
negative evidence.
   On the question of food we may withhold our opinion                                       till
some more decisive evidence                       is   adduced     ;   but on the question
of the paralysing power said to reside in the tentacles, these
experiments surely determine                           a   negative.        In spite of the
beetle,   so completely vanquished, there                              is   the evidence      of
crabs and shrimps being                      in repeated contact with the tenta
cles, and      in nowise affected.
   While preparing these notes for the press,                            I    have been led
to extend the experiments                     ;   because, although         it   would by no
means necessarily                 follow that whatever was true of the Hy-
droid Polypes must also be true of the Anemones, yet                                   a   very
plausible suspicion might arise — and did indeed arise in my
mind — throwing doubt on results which were in contradic-

ous    arms     of their low-organised         captor,   seem     paralysed
almost immediately          after   they have      been    seized,   and so
countenance the opinion           of Corda, that the secretion of a
poison enters the wounds."             Such statements can only be
set   aside    by   direct Experiment      ;  and    the superiority      of
Experiment over mere Observation needs no argument.
    As a matter of observation,        I too  had been struck with the
fact noticed by Owen.           I saw   the tiny Water-fleas drop ap
parently lifeless to the bottom of the phial, after being some
time held by the tentacle of the Hydra           ;  and,  intently watch
ing them,     I  saw them at last swim away again as lively as
before.     I removed     a  Hydra from the phial, in a little water,
and placing     it on a slip of glass, allowed it to settle and expand
 there   for two hours, when         I added    several water-fleas     (Cy

pridce) to the little pond, and patiently watched them swim
ming to and fro.       Repeatedly they touched the tentacles in
their course, but were not hurt, were even not arrested.                  At
length one was caught, and held for some seconds                ;   it then
fell to the bottom, and remained motionless for at least two
minutes, after which it started up, and was off          as if its    course
had never been arrested.         This certainly had very much the
appearance     of a case of slight paralysis    ;  the animal seemed
arrested by some benumbing influence, which for two minutes
rendered     it powerless   ;  at the expiration     of that time it
seemed to have       sufficiently recovered   itself to swim away.
 If  Observation alone sufficed, in questions     so complex as those
of Biology, this observation would have confirmed the state
ments of Siebold, Corda, and Owen.           But observation alone
does not suffice.      I  bethought me of a simple experiment.
 With    a needle  I  gently arrested one of these water-fleas           ; it
 suddenly sank motionless, remained thus for more than a
 minute, and then darted off again.         Thrice     I  repeated      this
 act, and each time    with similar result.     Will   any one say the
 needle had a paralysing power, or a benumbing poison which
 was secreted when the animal came in contact with                it ? And
 does not the reader at once recognise       in this sudden motion-
 lessness  of the animal a very familiar phenomenon? The spider,
 the crab, the oniscus, and very many animals " sham dead,"
 as schoolboys know,         when danger threatens ; these water-
        "               "
 fleas    sham dead        when the Polype or the needle touches
 them.     I  might have rested my incredulity of the alleged
 paralysing influence on this one experiment         ; but   I confirmed
  it in other ways.      Dropping the larva of an Ephemeron into

the phial containing the Hydras,                          I observed it              thrice caught
by three different Hydrae                     ;   it did not " sham dead," but tore
itself away without visible hurt.                             Nay,    I also        observed one
of those animalcules known as "paste-eels” for some time
in contact with the tentacle of a Hydra, on the stage of the
microscope, but, in spite                    of its having no shell to protect it
from the poison,             it was unhurt by the contact.                            Not having
a Nai's,   I could not           test what Siebold says of                        it;     but what
has already been mentioned must,                              I think, suffice to convince
the reader that the current opinion                               is an error, founded on
Observation unverified by Experiment.                                     It   was   only by veri

some time   till   it   struggled itself free.          Not only    was   it   apparently unhurt by
this contact, but to-day       it   is   as lively as    it   was three days ago, just before the

debattant."*       And he nowhere mentions that the escaped
animals died, or gave any signs of having been paralysed by
contact with the tentacles.
   To sum up this discussion, we may say that ample testi
mony is afforded       in proof of the position that Anemones
have a certain      stinging power, the nature of which is not
yet ascertained,     but which is probably                 a   minor degree of
that possessed by some Jelly-fish.
   Direct experiment           and observation prove that                   neither
the Anemones,  nor the fresh-water Polypes, possess in any
degree the power of paralysing other animals.
      " But do tell us
                       something about the habits and instincts
of these Anemones," some light-minded reader suggests, im
patient of all discussion, and supremely indifferent                            to all
considerations save those of a moral order.                      Unhappily my
story is not ampler in detail, nor finer in complexity of
movement, than the story of Canning's " Knife-grinder" —
who had none to tell.          The Anemone is lovely, but even its
warmest admirers must confess                 it is   a   little monotonous in
its manifestations.        Existence          suffices it.     It   expands its
coronal of tentacles,      eats when chance               favours    it,   produces
offspring, which     it   sends forth, leaving them,                borne by the
many currents of the           sea, to   settle where they list, without
any fear of parental supervision, and thus lives to                         a    good

that     grim          lady suddenly to cut the thread.*                         Nor is it
easy to nudge the old lady's elbow.                            The Anemone               has
more lives than a cat.                 We have already seen (p. 19) how
it will resist slashing and amputation                         ;    and,      except    zoo
logists and the fierce little Eolis,                I know          no animal which,
finding its flavour agreeable,                cares to make a meal                     of it.
Yet curiously enough, this Anemone, whose vitality is so
remarkable, who may be hacked and hewed without appear
ing to suffer from              it,   dies almost immediately                 if   removed
from salt-water to fresh.                It will   live for days out of water,
but in fresh-water           it   will not live    at all.      There       is a   problem
for the physiologist.              He will probably          see    in   it   the effect of
endosmosis,            by which all the fluids in the tissue of the Actinia
are suddenly so diluted as to be rendered unfit for the vital
processes.
     The Anemone has little more than beauty to recommend
it
 ;     the indications          of intelligence being of by no means                       a
powerful order.              What then    ?    Is beauty nothing               ?    Beauty

like calf s-foot jelly    ;  the smell is somewhat like that of a

Mr    Gosse describes his      frying them in butter, if           I remember
rightly   ;  and although he felt a little difficulty in swallowing
the first mouthful     — probably      remorse,        and zoological tender
ness, gave him what the          Italians call a "knot in the throat"
— yet, having vanquished his              scruples,        he ate   with some
                              " horrified   "
relish.     Lady Jane is                          at the idea    of eating her
pets   ;  but   now that horse-flesh             is publicly sold in the
markets of Vienna           and other German towns, and public
banquets of        hippophagists       are    frequent       in France, will
Anemones long escape the frying-pan                  ?
    It   was hinted just now that the Anemone was but an in
different parent.       Having given birth to her offspring, she
spends no anxious hours over the episodes                  of infancy.   When
I  say She,   I  might as well say He, or           It, for no distinction of
sex exists, as we shall see presently           ;  and probably it is to this
cause that the parental indifference may be traced                   ; how, in
deed, can maternal tenderness and ceaseless vigilance be ex
pected, when the maternal           individual is as yet undeveloped           ?
The Actiniae are viviparous.            Indeed      I   suspect they are  only
viviparous, and not at all oviparous.                 Rymer Jones seems to
hesitate on the point, adding, "but            it is    asserted by numerous
authorities that the young are not unfrequently born alive."
I not    only assert this, but ask whether any one has ever seen

                   ARE ANEMONES                    OVIPAROUS?                       141
the contrary       ?    It   startled me, however, when, on opening
an Anemone,         I   for the first time saw a young one drop out,
and immediately expand its tentacles                   ;   and some days after
wards, as     I   was carrying          home a lovely
                                                            " Gem,"       I   saw first
one,    then two, three,          four, seven young ones issue from its
mouth, fix themselves at the bottom of the vase, and make
themselves        at home     ;    they were         of various sizes, and in
various stages of development.                    Since then,    I have   repeatedly
witnessed this mode of birth                  ;   and one day, seeing some
thing in the inside of the tentacle of a Daisy,                      I   snipped the
tentacle off, and found a young Daisy there.                            Some writers
imagine that the young issue through orifices at the tips of
the tentacles —a supposition                  not very credible.          The truth
 is,   that at the bottom of the stomach                   there   isa    large open
ing — not several minute openings as we                    see   figured in books —
through which the young pass from the general cavity into
the water     ;    and this appears           to me the only exit for the
young.       Without absolutely denying that the ova are ex
truded,     and their early development carried on out of the
parent's body,      I    have never been able to detect ova, except
within the parent.
  I     leave this passage as        it   originally appeared, although, at
Jersey,   I   was subsequently convinced that with respect to
one species,       at least, the doubt expressed                  should be with
drawn.        In   the water         of   a   pan containing,           among other
animals, specimens            of Actinia parasitica,             I   twice noticed
abundance         of light-purple ova floating at the surface.                   Some
of these were placed in             a   vase by themselves,         and others left
 in the pan; but no further development took place.                                One

142                     SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
day dissecting a   Parasitica,      I found   in its ovaries these very
purple ova which had occupied my attention.                   This seems
very like evidence that the Parasitica,          if no  other species, is
oviparous  ; and it is strengthened by the fact that, as far            as
my experience extends — and         I have had     scores  of specimens
— the Parasitica     is not viviparous.         The point needs eluci
dation, and the student may amuse himself with it — first by
endeavouring to prove the other species to be really ovi
parous,   as well as viviparous; secondly,              by ascertaining
whether the    Parasitica is viviparous.
   In the visceral cavity of      a smooth Anemone a young one
as large as a cherry was found         ; and to complete the marvel,
it was faintly striped with     green,   like the well-known "green
striped variety,"   although its parent was of a dark-brown
hue.    Could the old one have swallowed an errant youth by
mistake?     No.     It    had been      many     weeks in captivity,
where no such errant youths were within reach                  :  besides,
Anemones do not swallow each other, or              if they  should,  par
distraction, make a mouthful of a friend, they would quickly
throw him up again       :  cannibalism belongs to a higher grade
of social development.        Apropos of this peculiarity of colour,
I may remark    on the great variations observable         in the colour
of Anemones,      and the impropriety           of making colour the
distinguishing    mark of species.         Thus, to select a striking
example,    Mr  Gosse makes two distinct species          of the Orange
disked and Orange-tentacled Anemones, naming                   them    Ve
nusta and Aurora      ;  but as  if  to prove the indifference of all
 such   characteristics,    I  brought with       me    from Tenby an

                 COLOUR       NO   SPECIFIC      MARK.            143
 home     a fortnight,   I   discovered,   with great surprise, was
 changed into an Orange-tentacled — disc and tentacles being
 of a rich orange hue, the only traces of white remaining
just at the tips.      If  there had been any other specimen in
 the vase    I  might have doubted       ;  but having only one in
 company with a white Daisy, and a Smooth Anemone, there
 was no avoiding the conclusion.
    I have had an Anthea,        with brilliant green tentacles, turn
 to a pale grey in the course of two days, and back again to
 green  :  and a Weymouth Anemone turn from pearly-white
 to a soft reddish-brown.         In fact the  changes of colour, ex
 cept  in the Crassicornis, which appears to me to retain its
hues   with tolerable constancy, are far too frequent to admit
 of colour forming a specific character.

 Chaeles Lamb, in          one    of his exquisitely humorous letters,
remembering         the   prodigal      command       of paper which        he
enjoyed as a clerk in the India House, and comparing                   it with
his forced stinginess in that              article now he is no longer
clerk, refers to the probable feelings of Adam when purchas

Paradise.       Dr Johnson said that never but              once   in his life
had he found himself possessor of as much                   wall-fruit as he
could eat.      These two      lingering retrospects of former plenty
appeal to me forcibly        :   it is true that in the particular case
of apples, a matured taste, fortified by philosophy and modi
fied by dyspepsia,      renders one tolerably resigned to poverty
—and in      the case of wall-fruit, the reader, terrified by absurd
rumours as to the cholera-influences supposed inevitably to
issue from plums, peaches, apricots, and nectarines, may be
inclined to consider a limitation of quantity in the light of a
benefit — yet, as an abstract question, every one must admit

the significance which lies in an unstinted, noble,                     prodigal
abundance.        Books, for example        :   can we have too many           of
them, provided they be well selected              ?     Dogs    :  can they be
too populous        in our grounds? or horses — in our stables?
or friends — at convenient            distances? or children — in the
nursery?       or creditors — no, not         creditors, unless gathered
together in a general cataclysm.                 In    a word, is not abun
dance     in and for itself a grand advantage                ?    Painfully the
truth obtrudes itself upon me as                I  sit eyeing the solitary
 Anemone which mopes in a single vase upon my table, the
 last rose of summer, all its blooming                companions dissected
 and dead.       My thoughts take wing to Ilfracombe and Tenby,
 where foot-pans,         pie-dishes, soup-plates,          and vases, were
 crowded with specimens           of every variety of form and colour.
  I think of that paradisaic abundance, and sigh over this one
 unhappy       animal — the     mere    Mesopotamian            pennyworth    —
  partly     because    I   love plenteousness           in all things,      but
  mainly because      it is only with abundant             specimens     at com
  mand that Nature           can   be properly interrogated.              Fortu
  nately   I  made good use      of my specimens, but not so much as
  I  could make now       ;   and from my notes           I  will   select a few
  points for the student's consideration            ;  but as they     will refer
   solely to questions of anatomy and physiology, the reader is
   advised to skip the chapter, unless he feel some interest                   in
  such questions.
      Perhaps nothing        has excited more surprise on the part of
  the public, and nothing has been more unanimously believed
  by   anatomists,      than the hypothesis            that    certain    minute
   organs found      in all Polypes, and variously styled thread-

capsules, filiferous capsules, or urticating cells (Plate                               III.
fig.    5),   are organs      of urtication, or stinging.                    The uncritical
laxity with which this hypothesis has been accepted may
point    a     lesson.   I      do not allude to the acceptance                      of the
act     that certain capsules                   containing       threads are found in
Polypes       ;   but to the acceptance                   of the alleged purpose, or
function,         of these           capsules.         The    things are there,         sure
enough        ;   but whether they serve the urticating purpose,                           is
another matter.                Ever since they were first described                       by
Wagner,*          Erdl.f Quatrefages, and Siebold.J they have passed
without challenge.                    They have been detected in the whole
group of Polypes, in Jelly-fishes,                           in the papillae of Eolids,
and, according to Van der Hoeven, in Planariae                                ;   yet, as far
as my reading extends, not one single experiment has been
made to prove the function so unanimously admitted, not                                    a
single test has been applied to strengthen or controvert what
was,     indeed, very plausible, but only plausible,                           not proven.
Accordingly,            no sooner did           I      submit the question to that
rigorous verification which Science imperiously requires, than
it     became        clear    to me that my illustrious predecessors                      —
Wagner,           Erdl, Siebold, Quatrefages, Ehrenberg,                            Agassiz,
and Owen — men whom the most presumptuous would be
slow to contradict, had admitted the point without proof,
because        it   wore so plausible an air.                  Let me hope the reader
 will accuse me of no immodesty in thus controverting                                   men

  What are these "capsules,"                   or "urticating cells?"                The
uninstructed         reader may be told that all the Polypes                             are
supposed      to urticate, or sting, like nettles                ;   and the nettling
organs, or urticating cells, are supposed to be minute suboval
microscopic capsules,           quite transparent,               containing        within
them threads coiled up, which, on pressure, dart out to many
times the length of the capsule, into which they never return.
This thread Agassiz likens to a lasso thrown by the Polype
to secure its prey.         I will     not enter here into minute details
of structure, which would only confuse                           the reader, who,            if
curious,      will find all that is known, in the works of Mr
Gosse, or     in the treatises of Owen, Siebold, and Rymer Jones.
Any one who has once seen these threads under the micro
 scope darting        out with lightning-rapidity, especially                       if    he
 uses a high power,         will at     once admit that the hypothesis                       of
 the    "nettling" or "urtication" being performed by                               these
 threads is an hypothesis so obvious, an explanation so natu
 ral, that — it should be doubted.                   In all complex matters, we
 should mistrust         the obvious explanation                 ;   I do   not say that
 we should disregard, or reject                it,   but mistrust it.         When we
 know, on the one hand, that the Jelly-fish stings, and when,
 on the other hand, we know that                     it   is   furnished with numer
 ous capsules,       in which are coiled threads, to be seen darting out
 when pressed, the idea             of connecting the stinging with these
 threads      is   inevitable   ;   but this    is   not enough for Science              :   it
 is    only   a   preparatory guess, which proves nothing                      ;   it    may

We have already seen how erroneous was the supposition
that Polypes paralysed their victims with a touch, and that
poison was secreted by their tentacles         ; yet for this supposi
tion there was at least the evidence of partial observation,
whereas, for the supposition we have now to consider,              there
is absolutely no evidence at all.
                                                                        "
    On a survey of the places where these "urticating cells
are present, we stumble upon an            unlucky fact, and one in
itself enough to excite suspicion.         They are present in a few
Jelly-fish — which urticate     ;  in Actiniae —which urticate     ; and
in all Polypes — which,   if   they do not urticate, are popularly
supposed to do so, and at any rate possess some peculiar
power of adhesion.       In    all these cases, organ and function
may be said to go together.           But the cells are also present
in the majority of Jelly-fish, which do not urticate         ; in Eolids
— which     do not urticate   ;   and in Planariae — which do not
urticate.     Here, then, we have the organ, without any cor
                         "
responding function ;      urticating cells," but no urtication !
The cautious mind of Owen had already warned us that there
was something not quite satisfactory in our                supposition   ;
"some superaddition to the thread-cell would seem to be
essential   to the urticating faculty," he says, when speak
                             " since these cells are
ing of the Jelly-fish,                                       present in
 species and parts that do not sting."           It  is to be regretted
that he was not moved by this doubt to a closer examin
 ation    of the evidence     on     which   the    urticating   faculty
rested   ; he would   assuredly have been led to the belief that
 no superaddition    to the thread-capsule        will account for    the
phenomenon.

             DISPROOF        OF    URTICATING       POWER.           149
    But   I  waive the argument derived from such a source,
and, confining myself to the Anemones, ask the reader what
he   thinks of this awkward fact, namely, that these urticating
capsules are most abundant in parts which do not urticate ?
Only the tentacles have this power, and although they have
numerous capsules, the urtication cannot well be attributed
to them, since these capsules are more abundant in the " con
voluted bands," in the lining wall of the stomach,               and in
the blue spots which surround the oral disc in the Smooth
Anemone      — these     spots,   indeed,   being made   up     of such
capsules and small granules — yet           in not one of these parts
can the slightest urtication          be traced  !  How is this    ?  If
these    capsules    are the    nettling organs,    why do they not
nettle in those parts where they are most abundant            ?  No one
has thought      of asking this question.
    It thus appears       that many animals having the capsules,
have none     of the power attributed to the capsules       ;   and that
even    in those animals which            have the power,   it is only
present in the tentacles, where the capsules           are much less
abundant than in parts not manifesting the power              : the con
clusion, therefore,       presses   on us that the power does not
depend     upon these capsules.
    And this conclusion is strengthened every           step we take.
Thus the Anthea is of all Anemones the most powerfully
urticating    ; yet,   if  we compare its capsules     with those of
other Anemones, we find them greatly inferior in quantity to
those    of the Daisy and Dianthus, and much inferior in size to
 those  of Crassicornis, as well as less easily made to uncoil their
 threads.     It  has not been remarked, that whereas according

150                           SEA-SIDE         STUDIES.
to theory, the thread should dart out almost instantaneously
on the slightest pressure             ;    in point of fact it frequently can
not be pressed out at all, even when the whole force of the
finger is exerted on the two pieces of glass between which
it   lies.     From the very capricious way in which the threads
dart out while under the microscope, and not under pressure,
and from the frequent impossibility                   of pressing them out,     I
suspect that pressure has really nothing normally to do                  with
the ejection of the thread.
     Hitherto we have merely considered facts of Observation                    ;
we shall now          see   them confirmed by Experiment.           Mr Gosse
proposes to establish a new genus,                   named Sagartia, on this
purely         hypothetical      function      ;   including in it all those
Anemones which, like the Daisy and Dianthus, possess an
abundance of peculiar white filaments, visible to the naked
eye, which are protruded from the pores of the body and the
mouth, when the animal is roughly handled.                        These fila
ments are seen, on examination, to be chiefly composed                         of
the    " urticating cells."          Mr     Gosse names the genus Sagartia,
because Herodotus says               of the Sagartians, that " when they
engage         with the enemy they throw out ropes which have
nooses at the end, and whatever any one catches he drags
towards himself, and they that are entangled in the coils are
put to death."              The name, you perceive, is aptly chosen, —
that     is,  it   would be,   if   the hypothesis of the filaments were
not    a     figment.       The filaments have no such lasso-like and
murderous           power.       This Mr Gosse would deny            ;   and
                                                                           I
remember he somewhere                     records an observation which   would
perhaps quite satisfy him that his denial has good ground to

        EXPERIMENTS                 ON       THE THREAD                  CAPSULES.          151
stand on.         He relates that he once saw a small fish in the
convulsions of agony, with one of these filaments in its mouth                                    ;
it shortly expired.            It is a       matter of surprise and regret that
Mr Gosse, having              once made            such an observation, did not
feel the imperative necessity of repeating and varying                                        it,
so as to be sure that the death was not                          a   mere       coincidence.
If the    filament had the power which this single observation
fairly seemed to suggest, nothing could be easier than to
establish the fact by experiment.                         But, I        repeat, no one has
seen the necessity for the verification                           of an hypothesis so
plausible    ;    and   Mr     Gosse,        like all his predecessors,              was con
tent with recording his observation, as                        if   it   carried the point*
Not being so content,               I    tested      it   thus      :     After irritating     a
Dianthus till         it    sent out     a   great many filaments,               I    dropped
a very tiny Annelid among them, and entangled                                  it   completely
in their meshes.              Yet   lo   !   these filaments, which are said to
possess so powerful            a    faculty of urtication                   that even verte
brate animals are killed by them,                         had no other effect upon
 a soft Annelid than that of detaining                         it   in their meshes, from
 which      it   shortly freed itself and wriggled away unhurt.                             Nor

reading by a commotion in the pan on the work-table, which contained a
 couple offish, a Doris, and a few Polypes, but no Sagartia.   On investigation,
 it turned out that the commotion was produced by fish (Ophidium) six ora
 seven inches long, in the convulsions of death.  In its mouth there wai a slif/hl
 strip of Viva. As the weed dangled from its mouth, was forcibly reminded
                                                                        I

 Mr    Gosse attributed to the filament        ?   Clearly not.         In both cases tho relation
 observed    was one of coincidence, not       of causality.

was     I   yet satisfied   ;    placing a tiny Crustacean, of the shrimp
family, among the filaments of another Dianthus,                          I   saw   it
remain there enveloped,                 but apparently quite comfortable,
not in the least so desirous of escaping as one would expect
if it   were being
                        " nettled " all over           and when      I lurched   the

      I have   since repeated this experiment                with Entomostraca
and Annelids, without once detecting the slightest indication
of their being more incommoded by the filaments than they
would have been by threads of silk.                     Mr    Gosse, indeed, not
only maintains that these filaments are weapons of offence,
but he actually suggests that the blue spherules which sur
round the disc of the Mesembryanthemum may " represent
                                        "
the function of these missile filaments   because they are
composed of the thread capsules.
      I repeat,    the hypothesis which assigns               to the thread-cap
sules a function of urtication,              or prehension, is an hypothesis
without a single fact to warrant                 it,   and   is   contradicted by
the various facts      I        have   just adduced.     Ehrenberg has very
unwarrantably given an ideal figure of                  a    Hydra in the act of
seizing its prey, with the hooks of the thread-cell extended                        ;
but, as Siebold truly remarks, the animal                    is   never seen thus   ;
and   I     will   add that     itis   always seen in precisely the contrary
aspect,       namely, the blunt end of the cell being in contact
with the animal, the hook and thread being turned towards
the Polype.
 I      have reserved         one fact as the coup-de-grace.              Having
shown that the parts most abundantly supplied with these

 last vestige of doubt by the fact that the capsule itself from
 the tentacle of an Anemone, when seen to eject the thread
and touch an animalcule, does not            kill or disable that animal
 cule ;  a fact  I witnessed     when examining the capsules under
the microscope.          This not only gives the coup-de-grace to
 the general hypothesis, but even sets aside that suggestion of
 Professor Owen's respecting the probable superaddition to the
 "urticating cell" which is to distinguish it from "cells" in
those parts destitute of the power            ; because here we see the
capsule taken from an urticating animal does not urticate.
    The foregoing discussion has had a purpose beyond that
of rectifying an universal error — the purpose of pointing                  a
lesson in Comparative Anatomy.               The greatest living experi
mental physiologist,         Claude Bernard, has recently insisted
with                                                           " anatomical

deduction        to be a fruitful source of error.*           He warns us
against attempting to deduce a function from mere inspection
of the organ, without seeing that organ in operation, and
applying to it the test of experiment.                As a    case    of pure
                                                                "
deduction, this hypothesis of the " urticating cells               seemed to
 command, and did command, instantaneous assent                     ; but on
submitting it to verification, we find the hypothesis to be an
error.    To the philosophical mind, therefore, there will have
been an interest in the foregoing discussion greater than any
interest issuing out of the mere conclusion respecting the
thread-capsules.
    Among other things, it will illustrate the need there is
for rigorous scepticism, and extended observation, on the part

of zoological students.      So long as we unsuspectingly accept
what is repeated     in books, without being assured that the
statements    are made on sufficient evidence,           and so long as
we have eyes but observe not, zoological progress             will neces
sarily  be slow,    in spite of the vast number of excellent
observers and workers, who do accelerate our progress by
genuine work.       When   I  insist on the necessity for circum
spect doubt, and verified observation,         the reader must not
understand me as implying that this necessity is not vividly
present to the mind of many zoologists, and of every real
worker   ; for in truth, only by such methods can any solid
result be reached, and no one even superficially acquainted
with the present state of Zoology        will  be disposed to under
rate the importance and extent        of that band of distinguished
investigators whose researches daily unfold fresh discoveries.
 Not, therefore,   as  throwing any shadow of scorn on these
men and their        methods,     nor   as  if  I    were    bringing a
neglected   principle into prominence, am         I   tempted to insist
on the only method of successful          pursuit in these studies       ;
but simply to distinguish       those   students of Zoology who
wish   to increase    the circle of knowledge by some small
addition    of new fact, from students who wish merely to
ascertain what is known.        In Zoology,    as   in all other depart
ments of intellectual activity, there are men contented with
" information," whose ambition never
                                               passes beyond erudi
tion.   They want to know what is known.               Others there are
who, less solicitous,    it may     be, about what is known, are
intensely moved to know for themselves            ;  and these are the
workers who extend the circle of the known.

               STRUCTURE OF THE ANEMONE.                         155
   What is known of the reproductive system of Anemones             ?
Not much, and that little confusedly.            Our English text
books are somewhat precise         ;  but the precision is for the
most part that of error.         I  carried with me to the coast
this amount of definite error, which gradually revealed itself
as error   in the course of a series of investigations.    That the
reader may follow clearly the course of reasoning presently
to be traced,     it is necessary   to begin with a few explana
tions, which the better instructed      will pardon.
   Let us first fix in our minds a definite idea of the struc
ture of the Anemone, as far as          it will  be involved  in the
subsequent remarks.          Imagine   a   glove  expanded into a
perfect cylinder by air, the thumb being removed, and the
fingers encircling, in two or three rows, the summit of the
cylinder, while at the base the glove is closed by a flat sur
face  of leather.    If now on that disc which lies within the
circle of fingers we press down the centre, and so force the
elastic leather to   fold inwards, and form       a sort of sac sus
pended     in the cylinder, we have by this means made a
mouth and stomach       ;  we then cut a small hole at the bot
tom of the sac, and thus make a free communication with
the general cavity.       We then divide this general cavity by
numerous partitions        of card attached to the wall of the
cavity, and form a number of separate           chambers  called the
interseptal spaces.       Just as the  cavity of the finger is con
tinuous with the cavity of the glove, so are the cavities of
the tentacles continuous        with the interseptal spaces.      In
these spaces    will  be found long coils, which are sometimes
seen  lolling out of the mouth, and always bulge out when

 156                    SEA-SIDE         STUDIES.
the Anemone is cut open           ;  these are called the convoluted
bands, and to them attention is particularly                  directed.    If
the reader will now look at the diagram given in Plate                  III.,
fig.  1 (wrong in several details), and also fig.          2,  which is an
accurate    section,  and shows a portion of the stomach, the
convoluted bands, and under them the ovaries — he                 will have
a tolerably accurate conception          of the general structure of an
Actinia.
    Having given a rough outline of the principal characters
of the Actinia's internal structure, sufficient to render intel
ligible what    will hereafter      be referred to,      I must   direct the
student anxious for more precise               details, to the Mtfmoire
by M. Hollard,* as the latest and best anatomical essay                      ;
noticing, by the way, that there still remains to be written                a
comparative anatomy of the various Actiniae, some of which
differ in important       characters        from     the others.     In  the
Anthea, for example, the tentacles are filled with round
yellow-brown      globules, which make them incapable of being
retracted under normal conditions              ; and the same is notice
able in the       two   horn-like       tentacles     in  Actinia     bellis.
What are these globules         ?      There are several      other points
 of difference   to be noted, but         I  content myself with indi
cating the desideratum of a careful comparison, to complete
our knowledge of the anatomy of this genus.                 Meanwhile let
us endeavour to form some distinct conception                 of the mode
of Reproduction      exhibited by the Actiniae.
     Certain general facts must be borne in mind.                  First, let
me call attention to the fact that            in all animals, the highest

       IMPORTANCE         OF THE        ANIMAL ENVELOPE.            157
as the lowest, the envelope          is of eminent importance, its
predominance bearing a precise ratio to the simplicity of the
organism.     The simplest organisms breathe, exhale, secrete,
absorb, and reproduce by their envelopes           alone ;  and  if the
more complex organisms perform each of these functions by
a special apparatus      of organs, yet these organs themselves
are   originally developed from the envelope.                We may,
ideally,  reduce    even  a mammal         to a cylindrical   envelope
folded inwards      at each end     ;  from the enfolded skin are
developed    all nutritive and reproductive organs, while the
nervous system and its osseous           sheath are developed    in the
space between the outer and        inner walls of the envelope.
    " We may, in      an ideal manner,"       says Professor    Draper,
 " conceive the                  of the more elementary animal
                  production
forms, as arising from a simple sac or bag, which, furnishing
a starting-point,    exhibits its first acquirement of localisation
 of function, by the doubling          of one half into the other,
thereby giving rise to a cup or pocket-shape form, so that
respiration   and digestion, which were confusedly and con
jointly carried forward       upon      the same surface,     are now
parted from each other, the outside of the cup being devoted
 to the one, and the inside to the other.           Increased endow
ments are obtained by crimping or dividing the edge of the
cup, prehensile organs of less or greater length and power
arising thereby   ;  and this in reality is the structure of the
Hydra.     Another advance        is made by the preparation of
new and complicated structures, fashioned out in the sub
stance between the inner and the outer wall, and in this

reproduction.              Such a state of things is presented                          by the
Actinia."*             What is here said respecting Respiration is very
questionable, but the general idea of an increasing specialisa
tion of function, in the increasing separation of the parts,
is well expressed.                It    is indeed a fundamental law that
every advance              in complexity                of organisation takes place
through a gradual differentiation,                            or specialisation, of the
general envelope.                These important                 synonyms, differentia
tion and specialisation,                     I     will explain by illustrating the
law to which they point, namely, the law of animal develop
ment first enunciated by Goethe,                             and strikingly applied by
Von Baer         -f- :  —Development is always from                         the   General    to
the   Particular, from               the Homogeneous to the Heterogeneous,
from       the   Simple to the Complex                       ;   and this    by   a gradual
series      of   differentiations.
     When we say an organ has been formed out of a tissue,
we say a differentiation                    has taken place          ;   and the function,
e.   g.   respiration, which before was performed by the general
tissue,     is   now specialised,                  i.   e.   performed by that special
organ.       A       homogeneous            mass        of organic matter, such as the
Amoeba,          which       has no organ whatever,                      performs all the
functions of Assimilation,                       Respiration, Locomotion, and Re
production, by its general mass, not by any special organs.
     The process of differentiation by which special organs are
gradually            developed       in the ascending scale of the animal
series,    is    equally exhibited in any particular case of develop-

ment.     Thus   if we   follow the formation of the human hand,
we find first a differentiation        between the carpus, or wrist,
and the metacarpus, or hand          ;  next the fingers are differen
tiated, but, without any division           into separate segments —
this takes place later      ;  then we have a separation between
the soft and hard parts, the cartilage separating from the
plastic mass   ;  then these cartilages become osseous            ; and in
the   soft plastic     mass    we distinguish      differentiations    into
muscle, tendon, skin, &c.        ; when the single tissues are thus
separated we may begin to trace differentiations              in the skin,
such as the papillae, the secreting glands, and so forth             :  till,
from    a homogeneous          mass    of cells, we have traced the
development of that marvellous and complex structure, the
human hand.
    Applying this torch to the obscure question of the repro
ductive system of the Anemones,              it at  once discloses to us
 that the Anemone, being of a very simple organisation, we
 shall be wrong     if  we expect to find in       it  a high complexity
 of special organs.      Anatomists, indeed, have often neglected
 such a consideration, and have worried                themselves   in the
 search   after organs, which        a priori were not likely to          be
 present.    They have sought for and "discovered" nerves
 and ganglia, each discoverer scornfully rejecting the alleged
 discovery of his predecessor,          and declaring the nerves were
 in a totally different locality, while no one anatomist could
 find  them anywhere           after   another.     They have worried
 themselves about the Respiration               of the Anemone, not
 perceiving    that     Respiration,     like   Circulation     and other
 functions    elsewhere       dependent     on   a    special   apparatus,

was    here    performed    in a     direct   and general         manner.
They have not suspected            that   Reproduction       takes place
in the Anemone, much in the same way as in the fresh
water    Polype   — not in     any special and permanent            appa
ratus of organs,      such as ovary, oviduct, &c., but         by a tem
porary specialisation of the general               envelope,    including
an accumulation      of germ-cells and sperm-cells.          I am   aware
that special organs called ovaries are described in all books,
and that      some   writers    describe an      oviduct — which only
exists in their imagination, for no duct of any kind is found.
Of course, no philosophical a priori conclusion could be
permitted to stand up in contradiction             to observed fact   ;  if
the organs are there,     it is of   no use deductively establishing
their non-existence.       But are they there       ?
    When    I first commenced the investigation           of Anemones,
I  had no reason whatever to doubt the statement so gene
 rally and confidently made, that the convoluted bands were
 the organs in question.        (Plate  III., fig.  3, represents a con
 voluted band attached to the border of the membrane called
 the mesentery     ; the grape-like mass is the ovary.)            At  the
 end of the first week my doubts began.                These convoluted
 bands contained no trace of ova, but instead thereof they
 contained vast quantities of those thread capsules which                 I
 then believed to be urticating cells.         This was the last place
 in the world where one might expect to find offensive wea
 pons  ;  and misled by the belief in these cells,          I  was led to
 question the function of the convoluted bands.             Questioning,
 of course, meant something more than supine doubt.               I began
 on the 14th     May to examine closely into the evidence,            and

                          DISCOVERY           OF        THE    OVARIES.                    161
on the        1   2th June      I was fortunate          enough to confirm     all doubts
by the discovery of the real ovaries (such as they are) in a
large Crassicornis                :   here there were no thread-capsules, but
abundance of unmistakable                           ova, each    with its " vesicle of
Purkinje."                The  thrill of delight with which the assurance
broke upon me                may be conceived.* At that time I, of course,
believed that the grape-like cluster in which the ova were
lying, were true and permanent ovaries                            ;   but having since
been frequently unable to detect them in adult specimens, and
never in young specimens,                    I came to the       conclusion that these
ovaries are temporary organs,                            formed by an accumulation
of germ-cells                in various parts of the free border of the
septa     ;    that, in fact, they represent the first rudimentary
state of what in higher animals becomes the special organ.
This conclusion                 is,   however, purely theoretical, and            I       will
now state what any one may                              see   who examines an adult
fresh from the rock-pool                     or tank.          With    a   rapid but not
deep incision              we lay open the envelope                   from the outside      ;
the convoluted bands                   will bulge through the opening                 ;   but
if   we are vigilant and brush these aside, we shall perceive
certain lobular or grape-like masses of darker colour, almost
entirely hidden by these bands, but growing from the septa.
(Plate        III.,   fig.   2,   represents    a       section of the Actinia, show

these ovaries         I

function, as temporary organs, similar to those of the Hydra.

near the base, about the centre,                     and close to the disc, they
may be found              :   nor are they on every septum                              ;   sometimes
we     may make three                    or four     incisions                before         detecting
them.
      Such are the ovaries                of the Crassicornis                   :   but are they
entitled to the name               ?     Are they organs at all                     ?       A   minute
inspection of them                will confirm what           I       said just now that

nothing but accumulations of germ-cells in a delicate mem
brane.        They have none of the essential characteristics of an
ovary.        It   is true that Spix, Delle Chiaje, Rapp, de                                    Blain
ville, Van der Hoeven, and others, describe                                     what they call
oviducts, without, however, agreeing as to their disposition.
But Mr Teale and M. Hollard have been unable to find them,
and       I also   can confidently assert that no duct whatever,                                   nor
anything           distantly       resembling        it,   exists         ;    but, as       I    have
convinced myself by scores of dissections, the whole structure
of the ovary         is       limited to     a   delicate membranous stroma, in
which        the ova are imbedded.                   When the ova are matured,
it   is   most probable that this stroma bursts to set them free,
and they fall into the general cavity, where their further
development takes place.                     It   would be justly considered an
unwarrantable laxity in scientific language                               if    the temporary
accumulation of germ-cells beneath the investing membrane
of the Hydra were designated as an ovary                                  ;    and no less         un
warrantable          isit      to call   a   somewhat similar accumulation                           of
germ-cells in the Actinia, an ovary.                       The pretended                     "organ"

is not permanent,           it is not even constant       in its locality, for
it may     be found at any part        of the free border of the septum          ;
and finally,      it has no specific structure, which distinguishes
it from any other part of the lining membrane                 ; its grape-like
form is owing entirely to the ova imbedded in it.
    The reader perceives that          I  regard the organisation of the
Actinia as much simpler than other writers seem willing to
admit, and that, in consequence,                 I  interpret   its functions
more    in accordance with the laws which regulate the simpler
organisms.          He will hereafter      see  that such a point of view
led me to examine and disprove the current notions respect
ing the Digestion and Nutrition of the Actiniae,* and he will
now    see    that   it led    me to the discovery      of their true sexual
character.
    The universal belief is that the Actiniae are of separate
sexes, and       Kolliker, to whom most subsequent writers refer,
asserts that the males are about as numerous as the females.
The great difficulties in the way of observation can only be
estimated by those who have tried it.                  Rapp declared there
was no trace of the male organs.           "All   the Actiniae are females,"
he says boldly.          Wagner having discovered,            as he thought,
spermatozoa in the convoluted bands, pronounced those bands
to be the reproductive organs of the male                  ; and this state
ment was accepted and repeated from book to book.                         It  is
now known that Wagner was mistaken                       ;f  perhaps he had
removed a portion of the ovary with the convoluted band, and
   * Part  III.,  Chaps. I. and  II.
   t This leaves the function of the convoluted bands a mystery.    In Part III.
 Chap. II., towards the close, the question is touched on.

in that case he might have seen true spermatozoa.               "What !"

 sir, how gat they there        ?    They were generated there,          is
my simple answer         ;   but before such       an   answer   will   be
 received a few remarks are necessary.
    Believing in the simplicity of this animal's organisation,
 and disbelieving in the existence of any proper ovary,            I  was
 naturally led a    priori    to disbelieve in the existence of male
 reproductive organs.          If a temporary      specialisation of the
 lining membrane sufficed as an ovary, would not a similar
specialisation suffice as a testis       ?    Meditating on this point,
it occurred to    me as very probable that the same spot           of the
lining membrane might subserve both purposes.                  What said
 Fact to so plausible a Theory          ?     At  first  it answered by
what seemed like blank negatives            ;  on three fortunate occa
 sions, however,    it seemed to answer         in unequivocal affirma
tion, for  I  found real spermatozoa moving amid the ova on
 the stage   of the Microscope.       The observations were neither
sufficiently extensive nor sufficiently removed from opposite
interpretations to admit of a very positive statement on the
point   ; accordingly      I  contented myself with indicating my
belief * that ova and spermatozoa were intermingled               in the
same stroma, announcing my intention                of more attentively
investigating the point when next at the coast.              Meanwhile,
I  had read the Mdmoire on the Cerianthus, an animal nearly
allied to our Anemones, published by M. Jules Haime,-J- in
which there is a detailed description, with diagrams, of this

very disposition of ova and spermatozoa in the same "organ ;"
so that    if it  had not been for the positive            statement of
Kolliker, respecting the separation of the sexes,                I   should
have conceived      the point placed beyond dispute.
   At   the Scilly Isles and Jersey my investigations                  were
renewed,     for a long time with the discouraging and para
doxical result of finding ova and nothing else.             It  seemed as
if Rapp's   statement would turn out to be correct,              and only
females were     to be found.        But then, whence the sperma
tozoa seen at Tenby        ?  Whence those described by Kolliker           ?
That the absence of spermatozoa did not, in the simpler
organisms, by any means imply the absence of reproduction,
but that females       were capable      of propagating, unaided,         I
I  knew well enough*            This did not answer the question
raised.    The fact that there were sometimes               spermatozoa
seemed beyond dispute         ; Kolliker had seen them, and asserted
them to be as numerous as ova.              The solution of the diffi
culty dawned upon me when             I discovered that the sperma
tozoa were contained in vesicles,            so  like ova in the early
stage   as to be easily mistaken for them.                It  is only by
crushing     these   that    the spermatozoa are         seen    escaping.
Thus   it became    intelligible that    I might have had spermatic
vesicles in the ovaries       under observation, where         I   thought
there were only ova      ;   and all my females might have been
hermaphrodite.       Unhappily this clue was detected at a period
when    I was so deeply engrossed with the nervous system of
the Mollusca, that     I   had little time to devote to the unravel
ling of the whole mystery. But          I made    a few direct and     con
                   * See Examples in Part  IV.,       I.

 elusive observations, which assured me that ova and sperma
 tozoa were intermingled in the same stroma             ; and the student
 may easily verify these observations when informed that the
 ova are distinguishable from the spermatic vesicles by their
 darker colour       ; he has only to spread out, on a glass slide, a
 fold of the membrane containing              the ova, and he     will per
 ceive among them polyhedral               and oval bodies     of a paler
 colour  ;  if  these     are crushed,   the spermatozoa     will  be seen
 escaping from them.
    How can this be reconciled with Kolliker's and Hollard's
 statement of the sexes being separate              ?   If I  could have
 devoted the requisite time to the point, when specimens
 were abundant,        I  might, perhaps, have answered        positively,
 what   I  can now        only answer hypothetically.         As it is,   I
propound a suggestion, which the researches                of some more
fortunate      inquirer may confirm, or rectify.             First, be it
remembered         that the ova and spermatozoa are developed in
precisely the same portion            of the lining membrane on the
free border       of the septum.      This is the statement of Kblliker
and Hollard, who further remark that              it is only by the dif
ference    of colour that the testis is distinguished from the
ovary.     If    these anatomists found ova         in one animal, and
spermatozoa in another,              whereas    I  found   both   in   one
and the same animal, four possible explanations                   suggest
themselves      :
   1st. There are Actiniae         in whom the ova and spermatozoa
are intermingled        ;  that is to say, one grape-like    cluster   will
contain both kinds of cells.
   2d. There may be others           in whom the spermatozoa accu-

inulate on one part of the septum, and the ova on another
part of the same septum                ;   or different septa may bear diffe
rent kinds of cells.
    3d. There may be others — and this has                        its parallel in
other Polypes, in Crustacea,                 and in Insects — which produce
nothing but ova              ;   and these ova may develop into embryos,
without the concourse of spermatozoa at all.
    4th. Or finally, the slight indication of the separation of
sex, which is presented when one side of the septum, or one
of the septa, develops only one kind of cell, may                       be   further
carried out in some species, and in them the complete sepa
ration of sexes takes place.
    Of       these four possible forms,           I   have positive observation
only of the first, and am strongly inclined to believe in the
third    ;    there    is,   however, nothing          at all improbable in the
second and fourth,                and either, or both, may be ascertained
by careful investigation, which would rectify or confirm the
observations of Kolliker and Hollard.                      But   it   must not be
forgotten that, although              a   single case of distinct separation
a   single Actinia found bearing spermatozoa only on                         all its
septa — would suffice to establish the                  truth of the fourth pro
position      ;   yet for this to be established, the inquirer must
be rigorously certain that              all the   septa bear the spermatozoa,
the ova being everywhere absent                   ;   and even then no amount
of such evidence                 will invalidate the fact announced in the
first proposition, that in some cases the ova and spermatozoa
are mingled        ;   a   fact  I   have quite recently discovered also          in
the fresh- water Polype.               Whether Actiniae are, or are not, in

168                      SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
very rarely so — the fact remains that they are also hermaph
rodite. Nor can this surprise us now we know that even fish,
which are almost universally         of separate sexes, also present
hermaphroditism        as  a  normal     phenomenon in the Perch
genus.*
   To sum up the various points we have just been consider
ing, it  appears that the Actiniae are       of very simple organisa
tion ;  that they have no sexual organs at all            ; and that the
temporary organ produced by an accumulation of cells in a
part of the lining membrane,           contains both the male and
female elements,     although possibly some indication of a sepa
ration of sexes does occasionally present itself.
   A   proof of the great simplicity of their organisation,             and
an argument against the separation of            their sexes, is seen in
the fact of their being able to reproduce themselves from a
mere fragment.        In  a letter received from        Mr   R   Q. Couch,
of Penzance, there is the following passage             :
                                                          " It  is said by
some that the sexes       in these creatures are separate,           but   I
rather think this    will   be found not to be the case.          Speaking
of reproduction,    I  may mention that the small specimen                of
Actinia dianthus which you             saw   is thriving       (Mr Couch
refers to a tiny Actinia which had grown from a shred of the
base which adhered to a stone when the Dianthus was                    torn
away), and that the day you left          I made four small cuttings
from the bases of the red and white varieties which, at the
present moment, are adorned with two rows of tentacles."
And the following report of         a communication          made   by Dr
Strethill Wright to the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh,
              *  See Dufosse,  in Annala  des Sciences, 1857.

                 DK WRIGHT'S       OBSERVATIONS.                 169
which is taken from the Edinburgh Philosophical            Journal,
will   be read   with great interest : —
    " The author stated that
                                 Actinia dianthus, the Plumose
Sea Anemone         of Dalyell, was found on the shores of the
Firth of Forth, generally      on rocks which were uncovered by
the sea only at very low tides.      Its habitat was not extensive  ;
it is gregarious, great numbers being frequently found in avery
bmited    space.    At Arran   he had seen several hundreds closely
aggregated together, clothing the roof of a wide low cave,
and hanging down like so many membranous bags half filled
with water.       A   similar colony had existed on the perpen
dicular surface of a single large stone opposite to the Baths
at Seafield    ;  and again,   another on the under surface of a
large overhanging rock at Wardie.           It  had been a matter of
 question with the author, how the young of these Actinias,
 if ejected from the mouth, as in Actinia mesembryanthemum,
 troglodytes, bellis, and gemmacea,       were able to attach them
 selves to the rocks, instead    of falling down and being washed
 away by the tide.       It was known    that Actinia mesembryan
 themum, troglodytes, and bellis were exceedingly prolific, Sir
 John Dalyell and Dr Cobbold having            seen twenty or  thirty
  produced at a single litter from the first species, and yet the
  number of very young Actinias found in situations where old
  specimens    abounded     was very small, and certainly bore no
  proportion to the number generated.          The cave at Arran was
  very difficult of access, on account of its shallowness and the
  floor being covered      by a pool of water      ; and the Actinias
  were only to be reached by assuming a posture which could
  not be maintained for more than a few minutes.           A number

were,      however,    obtained,    which, being attached to sponges,
were easily stripped from the rock, and with them were asso
ciated     a great number of very small specimens.                  Not long
afterwards the author noticed a number of young surround
ing a large white dianthus               in the Vivarium of a friend at
Leith, and was told that the Actinia, while moving round
the tank, had left behind it small white bodies, which separ
ated themselves         from the foot or sucker and became young
Actinias.          Sir John Dalyell had described a similar mode of
multiplication        in Actinia lacerata, and Hollard in Actinia
rosea      (?)    The former writer had observed           that   Actinia la
cerata protruded from all parts of its foot, stolons or suckers,
which became detached,              and presently put forth tentacles,
and were developed           into minute Actinias.            After reading
Sir John Dalyell's account of Actinia lacerata, Dr Wright
was anxious to acertain whether there might not be included
in the prolongations separated from the foot, either true ova
or germs,         or some tissue specialised         for the production          of
young.           In the hydroid zoophytes,       such as   Hydra, Coryne,
&c., the walls of the body consisted                 of three elements           or
layers,    — a    dermal or integumental, an areolar or muscular,
and    a   mucous or intestinal layer       ;   and when gemmation took
place      in these animals,       it   occurred by the protrusion          of   a
simple diverticulum or sac from the canal of the body, formed
of all the three elements.              This diverticulum was developed
into   a   polype body, with mouth and tentacles like those of
the polype, from which        it    pullulated   ;   the two bodies having
the     digestive canal     and all the tissues            continuous   with
each other.         In Hydra tuba multiplication took               place    by

              DR    WRIGHT'S OBSERVATIONS.                       171
stolons, which extended to some distance from the body be
fore the    new polype      bodies  sprouted from them, but in
that   case  also   a   prolongation  of the intestinal     element
passed through the stolon from the old into the new body.
These new polypes were not young         ; their production was a
simple increase of the individual, becoming afterwards a mul
tiplication, either by accident, in some cases, or in others by
a  natural process of absorption.     The structure of the helian-
thoid zoophytes or Actinias was more complicated in its de
velopment than that of the hydroid polypi, but        it consists of
the same three elements.        The dermal coat was succeeded by
the muscular element, which constituted the chief part of the
external wall of the body and tentacles,       and then passed in
ward to the stomach,         in the form of septa or partitions,
which suspended       that viscus in the centre of the body, and
divided the intervening        spaces into   numerous chambers.
The mucous or intestinal element existed         as a flattened sac
or stomach, which       appeared,  when viewed edgeways,        as a
 mere line extending down about       half the centre of the body.
 The stomach    communicated freely with the general cavity of
 the body.    This cavity, which corresponded        to the water-
 vascular system of the Acalephae, was single below, but as         it
 passed upward    it formed a number of     chambers   divided from
 each  other by the septa before mentioned, and finally com
 municated with the tentacles,      each chamber terminating       in
 the cavity of a single tentacle.
    "The whole of the general cavity and its chambers was
 lined with cilia, by which a constant circulation of the fluid
 was sustained, and the functions of nutrition, respiration, and

 172                   SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
excretion were all carried on simultaneously.         From the lining
membrane      of the general cavity, the male and female repro
 ductive organs were      also   developed,      and there, in some
 species, the ova were hatched, and the young (at first mere
 shapeless, ciliated germs, swimming         rapidly in the fluids of
 the cavity, chambers,      and tentacles)      became   fully formed,
 passed into the stomach     of the parent, and were ejected from
 the mouth as perfect Actinias, with mouth, tentacles, and suc
 torial foot.   The author had thought        it possible that the pro
 longations from the foot of      Actinia lacerata might contain
 one of these hatched germs in its imperfect state, and that          it
 might be thus deposited on the surface occupied by the par
 ent, and its safety insured.     Having some specimens of dian
 thus in his possession, he had waited for some time in vain
 for their multiplication by fissure      ; he therefore determined
to try an experimentum        cruds, and for that purpose having
placed the specimen in a     jar of  sea-water,    and fed   it until it
had become fully distended, he examined the edge of the foot,
which was perfectly transparent, with a powerful lens, and
convinced himself that no ovum or germ existed in that situ
ation.    He then separated a piece about a line in length, by
half a line in breadth, from the edge of the foot.           The parts
immediately receded from each other, and the next day he
found that the separated portion had crept to a considerable
distance along the glass.      In two or three days it had raised
its divided edge    from the surface to which it was attached,
and had become a curved column          ;   in a fortnight tentacles

Actinia, with a single row of beautiful long tentacles.                  From
the foot of this small Actinia he cut two other exceedingly
minute slips, which also became Actinias              ; and from the foot
of the original Actinia he also separated, at various times,
fourteen other slips, all of which became developed as the first.
The author stated that this             case  of gemmiparous increase
was an instance of the development of a perfect and very
complicated organism, from a minute fragment of one simi
lar to itself, all that was essential to the process being appar
ently the existence of a portion of each of the three elemental
tissues     of the original, the dermal, the muscular, and the
mucous tissue,      — the      last being represented        by the lining
membrane of the general cavity.                 And it appeared to be
analogous to the instance of gemmation from the water-vas
cular system observed by the late Professor Edward                     Forbes
in Sarsia prolifera, in which animal the young medusae
pullulated forth from the hollow bulbs which supported the
 tentacles."
     It  should be borne in mind, however, that the Actiniae are
 far less capable      of reproduction from fragments than the
 fresh-water Polypes are.              Delle Chiaje, indeed,         emphati
 cally denies that they can do more than reproduce their ten
 tacles*       This, as we have just seen, is not the case                ; and
 it is somewhat curious that Delle Chiaje should confine the
  reproductive power to the tentacles, when we remember that,
  according to Owen, the tentacles are the only portions of the

    But we must bid adieu to the Anemones for the present,
attractive as they are.           These pages        will have shown that
much yet remains to be done before a clear and positive ac
count of their structure and functions can be written                   ;  and
as they are     just now " the rage," we may hope that abun
dant experience will issue in some satisfactory result.

Between the lion that has once eaten a man—once tasted
the   glory and ambrosial delight of man-beef—and the lion
remotely ignorant of that flavour, there lies a chasm.             Only
in zoological text-books can the two animals be considered
as  of the same species.      In  profounder characteristics,     in the
complexion of their souls, they differ as the Caucasian differs
from the Hottentot.          The lion who has once fed on man,
carries with him an unforgettable experience ; he has supped
with the gods, and Homeric rhythms murmur in his ears.
Visions of that ecstatic hour hover before him in his lair,
accompany      his moonlight     marches     through the mountain
gorge,   thrill him with retrospective flavours         as he laps the
moonlit lake, and fill with a certain blissful torment all his
leisure moments.        These visions, like the after-glow of sun

set on the Alps,      tinge his mental horizon,     and create   a
gustatory after-glow which warms his whole frame.        Haunted
by such recollections, tormented by the appetites they deve
lop, his nature undergoes mysterious, modifying       influences  ;
new and grander ferocities are awakened,        which, in turn,
develop   fiercer  daring, and render him ten times more for
midable.      Hitherto he has wanted something of the daring
commensurate      with his strength.    He has always avoided
personal combat      with an European, when honourably the
challenge    could be ignored.   But now the case is very differ
ent ; now, the scent of human blood thrills along every fibre      ;
and when sight reveals the      proximity of his noble foe, then
flashes the tawny eye      with sombre fire, the terrible talons
tear up the earth, he dresses his mighty mane, and prepares
for the fight in slow, solemn,      concentrated wrath, clearly
foreseeing    that two issues, and only two, remain open for
him — man-beef, or a tomb.
   Not less profound, although not quite so terrible to his
enemies,    is the difference  between the man who has once
tasted of a noble sea-side passion, once lived   with his micro
scope for a few months on the wealthy shores    of some secluded
spot,  indulging    in a new pursuit — and the common man,
utterly remote from all such experience, walled out from it
by blank negation, incapable of even conceiving the heights
and depths of such       a passion.   Visions of those ecstatic
hours for ever accompany the happy man.          He may return
to his home, and resume the labours of his profession, which
secures  him pudding, and, it may be, praise      :  he continues
the daily round, but not as before.       He is a changed man.

           THE LION WHO             HAS EATEN A MAN.                      179
 The direction of his thoughts is constantly seawards.                 Mur
 murs of old ocean linger in his soul, as they murmur in                     a
 shell long since taken from the deep, and now condemned to
 ornament the mantelpiece of some lodging-house, the daily
 witness of prosaisms and peculations.              To the casual eye he
 may not seem changed          ; but read his soul, and you        will find
 he is another man.
   At   least   it was thus with        me.     I  had supped with       the
 gods,  and grew fastidious over my shilling ordinary.                     If
 work imperiously claimed my attention, if                  I was forced  to
trouble myself with          "proofs," commentators, old writers,
dreary philosophies, and multiform affairs, the glass vases on
my table, perpetually reminding me of Ilfracombe and Tenby,
aggravated the oppression.              The iodine of the sea-breezes
had entered me.         I felt that   I  had
                                               " suffered a sea
                                                                   change"
into something zoological and strange.              Men began to appear
like molluscs     ;  and their ways the ways of creatures              in   a
larger rock-pool.        When forced to endure the conversation
of some    "  friend of the family," with well-waxed whiskers
and imperturbable         shirt-front,   I  caught myself speculating
as to what sort of figure he would make in the vivarium —
not always to his glorification.           In  a word,     it was painfully
evident that London wearied me, and that                 I  was troubled in
my mind.        I had  tasted of a new delight         ;    and the hungry
soul of man leaps on a new passion to master, or be mastered
by it.
                  " Chacon veut en sagesso eriger sa folie"
says Boileau, and      I   was willing enough to demonstrate to
all recusants that my passion had a most rational                     basis.

Meanwhile            it   was the torment of intellectual hunger                        ;   and   I
make       it    a rule always to satisfy hunger                        — on philosophical
principles.           If     you don't content               it,   it   will torment you;
it    obtrudes on work and duty, perplexing the one,                                         and
obstructing           the other        :   it      can't    be     starved into silence.
When pastry-cooks hire new boys, they wisely permit an
unrestricted glut of tarts.                     The young gluttons fall on, tooth
and nail, and in                a   week are surfeited              ;   whereas     a   stealthy
and restricted appetite would have lasted them for years,
much to the damage of the pastry-cook.                                  In this philosophic
forethought        I       resolved to give myself                  a   glut of zoology, to
let loose the reins of desire, and afterwards,                                if   the fates so
willed      it,    settle       once   more into           a     student of books, and
writer thereof.              It   was really time.           For seven long months            I
had been separated from the coast                          ;     and like the Cyclops of
Euripides,       I    had grown weary of feeding on daily butcher's
meat and game,               just like other stray mortals in the Strand                          ;
and smacked                my lips at the prospect of man-beef.                             With
the Cyclops        I      exclaimed        :
                      "I am quite sick of the wild         mountain-game      ;

                          AndI    grow hungry for the flesh        of men."   *
     March was already come, the equinoctial gales were near,

 dangerous    shores.     The weather was intensely unlike sum
 mer, the snow and hail freely           falling ; so that,    on a first
 blush, there did seem a shadow           of reason for the astonish
 ment   of friends, who looked upon departure at such a time,
 and  for such a place, as indicating something like insanity.
 But great wits to madness nearly are allied, and this alliance
 with great wits will perhaps be granted to          me.     At any rate
 there was method      in the madness, for unless          I reached the
 coast before the equinox, the passage           would be more than
usually perilous   ;  and just after the equinox, as everybody
knows, the spring-tides recede to greater depths,               and offer
the   finest opportunities      for rock-hunting       ;  moreover the
gales   at this period throw welcome treasures on the beach.
The    loth of March,       therefore,    was the very latest        date
I  could afford for departure       ; and on that day the journey
began.
    Why the Isles of Scilly were obstinately              selected, may
not be so easily explained.        I  had a fixed idea on this point     ;
no argument      could make me swerve from it.                 The main
attraction was doubtless lurking in my profound geographical
ignorance, which invested these Isles with a mysterious halo.
In days when ladies take pleasure-trips to Algiers, and reach
it in four days, or run up             the Nile,    as   formerly   they
scampered     through      France,    any real bit of untravelled
country necessarily creates an interest        ; and for travellers, in
the adventurous or pleasure-hunting sense, Scilly is as virgin
ground as Timbuctoo.          Vessels in abundance touch there           ;
but who goes there      ?   Indeed, on entering a shop to make a
small purchase, the bland woman compassionately inquired

 lodging-house, kept by a middle-aged Harpy, rearing a brood
 of young Harpies, and rendered all the more fierce in lodging
 house instincts by her condition of widowhood, which,               you

Marseilles, flanked by a portrait        of the defunct husband,
master of the aforesaid brig, painted in the well-known style        :
a resplendent    shirt-front with a head attached, sternly inex
pressive,  on a mahogany background.          The defunct mariner
seemed blank     with astonishment at my courage in coming
to such a house— a ruin, not a lodging.           Everything in it
was afflicted with the rickets.     The chair-backs creaked in
harmonious threats,     if you incautiously leaned against them.
The fire-irons fell continually from their unstable rests.       The
bed-pole tumbled at my feet when         I attemped to draw the
curtain.     The doors wouldn't shut.       Even the teapot had a
wobbly top, which resisted all closing.        Nay — and this    will
surprise you — in the moral world      I  noticed a similar dilapi
dation.    The discrepancies were painful.          In the "bill,"
arrangements were made which showed fiscal genius              : and
when a suggestion was offered that the remains of yesterday's
fowl might serve for to-day's luncheon, a look of pained re
proach passed over the widow's face, followed by a gulp, and
a silence which was broken only by diversion         of the dialogue
into quite other directions — the look, the gulp, the silence
expressed,   as plainly as words, the mean opinion which the
widow     entertained of her victim.      Low   as  her opinion had
placed him before,    it had not  reached such     depths as that ;
the request for a paltry remnant of fowl, indeed, was answer
able only by profound silence.        Thus it was answered.         I
never gazed upon that bird again.
   Weather-bound       in such a place — the equinoctial gales
hurrying on— boxes corded, soul unquiet — you may imagine

the alacrity with which               I   sprang out of bed, the morning
when a sailor came up from the packet to say that anchor
was weighed, and we should start as soon                          as   I   could slip on

near the islands — drew near, but dared not venture nearer                                       ;
because, a     "very thick fog ensuing, the sailors began to be
apprehensive whether they should fall in with the proper
passage     into    St Mary's         Island      or not      :    sometimes             they
thought they could         see   the land, but were always uncertain

so) on each side     of us as we passed.                It   was Crow's Sound    ;
andI       must own the sight of                it   gave me     much pleasure,
which you will, and justly may in some measure attribute
to our sudden transition from               a   state   of uncertainty to that
of safety, but not wholly           ;   for these islets and rocks edge
this Sound in an extremely pretty and very different manner
from anything   I        had seen before.             The sides of these little
islands continue their greenness                  to the brim of the water,
where they are either surrounded by rocks of different shapes,
which start up here and there as you advance, like so many
enchanted castles, or by            a   verge        of sand of the brightest
colour."
  If this was    the passage made during gentle May, surely
we were very fortunate, in blustering                        March, to have got
over all our troubles in six hours.                      Shorter, our passage
undeniably     was   ;    whether    it     was also sweeter,         remains    a
problem, towards the solution of which                  I    will say thus   much,
— that     under no extension of euphuism could                     it   be called
sweet.     In the first      place, there had been no breakfast                 to
begin the day   ;    and the Ariadne offered nothing in the cul
inary department.          Cheering Souchong, or aromatic Mocha,
to warm the matutinal ventrals, was not to be thought of                         ;
we were even lucky to have              a   dry biscuit to munch in philo-

sophic resignation.       Deprived thus of our natural fortifica
tions against the advancing enemy, we were further disabled
by the rain, which forced us to descend into the cabin,        and
get into our berths.      In these exiguous spaces we remained
until the joyful tidings of arrival flooded us with sudden
energy,     and flung the past hours from us like a hideous
dream.      Except during the brief intervals of sleep and semi-
delirium, the hours were not pleasant.         The cold, not to be
kept out by any amount of rugs, cloaks, and tarpaulin, seemed
stealthily creeping into the very centres of life.      The sensa
tions which fly around sea-sickness      need scarcely be alluded
to.    Constantly, when my intellect was sufficiently disen
tangled from these sensations       to exercise itself, would the
thought arise that pleasanter far was the pursuit of zoology
in comfortable homes (where Mr Lloyd of Portland Road,
Mr Bohn of Essex Street, or Mr Damon of Weymouth,
 would supply tanks and vases with the desired          animals  in
exchange for vulgar dross,      thus bringing the forces of com
merce and civilisation     to minister to our pursuits), compared
with this harum-scarum method of trusting oneself to " sea-
traversing ships," in order to become one's own purveyor.
This thought would occur.        And then the fluctuating intel
lect passed into self-condemnation at thoughts so base, re
morse     so ill-timed,  cowardice so unzoological.    These pass
ing pangs, however unattractive, would they not inevitably
pass  ?    And how the released spirit, in its reinstated vigour,
would rejoice at having undergone such torments for such
weeks    of enjoyment.
    As  I  said, the joyful tidings came at last.   With alacrity

 I   urged my staggering steps up the ladder,               and emerged
 upon the deck, where the bright sunlight revealed a                scene,
which of itself was repayment and full discharge for any
arrears of misery.         We were in St Mary's Sound.                 The
islands lay around us, ten times bigger than imagination
had prefigured, and incomparably more beautiful.                 On their
picturesque varieties      I might turn a green countenance            and
glazed eye, but the heart within me bounded like a leopard
on his prey.      This was worth coming to        !   Those poor devils
who sit at home at       ease,  and supply their tanks from com
mercial sources, were now the objects of pitiless sarcasms
for their want of enterprise.           In   such   a mood      I hastily
secured comfortable lodgings, clean as a Dutchman's, at the
Post-office    ; swallowed some tea and toast,           to_ appease   the
baser appetites,     and hurried forth to satisfy` the hunger of
the soul, by a survey of the Bay, and its promises.                   The
promontory       on which     stands    Star Castle,      offered  a fine
breezy walk over downs resplendent with golden furze,* and
suffered the eye to take the widest sweep.             How thoroughly
I  enjoyed that walk     !   The downs were       so  brilliant that one
could sympathise with the enthusiasm of Linnaeus on his
arrival in England, and his first sight of furze, as he flung
himself on his knees, and thanked God for having made
anything     so beautiful.     The downs were all aflame             with
their golden light.      Ever and anon a rabbit started           across
the path, or the timid deer were seen emerging from the
clumps of golden bush.          A   glance at the many reefs and

creeks   along the wavy shores         raised    expectation    tiptoe,
forcing hope into certainty of treasures abounding.             What
ever drawbacks Scilly might possibly have in store, this at
least  was indubitable    —the hunting       would be good.          Not
that any shadow of a drawback darkened the horizon                 ;  for
what    could the heart desire        more?      Here   was a     little
archipelago,    such   as Greek heroes      might have lived in —
bold, rugged,     picturesque, — secure from all the assaults          of
idle watering-place frequenters, — lovely to the eye, full of
promise to the mind — health in every breeze.              Ithaca was
visibly opposite.      Homer's    cadences were      sweetly audible.
Here one might write epics finer than the Odyssey, had one
but genius packed up in one's carpet-bag          ; and  if the genius
had been forgotten, left behind (by some strange oversight),
at any rate there was the microscope and scalpel,          with which
one might follow       in the tracks of the "stout         Stagyrite,"
whom the world is now beginning to recognise                among the
greatest   of its naturalists.       Homer,     or Aristotle?        The

   It is puzzling to determine the number of the Scilly Isles,
because, where the largest,       St Mary's, is on a scale of no
greater magnitude than          nine miles     in circumference,       it
becomes a nice point to settle how         small a patch of rock is
to be reckoned as an island.         There are some hundred, or
hundred and twenty distinct islets       ;  but of inhabited islands
only six.     The area in statute acres is 3560, and the popu
lation in 1851 was, according to the census, 2600 in 511

houses   —the  females predominating     in the ratio of     1 439 to
1162.     The average of death is 16 in 1000      ;  in other parts
of England     it is   23  in 1000, showing    a decided     hygienic
superiority   in favour of Scilly.     Much arable land there is
not, but an occasional upland smiles prosperity at you          ; and
in the sheltered nooks of Holy Vale you are startled with
the appearance     of what almost looks like a tree.           In the
other parts of the island no tree is discoverable — without a
lens.    The lanes are formed of stone hedges, as in Devon
shire and Cornwall      ; but these hedges are not, at this early
season, prodigal     of ferns and wildflowers as they will be
soon.    Yet they have already abundant ornament.              On the
summit grows the furze, with its profuse bunches of gold               ;
from the crevices peep the stone-crop, the leaves of the fox
glove,   pennywort,     and a   multitude   of other wall-loving
plants, dear to my eye, though unknown          by name    ;  already
the dog-violet and celandine are gay with colour, and the
lichens tint the stone with delicate pale greys or greens,
deep orange, or    bright gold.
    The grouping of the islands is very picturesque, forming
 several  good Sounds, where vessels of great tonnage

 sound audible, except       the never-ending   symphony of the
 waters.   As we ramble round the coast,            the successive

 artist's power of transferring them to our sketch-book.              The
 rocks are entirely       of granite     ;  and the huge wave-worn
boulders, sudden         pillars,   and piles of broad ledges         into
which they have been disrupted, give                 endless  variety    to
their forms.      Sometimes they have a castellated             aspect, as
at

 of nature's cunning architecture.           Beautiful are the outlines
 of its topmost grey shelving ledges,             softened   with shaggy
pale-green Byssus-lichen,          —beautiful     its huge rectangular
masses     of warm light-brown, blackened here and there with
the mysterious beginnings of life, and darkening downwards
to the shining deep-brown reefs that             jut from the Atlantic
waves, which      lift their curling       masses   of crystal greenness
into momentary splendour, and then dash, and break, and
whirl in milky eddies among the ever-passive rocks.                  Pas
sive   are they    ?   Yes   ;   and yet    passivity itself is only a
slower action, which           escapes   our notice.    The rocks, too,
are mutinous        with change,       could our eyes but follow it.
They, too, grow, and change,              and die, and give up their
substances     to the great        All, returning whence they       came.
Changeless      they    seem,     in contrast     with   the   impatient
waters;     and yet with          reluctant concession     they give up
their    elements    to   the ambient air, and to the confluent
restlessness    of water, gradually rounding off their angles,
and softening their rugged asperities.           Mysterious and beau

                           THE GRANITE COAST.                                       191
The          Giant's     Castle — indeed, the whole of this southern
shore — has a character              of drear magnificence and massive
grandeur, given to           it by the disposition of its piled-up boul
ders and towering            altitudes, not to be anticipated from the
size of the islands.            The truth        is,   we are always impressed
by relative, not absolute size.                  Rocks, many thousands of
feet   in height, have         a   stupendous aspect only in isolation                ;
among others,           of kindred girth and altitude, they produce
no such towering             impression.         The eye takes its standard
from       the forms around.             The     subtle influence of propor
tion rouses emotions of the sublime, even on these small
islands     ;   emotions of gentler swell are raised by every creek
and valley.
   The rambles are delicious.                They want, indeed, the charm
of Devonshire, with its wondrous lanes —
                   "   Such nooks of valleys,   lined with orchises,
                       Fed full of noises by invisible streams."
                                                                   *
There       are no      rills and rivulets           intersecting          the land, no
affluence of vegetation making                  it
                                                 a     miracle of beauty and of
life   ;   but the lanes have their charm, and to that charm                        I
yielded myself.
   After my first walk had satisfied the first cravings, and
set the mind at ease respecting the wisdom                         of my choice in
choosing Scilly,        I    returned to my lodgings, unpacked the
book-box, arranged the working-table with its necessary jars,
bottles, dissecting implements, and microscope                         ;   and, resting
from these labours, opened Borlase to gain from his ancient

 quarto some information       about the place.         I will not, as
some learned pundits do, pitilessly burden you            with all the
knowledge recently obtained        ;   because,   although   I  suspect
you to be hopelessly ignorant on all these matters,              I  also
suspect you to be quite comfortable in that condition, and
by no means hungering for information              ;  and at any rate,
you know where such hunger can be satisfied.              But on the
baptism of the islands a word may be worth hearing.                Bor
lase pertinently asks,
                           " How came all these islands to have
their general name from so small and inconsiderable a spot            as
 the isle of Scilly, whose cliffs hardly anything but birds can
mount, and whose barrenness would never suffer                anything
but sea-birds    to inhabit there    ?   A   due observation     of the
shores   will answer this question very satisfactorily, and con
vince us, that what is now      a bare    rock, about a furlong over,
and separated from the lands of Guel and Brehar about half
a mile, was formerly     joined to them by low necks of land,
and that Treskaw, St Martin's,           Brehar,     Samson,   and the
rocks and islets adjoining, made formerly but one island."
Thus   it was by  encroachments    of the   sea, according to Borlase,
or by the dipping of the lands, that the one island was sepa
rated into several.     Scilly was the highest and most conspi
cuous    headland,   and from    it the whole group derived its
name.     That these isles were by the Greeks called Cassitc-
rides, and by the Romans Sigddes, Stlltnce, and Silures, may
be conceded     to antiquarians    and topographers, or denied          ;
we shall trouble ourselves       but slightly with the question.
Certain it seems that Phoenicians and Romans came here for

trade began to thrive, shipping to increase,        and naval wars
to be carried on in the western world, the commodious situa
tion of these islands at the opening into both the Channels
soon showed of what importance          it was to  possess them, and
how dangerous they might be to the trade and safety of
England if in an enemy's hand."            The hungry may find in
Borlase a succession       of historical dates and facts from the
tenth century downwards        ;  we will pause only at what is said
of Queen Elizabeth, who saw the importance of these islands            ;
 " and
         having the Spaniards, then the most powerful nation
 by sea in the world, to deal with, ordered Francis Godolphin
 (knighted by her in 1580, and made Lord-Lieutenant of the
 county of Cornwall)       to improve this station.      Star Castle
 was begun and finished in 1593.            At  the same time were
 built a curtain and some bastions on the same hill."              The
 castle   still remains  ; and the fortifications  — not of    a very
 formidable     aspect — manned    by five invalids,   still keep up
 the fiction of awing the enemies of England.           Not being     a
 military man, and still less a politician, it does occur to me
 either that Scilly is strangely neglected in the matter of for
 tifications,   or else that our enemies     are very easily awed.
 What Borlase said of it a century ago remains true to-day             :
  "  In the time of war it is of the utmost importance to Eng
 land to have Scilly in its possession : if it were in an enemy's
 hand, the Channel trade from Ireland, Liverpool, and Bristol
  to  London and the south of England could not subsist          ;  for
  Scilly, lying at the point of England, and looking into both
  channels,    no ship could pass, but a privateer might        speak
  with it from one of these sounds.            This the Parliament

quickly experienced          as  soon   as  Sir John Granville        had
garrisoned and fortified Scilly.          Whitelock tells us that con
tinual complaints were made to the then managers of affairs
at London, of the taking of ships by the privateers at Scilly,
so that at last they were obliged to send          Admiral Blake and
Sir George Askue to dislodge the cavaliers from             a post which
gave   them such       opportunities      of distressing their trade."
Surely a post of this importance needs a stronger garrison
                                                                   "
than five invalids ? Five may do for the " contingent                 of a
small German prince         ; nay,  in one sublime instance, five is
the sum total of the standing army, but in that case the
principality itself is of commensurate importance.
   What has been already hinted will suffice to show that
these   patches     of rock, on which       ribald Cockneys doubted
whether English were spoken, and flounces worn, are islands
dignified    by historical      and political    associations.     These
Cockneys may be further assured              that not only is English
spoken here, but spoken with a purity of accent, and intelli
gent discrimination       of diction, which    I remember in no     other
part of the English dominion.            The Scillians    are a remark
ably healthy, good-looking           race — the black eyes and       long
eyelashes of the children making one's parental fibres tingle
with mysterious pleasure as the ruddy rascals pause in their
sport to look at the stranger.          Their manners are gentle and
dignified  ;  civil, not servile.     Not an approach to rudeness
or coarseness have      I  seen anywhere.
   In the highest     sense of the word civilisation, therefore, the
notion of the place being " half civilised" is altogether wrong.

It   is only on making inquiries in the direction of commerce
that the mind gets familiarised with the consequences of the
remoteness       of these islands.        Then it is seen that, as far as
civilisation is represented by shopkeeping, Scilly is at present
in an embryonic condition.               To speak physiologically, there
is but slight differentiation of function in the Scillian com
mercial tissue.        Just   as   in the simpler organisms we                  see one
part of the body undertaking several functions which in more
complex organisms devolve upon separate parts, so here we
perceive the same smiling individual weighing                            out butter
and measuring yards of muslin, proposing the new cut of a
cheese to your         discriminating         taste,        or the new style of

aerial indistinctness                     through     the Scillian mind.            Poultry,

is calm, which               it never is at this          season    ;   and when the one

extremity which, in a zoologist, would have been only a milder
form of cannibalism.         Standing thus at the point of inter
section of two such paths, the pangs of prospective hunger
developed      in me new resources       and new impudences.          I
went boldly to Mrs Tregarthen (observe she is not a widow),
and to her pathetically unfolded the          case,   on the supposi
tion that she might not be utterly meatless, in which cir
cumstance the loan of a chop or steak might gracefully be
accorded.       Meatless the gentle and generous woman was
not.    A    piece  of beef, killed eight days ago, and now kept
fresh in salt against emergencies,         would furnish      me  with
a steak sufficient for two days, and there was a rumour            that
 on the third day beef would be killed, when             I could stock
 myself   till next killing-time.     Beef, at sevenpence     a-pound,
 as  I said, is the only meat you can reckon on, even             with
forethought.       In the time of Borlase it was just the con
trary,   mutton      being then    the meat,     and    beef a rarity.
 " About twenty years since,"           he says,
                                                    " the inhabitants
generally lived on salt victuals, which they had from Eng
land or Ireland      ; and  if they killed a bullock here,    it was so
seldom, that in one of the best houses in the islands they
 have kept part of a bullock killed in September to roast for
their Christmas dinner."          He adds, that in his time mutton
was abundant enough, but beef unattainable.
    Spiritual-minded      persons, indifferent   to mutton, may dis
regard this carnal inconvenience, and take               refuge in the
more ideal elements of picturesqueness, solitude, and simpli
city.    I  cannot say that the inconvenience weighed heavily

enlarged experience          proved the case not to be quite so bad
as   it   seemed at first.    After all,       I   came not here          for sumptu
ous larders,     but for zoological delights            ;   and those were not
wanting.        Was not the mere aspect of the sea a banquet                                ?
Xenophon        tells us that, when the Ten Thousand saw the
sea again, they        shouted.        No wonder.               After their weary
eyes had wandered forlorn over weary parasangs                            of flat earth,
and that earth an enemy's, wistfully yearning for the gleams
of the old familiar blue, they came upon it at last, and the
heart-shaking sight was saluted by a shout still more heart-
shaking.       At   the first flash of         it there must have               been a
general hush, an universal catching of the breath, and the
next moment, like thunder                 leaping from            hill to hill, the
loosened burst of gladness           ran along the ranks, reverberating
from company to company, swelling into a mighty symphony
of rejoicing.       What a sight, and what a sound                    !     There was
more than safety in that blue expanse, there was more than
loosened      fear in their    joy at      once      again seeing the dear
familiar face.      The sea was a passion to the Greeks                          ;   they
took naturally to the water, like ducks, or Englishmen, who
are, if we   truly consider   it,   fonder of water than the ducks.                   We
are sea-dogs from our birth.              It   is   in our race — bred in the
blood.       Even the most inland and bucolic youth takes spon

will sometimes        be — he goes through           it with   a certain care
less grace,     a manly haughtiness, or at the lowest a certain
" official
             reserve," not observable in the foreigner.*                    What
can be a more abject picture                 than a Frenchman          suffering
from sea-sickness       — unless it       be a German         under the same
hideous circumstances           ?     Before getting out of harbour he
was radiant, arrogant, self-centred                ;  only half an hour has
passed,    and he is green,            cadaverous,      dank, prostrate,        the
manhood seemingly spunged out of him.                          N.B. — In this

 sort of surprise, that even thus had the sea been glancing,

bending over old books, engaged               in serious work and daily
frivolous talk, through all these hurrying hours, the tides
had continued rising and receding, the pools had been filled

to the sun, the molluscs had crawled among the weeds, the
currents of life had ebbed and flowed in the great systole

 therefore, to Homer,       familiar  with sights and sounds so
 unusual, the     sea  could nevertheless be held as abounding
 in marvels, judge what it abounds in for our more easily
 astonished minds.
    Come with me to the rocks, on my first visit after arrival.
 The tide is not a very good one, but in a few minutes we
 discover that we are in the land of marvels.             Here are the
 snaky-armed Antheas in abundance           :   green with ravishing
 pink tips   ; brown with silver-grey tentacles        ; and a few of
 quaker drab.      Presently a noble Crassicornis reveals him
 self in a cleft — impossible to get at, unfortunately.          But in
 a few minutes another, then another, then a group, at last
 such    quantities   of  them make their appearance,          that the
heart palpitates at the wealth.        Was not this worth a few
hours' discomfort on board the packet            ?   Nay (now that it
is past), what was that discomfort       ?    A    hurricane of blows
upon the chisel answers with contemptuous emphasis.
    It  is laborious     work this chiselling away of Anemones
from the granite.        The grey-slate of Ilfracombe was trouble

descry two specimens              of marine spiders, or daddy-long-legs
(Nymphon gracile), very curious to behold.                      They have no
body to speak of ; a mere line, not thicker than one of their
legs, representing the torso.                 Tie a piece of silk thread, about
one-fourth of an inch long, into four equidistant knots, and
that   will represent the body            ;    from each of these knots let
much longer pieces of the same thread dangle, and you have
the legs       ;   split the tip of the thread into three filaments, and
you have the head          ;   gum bits of dirty wool, about as large as
a pin's head, on the second legs, and you have the egg-sacs                        :
and with this the animal is complete.                      The microscope re
veals fresh wonders, the head being furnished                   with crab-like
nippers    ;       the alimentary tube, instead of occupying an iso
lated and dignified position in the body, meanders                      out into
each of the legs, so that the leg repeats                  the body in its in
ternal structure, as well as in aspect.                 This ramified alimen
tary canal is covered with brownish yellow globules or cells,
called " hepatic cells," upon no very convincing evidence,
and supposed           to represent a rudimentary liver.           Mr     Gosse,

sort or other are forced forward."                    It   was food which         Mr

there is none.             The blood,      if blood it can        be called, is outside

                                      I    had reason to be the more pleased

thing to be known of the development of the Pycnogonidce,
I had been fortunate enough, at Ilfracombe, to discover some
of the embryonic phases, of which                         I      made          drawings, and
awaited further opportunity                  for pursuing the subject.
    If the reader          will turn to Plate V.,         fig.   3,   he   will see    a   Nym

aspect,    will marvel still          more at fig.         4,    which      is  a    magnified
representation of the same animal in the egg                               ;    and he may
puzzle himself by trying to conceive the stages of metamor
phosis through which this creature must pass before                                       it   can
exchange        the squab rotundity            of its early shape for the slim
and meagre elegance of maturity.                          Are Sylphs bulbous in

What is this    ? a  tiny Daisy on a frond of weed         ?   the beauty  !
No, now    it is in the bottle, it turns out to       be an Eolis,    Eolis
alba, lovely among the loveliest.           Stay  !   here are two cow
ries, and alive    !    The shells every one has seen, but few of
us have seen the animals        ;  so the capture is very welcome.
My back is aching with all this stooping and groping, and                  I
really must get home now, content with my day's work.
One farewell glance in at that pool, and         I have    done.      Lying
on my face, and dangling my feet in water,              I peer scrutinis-
ingly for some minutes, and bear off a lovely green Actceon,
as a reward.      (The Actaeon resembles an Eolis without the
papillae.)    Now     I will turn homewards.
    Another day, in idler mood, we ramble along the shore
in receipt of windfalls.          A  bottle is always ready in the
pocket, and something is certain to turn up.                     The stem
and root of that oar-weed, for example, is worth an investi
gating glance,       certain as   it is of being a colony of life.
 The tiny Annelids, white, green, and red, wriggle in and out
among the sheltering shadows             of these roots     ;  the Sponges
 and Polyzoa      cluster on them      ;   and  see   !   what pink-and-
white feathery creature is this, clasping the weed with                    a
 circle of pale pink roots      ?   By heavens      ! it is   a  Comatula
 (Plate  VI., fig.   2)  ; and now that      it feels    the grateful sea-
 water again, how        it expands its feathers, and         reveals  itself
 as an   animal fern, marvellous to look upon.                  Sudden joy
 leaps  in our hearts at the sight of this creature,               hitherto
 known only from hazy descriptions and inadequate engrav
 ings.   There is interest in reading about Crinoidea, fossil

and recent,       and in learning          that the Comatula is one of
these, having kindred          with star-fishes     ; but how that interest
is intensified by direct inspection             of the living animal        !   I
could not satiate myself with looking                    at my   prize*       All
the way home the bottle was constantly                       being raised to
my loving regard, that           I  might feast myself upon the wav
ing grace of those pink and white feathers                   ; and  I  thought
of the poetical passage in which Edward Forbes expresses his
emotions about these Crinoidea which " raise                       up  a vision
of an early world, a world the potentates of which were not
men, but animals — of seas on whose tranquil surfaces myriads
of convoluted Nautili sported, and in whose depths millions of
Lily-stars waved wilfully on their slender stems.                    Now, the
Lily-stars and Nautili are almost gone                 ;  a few lovely strag
glers of those once abounding tribes remain to evidence the
wondrous forms and structures of their comrades.                          Other
beings, not less wonderful, and scarcely less graceful, have
replaced them        ; while the seas in which they flourished have
become lands whereon man                in his columned cathedrals and
mazy palaces          emulates     the beauty and symmetry of their
 fluted stems and chambered cells." +
     The delight of getting new animals is like the delight of
 childhood in any novelty, an impulse that moves the soul
 through the intricate paths of knowledge — knowledge which
 is but broken wonder            ;  and this delight the naturalist has
 constantly awaiting him.              Satiety is not possible, for Nature

is inexhaustible.            Knowledge unfolds vista after vista, for
ever stretching         inimitably distant, the horizon moving as we
move.        New facts connect themselves with new forms               ;   the
most casual observation often becomes a spark of inextin
guishable thought, running along trains of inflammable sug
gestion.          To this intent the naturalist should always have
pencil and note-book on his working-table, in which to record
every new fact, no matter how trifling             it may    seem at the
moment        ;   the time   will   come when that and other facts         will
be the keys to unlock many a casket.              Not that Observation
alone   is,   as many imagine, the potent instrument             of Zoology.
Lists of details crowd books and journals, yet these are in
themselves no better than the observations of Chaldean shep
herds, which produced no              Astronomy in centuries of watch
ing.    They find their place in science, only as the architec
tural mind disposes them in due co-ordination.               What should
we think of        a   chemist who, on mere inspection of substances,
unaided by re-agents, and his balance,               hoped to further
Chemistry?             What would lists of such observation avail?
And in the far more complex science of Biology, how shall
cursory inspection, superficial observation, avail           ?    We must
follow the Methods which have led to certainty in the exact
sciences.         We must render the complex facts of Life as simple
as we can, by processes of elimination.            Experiment must go
hand in hand with Observation, controlling             it,   and assuring
us that we have correctly observed.              Much has been done,
and    is   daily done, in this way, yet still men too easily con
tent themselves with observation, or, what            is   equally    falla

cious, with anatomical deduction, declaring an organ to have
such and such a function,        merely because     it  resembles    an
organ known to have the function        ;  when in most of these
cases, direct experiment would show the error          of the conclu
sion.   In former chapters    I  have illustrated this point, and
have again to do so respecting the digestive power of the
Sea Anemones.
   In my note-book is pencilled this brief query, " Do the
Actiniae digest at all?" a doubt which, in its naked simpli
city, might   rouse contempt in the mind of any zoologist
accidentally reading it. What      ! here is an animal notoriously
carnivorous, and you ask whether it can digest          ?   Have not
you yourself repeatedly     fed  these animals    with limpets and
cooked beef? are they not greedy of such food?              It  is per
fectly true.   Nevertheless a doubt occurred to me whether
they did really digest, in any proper sense of the term           ; and
I made a note   of the doubt, as of a point to be investigated
immediately on my arrival at the coast.         Experiment should
settle the doubt.   Before narrating the experiments,          it will
be needful to settle  with the reader a few generalities on the
subject of Digestion   ; since,   in point of fact, the interest of
the question falls mainly on the general subject, and only
with a secondary importance on the digestive powers of the
Anemones.
   What are we to understand by Digestion           ?    At first   the
question seems so easy    ;  yet the closer  it is investigated, the
remoter seems the possibility of answering it.          Let us make

function        of the        intestinal      canal  — from       Assimilation,
 which is the general property possessed by all living tissues.
 For an animal to grow, and to repair the waste which the
 action of life incessantly produces,             it must assimilate, which,
 as the word implies,             means    to separate from the external
 medium such substances as are like to its own substance —
 or can be converted into them by the vital chemistry — re
jecting all such as are unlike, or not convertible.                Very simple
 organisms find assimilable food in the element they live in,
 and the process of separation is easy               :  they have no stomach,
 not even a mouth, much less glands secreting solvent fluids.
 Very complex organisms, on the contrary, do not, in the air
 they breathe, or on the earth they tread, find the variety of
 substances necessary to           build up their bodies       ; the substances
 have to be sought, captured, and when found, are not found
 in an assimilable condition, but in a condition requiring
 great changes, mechanical and chemical, before they are able
 to enter into the construction of the tissues.
     An example will make this plain                 :    Let us first consider
 the process in the Actinophrys, a microscopic animal care
 fully studied by Kolliker*                It  is a mere mass of jelly-like
 substance,      very contractile, without the slightest trace of
 organs, perhaps also          without even a distinct envelope separ
 able from the mass.f              The outer layer is formed into long

    t On the existence of a distinct membrane there is much dispute. The
 arguments,   for and against the existence of single-celled animals, are such as,
 in the present state of inquiry, render decision difficult. To my mind, however,
 the researches of  Acerrach ( Ueber die EinzeUigleit der A maben., in Sierold
 0 Ko'luker's    Zeitschrift, vii. 365) render extremely probable the fact that an
 enveloping membrane and a nucleus always exist, which afford a very strong

tentacular filaments, which, like the tentacles of a Polype,
seize hold       of young animalcules, or even minute Crustaceans.
The resemblance           to the Polype is carried further              :   no sooner
does one of the filaments seize a prey than                       it retracts       ;    all
the others bend their points over the captive, and gradually
enclose      it ; they then retract, and bring the food in contact
with the body of the animal.                   The point of contact is next
seen to yield inwards, retracting                   as the filaments had re
tracted, and, as         it deepens, the food sinks into the                substance
of the body, the edges of the cavity closing over it.                             In the
centre of the body the soluble parts are dissolved, the body
having        resumed its original            appearance.         This done, the
insoluble parts make their way out, much as they made their
way in     ;   and thus the whole process of ingestion and egestion
is accomplished.
    We need not pause to trace the episodes of the complex
story of Digestion in the higher animals, episodes of masti
cation, insalivation, chymification, chemical transformations
aiding mechanical actions               ;   every one is familiar with the
general facts.          Let us only note that even milk, which con
tains all the substances needed for the nourishment                              of the
argument in favour of the unicellular structure of these animals.            Although      I
have been unable, in repeated examinations,       to convince myself of the existence
of a distinct   membrane,   optical delusion being easy in this matter,   I cannot    resist
the conclusion     that something of the kind does exist, inasmuch         as there are
currents inside the body of the Amoeba       ; and after watching these currents,         or
rather oscillations,   carrying the large dark globules with them into the various
prolongations of the body and back again, for upwards of an hour,             I  felt con
vinced that the Amoeba was a cell, or at any rate a closed cavity with liquid
contents.      As regards what is   said in the text, the point is of no importance ;
and this note is mainly added for the sake of directing the reader's attention
to Auerracb'S interesting essay.

child, contains them in a condition perfectly useless, as far as
the direct and immediate nourishment of the child is con
cerned       :    until the milk has undergone the digestive process,
namely, a succession of chemical decompositions and recom-
positions,         it is    no more     competent to nourish the muscles,
bones, and nerves                of the child, than so much chalk and water,
which            is delusively sold as milk in virtuous                    cities.     The
mutton            chop,    too,    which we justly reckon such                    excellent
food,    is only "food potential;"                 it must undergo                   a very
curious series of changes before it can be converted into blood.
Nor is the business finished there.                         We are erroneously
accustomed           to consider blood as the final stage of food, pre
vious to its assimilation.                 Physiologists         trace the story         of
Digestion up to this point, and there leave                     it;   as   story-writers
leave their heroes married, thereby indicating                             that nothing
more remains to be said.                 But just as marriage is the begin
ning of a new act in the drama, and the act in which all life
culminates, so is this blood-formation but the commencement
of a new series of changes, and these the most important.                                  I
think it can be shown that the blood itself is not more im
mediately and directly assimilable than the mutton chop from
which        it   was formed.          In its   passage   through the walls of
its vessels, it undergoes specific changes, fitting                        it for assimi
lation   ;       without such changes it is not assimilable                   ;   blood, as
blood, nourishes no tissue, but lies on               it like any other foreign
substance which must be got                 rid of by re-absorption into the
veins —as we               see   when a vessel is ruptured, and the blood
gets     deposited          in the parenchyma.            Blood         is,   in fact, as
                                                            "
Bergmann and Leuckart well express                    it,       a     depot of assimil-

able and secretory substances             ; and its purpose in the eco
nomy is that of a regulating                apparatus, which         is necessi
tated by the fluctuations in the procuring of food."*
    Remember also, that, before Assimilation can take place,
the food must be rendered soluble.                Solubility is a primary
condition, but not the only one.                Many soluble substances
have to undergo chemical changes,                 both of decomposition
and allotropism, before they form parts of the living body.
If albumen       or sugar be injected into the veins, they               will not
be assimilated, but cast            out unaltered in the excretions               ;
whereas,     if   injected into the alimentary canal, or into the
portal vein, which would carry them through the laboratory
of the liver, they are entirely assimilated.
    Thus we        see  that solubility and transformation               are the
two digestive effects, to produce which, two agencies are
needful, the mechanical             and chemical.          From these two
points     all   other questions         expansively       radiate, to them
all converge.          A  single fact strikingly impresses             the mind
with a sense of the extent to which chemical agency reaches,
namely, that in the course of four-and-twenty                   hours a sixth
part of the whole weight of the body is poured into the ali
mentary canal, under the form of various secretions.                       Much
 more fluid is secreted from the blood and poured into this
 canal   during a single day, than would make up the whole
 mass    of fluid circulating in the blood-vessels at any given
period.-f-

  twofold  agency    of Digestion, and especially to its chemical
  agency, that a clear view may be taken      of the question which
  must arise as to what, in the abstract, is the purpose of
  Digestion.     In the abstract we may declare it to be the pre
 paration of the food, rendering it fitted for Assimilation.
  But if we descend from heights of abstraction, and approach
 concrete questions, we soon find this answer including several
 processes   in the higher animals — such as the prehension and
 mastication of food, its absorption and circulation, its aeration
 in the blood, and finally, its transudation through the walls
 of the capillaries — none of which can, without great impro
 priety, be called digestive.     We must be more specific.         No
 man would confound Mastication          with Digestion, or Circu
 lation with Digestion     ; and we must therefore      limit the term
Digestion to some specific meaning         ; Mastication is the spe
cial function of the jaws, Circulation        of the vessels, Respi
ration of the lungs, and Digestion of the alimentary canaL
But even this is too vague for our purpose         ;   we must affix a
still more specific character to Digestion       ;    and this may be
expressed    in the following formula    :   That, and that only, is
a specifically digestive act which takes place       in an alimentary
canal,  by means of secretions capable of chemically modify
ing the food, so as to prepare it for Assimilation.
    The preparation of food we have seen to be both mechani
cal   and chemical,     but   I select the latter as the specific
characteristic of the digestive process, in order to prevent
confusion.      Claude Bernard says : " We can conceive an
animal    without any digestive        apparatus,      mechanical or
chemical, because     living in an element which furnishes nutri-

 tive material directly      ;   we can also conceive          the digestive
 act reduced to a simple mechanical apparatus which                       has to
 press out certain alimentary juices capable             of nourishing the
 tissues without undergoing chemical modifications;                          but
 usually the digestive act is composed of two orders of pheno
 mena, physical and chemical."*           This is a brief and luminous
 classification as regards the whole animal series, and                  it well
 expresses the ascending complexity             of that series     ;  but inas
much as special        functions only make there             appearance       at
certain stages       of that ascending series, inasmuch as the
 simpler animals have not the special functions of more com
plex animals, we must deny to the two first classes of M.
Bernard's series any such special function as Digestion, and
confine    it to the third     class.     We do not, except in loose
latitude of phrase, speak of the legs of an animalcule, mean
ing its organs of Progression       ;  because a leg is a specific organ
of Progression, uniform in its elements throughout the series
of animals possessing legs ; nor should we, otherwise than in
easy speech,    talk of the Digestion of a Polype, meaning there
by its Nutrition.       The purpose of a leg, progression, is ful
filled by the cilia, which move the animalcule              ;   the purpose
of Digestion, preparation of food, is performed by the cavity
of the Polype      ;  but the specific     organs named legs and ali
mentary canal, and the specific            functions of those           organs
(Walking and Digestion), are in both cases absent.
    If  the   reader   has   followed     me thus far,        he    will have
understood       that, when      I   doubted      whether      the Actiniae

                                                                          *
preparing food, but only of their power of chemically digest
ing it.   I  doubted, in short, whether       they should not be
separated from the more complex animals which digest, and
whether they should not rank in M. Bernard's second class.
We do not call a hut or group of cottages a city.                We   do
not speak of its commerce,       its government, its literature         ;
these are social functions     developed   in a complex city, not
possible in a group of cottages.      In the same way we should
not expect    to find Digestion,      Respiration,     Sensation,     or
any other complex function, in animals so simple as a Sea
Anemone.      Nor could the notion ever have gained currency,
had there been the proper precision in our zoological lan
                           "                            "
guage, and had not the fallacy of observation             misled us.
    Now to the experiments.         The first point to be settled
was this   : Have the Polypes anything         of the nature of a
solvent fluid secreted by their stomachs       ?
                                                   "   It is obvious,"
 says  Dr Carpenter, the latest writer on this subject, " that
a powerfully   solvent fluid is secreted from the walls of the
gastric cavity  ; for the soft parts of the food which is drawn
 into it are gradually dissolved, and this      without the assist
 ance  of any mechanical trituration."       Obvious, indeed, the
 fact seems, until it is interrogated a little more closely, and
 then we find, 1st, that no solvent fluid is secreted        ;  2d, that
 the food is not dissolved, but only the juices pressed out.
    My first experiment was to test the presence or absence
 of a secretion,   which    was accomplished       thus    :   Tying a
 narrow strip of litmus-paper round a small piece of recently
 caught fish, and fastening     it to  a thread,    I   gave    it to an
 Antliea cereua who greedily swallowed it            ;  another thin

slice of the same              fish was        folded longitudinally           over a
similar bit of litmus-paper, and given to a Crassicornis.
If any      acid secretion were present, the paper would redden                        ;
if    not, the blue colour would                   remain.      On the following
morning the ejected morsels were examined, but not a trace
of acid reaction was visible.                      Repeating       the experiment
several times under varying conditions,                       I   came to the con
clusion       that no acid fluid was present in the digestive
process       of the Actiniae.               There    still remained a doubt.
Solvent secretions are either acid or alkaline.                        It was neces
sary to make similar experiments with an alkaline re-agent.
This      was done, and        with similar results.           It   is worth noting
that     M. Hollard equally failed in detecting                     an acid or alka
 line reaction,* which is a confirmation of my experiments.
      The Actiniae do not effect their preparation of nutriment
by chemical means               ;   and in our strict         sense     of the term,
they cannot         be    said to digest.           I  was anxious to         see how
far mechanical            means were employed, and for this, Reau
 mur's admirable experiment was a guide.                         In his day it was
supposed        that digestion was a purely mechanical operation,
 the food being ground into a pulp in the stomach.                            He took
 hollow silver balls, perforated with holes, and filling them
 with meat, caused them to be swallowed by a dog.                               When
 they had remained a suitable period in the animal's stomach,
 they were withdrawn                 by the thread attached to them.                 If

the digestive process        were mechanical, the meat would be
protected from all grinding action, by the silver covering                 ;
if  chemical, the meat would be digested               ; and digested (or
rather chymified)     it proved to       be    ; showing that a solvent
fluid had penetrated the holes, and dissolved the meat.                    I
took a piece of quill, of about half an inch in length, open at
both ends, and having six good openings cut in the sides,
thus affording ample means for any solvent fluid to exert
its action on the roast-beef enclosed             in the quill.     On exa
 mination of the ejected quills,        I   found no appreciable differ
 ence   between the contained meat,               and similar     pieces of
 meat left   in the water during the same period                ; in one of
 them which had the meat protruding                 somewhat from each
 end   of the quill, there was a maceration of the protruded
 ends, which looked      like a digestive effect     ; but on submitting
 it to the microscope,        I found the muscle-fibres not at all
 disintegrated, the striae being as perfect as in any other
 part, and the maceration obviously of a purely mechanical
 nature.    A   similar     appearance      is presented   by meat, after
 its ejection by the Actiniae      :   it is pulpy, colourless, but the
  muscles are not disintegrated.
     Mr  R  Q. Couch,      of Penzance, was good enough to repeat
  these experiments for me.          " I folded
                                                   portions of whiting in
  test papers," he writes, "and gave them to the Actiniae. After
  12 hours the whole was ejected               without   the papers being
  either broken or discoloured.           I   placed bits of mackerel in
  gutta-percha    silk,    with the same result.            Taking other
  specimens,   which    I  kept fasting for a fortnight,        I gave each
  a portion   of the silvery part of a mackerel,             measured    its

length, and weighed                      it in   a delicate balance.               In   one case
the fish was ejected after 23 hours, and in another 32 hours,
and in several others about 18 and 20 hours.                                        The parts
were folded on each other, and compressed                                 into oval masses
which, with the point of a pen,                            I   could unravel easily.         In
measure       they were precisely as                           I   had given       them.     In
weight       there was a difference                    :   in one     case,    9 grs. were
reduced to        5\     grs.    ;   in others,        8 grs.        to   5 ; 11   grs. to   5     ;
7 grains to       3^.       In   one piece from which                 I   had expressed all
the fluid    I    could, the decrease was slight, and the food was
soon rejected.           But in every                case the delicate         skin of       the
ventral portions of the mackerel and whiting were unin
jured. The fine metallic lustre was untouched, and the skin
unbroken      ;   showing that the digestion does not consist in
appropriating the substance of the food given, but in express
ing the juices contained therein."
  I   dare    not pause now to touch upon the many topics
which are suggested by the conclusion to which these inves
tigations led me.               It       will be enough just to note here the
progressive complication                     of the digestive function in the
progressive complexity of the animal series.                                  Starting from
the simple cell, which draws its nutriment from the plasma
surrounding        it,   by   a      simple process of endosmosis,                      we first
arrive at the mouthless Actinophrys,                                 or Amoeba, which,
folding its own substance                        over the food, presses out such
nutriment         as   it   can      ;   we then reach the                Infusory with       a
mouth, but without stomach of any kind * and the Polype,             ;

which has a portion of its integument folded in, serving
both for mouth and stomach, but not anatomically differing
from the external integument, nor physiologically                                   differing
in its action from that of the Amoeba's gelatinous sub
stance ;* we then ascend to the Annelids                                     having a real
intestine, lying free in the general cavity, but only mode
rately, when at all, furnished with secretory apparatus                                  ;   and
so on,         till at length          we reach          the   Mammalia, with their
marvellously complex digestive                             apparatus.        Corresponding
with this increasing complexity of the organs is the increas
ing complexity of the food which the animals digest, from
simple gases up to meat.
         If   all were not so marvellous in Nature, would not the
marvellous fact that food itself exists, arrest us                              ?    Food is
what the organism can separate                             from the world around              it,
converting what                  it   separates          into its own life.         We       may
consider Life itself as an ever-increasing identification with
Nature.           The simple cell, from which the plant or animal
arises, must draw                  light and heat from the sun, nutriment
from the surrounding                      world, or else            it   will remain quies
cent, not alive, although latent                         with life   ;    as the grains       in
Egyptian tombs, which, after lying thousands of years quies
cent in those sepulchres,                       are placed      in the earth, and then
     *   Trembley turned a Hydra inside out, and found the outside perform the
function of      a   stomach.      This has been held as proof that a mucus membrane
is   only a reflection       of the skin.        But from what has been advanced         in this
chapter, the reader may suspect that, inasmuch as the polype has no mucus
membrane         whatever,      the so-called    stomach not being anatomically distinguish
able      from   the   external skin, and          the    process   of digestion being wholly
mechanical,       the current opinion       is   not proved by Trembley's experiment.

                 FOOD     AND  KNOWLEDGE.                       219
smile forth as golden wheat.        What we call growth, is it
not a perpetual absorption of Nature, the identification of
the individual with the universal?         And may we not in
speculative moods consider Death as the grand impatience of
the soul to free itself from the circle of individual activity, —
the yearning   of the creature to be united with the Creator     ?
   As with Life,    so also  with Knowledge,       which is intel
lectual life.  In the early days of man's history, Nature and
her marvellous ongoings were regarded with but a casual
and careless eye, or else with the merest wonder.          It was
late before profound and reverent study of her laws could
wean   men from impatient speculations       ;  and now, what is
our intellectual    activity based   on,   except   on the more
thorough mental absorption of Nature       ?   When that absorp
tion is completed,    the mystic drama      will  be sunny clear,
and all Nature's processes   will be visible to man, as a divine
Effluence and Life.

The traveller's first wish is Shakespeare's —
               " I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
                 With the memorials and the things of fame
                 That do renown this city."
   At Scilly there is no city,       and this non-existent        city boasts
     "
no     things of fame," unless we choose so to consider the
grave where      Sir Cloudesley Shovel was first interred, which
crowns the negative attractions                of the Isles by being no
grave at all.    I am quite    serious.      They ask you here, whether
you have seen the grave           ; on investigation,        this renowned
spot turns out to be destitute even of the rudest stone or
landmark to indicate where the bones of the wrecked admi
ral may imaginatively          be supposed         to  lie; it is simply a
strip of land on the coast,       where no grass will grow by reason
of the shifting sand.          And yet,      if  "gossip report" be not
wholly a fibber, somewhere            in this neighbourhood            lie the

remains of the great admiral, who was wrecked as he re
turned home covered with glory, 1500 or even 2000 men
perishing with him on these inhospitable rocks.            This was
a  century and a half ago, and tradition, we know, is apt to
magnify, vires acquirit eundo.        Still, if  they  will keep up
the tradition,   they might put up a commemorative stone.
Stones are abundant enough,       in all conscience     ; and, if we
believe the antiquaries, some of these         stones are invested
with the hoar of Druidical sanctity.
    Druidical erudition    is not   common.       On    probing   the
recesses   of my own knowledge on this mysterious subject,           I
found that the principal source of my familiarity with         it was
the opera of Norma.         For more than twenty years         I  had
reverently followed that splendid priestess Giulia Grisi, and
that majestic priest Lablache    ;  and  if  to these you add the
fragments of undeniable Druidical Remains             in the persons
 of the very ancient virgins of the sun, forming the nightly
 chorus of that opera, little doubt should be thrown on the
 accuracy of my historical conceptions.        With that erudition
 I  had been content.      But on reaching Scilly,         where the
 respectable Borlase assured    me    Druid temples and sacred
 rock-basins did veritably exist,   I was not a little anxious to
 bring my operatic erudition into direct confrontation with
 fact.   I even cleared my throat  for a pathetic burst of moriam
  insieme, when    I  should really stand beside a Tolmen, and
 with the mind's eye behold my casta diva about to perish,
  the victim of a superstition which had small sympathy with
  lovers.
     Following Borlase's directions,   I soon came upon a tower-

 ing altitude of stones, in solitary isolation on the shore.       A
 less erudite eye would have seen here       nothing but a pile of
 stones; but the forewarned mind descried          in their symme
 trical arrangement, ledge upon ledge, crag upon crag, the
 rude architecture of early days; especially when         it glanced
 at the stone-hedges    and stone-cottages near at hand, which
 assuredly were built by human architects, and showed a less
 symmetrical arrangement        than the towering pile.        Then,
 again, the rock-basins, in which the pure water of heaven
 was received,    who could doubt that their oval form and
 smoothly chiselled sides and bottoms, were the work of man?
 If the cairn of stones left vague doubts, these rock-basins
veritably were Druidical remains ; and thus fortified against
scepticism,    I  indulged   in the emotions which naturally
accompanied the belief of being          in the    presence  of the
remnants of a great human epoch long since passed away.
    Having indulged in these emotions, and extracted from
them all the pleasure they could yield,         it was with acqui
escent    equanimity    that  I   afterwards   learned how little
probability historical scepticism allowed to these Druidical
remains.     It appears   that the cairns are simply cairns, and
not temples.     The architecture is Nature's; and, indeed, the
forms are repeated      in almost every cairn along the shores.
Moreover, those rock-basins, which looked so convincingly
human    in their design and execution,     are proved   by Science
to be the result of the disintegrating        action of winds and
waters, the uniformity of the causes producing that uni
formity of result which        seemed    the betrayal of design.

man like Borlase (a naturalist too, and inventor of the strange
worm which bears his name, Nemertina Borlasia), wander
ing among these rugged rocks, and finding in them the
traces of an ancient religion                     ;    noticing the oval basins, and
believing      them to be human work                            ;   inventing      a   plausible
explanation of their uses, admiring                            their design, and feeling
a sacred awe         in their presence                ;   whereupon arrives the geolo
gist with his            disintegrating                explanation,           and the whole
erudite fabric falls to pieces.                       Had Borlase lived in our time,
imagine the ineffable scorn with which he would have looked
down upon my Druidical authority,                               Norma ; yet, you                 see,
he     is,   with all his learning, quite as unveridical as Giulia
Grisi, and not half so beautiful.                             If     Norma       is   not   a   good
historical authority,              it   is   at least     a   delightful one       ;   and,     with
Voltaire,    I      exclaim —
                        " On   court, lielas, apres la vgrite            ;
                         Ah    !   croyez-moi, l'erreur a son merite."
     Scepticism refuses admission to these Druidical remains
altogether, so that            I    need not occupy space                    with the descrip
tion of them.             But here           isa      story safe from the assaults of
scepticism, and thrilling                     enough       it       is   to deserve     a       place
among moving accidents.
     On the 16th November                         1840, the French               brig Ne'rine,
under        Captain       Pierre        Everdert, with                  a   cargo of oil and
canvass, sailing from                 Dunkirk for Marseilles, was forced to
heave to       in   a   gale about ten leagues south-west of the Scilly
Islands.        The crew consisted of seven, including the captain
and his nephew,            a       boy of fourteen.                 At   seven   in the evening
a    heavy sea struck the vessel, and completely capsized her —

  turning   the keel   upwards.       The only man on deck at the
  time was drowned.           In   the forecastle were three      men,
  Vincent,   Vantaure,      and Jean-Marie      : the two former, by
  seizing hold of the windlass-bits,         succeeded  in getting up
  close to the keelson,      and so kept their heads above water.
  The unfortunate Jean-Marie probably got his feet entangled
 — at   any rate, after convulsively grasping the heel of Van
 taure for a few seconds, he let go his hold, and was drowned.
  " The other two,
                         finding that the shock of the upset had
 started the bulkhead between the forecastle and the hold,
 and that the cargo itself had fallen down on the deck, con
 trived to draw themselves        on  their faces close alongside the
 keelson towards       the stern of the ship, from whence         they
 thought they heard some voices.           At   the time of the acci
 dent, the captain, the mate Gallo, and the boy Nicholas, were
 in the cabin.    The captain caught the boy in his arms, under
 the full impression that their last moment had arrived.
 The mate     succeeded     in wrenching open the trap-hatch in
 the cabin deck, and in clearing out some casks which were
jammed      in the lazarette (a sort of small triangular         space
 between the cabin floor and the keelson, where stores are
 generally stowed away)        : having effected this, he scrambled
 up into the vacant space, and took the boy from the hands
of the captain, whom he then assisted to follow them.               In
about an hour they were joined by Vincent and Vantaure
from the forecastle.       There were then five individuals closely
cooped    together   ;  as they    sat, they were    obliged to bend
their bodies for want of height above them, whilst the water
reached    as high as their waists      ; from which irksome posi-

tion, one at a time obtained some relief, by stretching at full
length on the barrels in the hold, squeezing himself close up
to the keelson."        What a situation       !   To rightly conceive
its horrors, we must know that their only means of distin
guishing day from night, was by the light which struck
from above into the       sea,   and was reflected    up through the
cabin skylight, and thence through the trap-hatch into the
lazarette.    " The
                       day and night of Tuesday the 17th, and
of Wednesday the 18th, passed without relief, without food,
almost without hope       ;   but each encouraged the others when
neither could hope for himself         ; endeavouring to assuage the
pangs of hunger by chewing the bark stripped off from the
hoops of the casks.            Want of fresh air threatening them
with death from suffocation, the mate worked almost inces
santly for two days and one night, in endeavouring, with his
knife, to cut a hole through the hull."
    There is something very terrible in contemplating such a
position, in seeing the mad energy of the mate thus to cut a
hole,  which would have caused instant destruction to the
sufferers, since   it was solely owing        to this confined air that
the vessel floated.      Bad    as  the tainted air was, and threaten
ing life every hour, it was the sole safety of the crew.          They
knew nothing of this        ;  and when the mate's knife broke,       a
savage wrath at      their frustrated hope must have seized them.
 " In the dead of the
                         night of Wednesday, the vessel suddenly
struck heavily   :   on the    third blow the stern dropped so much
that all hands were forced to make the best of their way, one
by one, further       towards      the bows    ; in attempting which
poor Vincent was caught by the water and drowned, falling

down through the cabin floor and skylight.       After the lapse
of an hour or two, finding the water to ebb, Gallo got down
into the cabin, and whilst seeking for the hatchet which was
usually kept there,     was forced to rush again    for shelter to
the lazarette, to avoid being drowned by the sea, which rose
on him with fearful rapidity.      Another hour or two of long-
suffering succeeded, when they were rejoiced to         see  by the
dawning of the day of Thursday the 19th, that the vessel
was fast on the rocks, one    of which projected up through the
skylight.    The captain then went down into the cabin, and
found that the quarter of the ship was stoved      ;  and, looking
through the opening, he called out to his companions above,
'
  Grace a Dieu, mes enfans     ! nous sommes    sauve's   ! Je vois
                        '
un homme a terre      !    Immediately after this the man ap
proached,    and put in his hand, which the captain seized,
almost as much to the terror of the poor man as to the
intense delight of the captain.     Several people of the neigh
bourhood were soon assembled        ; the side of the ship was
cut open, and the four poor fellows were liberated from           a
floating sepulchre, after an entombment of three days and
three nights in the mighty deep."       There is another curious
detail in this story which must not be omitted.           On Wed
nesday    afternoon, two pilot-boats    fell in with the wreck
floating bottom up, at about a league and        a   half from the
islands.    They took her in tow for about an hour, when
their towing ropes broke, and as night was approaching,
 with a heavy   sea running and bad weather threatening, they
 abandoned her, not having the faintest suspicion that there
were human beings alive on board a vessel which was floating

with little more than her keel above water.                                 Nevertheless,
although they abandoned the wreck, their temporary aid had
been essential             ;   had they not taken her in tow, the set of the
current would have drifted her clear of the islands into the
broad Atlantic waste.*
        Granite is the substance of these islands.                      Generally           it is
thought that Scilly is only                   a   continuation       of the granite of
Land's End            ;   against which conclusion the idea of a separate
and distinct               range    seems     supported by the fact that, in
dredging between the islands and the mainland, sea-weed is
often brought up attached to bits of slate and greenstone                                        ;
and the           Wolf Rock, which lies not far southward of                            a   line
from the Land's End to Scilly, is composed                 of this same
                                              "          "
greenstone.               What geologists call the strike of the granite
here        is,   with few exceptions, towards the north or                            north
north-west.               The rock itself          is   not always confined to the
constituent parts of quartz, felspar, and mica:                                   shorl     is   a
very common ingredient, sometimes accompanying the mica,
sometimes            replacing it.          Hornblende         is   rare,    chlorite       still
rarer.        Veins of pure white quartz, of considerable size,
often intersect the granite               ;       rose-coloured quartz, and even
chalcedony, have been found                   ;     but the general nature of the
stone      is     of a coarse kind, useless for quarrying               ;    and the gra
nite needed for the new lighthouse                       is   brought from Cornwall.
     The reader           will   be curious to          know about the zoological
wealth of Scilly.                Rich the place undoubtedly                 is,   yet not      so

rich as  I anticipated.       When       Dr Acland, of whom Oxford
is justly proud,    commenced         the foundation    of that anatomical
museum over which he presides,                Scilly was the first place
chosen by him for the collection            of specimens, on account of
its geographical position at the entrance of the Bristol, Irish,
and English Channels, with Rennel's Current near.                  He em
ployed Victor Carus, since known by an excellent work on
Morphology,*      as his purveyor for six months,            exploring and
dredging.     Carus has contributed            a little paper to North's
 Week  at Scilly, in which he gives expression to his opinion
that the " sea is not a dense one, although there are multi
tudes of zoophytes and hosts of fishes            ;  there are only a few
molluscs, some worms, and a not very large number of echi-
noderms."      On the whole, he does not think Scilly equal to
the Channel Islands.            Either     I have been lucky, or my
wishes pointed in different directions from those of Victor
Carus  ; for although unable to dredge, and confined, therefore,
to tide-pools,   I  have had an embarrassment             of riches rather
than a want thereof.         His verdict, however, is worth remem
bering, because, as these Isles are very inaccessible,             and are
hyperborean in the imperfection              of their commissariat, the
naturalist    should     weigh       advantages with         disadvantages
before   coming here.           The attractions are manifold,         as I
have before     explained     ;  but the attraction        of a very rich
fauna Scilly cannot boast,             unless zoophytes be the main
object of search.       The Anemones are various, and prodigally
abundant.     Anthea, and the noble Crassicornis, are almost
as frequent as the Smooth              Anemone is at Ilfracombe and

Tenby.          Gemmaceas abound           ; Daisies  are frequent      ;  the
Dianthus is to be had           ;  also the Orange-disked     ; and two
species, probably yet undescribed — of which more anon.
    To learn the geographical position of Scilly — above all, to
get a glance at the coast — you would imagine                  it to     be a
wonderful place for marine zoology.               The first obstacle lies
in the nature of the rock.           Granite, indeed, as mere granite,
is almost as bad          as  chalk cliffs, which let no ingenuous
reader waste his holiday upon.               The weeds are loth to grow
there     ;  and where no weeds grow, no herbivorous                animals
will congregate for pasture            ;  consequently no carnivorous
animals will be there to pasture on them.              The large amount
of silica in granite resists the decomposing action of winds
and waves, and of course still more energetically resists the
animals, who require, among other things, lime for their
shells.        Drear and barren is many a hopeful-looking                 reef
here    :   and barren they would all be, were it not for the com
pensating conditions of climate and tidal current.                  Scilly is
a  little to the west of the sixth degree of western longitude,
and exactly         in the fiftieth degree of northern            latitude    ;
consequently         it is the most southern part of the United
Kingdom, if we exclude the Channel Islands.                    The mean
temperature in summer is 58°, and in winter 45°.                   The pre
valent wind is south-west, or west-south-west.               As a conse
quence        of this equable      temperature, there are numerous
plants growing in the open air at Tresco, in the garden of Mr
 Smith,       the lord of the isles, which at Kew are to be seen
 only in the hothouses.           The aloes are magnificent     :   and rare
 plants from California and New Zealand flourish in profusion.

230                    SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
From this you perceive that the climatal conditions               are
very favourable, and, whenever Rennel's Current permits it,
the southern forms of animal life are swept in by the Atlantic.
    One great condition      demanded by       the tide-hunter      is
wanting here.       There are no caves, no gullies, no huge dark
fissures,   few    overhanging   ledges  and rock-pools.      It  has
already been noticed in these pages that darkness and depth
seem    primary conditions even on a good coast.       Within the
sheltering darkness of caves and fissures, these animals, im
patient of the light, are to be found crowding       together, and
are only accidentally found elsewhere.       On such a coast as
this you gain nothing, unless you have a man and crowbar
 with you to turn over the big stones.        Under these stones
 the animals crawl and nestle, chuckling, no doubt, at your
 zoological despair in the helpless endeavour to get at them,
 but laughing on the other side of their mouths (by a remark
 able anatomical mechanism not yet explained) when they
 find that you have outgeneraled them, and have overturned
 their bastions.     And yet this love of darkness is very para
 doxical.    Some of them, especially Annelids, are so impatient
 of the light that they speedily die in your jars and bottles,
 unless abundant shadows         protect them.    The Actiniae are
 stimulated by the light       ;  or perhaps   it would    be    more
 accurate    to say that the effect of light upon the sea-weed
 oxygenates      the water, and thus makes the Actiniae more
 vivacious.       Some   Actiniae — the Daisies, for example —
 habitually flaunt in the exposed glare of sunlight      ;  but the
 majority,    like all worms, Crustacea,     and most     Molluscs,
  retire into the darkest shade they can find.

                     LIGHT      A   VITAL AGENCY.                              231
    This has a paradoxical air, when we reflect on the para
mount importance of light among vital agencies.                        In   dark
ness the infusoria,       it is said,   will not    develop.      In   darkness
the plant withers.          Try to rear a plant in darkness, and no
amount of heat, air, or moisture (the other vital agencies)
will stimulate it to the        processes    of real growth.          Deprived
of light, it is deprived of food, and the possibility of food.
It   then lives entirely on its own substance,                like a starving
animal    ; the store of food which was in the seed is used up,
but no new food can be assimilated from without.                        Nay,     if
the experiment be carefully conducted,                   you    will find that
your plant in darkness, in spite of apparent growth, has
really lost some of its substance, instead of increasing                       it  ;
weighing      less, when dried, than the dry seed from which                     it
issued.     Science has proved that            it is in light, and in light
alone, that plants deoxidise carbonic acid — setting free the
oxygen, which can then be breathed by animals, and in thus
setting free the oxygen, releasing the carbon, which nourishes
the tissues of the plant.          It  was thought (and is still printed
in many text-books) that the green parts caused the liberation
of oxygen in light ; but Mulder correctsthis, saying that the
parts do not liberate the oxygen because                     they are green,
but become green in the process.*                 Rear the plant in dark
ness, and    its leaves will be pale       ; bring it into sunlight, and
these    pale leaves       instantly    decompose       carbonic      acid, and
assume a green tint.

light and organisation is soon told.                   It  was not suspected
until 1771, when Priestley discovered                    that the plant gave
out an air which               was capable       of maintaining          combus
tion.    He allowed         a   burning candle to extinguish itself in
a closed     vessel,     into which he subsequently introduced a
living plant      ;  and in ten days this plant had so altered the
condition of the contained air, that the candle once more
ignited    in it.       Many a schoolboy can               now explain this,
which was then a splendid discovery, and opened the path
whereon, three years later, Priestley laid a foundation-stone
of modern chemistry.                Progress     in science       is   at   times
unaccountably         slow.      For fifteen years         had Europe        been
acquainted with           the     fact    that  growing       plants     set free
" oxygen," as we call it                but no further step was taken,
                                     ;
till Ingenhouss showed that this oxygen could only be
developed by plants when in sunlight.                        Neither he, nor
any one else, suspected whence came this oxygen                      ;  that was
a mystery for another ten years,                when Sennebier's work             *
gave to science the simple and pregnant fact, that sunlight
enables the leaf to liberate oxygen from the carbonic acid                       of
the air.     He proved that sun-heat alone would not suffice                       ;
sunlight was the agent at work.                 Living physiologists have
even separated         the particular ray of sunlight which exerts
the intensest effect.           Professor Draper was the first to show
this.    In   his recent work he says : " Since the sunlight is
composed      of many differently coloured rays, and different
principles,    it   becomes an interesting          inquiry which of these

is the immediate agent in ministering                                   to the nutrition of
plants.        In    1843,      by causing plants to effect the decom
position of carbonic acid in the prismatic spectrum,                                   I   found
that the yellow is by far the most effective,                                    the relative
power of            the various         colours being as follows                   :    yellow,
green, orange,           red,     blue,     indigo, violet.                  My experiments
on the production               of hydrochloric                 acid by the direct union
of chlorine and hydrogen under the influence of light, both
solar and artificial,            conclusively                 establish the fact that the
primary condition essential for the chemical action of light
is the absorption of some particular ray.                               If the physical     con

that they transmit              light without absorbing any, no chemi
cal change ensues             in them, and the same in cases of combina
tion.        Thus oxygen and hydrogen cannot be made to unite,
even by the most intense radiation, because neither                                    of them
exerts any absorptive action                    ;   but chlorine and hydrogen unite
with energy, because the chlorine absorbs the indigo ray." *
      Such     has    been the        history of this partial                    withdrawal
of the veil which hides the mysterious connection of light
with life.          And now, reader, as you ramble through the
cornfields, and         see   the shadows running over them, remem

with other eyes, and not to think of it as remote in                   space,
but nearly and momentarily               connected with us and all
living things.        Astronomy      may measure        the mighty dis
tance which       separates    us from that blazing         pivot of life     ;
but Biology       throws    a luminous      arch,    which     spans those
millions upon millions of miles, and brings us and the sun
together.      Far away blazes that great centre of force, from
which issues the mystic influence,
        "Striking the electric chain wherewith we're darkly bound."
For myriads and myriads of years has this radiation of force
gone on    ;  and    now stored-up force lies quiescent              in  coal
fields of      vast    extent,   once   all pure sunlight,          hurrying
through the silent air, passing into primeval forests, before
man was made, and now lying black, quiet, slumbering, but
ready    to awaken into blazing           activity    at the bidding of
human skill.        From light the coal-fields came, to light they
return.      From light come the prairies and meadow-lands,
the heathery moors, the reedy swamps,                the solemn forests,
and the smiling         cornfields, orchards, gardens        ;   all are air-
woven children of light.
    Not less indispensable is light to animals — first, as fur
nishing      them with plants on which              to feed    ;   secondly,
as furnishing       them with oxygen to breathe           ;   and,   thirdly,
as stimulating        in some unexplained          manner the organic
processes.      Light affects the respiration of animals, just as
it affects the respiration        of plants.    This is novel doctrine,
but   it is    demonstrable.       In the daytime we expire more
carbonic acid than during the night            ;  a fact long known to

physiologists, who explain             it   as the effect         of sleep   ;   but the
difference is mainly owing                  to the presence           or absence of
sunlight     ;   for sleep, as sleep, increases, instead of diminish
ing, the amount of carbonic acid expired, and a man sleep
ing will expire more carbonic acid, than if he lies quietly
awake under the same conditions of light and temperature                                        ;
so   that if less is expired during night than during the day,
the reason cannot be sleep, but the absence                        of light.*
     Now, we understand why men are sickly and stunted
who live in narrow               streets,    alleys, and cellars,            compared
with those who, under similar conditions                            of poverty and
dirt, live in the sunlight.            And to give            a solid basis to such
views, we have Moleschott's                   striking experiments, which
prove that under precisely similar                         conditions    of warmth,
age,    size, food, &c., the single variation                  in the condition of
light produces an equivalent and constant variation in the
amount of carbonic acid expired.                           In bright     sunlight         as
much as one-fifth more carbonic acid was expired than in
feeble light,     -f-   And have not all farmers and cattle-breeders
unconsciously           paid    tribute to this principle,               by keeping
their animals in the dark to fatten them                      ?
     Returning from this wide-sweeping excursion to the point
from which we started, namely, the love of darkness mani
fested     by our animals, the question arises, How can the
paradox be reconciled?                One might venture on an hypo
thesis,     were but the facts          a    little less refractory          :    when,

however, we        see one            kind of Anemone flaunting in the light,
and another creeping under a stone                          ;   when we          see   the Crab
impatient of the day, and the Prawn swimming gaily in the
brilliant pool        ;    when we         see    the Mussel fixing himself by
his byssus to the rock exposed to noonday suns, and another
bivalve boring his way into                          that       rock, secure from              the
"                                      ;" when, in short,             we see no constancy
    garish babbling day
or parallelism             in the facts,          explanation becomes                   difficult.
Let us be ignorant    Let us acquiesce in mysteries (when
                                  !
we cannot penetrate them), nor vex with noisy questionings
the imperturbable                     reserve     of Nature           ;   remembering          the
words of the poet, that                         " fools rush in where
                                                                      gentlemen
acquainted with zoology fear to tread."
      For     those who enjoy mysteries and paradoxes                                  there can
be no         lack of such             enjoyment here.                We walk amid sur
prises.        Only ignorance keeps us from perpetual wonder
ment      ;   as we       lift    each   corner of the veil, more and more
marvellous are the vistas which                             reveal        themselves.          My
vivarium is as pretty a little world of wonders as a specu

               "                "
does the         lying-in            with all pomp and circumstance.
Well, our pipe-fish is a Basque in this respect.                               Strange
as  it may sound to hear of a fish incubating like a domestic
hen, it sounds still funnier to hear that the male fish per
forms that office, and he alone.
    How does he manage it                 ?     Remove that gentleman from
under the sheltering stone, and you will observe a sort of
marsupial pouch formed along his ventral surface,                            in which
lie an immense mass of eggs in two layers of four strands,
which completely fill the pouch.                      Each egg, you observe, is
divided into two tolerably equal portions, one half being of
a  brilliant scarlet, the other opaque white                     ; and occasionally
you may observe            the scarlet portion              divided into two.         A
pretty sight, is it not          ?     Remove the eggs, and you will find
that the pouch is a mere fold of the integument, and that
the eggs are as much outside the body as those of a hen are,
in the nest.       So that the male fish does veritably incubate                         ;
and    I hope the     Syngnathus from this day forward                       will  have
an interest for you.*
    Indeed, the fish- world presents us with many anomalies,
which     press   heavily on our generalisations, and make us
relinquish them one by one.                       As   a sample, let us consider
this plausible passage, wherein maternal emotions are con
structed out of animal heat : " Still more remarkable is the
   * In popular zoology a     " mare's     nest
                                                "  is often alluded to ; but seeing that
one species of Syngnathus is      called the "sea-horse," and that he incubates,     the
question may be asked       if  a sea-horse      incubates  his eggs, why should   not a
land -mare contrive a nest    ?   It  is true that mares do not habitually lay eggs,
but that is surely a trifle !

effect   of a mere exaltation of animal heat upon the instincts
and affections of the different races of the Vertebrata.                     The
fishes absolutely unable to assist               in the maturation of their
offspring, are content to cast their spawn into the water, and
remain utterly careless of the progeny to be derived from it.
The reptile, equally incapable of appreciating the pleasures
connected      with maternal care, is content to leave her eggs
exposed to the genial warmth of the sun                  until the included
young escape.         But no sooner does the vital heat of the
parent become sufficient for the purpose designed by Nature,
than all the sympathies of parental fondness become deve
loped." *      This is a very plausible generalisation             ;  but there
are facts      which    peremptorily        contradict it.      On the one
hand, there are cold-blooded vertebrates — fishes, such as the
Hassar, Goramy, Stickleback, Lepidogaster, and Syngnathus
—which        make nests,     or sit on their eggs.            On the other
hand,      there are warm-blooded vertebrates —birds, such as
the cuckoo and American cowbird, which, utterly regardless
of maternal delights, leave their eggs to be hatched by other
 birds.
    The fishes contradict our generalisations on many other
topics    ;  and a very curious passage in Natural History might
be   written by any one who should take the trouble to
collect and group together what may be called fish-paradoxes.
Thus there are fish that fly          ;  fish that climb (Percha scan-
dens)    ; fish that hop, like frogs, using their fins            as   veritable
legs    (Lophius) ; fish that ruminate               (the carp)    ; fish that

incubate      ;  and fish thai brinp forth their young alive.
    Fish that sing have not yet been heard, but that some of
them make an approach to vocal performances by emitting
tones,     was    known to Aristotle, who specifies six different
 kinds   ; and Johannes            von      Miiller  has   recently       collected
the literature         of this subject in an interesting essay,* in
which,     after giving his own observations, he explains the
mechanism by which the sounds are produced.
     To these, recent researches              have added facts even more
amazing to          the systematic mind, namely, that there are
fish which normally               are    double-sexed    ;  and at least         one
species      which     undergoes metamorphoses                 similar to the
metamorphoses of reptiles.f
     But we must not linger over the fish, when so many
 other animals call            for notice.         The Actiniae       distributed
 among these          vases     and pie-dishes       will convey        some    idea

is a tiny   Actinia nivea. Here         are three  of a species new
to me.     They stand an inch and a half in height, with             a
tendency to elongate themselves still further.              They have
but one row of tentacles,          not retractile;   and their white
bodies are encircled      with rows of reddish spots, some small,
others much larger, the latter surrounded with a ring of
white.     The colour of their tentacles is dark green, spotted
with brown.       They most resemble          the Anemone which is
found,   I  believe,   in Weymouth Bay, of which           I have one
exquisite specimen      — translucent white spotted with      red, the
spots crowding towards the base          ;  the tentacles pure white,
with a brilliant apple-green streak running down on either
side,  and passing over the oral disk to the delicate             pink
mouth.      Here is another novelty, in size about one-fourth of
an inch    in diameter,      the body delicate French grey with
white strips, and tentacles of pure white.           And  here is that
lovely Lamp-Polype,         Lucernaria,      with its little knobbed
tentacles contracting and expanding.
   Let us pass with     a mere  glance at those Eolids, old acquaint
ances, and at that solitary Ascidian, passing his existence         in
the somewhat monotonous opening and shutting of his two
orifices (the only visible sign of life he gives), to pause for a
moment over the Echinoderms. There a Goniaster is clinging
to a bit of stone    ; and there two Comatulce (Plate 71., fig. 2)
expand their feathery charms         ; a   single Sea-urchin    crawls
up the side of the dish, and a lovely Brittle-star wriggles at
the bottom.      To look at this brittle-star       you would never
imagine how sensitively alive he is to insult.      Place but a finger

on him, and he breaks up his dishonoured body                into frag
ments before your eyes.          He thinks no more of throwing
away his legs and arms, than a young lord in London thinks
of squandering his acres.       The late Edward Forbes has left a
humorous account of his hopeless endeavours to secure a rare
species    (Luidia fragilissima) in        an entire condition.      To
understand his account,        you must know that most marine
animals     expire immediately      on    being thrown into fresh
water   ;  and you must further be informed that the pigment
spec at the end of each arm, or leg, is the extremely hypo
thetical "eye" of the star-fish.         Forbes was ready with his
bucket, and,
                 " as  I expected," he  says,  "a Luidia came up —
a most gorgeous specimen.          As it   does not generally break
up before    it is raised  above the surface    of the sea,  cautiously
and anxiously      I  sank my bucket to a level with the dredge's
mouth, and proceeded         in the most gentle manner to intro
duce   Luidia    to the purer element.      Whether the cold water
was too much       for him, or the sight of the bucket too terrific,
I know     not, but in a moment he proceeded           to dissolve his
corporation, and at every mesh of the dredge his fragments
were seen escaping.         In  despair   I  grasped at the largest,
and brought up the extremity         of an arm with its terminat
ing eye, the spinous eyelid of which opened and closed with
something exceedingly like a wink of derision."

 beauty   of its frilled   branchiae,  for there is nothing in its gen
 eral demeanour to admire.           It has  no pretty ways to capti
  vate our hearts—a mere drawing-room               beauty, large, lazy,
 lymphatic, and unintellectual.          This other Doris has not even
 brilliant colours to attract notice: a dirty white cloak is
 thrown over its person, which, except the delicate gill-tuft,
 has really  nothing to boast of. But as Falstaff consoled himself
 with the thought that his ragged troop were "mortal men,
 food for powder," and as good for bullets as a troop          of better
men, so    I  estimate this      Doris with   an anatomical   eye, and
find it worth attention.          The Eolids are poorly represented
here—only two E. Papfillosa, and one E. Alba               ; but there
happen to be abundant specimens of the Pleurobranchus
(see   Plate  VII.,   fig. 3), a naked mollusc     of translucent buff
colour, which on the rocks at first            I mistook for  aDoris,
but found on inspection could not be one; and recourse to
Woodward's       Mollusca,       and Gosse's     Hamibook,   at length
satisfied me    of its title and position. This animal wears his
gill drooping from his        side, under the cloak,  with the jaunti
ness   of an ostrich feather drooping from the side of a lady's
hat; and instead of carrying his shell like a breastplate,
or backplate, he wears it beneath his skin, as timorous
tyrants used to wear mail beneath their clothes.          The Pleuro
branchus was a novelty to me, and when the fisherman who
accompanied me, to turn over the stones, first pushed aside
the stone under which         it crawled, I expressed  my enthusiasm

by at once promising him an enlarged fee — a most impolitic
action on my part, and one which completely unsettled my
companion's mind.               From that moment he became a bore.
Every animal             I   condescended       to bag, became the object        of
his loudest laudations, in the dim hope that somehow he might
persuade       me   I    had secured a brilliant specimen, one causing
fresh overflows of generosity on my part.                      " Well, he be a
beauty     !   We arn't        seen one     like him before,   I reckon   ?    He's
worth a sovereign,            I'll bet a guinea ! "      This was the running
accompaniment he kept up, as he handed me an Anemone
or a bit of Sponge.               The Sponges especially alternately ex
cited and damped his hopes.  He was constantly exclaiming
" Oh ! look here, then ! what be this ? " and as constantly
               " Only a
hearing,                Sponge, Pat," which greatly moderated his
ardour.        One moment          I   thought he was going to persuade
me the Sponge was immensely valuable, but he digressed
into safer admiration of the Annelids just captured.                      In   fact,
as   I   said, my outburst had been most impolitic, by rousing
visions of        El    Dorado.     From that moment his conversation
pointed with fatiguing monotony in the one direction                              of
extra     fees.     The next day        I   took another man, and we found
more      specimens          of the Pleurobranchus           than   I   had room
for.     A dozen         were brought home          ;   and as — to judge from
all the works accessible in Scilly — the anatomy of this mol
lusc has not been studied since Meckel described                         it,   these
dozen specimens              will afford me ample means of investigation           :
meanwhile, the account given by Professor Owen of the diges
tive organs   sufficiently curious to be quoted. The animal

 branous, receives the bile by a large orifice placed near its
 connection with the second digestive cavity, which is smaller
 and more muscular     ; to this succeeds a third, the sides of which
are gathered into broad longitudinal             lamellae, precisely simi
 lar to those of a ruminant           ;  and to render the analogy still
 more perfect, a groove is found            running along the walls of
the second cavity from one orifice to the other, apparently
subservient to rumination.              The fourth stomach is thin, and
its walls smooth." *        A   mollusc equipped with the ruminat
ing series of stomachs, is paradoxical enough               ;   but what shall
we say to this ruminating Mollusc when we find him not to
be a vegetable feeder     ?
    One of these     Pleurobranchi          is resting on a whelk-shell
inhabited by our friend the Hermit-crab,                    of whose habits
we learned something at p. 46.                I did not then know that
the fine old naturalist Swammerdamm had argued, and very
ingeniously too, against the belief that this crab inhabited
the shell of another animal, which                 he calls a fable,       and
which on anatomical grounds                he endeavours          to disprove,
 declaring our friend to be a Crab-Snail.f                 Although he was
unquestionably     wrong       in this, he was right enough in
 laughing at Aristotle and jElian for asserting that the crab
lived with the mollusc, and undertook the office of finding
food for both.
    Passing from the region of vases and pie-dishes, let us

more interesting than to watch the beginnings of                                Life, to trace
the gradual evolution             of an animal from a mass of cells, each
stage   in the evolution presenting not only its own character
istics, but those marks of affinity with other animals which
make     the    whole world              kin    ?        To watch the formation of
blood-vessels,       to see the heart first begin its tremulous pulsa
tions, to note how Life            is,   from the first, one incessant struggle
and progress— these keep us with fascinated pertinacity at our
study.
   Among other things,            I       have watched the development                          of
the   Eolis and Doris with great interest                     ;   not the less so from
the fact that,       in spite of the marked differences                         between        the
developed      animals, their course of development                          is   so   indistin-
guishably similar.               On the rocks, or on the side of your
vases, you may see          a     long coil of spawn, looking like delicate
pearl beads enveloped              in    a   perfectly transparent membrane.
The first thing which will surprise you, on commencing the
investigation,       is   that the division of the yolk-mass                           is   unlike
that of most other eggs.                   In       the first place,       it   is     not sym
metrical   ;   in the next place,            it     is   not always the same. Some

times the division occurs in two unequal halves ;* sometimes in
three, or even four, unequal parts.                      I have    even counted five.
The germ-mass               may develop        into one, two, three, or even
six embryos,        f    all of which are seen slowly rotating in the
same envelope          ;    and besides       these, there may generally                 be
seen various masses of granules rotating with them, or driven
about within the envelope              — which        are probably fragments of
the germ-grass insufficient to form a separate embryo.                                This
multiplication        of individuals from one egg, this production of
twins, or triplings, is a constant fact, and may help the
 general question of twin births.                     Very curious it is to watch
 the increasing activity            of the little embryos.               At first their
 rotation is scarcely perceptible                ;   after a while the long cilia
 protruding from the shell are                seen to       wave with more vigour,
 and the animal moves quickly.                      Just       before emerging from
 its crystal envelope, the rapidity of its motion is very great                             ;
 and a wondrous               spectacle    it is to behold many hundreds
 of them whirling and whirling about till they escape into
 the water, where they swim to and fro like crowds of tiny
  Nautili disporting themselves on the ocean.
     * In  the ova of an    Adam, which     spawned      in my vase,  I observed   tho same
  want of symmetry        :  the yolk-mass divided in each case into two unequal
  halves.
     T  I hesitated to record in the text what         I   found in my Tenby note-book ;
  namely, that these embryos      sometimes amount to as many as six in one chorion,
  because as the observation     was made when      I was comparatively new to the sub
  ject, and differed from what is said by others,         I  thought it possible some error
  of interpretation might have occurred.          I have since satisfied    myself that my
  original note was accurate,     and  I have at this moment a coil of         Aplyria  eggs
  in process of development,     in some of which there are six, seven, and even eight
   embryos actively rotating in each chorion.

                          SHELLS OF MOLLUSCS.                           247
     The mention of Nautili reminds me that these young mol
 luscs,   which are without vestige of a shell in their mature
 stage,    are    all provided with a good-sized shell in their
 embryonic        stage.   According     to the principles     of Agassiz
 and others,       which    would    make embryology        the principal
guide in zoological classification, this transitory presence             of
the shell would imply that the naked molluscs were higher
in organisation than molluscs with shells.               This conclusion
will   not,   I  think, be accepted.      But the fact that the embryo
has a shell, of which          it is subsequently destitute, is inter
esting in the speculations it suggests, and will one day,
doubtless, receive its due place in science.             Curious it is to
think of the huge shell of the Whelk or Limpet fading off
into the small shell-plate concealed beneath            the skin   of the
Sea-hare        and the Pleurobranchus,         and disappearing alto
gether from the Doris and Eolis.             Yet perhaps not altogether
disappearing       ;  for may not those spiculae which are so abun
dant in the integument of the            Doris  represent   the shell in a
rudimentary condition         ?   I  say
                                         "
                                           represent," meaning thereby
that the spiculae are the analogous product of secretion, not
                                     "
the homologous " skeleton          ;   for although these spiculae may
stiffen the integument, and in so far fulfil a protective office,
I   find    them in other places — for example, in the mem
brane which lies next the " brain."
    To discover a new animal is surely a legitimate pride.             We
                                                   " varieties "

and    a   pride     ?       But you must be very circumspect, or you will
find, as   I     did, after long examination and some parental pride,
that some "plodding German" has been before you.                                                One
day looking down upon                    a     tuft of red sea-weed (Polysiphonia),
on which were clustered several specimens                            of Lagenella repens
(one    of the Ciliobrachiate Polyzoa,                   so    thoroughly investigated
by    Dr Arthur Farre and Van Beneden),*                        I    observed     a   quantity
of tiny cups in motion. On removing                       a     bit of weed to the             stage
of the microscope,            I     fancied these cups to belong to               a   new As-
cidian     ;    but many examinations gradually dispelled this notion,
and left me completely puzzled.                       I  ransacked my books in the
vain effort of identification, and began                          to   think the animal
before me was                    novelty.        This suspicion grew into                  convic
                                                                                   it, a

several         preparations to show admiring friends.                           The animal
springs from             a   creeping stem, and stands about the tenth of
an inch         in height, or          less.      Each individual      is   connected with
every      other by this creeping stem, and consists                              of       a   vase-
shaped body, or cup, supported on                        a    stalk.    When the animal
is   fully expanded,              it   unrolls the edge of its cup into                a       circle
of twelve or fourteen ciliated tentacles, curled downwards like
the    young fern-leaf, or like the handle of                            a       Greek         vase.
These tentacles are, as                I       said, cut out of the edge          of the cup,

cilia, and at the bottom there is a mass of yellowish granules
(hepatic cells    ?) and occasionally the food may be observed
rotating,   as if  on an axis.
    Some weeks after convincing myself the animal was new,
I  dredged between the coasts of Jersey and Brittany a small
Pecten, on the shell of which, besides other animals, there
was my new friend         in great activity, and of much larger size
than the one got at Scilly.            It was then     I   learned that my
friend had already been described             — that, in    short,   it was the
Pedicellina of Sars, or at any rate differed therefrom only in
such unimportant particulars (such as the retractility of the
tentacles)    as would      at the most constitute a distinction of
species.     I  made this out by studying the development                     of
the  animal       In Owen's Lectures          there is a diagram         of the
embryonic phases of Pedicellina, and some of these were
what     I had already drawn from my own animal.                      One fact,
however, is worth mentioning, because, as far as                  I  can ascer
tain,  it is not known       ;  namely,    that the Pedicellina is vivi
parous,     as well      as   oviparous and gemmiparous.                 While
examining      a cluster      of them,     I saw something protruding
from the mouth       ;   presently another something rose beside it.
I watched     anxiously, with a certain flutter.            I suspected they
were embryos.        Slowly they emerged, and the suspicion grew
stronger and stronger,          till finally  three   ciliated embryos,       in
the stages of development indicated at figs. 7 and 8 in the
diagram,* swam away in the water.                  There could no longer

of a new animal, a new fact with respect to its gener

   This has been narrated as an illustration                                of the caution
necessary before          announcing new genera and species to                                the
world, and needlessly encumbering the already unremember-
able lists of names.                I   was also interested by the puzzlement
into which         I   was thrown as to the classification of my new
animal (when           it was thought to               be new).
   Indeed, the assignment of animals to their proper places
in systematic          classification         will continue           to be the       work of
much unsuccessful ingenuity, until more rigorous and philo
sophical principles of classification be adopted.                               That present
classifications are only provisional, will scarcely be denied.
They have not             the       stable        basis     which     can    make future
researches the simple extension and application                                  of existing
principles.        A     new Method is inevitable                     ;    but we may         be
years before           it is promulgated.                  An instructive example              of
our inability to apply the present Method, otherwise than in
a provisional          way,    is afforded by that puzzle to zoologists,
the Sagitta bipunctata.                      (Plate V., fig.         1.)    Nobody knows
where        to   place it.         In       aspect       it   is   fish-like   ;    in some
structural peculiarities                it   is    fish-like   ;    in others    it   is   mol-
luscan   ;    in more     it   is   annulose.             Siebold classes    it     with mol-
lusca    ;   Huxley and Krohn, with the annulosa,                                the former

    Place    it where we will,         the animal        is very interesting,
either when darting about in            a glass vase,       flapping the water
with its tail, and fixing itself to the side of the glass (using
the vent as a sucker?), or seen on the microscope stage,
where its extraordinary transparency obliges a liberal use of
"
  stops." It is then seen to have a head with a formidable
set   of hooks (which, however, do not seem to fulfil the office
of jaws), and two large eyes.              The narrow body is divided
into two equal lengths (in my specimens this was so ; in the
figures published by Mr Busk and Mr Gosse the anterior
portion is considerably the larger)           ;  in the upper half lies the
straight     alimentary canal, terminating in a ciliated orifice               ;
on either side of the canal lie the ova                ;    in the lower half,
which is longitudinally divided by a septum, the whole cavi
ties are filled with granules of various sizes, moving, by a
scarcely perceptible progress, round and round, like food in
the stomach ; and these granules prove to be the spermatozoa
which issue from the two orifices near the caudal expansion.
It  is about the quarter of an inch in length, and differs in
several points from the species described                  and figured by  Mr
Gosse    in his Tenby and Handbook, and by Mr Busk in the
Microscopical Journai.f                For instance, it        has no anterior

are continuous        with the caudal fin, into which they expand                        ;
that     is to say,     it   has    really but          one    fin on each        side,
with a caudal expansion.                  Another peculiarity worthy of
notice    is,   that, in consequence of this union of the lateral and
caudal fins, the orifices through which issue the spermatozoa,
instead of opening directly in the integument of the body,
are openings        in the fin itself    ;   asI      have convinced myself by
repeated        examination —      a    circumstance which leads us to
suspect    that the      "fin"     is   only   a   membranous expansion of
the integument, and not properly                   a   fin.    Other details, not
mentioned, and therefore,               I    presume,         not present in the
specimens        previously described, but which were constant in
those    found at Scilly, are the double band of light yellow
granules forming three sides of                   a   parallelogram about the
oesophagus, and two dark-brown irregular masses above each
oviduct.        The hairs, or spines, are distributed over the fins
as   well as over the body — an arrangement which has been
noticed by Krohn, who denies that they are                         setce   at all, con
sidering them to be merely epidermic processes.                              On what
grounds he so considers             them,    I     am not informed           ;   butI
entirely concur with him, because                 I   find these supposed         setce
very rapidly undergo decomposition, which would not be the
case were they inorganic hairs or spiculae.                        Let me conclude
these perhaps dry details              with the remark that the delicate
layer of epidermis, composed of rounded cells — the existence
of which Krohn first disputed and then admitted —was visi
ble in my specimens, although            I     mistook         for scales or scaly

confirmation.
    But the point of all others which in this interesting Sagitta
excited my interest was one               I have not seen noticed by
others,     namely, the entire absence         of any vascular      system.
Here is an animal with a nervous system of some importance
(see  Prof. Huxley's diagram in the Microscopical Journal)
with eyes, if no other organs of sense, and with muscular
fibres of the striped kind, yet in spite of such characteristics
of high organisation, it is totally without " blood," without a
trace of a vascular apparatus.             So striking a paradox neces
sarily fixed my thoughts for some time,               till at length light
seemed to break          in obliquely from some investigations pur
sued respecting the relation            of the blood to Respiration.
These investigations           are not yet sufficiently     advanced for
publication, but they point unequivocally to the fact, that in
the animal series there is a definite relation existing between
the development         of the vascular and respiratory       systems, the
specialisation of the one following           the specialisation of the
other.*       Seen by this light, the       Sagitta ceases to be para
doxical    ;   its respiration     is performed      by the whole sur
face, without        the need of any special         organ such as        gill
or lungs, and this absence of a respiratory apparatus carries
away with it the need of a vascular apparatus.                     No Re
spiration,       no Circulation     : the   one   necessity   creates     the
other.
    If the    Sagitta is without a vascular system, it must con

fluid which             is   water, and nothing           more.        Dr Thomas Wil
liams, to whose researches                        on the blood we owe grateful
acknowledgment,                    considers that in the Echinodermata the
blood-proper               first makes       it   appearance      ;   below that point
there          is   no blood, but only chylaqueous fluid                ;   and even for
several             stages higher, this chylaqueous                  fluid continues to
hold its place beside the true blood                        ;    so that    a   worm, for
instance, has two fluids —blood, circulating                             in a system of
closed vessels, and chylaqueous fluid oscillating                           in the general
cavity outside the vessels*
      It       is   indispensable, in philosophic zoology, to discriminate
between blood,               a   fluid of definite constitution             circulating in
a     system of vessels, and the chylaqueous                           fluid, formed of
water and the products of digestion, oscillating in the general
cavity.              But my investigations lead to a still further reduc
tion of this latter fluid                   ;   and instead of saying with               Dr

                      THE BLOOD OF ANEMONES.                                     255
 by facts to say that lower even than this is the earliest state
of the nutritive fluid        : namely, sea-water carrying certain gases
and organic particles, but without definite chyle-corpuscles,
such as     Dr Williams figures —without                even albumen      in solu
tion, at least as a constant element.             This is the case with all the
 Sponges.       They simply suck in sea- water and expel it.                   The
 reader will, however, learn with surprise that this also is the
 case   with the far more highly organised Actinice; a fact which,
when coupled with what was said in the preceding Chapter
respecting the non-digestive powers of these animals, may
lead to many interesting speculations.
     If you   have    ever kept Sea Anemones,               or have even paid
casual attention to them in the vases of your friends, you
must have noticed their remarkable variations in size.                         The
Crassicornis which excited your cupidity by his magnificent
proportions, as the eye first beheld him in the rock-pool, has
collapsed to a fourth of the size before you have chiselled
him off ; and in collapsing he squirted continuous streams
of water from his pores                and tentacle-tips*           That Gem,
which an hour ago was expanded to the height of an inch, is
now a mere button.              The ordinary explanation of this pheno
menon is that the animal swells itself with water, which                           it
                                                   "
violently ejects on being irritated
                                    "                 or " alarmed."       But as
we are just now looking with scientific seriousness                        at our
animals, we      will discard all anthropomorphic interpretations,
such as point to " alarm," because they not only confuse the
question, but lead to awkward issues                ;  among others, that the
   •  Those anatomists   who still deny the existence of openings at the tips of the
tentacles, need only   "irritate"  a Crassicornis to be convinced of the fact.

256                         SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
Anemones have highly susceptible souls, as liable to emo
tions of alarm as a fine lady.                  When they are in undisturbed
quiescence       in pool or tank, the same ejection of the water
takes place, only       with less rapidity.            Their normal condition
is that of constantly sucking in and pouring out sea- water,
for    on this   mainly depends their nutrition.                   Keep one in a
vase,      without feeding      it,   without even suffering visible food
to float     in the water, and        it   will nevertheless   feed and flourish
simply by this absorption of water, which contains gases and
invisible organic particles.
I      had three Daisies in       a    vase      for nine weeks, during which
time they were entirely without food, except                        such       as the
water held in solution.               They were as healthy and active all
the time as any others, and            I        believed they would have con
tinued so to the end of the chapter.                      The experiment             is
worth trying.
  Far as this          is   from the notions current respecting the
nutrition of Anemones,                it   is   easily demonstrable.        In      the
                 Chapter         showed that           the supposed        "
preceding                   I                                                  diges

tion       of the Anemone was confined to the pressing out of
the juices, and the rendering                     soluble, by maceration,            of
organic substance       ;   I   have    now to show that this animal                 is
not only without " blood," in any proper sense of the term,
but also without that simpler form of blood named " chyl-
                   "        Dr Williams and
aqueous fluid          by                             succeeding    writers.
  This will probably startle the reader,                       especially      if   he
happen to have seen the writings of                   Dr Williams, who actu
ally figures the chyle-corpuscles of the Actiniae, and declares

                      THE BLOOD OF ANEMONES.                                      257
that the fluid gives an albuminous reaction.                       But with the
highest respect            for that observer, repeated investigations,
which have subsequently been confirmed by the well-known
zoologist,    Mr R. Q. Couch, compel                 me to declare           that no
such fluid circulates in the Actiniae — an assertion which can
readily be tested.           The water is easily forced out of the ten
tacles, or collected by cutting              open the Actiniae         in a glass.
Evaporate      it,   and you       will find   it   to be sea-water, holding
sometimes     organic particles in solution.               Test    with concen
                                                                  it
trated nitric acid, and instead of becoming turbid, as                   it   would
ifit   contained albumen in solution,                 it   remains unaltered,
except that, when organic particles are present,                   they become
distinct.     Examine the fluid with the microscope,                        and you
will find    animalcules       and various particles, but nothing like
definite corpuscles, such as are visible in the true chylaque
ous fluid.     It    is,   in short, sea-water and nothing more.
     Feeling that in thus opposing the positive statements of
an accomplished zoologist like                 Dr Williams,   I        might very
possibly be under some error of observation, or interpre
tation,I     requested        Mr    R   Q.   Couch to repeat the investi
gation, that   I   might either be corrected or confirmed.                        He
                                                        "
very kindly      undertook the task, and thus wrote                     :   I    took
two specimens              of the spotted       Mesembryanthemum,                and
forced the water from the tentacula,                   and found, under the
microscope      of 300 linear, numerous infusorial                          creatures
rapidly moving about.               On treating this with nitric acid,            I
had   a   slight opalescent         deposit,   or rather     a    diffused milky
cloud of very slight            character.      The next day       I        obtained

 several from our rocks,          and again     forcing the water out,         I
 obtained two        specimens      of a microscopic nudibranchiate
 mollusc, and other creatures of similar character."
    I may observe that the slight milky cloud here spoken                     of
 occurred once, and only once, in my examinations, showing
 it therefore to       arise   from    an  accidental,     not a constant
 element.     "A     third and a fourth experiment," continues
 Mr   Couch,   "  was made on others taken from our rocks in a
 contracted state, and consequently empty.                   I  placed   them
 in sea-water which        I  had repeatedly filtered through sand,
 and afterwards cloth.           In this they remained till to-day,
 when, taking them in an expanded                  state,  I   put them to
 drain in a small glass dish.        In  this  I could discover nothing
 organic,    and    it  gave     no  cloudiness by nitric          acid.     As
these experiments are quite           in accordance with others made
some years since as regards their results,              I regard this fluid
as merely sea- water free from every              admixture of secreted
matter."
    Nothing can be more              explicit,   however startling          the
result.   In   the presence of such evidence, one is amazed to

through the opening at the bottom                 of the great cavity of
the body   :  in this cavity it remains for            a  variable period      ;
it now injects the tentacles.           Corpuscles now arise in the
fluid; it becomes thicker in consistence through increase
of albumen      : it is   no longer pure lifeless sea-water            ;  it is
a corpusculated chylaqueous fluid            : it is  competent      to serve
the ends of nutrition.        Whence do the floating cells proceed            ?

is   it possible that           there can inhere                  in albumen a mysterious
histomorphotic power in virtue of which                                    it transmutes itself
from the liquid into the solid condition                                   ?   This were only

All     these       questions are superfluous, since the fact is imagi
nary      ;   an albuminous               corpusculated fluid does not circulate

     Dr Williams               has, however,              published         drawings          of the
corpuscles discoverable in the fluid, and Schmarda, as                                    I      learn
from Victor Carus,f declares that such corpuscles are con
stant.             Can       these       statements be reconciled with what
results from the experiments of                                   Mr Couch and myself?
They have the advantage                           of being positives against nega
tives, and must, one would think, have some truth in them.
What          is   that truth        ?    This question,          I     confess, haunted me
till an answer                suggested           itself.         One of my Daisies (A.
Bellis) brought forth                    a   round mass of fifteen young, agglo
merated together in                  a     ball   :   they were in different stages of
development, and being perfectly transparent, admitted of
easy microscopic examination.                               In them spherical globules
were distinctly visible, circulating by the action of the cilia
lining the cavity               ;        and   with the globules an occasional

animalcule.       This was the case with all of them                              ;   and    as
the globules seemed most abundant in the youngest speci
mens, the idea occurred to me that                             Dr Williams had only
examined the fluid of young Actinioe, and had concluded
that what was true of them was true of adults.                                   This idea,
however, grew less and less plausible on reflection.                                  That    a
young      animal         should have a circulating                    fluid higher          in
character than the fluid of the adult, seemed unreasonable.
While thus speculating,                 I       observed    a great       irregularity in
the size of the globules                    ;    sometimes       they seemed united
together in considerable masses.                           To pursue the investi
gation closer,        I   opened    the cavity with a needle, and let out
the fluid   :   to my surprise, these floating globules turned out
to be no chyle-corpuscles, but the yellow spherical cells                                    (?)
which fill the tentacles            of the adult Daisy, and make solid
the tentacles of the          A nthea,             as   well as give the brownish
colouring to its body            (see   p. 156). What may be the function
of these yellow spheres,           I            know not   ;   but   it   is   certain they
are not the corpuscles             of   a       circulating fluid (they are station
ary in the adult), although             I         must suppose        Dr Williams        and
Professor Schmarda have mistaken them for such, since no
other definite globules are discoverable                        ;    and these circulate
only in the young.
      Parenthetically       it   may be mentioned, that in Professor
Allmann's recently published                            Monograph         on   the Fresh
water  Polyzoa, the subject of the chylaqueous fluid                                         is
thus noticed " It : by no means homogeneous, and nume

minute portions                of the tissues separated                    by laceration.           If
it   be admitted, as            I   think it must be, that the perigastric
fluid consists mainly of water which has obtained entrance
from without,              it then corresponds to                      a    true aquiferous
system subservient to a respiratory function.                                       But it also,
without doubt, receives certain products of digestion, which
had transuded through the walls of the alimentary canal                                                ;
it thus        connects         itself with the digestive system.                             It    is,
moreover, the only representative of                           a   sanguiferous circu
lation, for in the Polyzoa there                      is    certainly no trace of                   a
heart, nor can anything                  referable to         a   true vascular system
be detected."

we      see   the necessity of           a   cultivated caution in the accept
ance     of statements in matters so complex as those of Biology.
The respect justly due to                 Dr Williams          as an investigator, has
caused his views respecting the

so  with respect to this on the fluid of the Actiniae.                The
 result has been seen.      It throws a new difficulty in the way
of rightly understanding the          processes    of Nutrition; but it
is a step towards a right understanding, because it removes
an explanation which, seemingly true, masked the real pro
cess.   It also gives the final blow to those gratuitous deter
minations of special "organs of secretion" in the Actiniae in
which zoologists have revelled.            If there is no blood, there
can be no secretions from the blood; and all attempts at
fastening a secreting function          on the "convoluted bands"
may a priori be dismissed         : I  say
                                             a priori, because no one
has yet attempted, by chemical tests, to prove the presence
of bile, or urea, or any other product of secretion in these
organs   ; and   as, therefore, the function           is assigned on a
priori  grounds, on those grounds may             it be dismissed.
    On closer inspection this conclusion becomes more impera
tive.   The enormous mass of these convoluted bands, forming
by far the largest organ in the body, forbids the idea of
its function being that of secreting urea.                It is true that
Bergmann and Leuckart suggest this to be their function;
so does   M. Hollard ; and Victor Carus speaks with some deci
sion on the   point*      But   I would ask      these eminent writers
how they reconcile such a supposition with anatomical and
physiological    considerations?        There are no vessels       in the
Actiniae which would convey the products of disintegrated
tissue to these secreting organs.         Ifsuch products are thrown
into the fluid of the general cavity, they will be got rid of as

that fluid passes out of the body, without undergoing a pre
liminary secretion in the cells of these convoluted bands.
Seeing the disposition of these bands, attached to the mem

side, and on the other floating free             in the cavity, we detect
no means         by which the disintegrated products, urea,                    &c.
could reach them.          Moreover, the first step in organology
must be to determine whether the product of the organ                           is
present,    e.   g. ova in ovaries, bile in liver, urea in kidneys, and
so on   ;   and until chemical reagents           have    detected       urea or
bile in these convoluted bands, we may rest on the assurance
that these bands are neither urinary nor biliary organs.                       To
look for such special organs in so simple an organism, seems
to me like seeking for         a   circulating library in an Esquimaux
village.
   The mention of         a   library carries my thoughts, by an easy
transition, to our evening studies.             When the labours of the
day are over, the microscope             is   put up, the work-table            is
quitted, and the delicious calm of candle-light invites us to
quiet intercourse with one of the great spirits of the past, or
one   of their worthy successors in the present.                   It    is   well
thus to refresh the mind              with Literature.         Contact with
Nature, and her inexhaustible wealth,             is   apt to beget an im
patience at man's achievements           ;    and there   is   danger of the
mind becoming so immersed in details, so strained to con
templation of the physical glories of the universe, as to for
get the higher grandeurs of the soul, the nobler beauties of
the moral universe.            From this danger we are saved by the
thrill of   a     fine poem,    the swelling sympathy with           a    noble

thought, which flood the mind anew with a sense of man's
greatness, and the greatness        of his aspirations.         It is not
wise to dwarf Man by comparisons with Nature                ; only when
he grows    presumptuous, may we teach              him modesty by
pointing to her grandeur.        At other times it is well to        keep
before us our high calling and our high estate.               Literature,
in its finest moods, does this.          And when      I   think of the
delight given by every true book to generations after genera
tions, moulding souls and humanising           savage impetuosities,
exalting hopes and prompting noblest deeds,           I vary the poet's
phrase, and exclaim —

After     seven weeks, the rocks         of Scilly appeared      to have
seen enough      of me.     A   residence   so protracted, astonished
and fatigued them.        They knew all my varying          moods,     and
one unvarying, not picturesque costume.              Familiar with the
ring of my hammer, as it chiselled with savage pertinacity
at their granite ribs, they were not less familiar              with the
compass    of my voice, and the extent of my operatic reminis
cences, as, seduced       by their solitudes, to the orchestral in
spiration of their waves      I loosened   all the power of my lungs
in lyrical fervour.      For  seven weeks had our intimacy lasted,
and now there arose the conviction that the time for separa
tion had arrived.         Nothing new could possibly be learnt
about me.       Their curiosity was satisfied,    if not  satiated   ; and
my presence      began to carry a certain monotony with it.

 pier, began to eye me with an air of supercilious weariness           ;
 and   I forbear  to investigate the sentiments of the Scillians,
 lest they should too painfully resemble the indifference of the
 dogs.     Decidedly  it was time to pack up.        In spite, there
 fore,  of the inexhaustible obligingness of my friend Mr        J. G.
 Moyle, the admirable surgeon of whom Scilly is justly proud
 — in    spite of his efforts to make my residence        every way
 agreeable,   I took  the hint    : the Granite Beauties turned a
 cold boulder on me, and      I  resolved to weary them no longer.
 My animals were scattered to the four winds (figuratively, of
course   — one of  the four being the     railway to London, which
transported a coffee-tin of anemones to a tank-loving lady)           ;
my tent was struck, and after hurrying through Penzance,
Falmouth, and Plymouth,           it was  once more pitched    in the
pretty island of Jersey.
    Nothing could.be more charming than the welcome smiled
by the rich meadow-lands and orchards there.          After the bold
picturesque solitudes of Scilly,       it seemed like once more en
tering civilised nature.     Every inch of ground was cultivated.
 Cornfields and orchards resplendent with blossoms,            sloped
down to the very edge of the shore, and, by the prodigality of
soil, defied the withering influence of sea-breezes.      It was not
amazing to me to learn afterwards that the land in the in
terior yields double the crop, per acre, which can be raised
in most parts of England       ; and that, although the rent is £10
an acre, such rent can be paid by potatoes alone.        Elsewhere
it is difficult to get even grass to grow close on the shore, and
trees have always a look       of stunted old-maidenish misery       ;
but here the high tide almost washes the hedge which limits

orchards     that     no right-minded           boy could resist robbing.
Jersey, indeed, is the very paradise of farmers.
    The Americans say that England looks like a large garden.
What England           is to America,         that is Jersey to England.
Even the high-roads have the aspect of drives through a
gentleman's grounds, rather than of noisy thoroughfares                        ;  and
the by-roads and lanes are perfect pictures of embowered
 quiet and green        seclusion.      There are few more delightful
places to ramble in.           Every turn opens on some exquisite
valley or wooded hill, through the cool shades and glinting
lights of which the summer wanderer is tempted to stray, or
 to recline  in the long grass, and languorously listen to the mul
 titudinous music of the birds and insects above and around.
 Observe,    I say   nothing of the        sea,   and the succession of bays
 on the coast     ; for what can be said at all commensurate                     with
 that subject    ?    Even the poets, who not only contrive to say
 the finest things about Nature, but also teach us how to feel
 the finest tremors of delight when brought face to face with
 her,   have   very imperfectly spoken of the sea. Homer is
 lauded for having called it " wine-faced."                            He probably
 meant some ivy-green potation, since " wine-faced" is the epi

 his epithet is only an epithet, and the                  sea   is of all colours,

 respecting the         giggling which uEschylus, in a terribly-
 thumbed passage, attributes to the sea.                      The "innumerable
 laughter of the waves of the sea," one is apt to interpret as

 a giggle        ;    an   expression not only unbefitting               the       sea,   but
unworthy of the occasion.                    Neptune was not mocking                      the
agony of Prometheus with a school-girl's incontinence.                                    He
was too grand and fluent for such weakness.                          In moments
of serenest summer-calm he may be said to smile                      ;   in moments
of more leaping mirth he may be said to laugh                                  ;    but to
imagine          him       distorting     his countenance by             innumerable
giggles, would be at all times intolerable, and at such a time
perfectly indefensible.
   On the            sea, therefore,    allow me to be silent.       On the great
attractions of Jersey for the naturalist, one word                       will      suffice     :
there is no such spot in England                    for marine zoology.                   Be

Memory consecrated                 the ground.         Eight-and-twenty               years
ago     I    was at school here.              Changed as the aspect of St
Heliers necessarily              is,   the few spots still recognisable had                  a
peculiar fascination for ma                   The Royal Square seemed to
have shrunk to             a   third of its old dimensions, but with what
strange sensations           I   first re-entered    it!   The Theatre had by
no means the magical and imposing aspect which                       it   then wore,
when        it   seemed the centre         of perfect bliss. Its yellow play
bills no longer thrilled me, although memory wandered back
to those happy nights when enchanting comedy and tearful
tragedy were ushered in by the overtures to "Trancredi," or
" Semiramide "
                  (the only two which the orchestra ever
played), and when ponderous light comedians in cashmere

vinous gaiety and good feeling of Charles Surface          ;   nor think
 Holla the most impassioned and eloquent of beings.              I know
that the sentiments are as unreal as the acting, or the stage

 Turning with a retrospective sigh into the Market-Place,               I
feel the breath of former years rising around me.               There is

    Among the changes, it was pleasant to find that no longer
 did the Pillory disgrace the Royal Square          ; no longer were
 criminals publicly whipped through the streets, as          I  once saw
 them with shuddering disgust.          Formerly women were thus
 publicly whipped    ; but that disgraceful exhibition was put a
 stop to before my time     ;  and now Jersey has grown human
 ised enough to    see that whipping men must be relinquished.

                                              — this was the picture
 Justice frequently presented to the inhabitants of Jersey, and
 which now, thank God,         will never  be seen by them again,
 but   will take its   place among the brutalities        of the past, a
 sign of the onward progress we have made.

    Although St Heliers, the capital of Jersey," was the spot
 consecrated    by memory,     I took  up my abode at the entrance
 of the fishing-village      of Gorey, just four miles from St
 Heliers   ; and  as these pages are    addressed to amateur natu
 ralists, some of whom may hereafter visit Jersey, a word
 on the reason of my choice may not be superfluous.                  The
 attractions of the capital      I do not deny, and    if  the visitor is
 in need of watering-place attractions, he will pitch his tent
 there   ; but if his primary desires be zoology and quiet, he
 will   select  Gorey, especially during summer, when               tide
 hunting is necessarily poor, and only by dredging and trawl
 ing can he hope to get a good stock of animals.              Always go
 where there are fishermen, that you may have the benefit of
 their aid.    They may bring you what you would never find.
 It  is true there are two sources of difficulty in your way             :
 the first is the almost impossibility of making them under
 stand that you can set any value on things            they are accus

tutored them that           they know what you want, they are
strangely backward in their supplies.                  Money is of course
the only cogent argument             ;  yet even      money moves them
but slowly.       They go out day after day,                staying out all
night, and return often without           a  shilling's worth of fish    ; yet
although you offer to pay them for oyster-shells and weeds as
for fish, they cannot easily be induced to throw this " refuse"
of their nets into      a bucket, instead of throwing           it overboard
again.     They promise to do       so,  but you generally wait in vain.
At Tenby, in spite of urgent entreaties and liberal promises,
only one Loligo was brought me            ; at Scilly, nothing     ; at Gorey,
 in spite of my being on the best terms with fishermen whom
I had     employed,    and with whom           I  had gone trawling, five
weeks     passed before a bucket          of refuse was brought me.*
Two words — pertinacity           and liberality — sum up the whole
art of gaining         this    desirable result     ;  when      gained,   you
will   need no argument to prove the superiority of a fishing-
village.
    Comfortably settled at Gorey, and my working-room                       set
in order,    I had only to await the spring-tide,              once more     to
gather a variety of pets around me.                   Not that     I was even
then without serious occupation.               Before leaving Scilly     I had
put up my Nudibranchs              in spirits of wine, and these were
now carefully to be dissected.                Make no wry face at the

over it.   If  prejudices could be satisfactorily displaced by
argument, one might ask how a man can pass a butcher's
shop  with equanimity, yet shudder at the idea of dissecting
a rabbit or a dog    ;  but  I  will admit all      such incongruities as
facts  not assailable      by argument, and simply               direct    the
reader's attention to the important            differences    between dis
secting animals of the larger kind, and dissecting our marine
pets — it is as great as the difference                between knitting       a
silken purse in a drawing-room, and making a ship's cable in
a rope-walk.       Almost all our dissections are performed
under water, with needles, tweezers,                and delicate scissors.
There is no visible blood to suggest unpleasant ideas                  ; there
is nothing unsightly— to the philosophic eye the sight is full
of interest — and    if   an unsightly aspect be present,             has not

 Comparative Anatomy reveal its marvels to the delighted eye
 of a poet, but also that the keen glance of the poet may be
 that of a great discoverer in anatomy         ?   To Goethe, bones
 and ligaments were not less beautiful and           full of interest
 than flowers and streams,        because  he saw   in them parts of
 the mystic scaffolding of the temple of life.        And laborious
 and delicate as the amateur may find the dissection of ani
 mals to be, he     will find his labour well rewarded at    the close.
    When the spring-tide did arrive it was unfortunately                a
 very poor one      ; and had Jersey been less wealthy, my hot
 labours on the rocks would have produced but a meagre               re
 sult.    As it was,  I managed to secure an ample supply ot Sea
 Hares, Eolids, Dorids, Solitary Ascidians, Clavellinos, Hy-
 dractinice, Pycnogonidce, Actceons, Anemones, and Polypes.
 In  the way     of novelty there was only the Hydractinia             (a
 pretty little white     polype growing in clusters on the out
 side   of a whelk shell, inside of which was a hermit-crab) and
 the Actinia parasitica, hitherto only known to me through
 pictures, but which      I found transcending in beauty all power
 of painting.      This beautiful Anemone is extremely abundant
 here at low tide, but scarcely merits its name       of Parasitica,
for   I  find it almost  as frequently on stones and on the sides of
the rocks as on the whelk shells      ; and in captivity  it quits its
 shell, roaming about the pie-dish, and fixing itself to the side,
or to seaweeds, like any other Anemone.           The extreme sensi
 tiveness of the Parasitica enhances its attractions        ;  it is for
 ever expanding and retracting its tentacles, elongating, curv
ing, or retracting its stem     : sometimes doubling its length, at

other times assuming an hour-glass constriction in the middle.
The     filaments which           contain     the "thread-capsules"                are
poured forth in great abundance whenever the animal is dis
turbed.     While on the subject of Jersey Anemones, it may
be added that, besides the ordinary               species,     I  dredged what
is probably a variety of the             Actinia ornata, described                and
beautifully figured by         Dr Strethill Wright in the Edinburgh
Philosophical Journal for July 1856, — the body white, the
exterior circle of tentacles orange,               the two interior circles
white striped with grey, the disc orange in the centre                       ;   very
charming to behold.
    Having stocked my jars and dishes,                       I  was somewhat
reluctant    to broil in a noonday sun amid the rocks, with
little hope of finding any animal not already familiar ; and
therefore contented myself with the less exciting and more
remunerative labour of deep-water hunting.                        By this      I  got
initiated into the art and mystery of trawling, having made
friends with a fisherman,               master     of a Trawler of about
twenty tons.
    Pleasant    it is on     a   bright sunny morning, with a nice
breeze from the shore, to recline on the deck                   of  a  fast-sailing
vessel, and listen to the men retailing                 their experiences, or
watch them heave out and haul in the net.                        Away we glide
towards the coast          of France, Jersey melting                  in the dis
tance, —
               " The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,
                 And all is stillness, save the seabird' s cry
                 And dolphin's leap."
The net is at the bottom, collecting in its gaping mouth the
treasures we are duly awaiting; meanwhile,                         in a sort of

                              TRAWLING.                             277
dreamy content, we stretch ourselves in the sun          till the word
is given to haul in, and then anxiety dissipates the luxurious
calm.      The trawl is a huge net of somewhat conical shape,
from twenty to thirty feet wide, from thirty to forty deep.
Along the edge of the wide opening is a stout wooden beam,
to the ends of which are fastened          the trawl heads, namely,
thick flat semicircular bands of iron, which serve to keep at
a distance of three feet from the beam that portion              of the
net meant to touch the bottom.         In   the net there are various
pockets.      When the trawl is thrown overboard, the weight
of the iron carries it to the bottom, the buoyancy of the
wooden beam, assisted        by the perpendicular support of the
iron bands,      keeping the upper edge of the           net steadily
floating three feet above the ground.            The rope sweeping
along the bottom disturbs the fish       ;  up they dart in foolish
distracted haste,      and come in contact with the net over
arching them      ; this flurries them, and they dart sideways to
escape   ;  in doing which they unsuspectingly swim into the
net  if they   go one way, into the pockets      if they go the other.
The net, thus scraping the bottom, gathers,              of course, a
quantity of shells and weeds as well as fish ; this is known
to naturalists as " trawl refuse," and is always worth careful
overhauling.
   The contents are all emptied upon the deck,              and while
Jack is gloating over the turbot, brill,       soles, skate, and gur
nard, or grimly noticing the utter absence of those desirable
individuals,    you squat down amid the refuse, and begin a
long deliberate investigation thereof.         The net is once more

the rippling music, and you are absorbed in eager inspection
of shell and weed.           It       is probable that this stooping and
peering, accompanied         by the motion of the vessel,                   will bring
on the nausea and headache,                if not   worse, which hitherto            you
have escaped.       I will   not pretend that this is pleasant                   ;   but
there is no help for it.               None but the brave deserve the
mollusc    !   The pain is transient, the delight persists.                          You
may return home at the close of the day probably uncomfort
able, and certainly hideous            ;   but behind you, Jack is bringing
a bucketful    of treasures       ;   and to-morrow you will only know
that you have these treasures.
    The first thing     you have to do on                          the morrow is to
"identify" the animals —a long and interesting,                                though
sometimes      perplexing         process,        owing           to the exasperating
system adopted        by naturalists              of frequently selecting,            as
marks, characteristics by no means obvious.                             For example,
when you read the sentence                 "shell flexible," among the curt
indications by which an animal is to be identified, how are
you to suspect that the animal in question has no shell visi
ble at all, until you have dissected                        it,   and found the thin
calcareous     plate underneath the back,covering the liver?
That one sentence " shell flexible" prevented my identifying
a   Pleurobranchus for at least an hour.
    Nor have   I   to this day been able to identify the species of
a  compound Ascidian (which     only know to be an Ascidian
                                           I

alternately protruded and retracted, but does not open and
shut like that of an Ascidian                     ;     and, moreover, the orifice is
single.         The heart, or pulsating                 sac,   lies at the bottom of the
visceral cavity.                Imbedded in the clear gelatinous base are
several branching vessels giving off pear-shaped                                     processes.
These vessels'connect               the visceral cavities of the whole colony,
and the globules of food are seen oscillating                            to and from the
cavities into the pear-shaped processes.                                I was      completely
puzzled what to consider this animal, until                              I   saw a tadpole
embryo escape from                it,   and swim away, followed by several
others    ;     and then        I   knew an Ascidian                of some kind was
before me.
     A tadpole        ?    Well, that      is a   figure of speech.              The embryo
of the Ascidian             is   more like       a      tadpole than anything                   else   ;
and totally unlike its parent, not only in possessing                                       a   good
long tail, but in being able to swim vigorously through the
water in which the parent                   is   immovable.             In   the interior of
the round body which surmounts this tail,                           a   mass of yellowish
granules (the vitellus)               is   observed,           which extends some way
down the axis of the tail.                      The transparent membrane sur
rounding             the granular       mass enlarges.              The mass develops
three processes, which act as suckers, wherewith                                   the animal
finally fixes itself for life.                The tail then becomes absorbed,
as     in the tadpole.*                 The viscera appear              ;    the envelope
     * Some writers describe        this disappearance of the tail as        a   fission,   the tail
dropping      off.   I    have not observed     this.     The enveloping membrane,               as   it

increases, and finally becomes the general basis out                        of which,
or in which, an immense number of Ascidians are developed
by the process of "budding                  ;"   so that from this one tadpole
embryo there arises a whole colony of animals, from which
in turn solitary tadpoles will issue, each of which will produce
its colony.         Imagine a tadpole to be transformed                          into a
mature frog, this frog             to swell his skin to an indefinite
extent,     and under that skin to produce,                     by budding, some
hundreds of frogs, all living harmoniously together, each fed
by all — further imagine this colony producing at last a few
solitary tadpoles, and you              will     have some conception            of the
paradox presented by our compound Ascidians.
   Nor is this paradox without parallels.                         The other day       I
noticed the surface          of the water in my pan agitated, as                     if
scores      of hairs were at various                   points     thrust    upwards.
Nothing else was visible with eye or lens.                        Suspecting, from
a certain pulsating motion, that                    it was       caused by     young
Medusae,      I   dipped the zoophyte trough, and brought up a
quantity of newly-hatched Medusae in great activity.                              They
had just issued from the Polype                      (Laomedea        geniculata),
and on removing some of the Polype branches to the micro
scope, the young Medusae                    were plainly visible in the cap
sules, and were easily pressed                   out, whereupon            they swam
away like the others.             (Plate      IV., fig.   1.,   represents   a   Cam-
panularian Polype with the young Medusae in the capsule.)
Familiar as this sight was to me,                 it   had not lost its marvel-
lousness.         Here was    a   Polype, which the uninstructed eye
enlarged,   included the tail within   it
                                        ;    and the absorption took place within the
sic thus formed.

             POLYPES      PRODUCING           JELLY-FISH.            281
could not distinguish       from a seaweed, producing scores of
Jelly-fish ;  and these Jelly-fish,      if  their days were spared,
would in due time produce Polypes.                 Imagine a   lily pro
ducing a butterfly,    and the butterfly          in turn producing a
lily, and you would scarcely invent a marvel greater than
this production of Medusae was to its first discoverers.            Nay,
the marvel must go further           still ;  the   lily must first pro
duce a whole bed     of lilies like its own fair self, before giving
birth to the butterfly    ;  and this butterfly must separate it
self into a crowd     of butterflies before giving birth to the
lily : when you have thus added marvel upon marvel, you
will be ready to listen without scepticism to the phenomenon
known as the " alternation of generations," since Steenstrup
so baptised it.    Others have given it other names             :  Owen
calls   it "Parthenogenesis;" Van Beneden, "Digenesis;"
 Victor Carus, "Neomelie ;" and Quatrefages, " Geneagenesis."
But while differing about the name, and the explanation of
the phenomena,     there is no difference         as to the phenomena
themselves.     I will ask the      reader's    attention to a succinct
exposition of the various facts and theories connected with
this interesting    subject    ; premising      that    I have not only
verified the capital observations on which the marvel rests,
but have some new facts            to bring forward         which   must
materially modify the current conceptions.
    Harvey's celebrated      aphorism, Omne vivum ex ovo (every
living being issues from an egg), was a premature gener
alisation, and has for some years past been known to be               so.
Many animals issue not from an egg, but directly from the
substance of the parent's body, by a process analogous to
                                 2 A

282                       SEA-SIDE     STUDIES.
that of the budding of plants.           To include this process and
the ordinary process        under one expression, Auguste        Comte
suggested the     following modification of the aphorism, Otnne
vivum     ex   vivo   (every living being       issues  from a    living
being)  ;  and as the idea of spontaneous          generation becomes
every year less and less tenable, this aphorism acquires the
force of   a law.     I  allude to it at starting, because, inasmuch
as the course       of our inquiry will conduct us to the con
clusion that Generation         is not essentially a distinct process
from that of Growth in general, the idea of an ovum as the
necessary origin       of every living thing needs to be modified.
The first illustration we owe to Trembley, whose Memoirs
on the    Hydra, or Fresh-water Polype,            are so admirable   in
accuracy     and extent of observation, that, in spite of the
labours of a century, nothing of what he stated has been set
aside, and very     little added, except what the microscope has
revealed.     He taught us that the Polype, which originally
comes from an egg, produces           a quantity     of other Polypes,
exactly similar to itself, by a process           of "budding," after
the manner      of a plant.      He taught us, moreover, that not
only is this the normal mode of multiplication,             but that   if
we lacerate the Polype, each lacerated         fragment    will become
a new Polype,       which in its turn may be cut into several
pieces, every one       of them developing into perfect Polypes.
Several naturalists have repeated         and confirmed his experi
ments.     In  repeating them myself        I failed at first, but sub
sequently succeeded,         and attribute   the first failure   to the
presence    of impurities      in the water containing        the frag
ments.     Mr    R   Q. Couch      made    the curious     observation,

that       if   the body of the Hydra " be merely irritated with a
needle, or a ray                   of the sun, a young one will sprout from
the injured parts."*                     Here Harvey's           dictum receives direct
contradiction              :       the Polype which is produced from a wound
in the body of the parent, being in every respect similar to
the Polype which is produced from an egg.
      It   was in         1    744 that Trembley made known to the world
the astonishing reproductive powers of the Hydra.-                                          f           The
following year                 j    Bonnet published his not less astonishing
revelations on the reproduction                            of Aphides, or plant-lice.
The        Aphis,              a    winged    insect familiar          to      most readers,
deposits its eggs in the axils of the leaves of plants at the
close      of summer, and these eggs are hatched in the follow
ing spring        ;    but the insect which issues from the egg is                                        a
wingless sexless insect.                      It   was known that this wingless
insect brought forth its young alive.                                Bonnet proved that
this took place when no male insect was present— in fact, he
proved that the insect was a virgin mother, and astoundingly
fertile.        He isolated the young Aphis as soon as it was
hatched,         reared            it in strict    seclusion,     and watched               it daily,
almost hourly, with the patient tenacity of a naturalist of
genius.          He has left on record his anxieties, his tremulous
agitation         lest its death              should supervene               to frustrate his

 change         its skin, and reach                  its    normal       development,            to
 observe         that this         absolute virginity            did not in the least
 interfere with fertility.                      On the eleventh day the Aphis
 produced          a    young         one       alive   ;   another         succeeded,         and
 another.           Every four-and-twenty                    hours       the       brood       was
 increased        by three, four, and even ten arrivals.                            At   the end
  of twenty-one days, ninety-five                         young ones were produced
  from this single Aphis.*                      Carrying further his observations,

  often goes on             till the      eleventh        generation      :   then this pro
  cess ceases,         the last generation is of perfect insects, with
  separate        sexes, and these               produce       ova which             next     year
  become the productive virgins we have                          just been reading of.

Ascidians and Polypes formerly mentioned, an alternation of
generations takes place   ;   the parent producing a child unlike
itself, and that child in its turn finally producing one like its
                  " The
 grand-parent.           winged and perfect Aphis produces a
wingless hexapod larva     ;  this wingless larva produces at last
a  winged and perfect insect."       The reader may imagine how
great was the sensation produced in the scientific world by
these    announcements, and how many theories were pro
pounded in explanation     ;  we must not pause here to consider
them, but proceed    with our history.
    The last date was 1745.       In 1819   a Germanised     French
man,    known to all lovers of romance as the author of Peter
Schlemil,    made a discovery      in Natural History which was
almost as incredible as his Shadowless Man.        Whether this will
endear the name    of Chamisso still more to his admirers may
be a question.    Literary men will point with some satisfac
tion to the fact that a novelist was the discoverer of a form
of reproduction unsuspected by the profoundest zoologists.
They may also remember that the luminous                 doctrine   of
plant-morphology     was the discovery      of the greatest of our
modern poets    ; and that the great Haller himself was a poet
and litterateur before, in latter life, he devoted himself with
such splendid success to physiology.
    In  Chamisso's day, naturalists knew two distinct         species
 of the curious mollusc named Salpa, an indescribable animal,
 transparent as crystal, and of irregular        cylindrical  aspect.
This animal is also seen somewhat different in structure, but
most obviously differing from the solitary species in being a
long chain of animals.       In spite of their differences,  they are

not two species, but two generations of the same species.
The solitary Salpa produces the chain-salpa by " budding ;"
and the chain-salpa by "alternation of generations"                            (the
phrase     is Chamisso's) produces the solitary                    salpa by    ova.
Krohn, Huxley, Leuckart, and Vogt (alas                      ! only one English
man among four Germans), have since confirmed Chamisso's
discovery, which, as          Mr Huxley         has pointed out, gives him
the priority over Steenstrup, not only as to the mere phrase
of " alternate generations," but as to the distinct conception
of the idea implied in the phrase.                  Nine years afterwards, in
1828,    Milne Edwards first announced a similar mode of repro
duction among the Ascidians (such as                   I sketched it just    now),
without, however, connecting it with Chamisso's discovery.
In   1835, the Norwegian pastor and indefatigable                      naturalist,
Sars, opened         that wonderful        series    of revelations which by
himself, Loven, Lister, Dalyell, Steenstrup, Van Beneden,
Allman, Forbes, and others, have established the alternation
of generations in Polypes and Medusae.
    A   not less surprising         alternation has been discovered in
the Entozoa       ;   but  it would occupy          too much space to narrate
here, requiring much preliminary                 explanation before       it could
be   intelligible to the general          rea,der.   *     Let us continue our
history.
    In   1842,    the known facts were collected,                 and connected
under one generalisation by the Danish botanist Steenstrup,
  *   The student will find a complete history of these phenomena       in Sikrold,
Veber die Band-und- Blasenwurmer,        1854, or in the larger work of Kuchbn-

who brought          his own quota of important             facts.   In   this
work, * a flash of light suddenly revealed the connection in
which many isolated             paradoxes    stood to each         other  :   a
theory was proposed, which, although really nothing but                       a
metaphorical expression of the already known facts, was very
widely accepted as a perfect solution of the difficulty.
     In  1849,    Professor Owen published his two lectures on
Parthenogenesis, in which, re-stating the results of his inves
tigations     into the reproduction        of Aphides      (1843), he pro
pounded a theory as a substitute for the metaphor of Steen-
strup, and one which up to this time is the sole theory not open
to the charge of being a merely verbal explanation.                   In    the
same year,       Victor Carus published a small work           f containing
some new observations, and an ingenious classification.
     In 1851 Leuckart published an essay            J to prove that alter
nate generation was simply metamorphosis plus asexual gen
eration — an unhappy explanation, since the peculiarity of me
tamorphosis is that the larva becomes a perfect insect, whereas
the Polype never becomes a Medusa,              it only produces it     ;   the
wingless Aphis never becomes a perfect insect ; moreover, the
                                           "
phrase "plus asexual generation              conceals the real difficulty.
     In  1853,    Van Beneden, to whom we owe so many impor
tant contributions, published a work             § in which he modestly
contents himself with stating the phenomena,                   classing ani-

netic,  i.  e. reproducing themselves             by sexual and asexual
methods.
    In  1855    M. Quatrefages published four articles in the
Revue des Deux Mondes               entitled Lea Metamorphoses, in
which he reviewed the state of the question, criticised the
theories,   and propounded one of his own.
    In 1856    another brilliant flash of light came from Ger
many.      Von Siebold published a work * containing                     some
startling facts, and such       as, in my opinion, will serve to dis
sipate   all the clouds from the question.                   He   offered    no
theory himself; and in the only                   remark     which directly
touches    our subject, he desires           to lay      "particular stress
upon the distinction between           the alternation of generations
and Parthenogenesis."           In   spite of this,      I  must think that
the two are one, and that his facts convincingly                prove them
to be so.      For the present, however, we will confine our
selves to the points established           in his work bearing on our
subject.
    Having isolated female           moths, he constantly             watched
them in little vessels closed with glass lids.                  In   due time
they laid eggs.       There was nothing surprising              in this   ; the
virgin moth, as well as the female of every other insect —
indeed, of every other animal — lays eggs              ;   but what was his
astonishment, " when all the eggs of these females, of whose
 virgin state    I was most positively convinced, gave                birth to
young caterpillars, which           looked about with the greatest

                                       "
avidity in search of materials       !    Imagine a brood of chickens
hatched from the eggs of a         virgin hen, and you will conceive
Siebold's surprise.       He subsequently found that bees, in like
manner, produce hundreds of eggs, which, however, invari
ably become male bees        ;  for it is only the fertilised bee-egg
which  will develop into       a female   — either worker, or queen.
   Ungallant physiologists, resting on the evidence of some
embryological      phenomena,      have declared     the female    to be
only a male      in arrested      development   ; a very impertinent
deduction, which was, however, flung back on them by a
witty friend of mine, who, hearing that one of her own sex
was fond of reading metaphysics,           and was feared to be suffer
ing from a softened brain, drew her own conclusion as to
this masculine course of study, exclaiming,               "Man is     but
woman with a softened            brain!"       She would have        also
retorted Von Siebold's facts about the bees, which point at
a miserable    inferiority on the part of the males.          But I must
not let her prematurely enjoy this triumph            : if the imperfect
bee is always a male, the imperfect moth (Psyche) is always
a female   ;  and to reconcile both parties, we have the silk
worm moth, whose virgin progeny is both male and female.
   In conclusion, be     it noted    that Von Siebold's work estab
lishes Parthenogenesis         as  a   normal process       in bees and
moths, on grounds which, Funke justly says, do not permit
the severest    scepticism to raise a doubt worthy of notice.           *
He, moreover,      points to the fact that among the Entomo-
straca there are species of which only the female is known               ;

again, thousands      of females of the gall-fly have been examined,
but not a single male has yet been found.
    Thus Parthenogenesis has been found to exist in Polypes,
Molluscs, Annelids           (by M. Quatrefages in the Syllis), and
Insects.     It  has also been found            in plants.   The Ccelebogyne
Ilicifolia,    one    of the Euphorbiacice              to be seen    in Kew
Gardens, is a striking example.                     Only the female of this
plant has reached England, yet                it continues yearly to produce
descendants, although no male has arrived.*

 was first observed       in a Euphorbiaceous plant in the gardens

292                          SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
     To this list may be added the A Igce, in which Pringsheim
has observed the same phenomenon*
      Such were the facts known at the time when                                         I   resumed
my investigation            of Polype-parthenogenesis.                           The labours
of distinguished naturalists on the genesis of Polypes may be
summed up in the following schema                       :
     A     The Medusa parent produces ova                    ;
     B. These ova are developed into infusoria                           ;
     C. These infusoria are developed into Polypes                                   ;
     D. These        Polypes       produce,        by   budding,             the             Medusae,
which in turn produce ova.
     Thus D completes the cycle commenced at A.                                          As varia
tions from this route we have
     a.    The Medusa produces Medusae by budding                                ;
     /3.   The Polype produces Polypes by budding                            ;
     y. The Polype          produces Polypes                by    ova        directly,             i.   e.
without going through the Medusoid generation.
     Attention     is    called to this second table, because the facts
therein registered have been too often lost sight of in the
discussion of the theory.              When, for example, so much stress
is   laid on the analogy between the development of                                      a    Polype
into a Medusa, with that of               a   bud into       a    flower,            it      is   appa
rently      forgotten that, in spite of the resemblances,                                         great
differences      are     discoverable.            No flower produces                          similar
flowers by       a   process       of budding, as the Medusa buds off
young Medusae             from its substance            :   a    rose does not split
up into     a   dozen roses.

     So little have the facts             registered     in the second table been
kept in view, that the doctrine of Alternate Generations has
been persistently denied on the ground that the Polypes are
not generations at all — are not, properly speaking,                              " indivi
duals" any more than leaf-buds are individuals.                                 According
to this argument, which has been set forth by                           Dr Carpenter*
only those can be truly called generations which issue from
a generative act, i.e. the union                  of a germ-cell with a sperm-
cell   ;    an arbitrary assumption disproved by a multitude                               of
facts.        He maintains the analogy of the Polype and the leaf-
bud to be complete,                    and considers the multiplication                    of
Polypes, and of Medusae from Polypes, to be always a process
of budding           ;    this gives his argument a superficial plausibility,
which         is,    however,       totally    destroyed     by the fact that the
Polype also produces Polypes by the union of ova and sper
matozoa.
 I         shall have to recur to this point hereafter                  ;     meanwhile   I
may add that, in the course of                   a     long investigation           into the
development of the Campanularian and Plumularian Polypes
— especially P. myriophyllum (Plate IV.,                          fig. 2), from deep
water off Jersey —              I    found that not only does the                    Polype
produce Polypes by means of ova, but also produces Medusce
in     the same            way;      so that instead         of the production of
Medusae         being only one of simple budding,                     it    resembles the
production               of Polypes      in being sometimes                 a   process    of
budding,            and sometimes          a   process     of oviparity.         I     have
followed            this development through all its stages                     ;    and as

what   I  have seen    may be seen by any one who chooses                to
devote the requisite patience,      I   shall merely clear away cer
tain theoretical obstructions which may screen the real facts.
    In Dr Carpenter's summary of           the views held by natural
ists, we read that the ovarian capsules               (the large vesicles
which rise from the stem of the polypidom) are improperly
                                  "
designated ovarian, because         they have been shown by Pro
fessor  E. Forbes to be in reality metamorphosed                 branches."
The force of this objection escapes me.          Wolff and Goethe have
shown the stamens and pistils to be metamorphosed leaves,
but no one denies them, on that account, to be reproductive
organs.     The capsule in question is not a branch, but a cap
sule, and the proof     of its being an ovarian capsule is the fact
that in it ova are developed.            This, indeed,       Dr Carpenter
denies, for he continues,* " These Medusa buds spring not
from ova, but from a detached portion of the medullary sub
stance  ;" and in   a note he adds,   "Although they are described
by Van Beneden as developed from ova, yet                 it is clear from
his own account that such is not the           case ;   and that what he
called the vitellus is continuous with the medullary substance
of the stem and branches          of the zoophyte."             Not having
seen  Van Beneden's       M4moire,     I  am unable to say whether
that admirable naturalist has imperfectly described what he
has seen, or   Dr Carpenter imperfectly         comprehended       what he
has read   ;  but  I  have no hesitation      in asserting that direct
study of the phenomena will disclose the fact of the Medusa
being,   at any rate, sometimes      developed from ova, although

                     " continuous with the
 the vitellus is                                medullary substance of
 the stem."         The ova are there, unmistakable by any eye
 familiar with the ova of zoophytes           ;  and by cutting off the
 tips of the capsules we can gently press these ova out, reveal
 ing the germinal vesicle in each, and the vitelline mass sur
 rounding it.       Not only are ova there, but in some instances
spermatozoa may be observed in great activity, and this at a
 time when the circulation,           or more properly oscillation,      of
medullary granules from the stem into the interior of the
capsule is perfectly visible.          Sometimes,    instead of these, we
find simply a mass of granules and nucleated cells             ; at other
times, ova in various stages of segmentation, the germinal
vesicle having disappeared,          and a vitelline membrane being
formed    ;   at others, we find embryos nearly ready to         escape.
    The facts which        I  have    observed   are so opposed to the
current theories on this subject, that           I have no expectation
of their gaining acceptance, until they have been confirmed
 by others.       But    I am    content to await that confirmation,
assured that       it must   come sooner     or later.    Scepticism, be
it never    so authoritative, cannot alter the facts       ; and as  I  am
quite sure of what        I  have seen, and seen many times,        I   am
sure  it will    be seen by others.        Unfortunately the Myrio-
phyllum is only to be had in deep water, and appears not to
be common, although           it is abundant off Jersey    ; and there is
also a possibility that the phenomenon may not be observable
in this species, dredged from other coasts.             I say possibility,
because     I  am informed by Professor         Kolliker that the same
species of Polype       (Eudendrium) found off our coasts and the
coast of Naples, differs in this remarkable character : the one

produces      eggs, and not Medusae         ;  the other Medusae, and not
eggs.     The same great anatomist assured me that he also had
seen something        like what        I  have    seen j  he had seen the
same species       of Campanularia producing both eggs and
               " but no one
Medusae,                         believed me," he added.          The plea
for scepticism being,          that Professor        Kolliker   must   have
mistaken       two different        species    for the same species     —a
hazardous assertion, considering who is the observer.                   But
this objection cannot apply to my observation, for                   it was
on the same        Polypidom that         I   found some of the capsules
filled with eggs, and some with Medusae.                  Even more start
ling is the fact now to be mentioned.                 In  one and the same
species     (Myriophyllum), dredged at the same time and from
the same place,       I  found the capsules containing            eggs and
also Medusas ; and others — but not on the same Polypidom
— containing eggs and Polypes, i.                e. the ciliated gemmules
which we know to be the infusorial stage of the Polype.
    I have seen this so often that the whole history              of evolu
tion thus presents         itself :   Taking the medullary substance
of the Polype as the analogue of the cellular basis of the
plant, we may trace          a somewhat similar course of evolution
in each     : the cellular basis becomes differentiated into leaves,
stamens, pistils,     germ-cells, and sperm-cells          ; the medullary
substance becomes differentiated into nucleated cells — these
cells    into   germ-cells     and sperm-cells, or into          germ-cells
 alone, from which are developed,

 and food, Polypes       ;

leaf-bud is developed        under one set of conditions, and a
flower under another set          ;  or as only germ-cells are deve
loped in one plant, sperm-cells in another, or both on the
same plant.
    Of great importance        as regards        the theory of Partheno
genesis are two of the facts just indicated                  ;   namely, that
the Polype      produces     ova     which        become       Medusae   ;  and
that these ova may indifferently become                   either Polypes or
Medusae.      The latter fact ceases to be so marvellous, when
we consider that Agassiz has demonstrated the identity in
structure of Polype and Medusa.
    Of still greater importance as regards the theory of Par
thenogenesis is the conclusion that from germ-cells                        only,
without any influence from sperm-cells, Polypes and Medusae
may be developed.        Do you ask for evidence                  on which to
base this conclusion      ?    The evidence is various.              We have
already noted the indubitable fact that the unfertilised eggs
of Entomostraca,       gall-flies,     bees,     moths, and silk-worms,
do    become    developed      animals      ;   these   must      spring from
germ-cells only.       Next we have the recent experiments in
France     and Germany, which place                 beyond      a  doubt that
dioecious plants become fertile when their pollen                   is entirely
removed     ; and we know         that female plants become fertile
when no pollen-bearing plant is in the kingdom                        ; so that

be added the fact that, according to my observations,                   sperma
tozoa are rarely met with in the Polypes, whereas                       ova   are
extremely abundant.
    All this    evidence, however, is as nothing beside that which
is furnished in the very remarkable researches on the repro
duction of Aphides made by Professor Huxley, an account of
which he read to the Linnaean Society, Nov. 5, 1857.                        That
paper not being yet printed,               I   can only refer to its conclu
sions    in as far      as  they bear on the present topic, and these
are — First, that the        virgin viviparous Aphis, which is said to
produce broods of young by "internal gemmation,"                             does
really produce them         from unfertilised        ova   :  every stage  of the
development of these ova, and that of the embryos having
been carefully made out.             Secondly, that the female oviparous
Aphis produces her young from ova fertilised by spermatozoa                      ;
but the early stages in the development of these ova are pre
 cisely   similar     to those of the viviparous Aphis,               the differ
 ences presenting themselves            at a later period, when in the
                                            "                     "
 one case     the formation of the             mulberry mass takes place
 spontaneously,       in the other     case   it is  preceded     by the union
 of the spermatozoa with the              ova.     As the product of both
 processes is identical — as the            Aphis which is seen to issue
 from an unfertilised ovum is in all respects similar to that
 which issues from a fertilised ovum — the conclusion is irre
 sistible, that Generation is possible from germ-cells only                ;  and
 system that wo have now no evidence of sexuality, whereas in the cryptogamic
 plants sexual distinctions hare been accurately    ascertained.  It seems to me,
 however,  that this paradox   is more piquant than true, and that the analogous
 phenomena     of Parthenogenesis    in animals   explain the difficulty, without
 forcing us to deny the sexuality of the Phanerogamia.

the facts    I   have brought forward respecting the Polypes are
thus    seen to stand              in no absolute isolation.
     Resuming in one schema the results of the investigations
into Polypes, with those of my predecessors, we find, —
     A. The Medusa parent produces ova ;
     B. These    ova           are developed        through an infusorial       stage
into Polypes         ;
     C. These Polypes,               in turn, produce ova        ;
     D. (1) These ova are developed                       into Medusae, thus com
pleting the cycle opened at                  A.
     D. (2) These ova are developed                        into Polypes, thus com
pleting the cycle opened at C.
     The budding process, which both Medusa and Polype mani
fest,   may be eliminated from the scheme of "Alternation."
We shall hereafter                  see   that   it is essentially the   same as the
other processes of generation.
     Such, in brief, is the history, such are the facts, of Par
thenogenesis.                 Let us now glance             at the theories which
attempt to explain them.                    Steenstrup — whose merits are very
considerable, and who first propounded a general                               theory,
named by him the "Alternation of generations"                        — encumbered
the question, instead of clearing                   it,   when he called the Polype
the " wet-nurse" of the Medusa,                         denying its claim to be con
sidered as               "                 To say that the Polype        is   not pro
                 a           parent."
perly   a    "parent," but has only the germs of the Medusa
confided to       it,        is,   as Professor         Owen justly remarked, to
make     a   metaphor supply the place of an explanation.                          In
reply to this objection Steenstrup boldly declares his theory
is   la combinaison intime des /aits.                         Professor Owen con

300                           SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
vincingly shows that the theory is purely verbal                                          :    it    is,
moreover, in direct antagonism with the fact that the Polype
sometimes          produces       eggs without the mediation                    of   a   Medusa       ;
and    if    a   Polype, issuing from an egg, and also producing an
egg from which             another Polype              will   issue,     be not regarded
         "                   will
as   a       parent,"   it          be difficult to specify in what parentage
truly consists.           Steenstrup's theory                 is   almost identical, ex
cept      in language, with that of the old writer alluded to                                        by
Quatrefages,           who accounted for Bonnet's facts by a " trans
                                  " "
mitted fecundation            :       D'apres lui, les pucerons produisent

     At   a   first glance this may be mistaken for an anticipa
tion of Owen's theory               ;   but   a   more rigorous inspection dis
covers        that Owen's theory differs from                      it   by the all-impor
tant character of definiteness.                        Instead          of throwing over
the question the obscure                   generality of           a    phrase,      it       points
directly to        a   specific fact, or condition, such                  as,   if       accepted,
would indicate the terminal stage of inquiry, beyond which
no intellect could hope                  to penetrate.             It    starts from                the
germ-cell, from which the organism arises, and, following
the course of this germ-cell,                     it   holds the Ariadne thread,
which, through all the mazes of the labyrinth, conducts the
mind to clear issues.                   Let us, in as brief             a   space as pos
sible, develop this theory.

                          OWEN      S    THEORY.                            301
    All  organisms, plant or animal, originate in a cell.                  This
cell spontaneously divides into two, these two into four,
these four into eight, and so on, till, instead of a solitary nu
cleated cell, a mass is present, known as the " germ mass."
(Plate   VI.,  figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.)      In the Conferva, instead of         a
mass, a thread      of cells has arisen, forming the filament which
constitutes the whole plant.            In the animal, the         cells have
not been placed end to end, thread-like, but side to side, and
                                                           "
form     what is called the " mulberry              mass     (fig. 8)  ; and a
further distinction is to be noted, namely, that each animal
cell, as it formed, carried with it a portion of the yolk. From
                      "
the " germ mass         the animal is evolved.             Each cell of this
mass is the offspring       of the primary germ-cell, reproducing
its powers and capacities.          As the animal is formed out of
this mass, and by means of          it  (figs. 9, 10), we are forced to
the conclusion that the cells have become transformed into
tissues.    But " not all the progeny of the primary germ-cell
are required     for the formation of the body in all animals                 :
certain of the derivative germ-cells may remain unchanged,
and become included in that body which has been composed
of their metamorphosed and diversely combined or confluent
brethren    :  so included,      any     derivative     germ-cell,      or the
nucleus of such, may commence                 and repeat the same pro
cesses   of growth by imbibition, and of propagation by spon
taneous fission, as those to which itself owed its origin." *
    It is this, according to Owen, which constitutes Partheno
genesis.      Some    of the cells, instead of being transformed
into tissues, remain, unchanged as cells, included in the body,
                        * Owen   : Parthenogenesis,  p. 5.

302                         SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
where they repeat the original process                    of subdivision,       and
produce offspring as they themselves                     were produced.          In
proportion, therefore, to the complexity of the animal (that
is,   in proportion         to the amount of cells transformed into
tissues),     will   be   its inability to reproduce itself by Partheno
genesis.       In proportion         to the amount           of unchanged cells
will be this power of reproduction.                      The marvels of the
Hydra, as recounted by Trembley, are thus explicable                        ;   for
the    Hydra retains its germ-cells unchanged everywhere,
except      in the tentacles and the integument, and these are in
                                        " The                        of parts of
capable       of   reproduction.              reproduction
higher animals has also been found to depend on pre-existing
cells retained as such.             Mr H. D.     S.   Goodsir has shown that,
in the lobster, so noted for the power of reproducing its
claws, the regenerative faculty does not reside at any part                      of
the claw indifferently, but in            a    special locality at the basal
end of the first joint.             This joint    is   almost filled by   a   mass
of nucleated cells             surrounded by      a    fibrous and muscular
band."
      But here the reader may ask how the cycle of generation
is    ever completed       ?    Why    does not the Polype continue bud
ding off fresh Polypes for ever          ;   why does not the Aphis-larva
continue producing broods of larvae               ;    why does not the plant
persist in sending forth leaves and buds                 ;   why do we always
see   a   sudden change        —a   leap, as   it     were, into higher life —
completing the cycle by the Polype producing                     a   Medusa, the
larval Aphis producing an Aphis, the plant                        producing       a
flower    ?    To this question Owen has prepared an answer.

                  CRITICISMS OF OWEN                       S    THEORY.                303
by dilution       a portion of its plastic force.                  If   on starting     it
had a force of 100, after fifty subdivisions it will have no
more than 2.                 It    is this necessary           dilution of power in
repeated reproductions which prevents Parthenogenesis from
being indefinitely prolonged.
     Such is the theory, in every way remarkable, proposed by
our great anatomist                 ;   and before proceeding to examine its
stability,    I   will       adduce the strongest          illustration in its favour
I    have yet found.                    The theory assumes that some of the
original germ-cells are retained untransformed in the body of
the Hydra and Aphis, which cells, in virtue of their original
tendency, subdivide and develop into new animals.                             We have
formerly seen that the germ-mass of the Eolis, Doris, and
Aplysia, normally develops itself into one, two, three, and even
eight distinct animals.                  As this takes   place contemporaneously,
and in the same chorion — as one egg actually divides into
several      embryos, by a simple process                      of subdivision     in the
germ-mass — do not  I                   see   how Owen's position can be denied,
that here at least the offspring of the original cell is actually
included in each distinct mass, and that                          it is the origin of
each embryo.                 Whether the cells are unchanged or not, may
be a question            ;    it is certain that they             are included     :   and
as    there can          be        little difference      in the process,        whether
the progeny of one cell be developed                            simultaneously as in
the Doris, or successively                    as    in the Aphis, the fundamental
position      seems secured.                    I   say seems, because       I   do    not
 really      think it             is,   nor do  I     find myself       able to accept
 Owen's explanation.

genesis as embodying an error.               The larval Aphis, says the
former, cannot properly be styled a virgin, because it is an
                          "
incomplete organism, and a l'idec de virginite se rattache
invinciblement        celle   de la possibility        de cessation        de cet
dtat."    He objects, therefore, to the name, because, he says,
Owen's conception rests on the remarkable exception                         of   the
Aphis-larva, in which reproductive              organs,       incomplete,        but
still perfectly recognisable,           have    been        discovered.          The
objection, which        was never very           forcible,      is completely
silenced by       Von Siebold's discovery of perfect insects, male
and female, in the virgin-progeny              of bee and moth.             As    to
Von Siebold's objection to the name, that by it Owen " con
founds Parthenogenesis with alternation                    of generations," it
is met not only by the explanation Owen gives in a note to
the translation of Von Siebold's work                (p.   11), but   is   further
met by what        will probably      be seen, in the       following discus
sion,    to be the true state of the case              ;    namely, that the
generation of bees and moths            is   essentially the same as that
of Ascidians,       Aphides, and Polypes         ;    and instead of con
founding two distinct things in one phrase, Owen has recon
ciled two seeming differences.
     Ketaining,    therefore,    the name Owen has given to the
phenomenon,         let us      examine his      theory.         Quatrefages,
among objections of little weight, urges one of more value

 not cells      at all.   On this latter point       it may  be observed
 that embryologists are still divided,* the dispute turning on
 the   correct definition of a cell — much as if men disputed
 whether a book " in sheets
                                    "
                                       ought properly to be called a
 "
   book."        As regards Owen's theory, a slight modification in
 its terms would meet the objection.
    Not so the objection which must,         I think,   be raised against
 the vital point in the theory — the assumption of a definite
 prolific   force    contained in the primary         germ-cell, a force
 which becomes diluted by subdivision of the cell, and can be
 renewed only through another act of fertilisation.                This is
 the heel of Achilles      ; if vulnerable here, our great anatomist
 may be pricked by any vulgar javelin.                Let us try. "The
                                   "
 physiologist," says Owen,           congratulates himself with jus

until he arrives at the union of the spermatozoon with
the germinal vesicle as the essential            condition of develop
ment — a cause ready to operate             when favourable circum
stances concur, and without which cause those circumstances
would have no effect.           What  I  have endeavoured      to do has
been,    to point      out the conditions which bring about the
presence      of the same essential cause in the cases of the
development of an embryo from a parent that has not itself
been impregnated.         The cause is the same in kind, though not
in degree     ;  and every successive generation, or series of spon
taneous fissions of the primary impregnated germ-cell, must

  Quatrefages justly calls this a seductive theory                                ;    but adds,
that not even the imposing authority                          of Owen's name has
gained acceptance for it.The first objection I should raise is,
                           "               "
that the assumption of the prolific force    belongs to meta-
physiology.        The second objection                 is,   that    it     obliges us to
embrace        the paradox of the greatest                effect arising from the
most diminished force, since, according to                           it,    the    seed,      in its
primal vigour, only produces buds — in its exhaustion, flowers;
the egg, in its primal vigour, only produces Polypes and
Larvae    — in its     exhaustion, Medusae and perfect Aphides.                                  Or
must we regard the Flower, Medusa, and perfect Aphis as
inferior and arrested               forms, of which Leaf,                     Polype,           and
Larva are the matured beings                 ?     The celebrated                 Wolff main
tained that the Flower was an imperfect organism —flowers
and fructification, according to him, being the consequences
of arrest of development                   and much may be said for this

hypothesis, although we must finally reject                           it,   when we know
that there are plants which                   flower before                they put forth
leaves, and that the larval              Aphis     is   confessedly           an imperfect
insect.
      A   third,   and far more           fatal,     objection              is,   that        under
suitable       conditions        the plant       will continue putting forth
buds,              Polypes, and the larval Aphis larvae, to
           the Polype

nishing,       by repeated         subdivisions         of the cells,                 retains    its
primitive fertility.            Kyber kept       a   plant, with larval Aphides,

in a room the temperature of which was constant,                   and saw
these larvae produce broods for four years           without interrup
tion   !   Whereas, had the temperature varied, these                 larvae
would have manifested changes similar to those observed in
ordinary circumstances,       when the lowering of the tempera
ture in autumn stops the production of larvae, and induces
that of perfect insects.      We may also refer to the observation
of Sir     J.   G. Dalyell, who kept a strobila for several years
continually budding.
  A fourth       and last objection   is,   that the Polypidom, which
produces both Polypes and Medusae by gemmation, also pro
duces      eggs which become Polypes, as every one knows, and
eggs which become Medusae, as         I     have discovered   ;   yet, after
one    of these egg capsules has been developed on the Polypi
dom, the budding process continues as before.                 This would
imply that the original prolific force, when nearly exhausted,
produced eggs, and then, suddenly recovering its vigour, con
tinued the production of buds.              Now, an oscillating force of
this kind cannot be accepted.
   Although      I   think Owen's theory must be abandoned,               it
seems to me incomparably the best which has been offered
indeed, the only one which       goes deeper than        a    phrase, and
rests on definite conditions.         The very definiteness         of these
conditions enables them to be closely tested and confronted
with fact.       The pregnant ideas contained in his work have
been of essential service     in the formation of those conclusions
which force me to regard Parthenogenesis as not presenting
any peculiar mystery.       I   shall endeavour to show that           it   is
no deviation from the ordinary processes of Keproduction,

except   in formal and quite accessory details.            Do not, how
ever, suppose that, in denying the relative marvellousness              of a
phenomenon which has excited               so much astonishment,        any
attempt is made to lessen the original             marvel.      When the
rise of a feather in the air is explained by the same law of
gravitation which explains the fall of the quill, no mystery is
dissipated by this reduction of two seemingly contradictory
facts to one law.        In like manner, the eternal mystery of
Reproduction remains the same dark Dynamis,                    baffling all
comprehension, although by its laws we may also explain
this novel phenomenon of Parthenogenesis.
   Hitherto physiologists have admitted three forms of Repro
duction.      1. The fissiparo us;      e. g. when a cell spontaneously
divides into two cells.       2. The gemmiparous ;          e.   g. when a
plant puts forth buds, or a polype sends forth polypes from
its stem.    3.  The oviparous ;     e.  g. when the plant and animal
produce seeds and eggs.          Fission, Gemmation, and Genera
tion, are the three names designating these processes.                  The
two first are universally admitted to be identical processes                ;
but almost all writers regard Gemmation and Generation                    as
two essentially distinct processes.             Owen denies that there
is any essential distinction.        The Hydra, as he remarks, pro
duces Hydrae both by Gemmation                 and Generation.        " The
young Hydra from the bud is identical in organic structure
and character with that which comes from the ovum                     ; and
when the effects of organic development are the same, their
                                   '                           '
efficient   causes cannot     be     altogether distinct     ;    only the
non-essential accessories      of the process may be the subject
of variation."      And Dr Alexander Harvey reminds us                   on

this point, that " things that are equal to the same, are equal
to one another ;"          so   that    if  the product    of the bud and the
product of the          seed   be     in all respects identical, there must
necessarily be an identity between                 the seed    and bud.*       The
potato-seed and the potato-bud both germinate apart from
the parent plant, and both give                     rise to organisms in all
                              "
respects     identical.          What, let me ask, is included in the
statement that the bud can evolve a perfect                        and complete
plant — that        it  can evolve        the flower and the seed      ?    This   :
that it must contain                within itself the two kinds of cell
regarded       as essential        to the     constitution    of the   seed, —as
forming the essential            characteristics of the       seed,  namely the
'
  sperm-cell/        and the
                                  '

rent idea respecting the germ-cell and sperm-cell                      as essen
tially necessary to the             seed,   and   Dr Harvey himself         seems
to   have     relinquished        the    idea in his more         recent    work   ;
meanwhile it is sufficient that in both works he has esta
blished the essential            identity of bud and          seed,  and conse
quently of Gemmation                   and Generation.        Wolff long       ago
taught that the bud was identical with the                       seed ;J but     no
one,    I believe, has carried this doctrine to its legitimate con
clusion, namely, that Generation is only                   a form of Growth        ;
because every          one has assumed           that the union of two dis
similar cells is the necessary commencement                    of every genera
tion.     Even Owen, who maintains that Gemmation is closely

allied to Generation, does so because he maintains that the
original unchanged cells, which resulted from fecundation,
form the starting-point         of the bud    ; and that thus the bud
and seed are identical, because both really originate in iden
tical cells —both really issue from an original act of fecunda
tion   ;   whereas   these pages contain abundant evidence          that
fecundation is by no means necessary to Generation, except
in the higher animals         ;   plants,  polypes,  insects, and crus
taceans, being generated         without fecundation.
    It   is worthy of remark that, although the Hydra propa
gates by eggs and by buds,             it only produces two or three
eggs     during the autumn, whereas it buds all the year round.
We may consider its oviparity, therefore, as an exceptional
process.       I believe it is one solely determined by external
conditions, and that      if the Hydra were kept in an unvarying
temperature,      it would never produce eggs at all, but continue
budding to the end of the chapter.
    All     the  endeavours      to   prove that    Parthenogenesis    is
in every case the result of mere Gemmation are powerless
against Owen, who denies the essential difference               between
Gemmation and Generation, and serve to support his view
when they are coupled with Von Siebold's discoveries.               The
Hydra sending forth a second Hydra from its own substance
                                   " bud " like a
directly, may be said to                             plant. The Aphis
producing broods of Aphides internally, instead of externally,
which broods are unattached to their parent, may likewise
be said to exhibit        "internal Gemmation," — although           this
budding is the result of ova.             Von Siebold's virgin moths
 present us with eggs instead of young — eggs in every way

identical with those produced by Generation               :  yet,   if this be
so, how shall we name the process?                  We must name it
internal oviparous Gemmation ; and what distinction there
is  between oviparous Gemmation            and oviparous Generation,
it will  be difficult to say.     In both     cases, eggs are produced
directly from the substance           of the parent     ;   these     eggs,  in
both cases, develop      into animals indistinguishable in struc
ture or function, and capable of reproducing their species by
either mode.      From attending to formal and accessory differ
ences,    and not keeping the          attention    fixed on         essential
processes,    physiologists    have      imagined     a     distinction      to
exist between Gemmation and Generation, which will not
withstand                   Thus M. Quatrefages says                 " In the
               scrutiny.                                          :
 animal, as in the plant, reproduction by budding is effected
on the spot (en entier sur place), at the expense                       of the
parent's substance.        In the two kingdoms, reproduction by
 seeds and eggs demands        the concourse of two elements pre
pared by special       organs.     It   is immaterial whether these
organs are both united in the same individual, or borne by
distinct   individuals   ;  there is always a father and a mother,
a stamen     and a pistil, an element which fertilises, and an
element which is fertilised."         I   really cannot      see    anything
beyond subsidiary distinctions           here.   The contrast is only
formal.     Out of the substance          of the parent both bud and
seed are evolved    ; whether the product shall be a mass of cells
which at once develop into an organism by repeated                      subdi
vision,   or into eggs by repeated           subdivision,      will    depend
 on specific conditions, but the essential        process      is the same
 in each.    The egg itself is   a product, as much as the embryo               ;

312                           SEA-SIDE                STUDIES.
it is not   a starting-point,      but a station on the grand                     junction
line of development.            No one will venture to assert that the
process     of Nutrition is other than identical, whether the
product evolved          from the blood-plasma be a nerve-cell, a
muscle-cell,       or a gland-cell    :   different as these products are,
they all issue from embryonal cells indistinguishable                                      from
each other     ;   and the law of Nutrition by which they increase
is the same law in all.
     The identity of the process in Reproduction                                  is clearly
seen in the following results of Mr R. Q. Couch's observa
tions on the Sertularian Polypes : " At certain seasons of the
year they produce cells (capsules) much larger than those of
a more permanent character.                       These,        at first, are composed
of the granular pulp of the stem                           ;   afterwards the pulp be
comes furrowed, and            finally formed into cells.                     After a short
period they separate from the parent, and undergo the pro
cess    of development.          If   these cells attain a certain                         size,
they are developed            into eggs       ;       if   they are stunted by cold,
they are formed into Polypes                      ;    while     if,   from unfavourable
causes, they are        still smaller, they grow into branches                         ;   and
thus we     see    that, according to circumstances,                        different organs
are capable of being eliminated from the same structure."                                      *
In    conclusion, let us remember that the egg itself                            is   an out
growth, not        a   starting-point     ;           as all know who have made
themselves         acquainted with the results                         of    embryological
research,   in which the phases of the genesis of the egg are
minutely recorded         ;   this genesis                 being the same essential
process observed         in all other forms of Growth.

     Let us now examine the old position, which declares that
the union        of two different        elements,   a   germ-cell and a
sperm-cell, is the act of Generation — an act                sui generis,
and altogether distinct from the act of cell-multiplication,
or Growth, which is regarded simply "as                    a modification
of    the nutritive function."         The act of union, hitherto re
garded as the fundamental            act   of all Reproduction, is only,
I   believe,   a subsidiary,     derivative process, and not by any
means the        " ultimate fact
                                    " at which our researches must
pause    ;   a   conclusion to which          Goethe pointed when he
 showed that Growth and Reproduction                   in plants are but
 different aspects of the same law.
     Let us consider the known facts of Reproduction in their
 ascending order of complexity.              What is the simplest pro
 cess   known ?       It is that of a cell spontaneously multiplying
 itself by subdivision.         In the albuminous and starchy fluid,
 named protoplasma,           a  single cell appears.       It  assimilates
 more and more of the fluid.             It  then divides into two cells
 perfectly similar.         These two cells divide into four, eight,
 sixteen, and so the multiplication            continues,   till there is a
 filament of cells, each independent and capable               of separate
 existence,    but each attached to the other by its cell-wall.
 In    a similar way leaves,        instead of filaments, are formed.
 Many of the lower plants are nothing but aggregations of
 such cells    ;  and in many this simple mode of Reproduction
 is the only mode yet discovered.              By this process of sub
 division a    single cell of the Protococcus nivalis (or red snow)
 will redden vast tracts of snow in a few hours                  ; and the
 Bovista giganteum is estimated to produce in one hour no

less than four thousand millions                   of cells.        Ehrenberg com
putes the increase of the infusorial                      Paramecium at two
hundred and sixty-eight               millions     in a month.              In this, the
simplest form of Reproduction,                   the identity of the process
with that of Growth is indisputable and undisputed.
     The whole organism consists of a simple cell, or string of
such cells       :    we must therefore        either deny that the union                 of
two dissimilar cells is the essential               process        of Generation, or
we must point-blank                deny that these cellular organisms are
generated at all.            If,   shrinking     from this latter alternative,
we acknowledge that Generation must take place                                  in these
organisms,            how shall we establish          a     line    of demarcation
between          the reproduction       of independent cells, and that                    of
cells      united together in         a    filament   ?     In other words, how
shall we demarcate Reproduction from Growth                             ?     When the
cells are attached,         a   filament    is   formed,    and the plant          is   said
to grow      ;   when the cells are detached,          a    new plant         is   said to
be      generated      :   but whatever          differences        there       may      be
between          twenty cells forming          a   filament, and twenty cells
existing separately, each capable of growing into                           a   filament,
the origin of both            is   one and the same, and the process                      of
Growth         is    identical with the process of Generation.
      In   a   former passage       I     suggested        that    it   was     probably
owing to differences of temperature,                  or food, that Reproduc
tion by Gemmation and by Generation took place.                                     This,
which was hypothetical as regards the Polype, can be demon
strated in the Yeast plant.                There are two kinds of yeast, or
rather two forms of the same plant. The one                        is   called surface
yeast, the other sediment yeast                    The former requires             a    tem-

                 GEMMATION           AND GENERATION.                                         315
perature of 70° to 80° Fahrenheit                     ;   the latter 32° to 45°.
Under the microscope we can watch the process of Repro
duction in      each.     The surface yeast grows by budding only                              :
from the cell-wall a little hernia is formed, which grows and
grows, until in lieu of one cell there are two                       ;    these two set
up the same budding-process, and a whole filament of cells is
the result.        The sediment          yeast does not bud               ;    its isolated
cells burst, and liberate a quantity of nuclei (spores                             ?)   which
develop into perfect cells.               If,   however, the temperature                      be
raised     from 45° to 70°, this process                   is   arrested       ;   no more
spores are formed, but the plant begins budding like surface
yeast.      Here, by      a   simple change in one of the conditions
only, (that of temperature),             we convert indisputable Gemma
tion into indisputable            Generation — unless                we        obstinately
refuse to consider any reproductive process as                           a    true genera
tive act that       is   not preceded by the union of sperm-cell and
germ-cell     —    a     refusal which          would lead to the denial of
 Generation altogether in vast regions of the vegetable                                      and
animal kingdom.
    Having established this point, let us ascend                              a    step, and
we reach the second              form of Reproduction,                    which         is   the
union      of two   similar     cells.     This      is   named      by botanists the
 act     of "conjugation."         In    a   simple filament, consisting of
 cells    produced by fission, any two cells may unite                                  ;   their
 contents coalesce to form           a    new starting-point,                 from which
 the multiplication of cells may proceed.                                Instead of two
 cells    in the same filament, two cells of contiguous filaments
 may coalesce, but          in each case        it   is   the union of two similar
 cells.     This    is   the first dim indication               we       obtain of that

   316                      SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
   union of different sexes which in higher organisms becomes
   the normal process.
      From the fission of one cell into two similar cells, and the
   conjugation of two similar cells, we now pass to the third
   and final mode of Reproduction,                namely, the union       of   two
  dissimilar cells.        To this union the special name of Genera
  tion has been applied         ; but the difference of name must not be
  allowed to mask the identity of the process.                  It is a fact, that
  for the production of the more complex organisms, union of
  germ-cells     and sperm-cells         is     indispensable.       Speculative
  physiologists     have      likened    this      union    of germ-cell with
  sperm-cell to the union of an acid with its base.                      But the
  deeper    our researches         penetrate,     the more erroneous         does
  such   a comparison appear.             I    cannot pause here to trace
  the genesis     of ovum and spermatozoon,                 but must content
  myself with the assertion,           which        the reader can verify       by
  consulting any embryological authority, that in their origin,
  and in the earlier phases of their development, these two
  cells are identical.       It   is only in their subsequent history
 that they differ.*        If one    convincing argument be needed to
  crown all these indications, we may find it in the now indu
 bitable fact, that animals which normally are developed from
 fertilised eggs, are also normally developed from eggs unfer
 tilised.    It is clear, then, that        if   the egg, previous to fertil
 isation, has within       it  the elements and conditions which              will
produce the same animal as would                       have   issued   from    the
fertilised    egg, the    influence of the sperm-cell on the germ-

      That is the reason

         UNION OF SPERM-CELL                     AND       GERM-CELL.           317
cell, whatever       it may    be, cannot be        of that elementary indis
pensable nature which is implied                 in the comparison of an
acid uniting with a base to form a salt.                          No alkali spon
taneously develops into a salt             ;   without the acid the alkali is
powerless to assume any of the saline forms.                       But the germ
cell does develop an embryo without the aid of a sperm-cell                          ;
and this, too, in certain animals which at other times generate
sperm-cells.         Indispensable the influence of the sperm-cell
is,   in the more complex organisms (although the insect                       is a
very complex organism)           ;    but we observe one intensely sig
nificant fact, namely, that the germ-cell spontaneously passes
through the same early phases                  of   its development,      whether
it   be fertilised   or not.    It cannot      continue its development,          as
the germ-cells of Polypes, Entomostraca, Bees, and Moths con
tinue theirs    ;    but neither    is   there any fixed     limit to its arrest.
Some ova fall short at one stage, others at others, but at no
stage    of their history can we say, Here the aid of fertil
isation begins.        Every ovum, therefore,               of   the highest   ani
mal as     of  the lowest, has      within     it   the   power   of development
unaided      by   the spermatozoon        ;    this development falls very
short indeed of an embryo, in the highest animals, but                            it
travels some miles on the road towards that goal                     ;   and when,
as    in insects, the goal     is   not very distant,       it   may be reached.
We may liken the spermatozoa to the extra pair of horses
put to the carriage to enable              it   to reach     a    certain distance
over mountainous ground.                  Two horses have dragged the
carriage to the foot of the                hill, and have brought            it   by
precisely      the same route as the four horses                       would have

318                            SEA-SIDE             STUDIES.
indispensable.              In granting the indispensable nature of the
aid of such extra horses, no one would think of saying that
it proved         the necessity          of four horses to carriage travelling.
      What the precise nature of the influence exercised by the
spermatozoon truly                 is,   we know not         ;      but an hypothesis
may be here suggested, provided the reader regard                                     it   as an
hypothesis, not at all interfering                      with the positive facts
just stated.              We may give speculation elbow-room for a
moment,           and return to our discussion in no worse condition
than before.              When the spermatozoon penetrates                            into the
interior of the ovum,               it    there becomes dissolved,               and finally
disappears.           According          to Meissner * its metamorphosis                       is
precisely the same, whether occurring inside the ovum or
apart from          it,   and in each       case   the process       is   one    of gradual
change into fat.             Now     if    we consider the absolute import
ance of fat         in the formation of cells, and remember that the
development of the ovum                      is    through      a   continuous multi
plication of cells, the influence of the spermatozoon                                  will   be
perfectly intelligible             as that     of furnishing          increase        of cell-
production.            The    sperm-cell           being proved identical                  with
the germ-cell, we may compare                        its additional force to the
force       added     by the        extra horses         which        must        draw the
carriage up the            hilLf
      Having given expression to my hypothesis,                           I       return to
the survey of the various modes                      of Reproduction, which we

t      Wolff, Theorie von der Generation, p.           248-9,    maintains that the sper
matozoon     is   nothing but the highest form of concentrated            nutriment    ;   in his
day   it   was thought to be the miniature animal, the office of the mother being
simply to feed and rear it.

      WHAT IS THE OFFICE OF THE SPERM-CELL?                        319
have     seen to be identical,     since   not only are Fission and
Gemmation admitted to be identical, but we have further
seen that between Gemmation             and Generation no real vital
distinction      exists.   By a real and vital distinction,    I mean
one which       implies an essential    and indispensable difference
in the two processes, and in the two results.               But if the
Hydra produced from a bud is in every respect the same as
the Hydra produced from an ovum, and is capable in its turn
of producing buds and ova, we can hardly suppose this iden
tity of result to arise from     processes essentially dissimilar.   If
the Bee, or Moth, produced from an unfertilised egg is pre
cisely the same as the Bee or Moth produced from the fer
tilised egg, and is capable of producing offspring in the same
 way, we can hardly suppose           this identity of result to arise
from processes essentially dissimilar.        We may distinguish the
 process of the      union of two cells from that of the simple divi
 sion of one cell, and call this union by the name of Genera
 tion  ;   and there   will be obvious   convenience   in having such a
 name     ; but  if the result of Generation is the production of an
 animal perfect in all its parts, and capable of propagating its
 species,   it is quite clear that the union of two dissimilar     cells
 is not the essential and fundamental process necessary for such
 a result, since the result is frequently         attained without it.
  When we consider Generation in the higher animals, we seem
 justified in establishing the union of germ-cell and sperm-
  cell as the distinctive and indispensable condition       ; but when
  we consider Generation in the abstract,         and observe its phe
  nomena in the simpler animals, we are forced to admit that
  this condition is no longer distinctive and indispensable, but

  320                    SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
 that the union of the two cells is a secondary and derivative
 process, not the fundamental process           of Generation.
     In  the simpler animals we have seen that no distinction
 whatever exists between Reproduction and Growth              ; and  if in
 the more complex animals Reproduction is not carried on               by
 this process     of cell-division or cell-formation, the union         of
 two dissimilar cells being indispensable, so likewise in those
 animals Growth is carried on by a more complex process.
 A   vertebrate   animal does not reproduce itself by spontaneous
 fission, like a conferva or an animalcule        ; but neither does a
 nerve grow by spontaneous        fission.
     Unless  I am greatly deceived, the foregoing survey of the
 various forms of Reproduction has shown that there can be
 no essential distinction between        Growth and Gemmiparous
 Reproduction.        This granted, it likewise follows that as
 Gemmation and Generation are identical, there can be no
 essential    distinction    between      Growth       and   Generation,
 but only formal accessory        differences.       Whether    cells are
 aggregated     together in filaments, or are set free as indi
 viduals, whether the cells develop          into tissues, or into indi
 viduals, must depend on secondary processes.
    If  the reader has followed     with assent this somewhat ab
struse discussion and elucidation of the identity of Growth
and Reproduction,       he   will have     little difficulty in classing
the phenomena       of Parthenogenesis under the ordinary laws
of Reproduction, and removing the peculiar marvel which
has hitherto invested those       phenomena.          Accepting Repro
duction as a vital property — an ultimate              fact —which ap
pears under various forms of Growth, Gemmation, and Gen-

               WHAT         IS PARTHENOGENESIS?                          321
eration, he  will admit that there is nothing more marvellous
in  an animalcule reproducing several millions of animalcules
by spontaneous fission, than in             a plant being constructed
 out of several millions of cells, each produced by a spon
 taneous fission  ;  in each case the marvel is the same —the
process the same.       It    is not more marvellous that an Aphis
 should produce another Aphis full-formed from its own sub
 stance, than that a lobster should out           of its own substance
 replace a broken claw.
    The peculiarity     of Parthenogenesis which has most at
tracted and puzzled naturalists is the fact that each genera
tion is unlike its parent.         In Steenstrup's words     :
                                                                " Genera
tion  A  produces generation B, which is dissimilar              to  itself ;
whilst generation B produces generation C, which is dis
similar to itself, but which returns to the form of genera
tion A."     This, on closer scrutiny,         becomes    very dubious.
Agassiz has pointed out the identity in structure of the
Medusa and Polype         ;   and although there are formal diffe
rences   between    these    two animals, as we ascend the scale
such differences grow less, and finally disappear.             The Aphis
produces a larval Aphis, which only differs from its parent
in the imperfection of certain organs,               and these      imper
fections   are  not     constant ;        the  larva    has    sometimes
wings.    The   virgin       product     of the silkworm        Moth      is
every way indistinguishable           from the products of fertilised
eggs.
    What, then, is the theory of Parthenogenesis to which this
discussion conducts us       ?    Simply this   :  The phenomenon is
not a deviation from the ordinary laws of Reproduction, but

322                      SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
a derivation from those laws.            What they are, no one at pre
sent can express.           The fact that all organic beings are
endowed with the property of Reproduction,                    which mani
fests itself under the forms of Growth, Gemmation, and Gen
eration, must, for the present at least,               be accepted      as an
ultimate fact, not permitting dispute, not admitting explan
ation.    Whether new individuals or only new parts                   of indi
viduals, are reproduced, the fundamental process is the same.
Whether the animal produce cells which increase as buds, or
as eggs, the process         is the same.       Whether      the egg deve
lop under the influence of fertilisation,                or without that
influence, the process         is the same.        Whether the union of
 two cells, followed by continuous fission, be taken as the
starting-point,      or whether the continuous fissions proceed
without any union, everywhere the one law of Reproduc
 tion—the fundamental property of Growth—meets                          us  as
 the ultimate       fact, the great terminal           mystery; and the
 simplest form under which this process                is known to us is
 the spontaneous subdivision            of a cell.       Thus, to borrow

There    are perspiring      individuals    who love not summer in
its sultry splendour.       With bubbles on their upper lips, they
languidly declare the heat is insupportable.             It   is not often
that our English summers swelter with intolerable heat                        ;
and when the blazing sun does pour fierce radiance on the
land, who have true right to murmur           ?     Only those unhappy
victims of civilisation doomed to move along stifling                streets,
with souls yearning for the far-off woodlands and the breezy
sea-boards   ;  or those victims of agricultural necessities who
toil amid the shadeless corn.         Nobody     else.   The heat is hot,
undoubtedly     ; but  it is  beneficent.     Nature ripens       ; life cul
minates   ; let no one murmur.         I  am  in a permanent vapour-
bath while writing this, yet the temporary discomfort cannot
quell my invincible delight in summer             : it only gives    a more
exquisite sense of the evening coolness, and the breezy shade.
To walk out under this August sun demands                       a touch of

heroism    ;  yet  if we venture out, there is always the refuge
of a shady nook behind the rocks, where, sheltered amid the
ferns and purple heath, we may recline, and watch the gentle
sea lapping      the pebbles      at our feet.    In  dreamy mood we
" fleet the time carelessly as they did in the Golden Age."
A   pleasant book beguiles the lazy hour.           Murmurous insects
sing and labour all around          ; birds chirp and twitter in their
busy joy.      These are the psalms of Nature, in which the
soul finds perennial delight.            They sink into our minds with
the gentle fall of raindrops in a silent pool, creating many
circles.     They speak to us of happy days, and chide with
their serenity the feverish impatience of our lives.
   Then, delicious are our evening rambles, when the birds
are ceasing     from melodious labour.           The lazy toad crawls
ungainly from his hole (not despised              of us, although   the
victim of popular prejudice)           ;  the timid bat wings its pur
blind way through the dim air, holding her young one fast
ened to her breast, and moving              with her dear burden less
gracefully than her mate        ;   and the numerous goats, browsing
on the rocks, are being milked, while their kids are tenderly
led home.       The sands or the lanes invite us to a meditative
stroll, and we ramble on, revolving the various hints, glimpses,
hypothetic suggestions, which gather round the facts observed
 in the morning's labour.
    Or,  it may     be, we step    into a boat, and glide softly over
the   water, skimming        its surface      with the Medusa-net, to
gain fresh material for study.             The muslin net, after skim
ming the surface for two or three minutes, is examined.              To
the unlearned eye        it contains nothing beyond foam-bubbles

and stray bits of weed                     ;   but we know better. Those bubbles
are not all    of foam          ;     some       of them are exquisite creatures             of
living crystal       ;    and on reversing the net into the glass                        jar of
sea-water, behold               !     they swim before our delighted                      eyes
as Cydippes,             Noctilucae, and Naked -eyed                          Medusae.    The
Cydippe (Plate            I.,   fig.       2)   is   melon-shaped, with longitudinal
bands, on which are transverse rows                                 of very active cilia, not
unlike tiny treadmills, and with two long streamers, which
follow like the tail of                a   comet.         As we capture        these beauties,
our boatmen are lost in astonishment.                                                " see'd
                                                                          They never
such things        afore — that                 they never did — never in all their
lives, long as they've been at sea."                               Nor can they understand
how we distinguish                   them from the foam-bubbles.                      Indeed,
I   cannot myself precisely indicate the characters by which
they are recognised             ;      and yet no sooner was there one in the
net than      it   was detected.                     If   the reader desire to learn         a
simple plan by which he                          will infallibly          detect   them, when
they escape his rapid eye, let him place his hand underneath
the net, where the bubbles are, and the greater opacity of
the animals        will at           once betray them.                    Then, without loss
of time, let him reverse the net into                              a   jar or bucket, and the
creatures     will float            off.
    On bringing them home,                            we place our captives           in glass
vases, and begin to study them.                                The Noctilucce are little
crystal balls of about the size of                        a   pin's head, which, under the
microscope,        present the appearance                          figured in the Frontis
piece (fig.    3).       The transparence of its structure permits an
easy investigation.                    Not      a    fibre    is   to be seen, unless, with
De Blainville, we consider the transverse markings of the

tail in the light of muscular fibres, a supposition which is
very questionable.           In the neighbourhood of this tail there
is usually a mass of food, or the indigestible remains of food.
Not that we are to look for a stomach in this animal —
nothing of the kind exists               ;    but in lieu thereof we find, as
in Infusoria, a number of vacuolce, or assimilating cavities,
which     appear and disappear,                according to need, formed out
of the contractile substance which is seen radiating in fila
ments all through the substance  of the animal, and which
              *
M. Quatrefages likens to the sarcode described by Dujardin.
In    this curious animal, not a trace has been discovered of
                                                                  "

It    is a mass of animated jelly, with a mobile tail.                        Its   mode
of reproduction has been variously expounded, but the obser
vations of Quatrefages and Krohn seem placed                                 beyond a
doubt by those recorded in                   Mr Brightwell's     paper,     -f-   proving
that they multiply by spontaneous subdivision.                             No one has
yet observed anything like reproduction by means of ova.
      To these Noctilucce the sea owes much of that brilliant
phosphorescence           which at all times has been the marvel of
travellers.     Place your vase in              a   darkened room, and strike
the glass, or agitate the water, and you                        will   be delighted
with the spectacle presented.                 From every part brilliant sparks
appear and disappear,               until at length no agitation of the
water     will produce more          ;       their power   is   exhausted,         as that
of the electric-eel         is   exhausted         after   a   few shocks.           You
want to know the cause of this phosphorescence                         ?   Unhappily

the point is still sub judice.             It  is only since the beginning
of this century that the attention of naturalists has been
fixed upon the Noctilucce as sources of the phosphorescence,
in all times observed, and in former times attributed to the
presence       of decaying organic substance,               to electricity,       to
"   an absorption       of solar light disengaged in the dark," &c.*
 The extensive and minute investigations of                   M. Quatrefages
led him to the following conclusions                :
     There are two different kinds of phosphorescence                    observed
 in the    sea.    The first is of very brilliant but isolated sparks,
 and is due principally to Star-fishes, Crustaceans,                   and Anne-
 Uds.    The second is of a general luminous tint, over which are
 strewed isolated sparks, and is due to the Noctilucae.                       These
 Noctilucae have no special organ which produces                        the phos
  phorescence as the other         animalsiave ; but the light emanates
 from the whole substance of their bodies.                  Every irritant, no
 matter of what nature, produces this phosphorescence                      in them.
  The phenomenon is not, as in insects, one of combustion                      ; but
  is intimately connected with the contraction, spontaneous                        or
  provoked, of their substance.           It is independent      of all secretion,
  and   it is probable that the sparks            are due to the rupture and
  sudden contraction of their sarcodic filaments                     ;  while the
  steady light they emit in dying results from the permanent
   contraction of this sarcodic substance.
      Having satisfied curiosity about the Noctilucce, let us turn
   once more to the Cydippes, which should be placed                          in the
   tallest jars, because, while the Medusae keep at the surface,

 where they swim with successive pants, the Cydippes con
 stantly  let themselves     drop to the bottom, and rise the
 next moment in graceful buoyancy, drawing their elegant
 streamers after them, these streamers         elongating as they
 ascend,  until from shrivelled threads they unfold into long
 and graceful forms, which, on coming into contact with any
 object, shrink rapidly again into their former shrivelled con
 dition.   All  this while the locomotive paddles of cilia sway
 the animal with restless grace — a charming spectacle        !   After
 admiring   it abundantly, you may      commence     a closer inspec
tion of the creature's structure, which is sufficiently curious,
but need not detain us here, because you may              see   in any
text-book what is known,        and   I know nothing more than
what is there recorded.        One remark only need be made             :
the notion of the streamers      (or tentacles)   being locomotive
 organs, as some suppose, is easily disproved      ;  you have only
to snip them off, and you       will observe  the animal moving
with the same vigour and grace as before.          Nay,   if you cut
the animal    in pieces, each section, provided it has a portion of
the ciliated bands,   will for days swim about with unabated
energy.
    The reader, who is of course a lover of animals, and con
sequently of a sympathetic compassionate          nature,  will pro
bably feel some repulsion at the quiet way in which he is
recommended       to snip off the Cydippe's tentacles, and         will
energetically protest against the cruelty of physiologists who
employ vivisection      as a means     of experiment.     It   is very
true that a grave question has to be answered by the physio
logist when, for the sake of science, he inflicts pain.         I con-

        DO    THE SIMPLER ANIMALS FEEL                       PAIN?         329
fess that my susceptibility altogether disqualifies me from wit
nessing, much more from performing experiments accompanied
with pain.    It was   a long while before      I was able   to justify the
French and Germans in their wholesale slaughter of puppies,
cats, rabbits,   and guinea-pigs. Nor can they be justified except
by the austere necessities of science. When this is their object,
we are wrong to accuse them of cruelty, because cruelty is the
indulgence of tyrannous love of power, and their purpose is
the grave investigation of truth.             Cruel they are not, unless
surgery be also cruelty.          And in any case the reproach
comes   with an ill grace from men who torture animals in
the way of mere sport, as in hunting, fishing, and the like.
I   have said thus much in extenuation              of vivisections,        al
though, as before intimated, my own organisation renders                     it
impossible for me to witness them in the case of the higher
animals.     With lower animals the          case is altogether different.
They feel no pain.        If we    know anything        about them, we
know that.       You   are sceptical   ?     You want to know how it
can be proved that these animals feel no pain.              It   is of course
impossible for us to say accurately what any animal feels                        ;
we cannot even know what our fellow- beings feel                   ;    we can
only approximately       guess, interpreting        their    gestures     and
cries according to our own experience.                Admitting to the
full this initial difficulty, we may nevertheless assert that, if
it is allowable to make any statement            on this point, there are
certain capital facts which force the conclusion upon us, that
so far from   Pain being common to all animals, it                is,   on the
contrary, the consequence         of   a   very high degree of speciali

tion.    It   is probable that reptiles have only a very slight
capacity for pain, and animals lower than fish none at all.
    When we       see  an animal shrink,    struggle, or bite, when
we hear     it cry or   hiss, we naturally    interpret these actions
as the expressions       of pain, because pain calls forth similar
actions    in us.    But there is a fallacy in this interpretation.
The movements which in us accompany or succeed the pain
are not produced by the organs which               feel the pain, even
when pain is actually          present ; they are not produced by
pain, but incited by the stimulus pain gives to other organs.
Grief incites the lachrymal organs, but tears flow from vexa
tion, from affliction, from physical pain, or from the effect
of an onion on the eyes.         Pain incites the vocal organs to a
shriek   ;  but we hear persons, unhurt, shriek, when they see
others in danger.         These illustrations    suffice to make clear
the   difference     between movements which          follow the    sen
sation     of pain, and the movements which              in themselves
indicate it     ; and enable us to apply the Method of Exclusion,
and show that inasmuch as the very same movements are
produced by other stimuli besides pain, we are not entitled
to assume that these movements necessarily indicate pain
in all     cases.    And there is abundant evidence that even
 human beings may exhibit all the phenomena of pain, when,
 by their own confession,        they feel none.       I allude to those
 numerous cases where paralysis of the nerves of sensation
 is unaccompanied by paralysis         of the nerve of motion.        A
 man in such       a state  will retract his leg if pricked, or have
 his limbs thrown into convulsions such as would accompany

 violent agony, yet he will tell us that, so far from feeling
any uneasiness,    he was    totally unconscious of having been
touched.    A  decapitated frog manifests the same movements
of self-preservation as it manifested when its head was on.
 When engaged in certain functions, his leg may be cut off
without causing him to desist.            An insect will      sometimes
continue eating   if pinned   to the table, and will only struggle
to fly away when the food is devoured.               " Soft, lubricated,
and irritable   as is the     skin of the naked mollusc," says
                   "
Professor Owen, there are not wanting reasons for suppos
ing it to be possessed of a very low degree of true sensibility.
Baron Ferussac, for example,          states   that he has seen the
terrestrial gasteropods,     or slugs, allow        their skins to be
eaten by others, and    in spite of the large wounds thus pro
duced, show no sign      of pain."*       But even if they showed
"signs" of pain, we might legitimately question whether
those signs really signified what they seem to us to indicate.
Nothing can be concluded from struggles, shrinkings, and
cries.   A  decapitated man, in whom all consciousness                 is
necessarily obliterated, struggles to free his hands, attempts
to stand upright, and stamps with his feet.             A  headless fly,
fish, or worm, writhes and twists about          if touched,    although
entirely deprived of sensation       ;  a  fly makes the movement
of brushing its eyes by reflex action, although its head may
be off.   Animals that fight with their hind-legs use them
vigorously when decapitated,       at every irritation applied to
the nerves.    Headless insects deposit their            eggs    with as

much care as others.*            Such facts might easily be multi
plied.    Looking at these, however, we are forced to conclude
with Unzer, that " it cannot be inferred from the occurrence
of those movements which usually accompany an external
impression, particularly tickling or smarting, that the latter
are felt, but only that there is that present               in the external
impression which           can cause    tickling or smarting.            If    an
acephalous     foetus, or the headless       trunk of a worm or insect,
be irritated, the same movements result as would have been
considered the direct and incidental              sentient actions of the
irritation if it had been felt.          If it be   so irritated that pain,
under ordinary circumstances,            would have been caused, then
those movements result which are the ordinary                     direct and
indirect   sentient actions of pain.              The injured part con
tracts, is congested with blood, swells and inflames, and the
animal writhes, tries to escape, leaps, flies, defends                    itself,
 and exhibits      all the signs of suffering although it is inca
pable of sensation.”-      f
    It  thus becomes        evident that shrinking, struggling, cry
 ing, &c., are no certain indications               of pain.     Nay,     if we
 were to accept         the  shrinking as evidence,          we    should be
 forced to admit that the flower feels pain when                    it shrinks
 on being touched.          The other day      I  was dissecting a Solen,
 which    had already been          dead     eight-and-forty      hours, and
 was beginning to decompose,             yet no sooner did the scalpel
 touch the muscular foot, than that foot shrank, as                   it would

have shrunk     in the living animal.         Was this pain       ?     Clearly
not.   It  was due to the irritability of the muscular tissue.
   Another observation made over the dissecting-table is even
more instructive.       One of my Tritons had been dead some
time, and was pinned down on a cork plate by the four
paws.     I  had taken out the heart and lungs, without exciting
any obvious contraction, when, on accidentally pricking the
tail with the scalpel,   I was amazed       to  see  it writhe  ;   repeating
the prick, my amazement increased as               I  saw the whole lower
extremities twist and writhe, so          as to free the legs       from the
pins which fastened       them    to the cork.         A  bystander would
have    said that the animal must be suffering pain                   ;  yet on
pricking the anterior extremities, the ribs, the stomach, and
the head, not a trace of sensibility could be detected.                   Dead
the animal assuredly        was.       He had been dead some hours
before   I removed   his heart, yet sensibility remained apparently
as active as ever    in the tail   ;   and on examination         I  observed
this sensibility decreased     as   I  ascended from the tail upwards,
 disappearing altogether midway in the body.
    Up to this point,    we have        done   little more than destroy
the value of the positive evidence which can be adduced in
 support of the proposition           that all animals feel pain.            As
 regards mere shrinking and struggling, fighting and crying,
 we  see  that the evidence     is null.       If  it should   be said that
 all animals possessing a nervous system                  must feel pain,
 because pain belongs to the nervous system,                I ask,   To what
 part of that system?          We are certain that it does not
 belong to every part.       We have endless nerve-actions inces

 santly going forward, without a vestige of pain accompany
 ing them.         There       is no        pain   in seeing, hearing, think
 ing, breathing,          digesting,        &c.    If   not   every part of the
 nervous mechanism, then only some special part, or parts,
 must be credited with sensibility                   under the form of Pain         ;
 and the mere fact of an animal's possessing a nervous sys
 tem,   will aid the argument only when proof is afforded that
 this system also includes the special part or parts endowed
 with sensibility to Pain.*
    As far      as   I   can see into          this obscure question, Pain is
 only a specialisation            of that Sensibility which is common to
 all animals.          It   is a specialisation           resulting from a high
 degree of differentiation             of the nervous system, consequently
 found     only in the more complex animals, and in them
 increasing       as we ascend             the   scale.    Out of a primordial
 basis   of Sensibility (one of the vital properties — an ultimate
fact, therefore), various special forms are developed.                       In the
 ascending series we have first reflex action, we have next
the organic sensations,              then the special sensations         of seeing,
hearing, tasting, smelling, touching; we have, further, the
sensations        of shivering, tickling, fatigue, hunger, thirst,
 which, although not painful in themselves,                        may easily pass
into pain.        Finally, we have a specific form of Sensibility
capable     of being excited by a great variety of stimuli in
great variety of degrees                :   and this is Pain     ;  which appears

to exist in all the higher animals, though in a feebler degree
than in man.              Even among men the difference                               of suscepti
bility is very remarkable.                     It   is much less in savages than
in highly-civilised            men, as         it   seems also                 to be less in wild
animals than in domesticated,                            especially petted,                 animals        ;
less   in men leading an active out-of-door life than in those
leading a sedentary             intellectual             life   ;   less       in women than in
men       ;    less    in persons of lymphatic                        than in persons                 of
nervous temperaments.                     To one man the scratch which is a
trifle scarcely noticed, is to another an obtrusive pain                                         ;   the
one    will not         even   tie his handkerchief                    over the wound, so
little does it press upon his sensibility                                  ;    the other is pale,
and must have the wound dressed.
     It       is because men habitually confound Sensibility                                      with
Pain — the general with the particular — that so many disputes
continue respecting the sensibility of certain parts of the
nervous mechanism               ;   for instance, the disputes as to whether
the Sympathetic system is also a Sensitive system.                                              But no
correct understanding of the nervous system can be arrived
at     until more rigorous language is adopted, and we learn to
designate             all nerve-actions by the one general                            property of
Sensibility, and to discriminate between this general property
and its special manifestations.                           Pain       is,

form of this general Sensibility                    ;   and although anatomy has not
yet detected             the special Centre wherein stimuli are trans
formed into sensations of pain, there can be little doubt that
 such         a   Centre exists, and none at all, in my mind, that the
 lower animals have                 it   not   ;    and this conviction                     keeps     me

a very desirable result, seeing that,                 without experiment, our
observations would carry us but little way.
    But let us turn to another subject.                         In   describing        the
various methods of search for animals,                     it   has been assumed
that a tolerable conception exists as to the appearance                                 of
the thing sought.             We may also count on "chance-seek
ing."       We never know all that we have captured until some
days      afterwards.       Repeated examinations of our vases and
bottles with a lens, enable                us   to detect        many a          curious
novelty        which    was unsuspected among                    the      weed,       and
has now emerged.              It   is,   therefore,   a   good plan always to
               "                                                          have       root

the red weeds being the most advantageous.                            This    is   placed
in sea-water for        a   day or two, and carefully examined from
time to time; something                  is   tolerably certain to be found
thereon.        One day, going over the contents of                   a   bottle with
a   lens,   I   was struck by the curious appearance                          of some
Sertularian       Polype,      round       which      minute         grains of sand
seemed to be clustered,            but all equidistant from the Polype,
and not visibly attached to it.                 On removing          it   to the stage
of the microscope,          these supposed         grains of sand proved to
be the cups       of   a   tiny Polype, in aspect closely resembling
Tubularia indivisa, growing parasitically on the Sertularia.
Proceeding to identify          it,I     found the species to be one hither
to undescribed     ;    and I   propose to name           it    Tubularia para
sitica,   if no one has been before me.                On another occasion             I
saw,    with the naked         eye,   a   polype-like creature attached to
the side of the glass, with its tentacles expanded                        ;   the lens

showed   it to be aPolyzoon, much resembling            the  Ahyonidium
hirsutum.       It  was single, however        ; and on other parts of
the glass were eight other specimens, all solitary.                This was
in itself noticeable, because, as the name Polyzoon imports,
these animals live        in colonies.    Under the microscope, a new
fact presented itself        : the animal was enclosed in an oblong
bivalve-shell, which seemed permanently open on one side,
and open at the summit to give passage to the crown of ten
tacles. Imagine a shell        like that of a mussel  gaping open, within
which is a quinine bottle, the broad neck protruding, and you
will form    a tolerable idea of the general aspect of this animal
when the tentacles are withdrawn.                I believe    this to be a
new genus,       and also to have an interest beyond novelty,
because furnishing          another decisive argument in favour of
the molluscan nature of the Polyzoa              —a   point still disputed
among naturalists*             The existence of a bivalve-shell is very
important     ; and   I   took pains to convince myself that           it was
really a shell, and not a membranous envelope having the
aspect of a shell     :   submitting the animal to decomposition,            I
found the shell remain behind intact.
   Apropos of Molluscs           : their powers of endurance       are very
remarkable.        Having noticed that they live out of their
native element,         the    water,  for a considerable time, being
often left bare on the rocks by receding tides,                I thought    of
testing their powers in this way.             Accordingly, a Cockle was
placed on my work-table, out of all reach             of damp, in    a  room

where a fire was constantly burning.                   This was on the 10th
of April     ;  not until the 21st was the cockle dead.                 A  small
fish (Ophidium) under similar circumstances died in seven
hours.         Whence     this remarkable           difference    in two gill-
breathing animals       ?    A   question easily asked, but not easily
answered.
    It is true that both animals are aquatic, and both breathe
by gills; but when we come to understand the complex
mechanism of respiration, we               see   various special differences
between the two organisms.                Let us begin with that of the
fish.    M. Flourens      *  has shown that the weight of the soft
leaflets   composing the fish's           gill differs but slightly from
that    of water     ;  so    that when          the animal      is   in water
the slightest force         suffices   to float and separate them, by
which     means     the water        bathes      their    surfaces,    and   the
exchange       of gases takes place.           But no sooner is the fish
brought out of the water than the difference                     between     the
weight of its gills and that of the atmosphere,                   immediately
causes     a collapse     of the former        :   the leaflets,    instead of
floating free in the air, are pressed together, so that only the
external surface of the two outer leaflets are in contact with
the air, and this is obviously too small a surface to suffice
for the whole aeration of the blood                  ;  and the fish dies of
asphyxia.        Add to this cause, the rapid dessication which
ensues     on exposure       to the air, and which we know is an
obstacle to respiration.
    The Mollusc     — our    Cockle for instance — is somewhat differ-

 ently provided.       It   is true the molluscan gills are formed of
 leaflets heavier than the         air  ;  but when we take him from
 the water he closes his shell, and             in that shell a reasonable
 supply of water remains.             But this is not his chief safeguard.
 A  constant exudation from the surface keeps the gills moist,
 and this moisture permits the exchange                 of gases, on which
respiration depends.          It  is this cause which enables the land-
 crabs   to live in the atmosphere,              although their gills are
 formed on the same plan as those of the marine crabs.                      Milne
Edwards has shown that a special reservoir exists which pre
serves the humidity of their           gills.*    In  those Molluscs which
have no supply      of water in their shells to keep the branchiae
floating, there is always a constant moisture to keep them
fit for respiration    ;   and although the respiration must neces
sarily be feebler under such circumstances,                yet we must re
member that the vital changes are not so rapid in its lethar
gic and comparatively simple organism as in that of the fish
    The molluscs do not rank high in the scale of intelligence,
yet even the Oyster seems to be educable                to a small degree.
Milne Edwards relates, that in the great oyster establishments
on the coasts of Calvados,             he learned that the merchants
teach these succulent molluscs to keep their shells closed when
out of the water, by which means they retain the water in
their shells, keep their gills moist, and arrive lively in Paris.
The process is this      :   No sooner is an oyster taken from the
sea than    it closes its shells, and opens them only after a cer
tain time — from "fatigue,"            it is   said, but    more       probably
because the shock       it  received,     and which caused its muscles

to contract,  has passed away.       The men take advantage           of
this to exercise the oysters, and make them accustomed to be
out of water, by removing them daily into the atmosphere,
and leaving them there for longer and longer periods.              This
has the desired    effect ;  the well-educated mollusc keeps         his
shell closed for many consecutive hours,       and as long as the
shell is closed his gills are kept moist.
    The ten days of my Cockle sink into insignificance be
side the astonishing      facts on record.    In Mr Woodward's
valuable    Manual of      the  Mollusca, we read    :
                                                          " The fresh
water molluscs     of cold climates bury themselves             during
winter in the mud of their ponds and rivers                  ; and the
land-snails hide themselves in the ground, or beneath               the
moss and dead leaves.       In warm climates they     become     torpid
during the hottest and driest part of the year.          Those genera
and species which are most subject to this summer sleep are
remarkable for their tenacity of life, and numerous instances
 have been recorded     of their importation from distant coun
 tries in a living state.     In June  1850, a  living pond-mussel
 was sent to    Mr Gray from Australia, which had            been more
 than a year out of water.       The pond-snails have been found
 alive in logs of mahogany from Honduras      : and M. Cailland car
 ried some from Egypt to Paris packed in sawdust.          Indeed,  it is
 noteasy to ascertain the limit of their endurance     ;  for  Mr Laid-
 lay, having placed    a number     in a drawer for this purpose,
 found them alive after five years, although in the warm
 climate of Calcutta.     Mr Wollaston     has told us that speci
 mens   of two Madeira snails survived a fast imprisonment in
 pill-boxes of two years and a half.      But the most interesting

example of resuscitation occurred to a specimen of the desert
snail from Egypt, chronicled        byDr Baird.          This individual
was fixed to a tablet in the British Museum on the 25th
March 1846      ;  and on the 7th March        1850     it was   observed
that he must have come out of his shell in the interval (as
the paper had been discoloured, apparently in his attempt to
get away), but, finding escape impossible, had again retired,
closing his aperture with the usual glistening film            ;  this led
to his immersion in tepid water and marvellous recovery.
He is now (March 13, 1850) alive and flourishing, and has
sat for his portrait."
   The Molluscs, like the heathen idols, have eyes for the
most part, yet        see  not ; organs of hearing, yet hear not           ;
nevertheless, unlike the heathen idols, they are endowed
with these organs for no " make-believe," but for specific
purposes.     A function     there must be, and doubtless a good
one  ; but we speak with large latitude of anthropomorphism
                                     "
when we speak of the " vision of these animals. Molluscan
vision is not human vision       ; nor in accurate       language is     it
vision at all : it is not seeing, but feeling;  it is not   a perception
of objects, but a sensation of light and darkness.         This does not
apply to the Cephalopoda, in which vision seems to be as per
fect as in Fishes   ; nor, on the other hand, does     it apply to those
Bivalves    which have no eyes at all, not even " eye-specs."

 ganglia), attached thereto by a microscopic nerve.                  There is
 no aperture in the skin,         as' there is in ours, through which
 the   rays of light may fall directly on the eye               ; so   that in
 spite of pigment, lens, and nerve — the essential parts of a
 visual organ — vision is utterly impossible            ;  as you may con
 vince yourself even with your own admirable eyes,                 if the lids
 are obstinately closed        over them.        I am aware       that clair
 voyants of the strictly unveracious species, profess to see
with their eyes closed         ;  but our simpler Molluscs have no
such pretensions        ; they have not yet given in to the clair
voyant mania, and are content to submit to those laws of
physics which regulate phenomena with the same unerring
consistency in the world of Naked-gills as in that of Clothed
Noodles.
    A  first requisite in vision is surely the formation                 of an
image    ; and how can this image be formed when the rays have
to pass through the skin and muscles covering the eyes                    ?   A
second requisite is a special ganglion, or centre of sensation ;
and even this is wanting in many cases.                In Pleurobranchus
and    Aplysia     I  find the optic nerve arising from the gan
glion which supplies the antennae           ; and Leydig says the       Doris
lugubris has its small eyes resting immediately                       on the
brain.*      Nevertheless, although these eyes are incompetent
to vision, they represent the early stages of that marvellous
and complex function         ;   they are special organs for the recep-

nothing more likely to hasten his departure than a touch of
Transcendental Anatomy,             I   turned to my friend, and, as               if
resuming the thread of our conversation, remarked, "Yes,                     it is
singular to think of the eye being nothing more than a tactile
organ."      Whereupon White-waistcoat precipitately retreated.
He would not wait to hear the development of that mad pro
position     ;   yet, had he waited, he might have learned that the
eye   is a tactile organ, and that what we call vision is a com
bination of the sensations          of touch, and of temperature of a
specific kind.
   The common notion          is,   that objects are reflected as images
on the retina, and thence, as images, transmitted to the brain.

    the brain ;        on    the   contrary, the thing transmitted                  is a
    sensation, or group of sensations, excited by what is called
    the " image."           The wave of light is translated into a nerve-
    stimulus, the impression excites a sensation                    ; but the sensa
    tion is due to the specific centre, not to the specific stimulus
   of light     ;  as we     know by the fact that any other stimulus,
   such as pressure or electricity, is translated into a precisely
   similar     sensation.        So that even        if  we suppose an image to
   be formed on the retina, as             it is formed in       a camera-obscura,
   it will not     be transmitted to the brain, but               it will excite the
   specific sensations of which the optic centre is alone capable,
  and these will be transmitted.*
      When, a little while ago,             I   said that the formation of an
  image was a primary requisite in vision,                   I meant     that unless
 the rays from an object converged into an image on a proper
  surface,     no distinct        perception of that object could result.
  The reader will not, therefore, suppose that, in throwing
 doubt on the notion of images being formed on the retina, as
 they are formed on the camera-obscura, any attempt                            will   be
 made      to     overthrow      the    optical principles        minutely      estab
 lished by philosophers.                A brief       description of the retina
 and its connections             will   enable us to argue this              point at

layer        ;    it is more accurately described                   as a membraniform
ganglion.               After entering the              eye,   the nerve expands, and
lines the inner surface with a layer of fibres                                 ;   but beneath
this layer is one of cells, not distinguishable                                from those of
the brain, and beneath that, one of granules                               ;       beneath   this
layer, again,              is another of perpendicular                   rods and cones,
known as the " membrane of Jacob."                                 So that we have four
distinct layers, very dissimilar                         in structure, and of course
very different from the optic nerve, which is simply fibrous.
Instead of regarding the retina as composed of layers, how
ever, modern investigators,                       following Kolliker and Heinrich
Miiller, are generally agreed in considering that the fibres of
the optic nerve pass            radially through the retina : thus from
the fibres a            thread passes downwards till it meets a cell of
the vesicular layer, which in turn is in connection with a
granule of the granular layer, which terminates in a cone and
rod     ;   these latter forming the                  real termination of the optic
fibre in the pigment layer of the choroid coat.                                      (See Plate
III.,       fig. 4.)      It    is now universally held that the rods and
cones are the percipients                    of light, which they communicate
to the cells of the vesicular layer, thence to the optic fibres,
and thence to the optic ganglion.                              The point to be borne in
mind in this description                      is,     that the sensitive           part   of   the
retina           is    not the surface on which the light immediately
falls, but             the surface       which        is   in contact with            the black
pigment.

has considerably disturbed the harmony                             which existed on
the subject of the retina, by the publication of a series of
researches, which        led him to the conviction                        that only the
optic fibres of the retina are of nervous structure, the rest
               "           "
being formed of connective   tissue.                              Whatever may be
the issue of the quarrel thus raised,                       it will not          affect    the
points to which          our argument             will       be directed         ;   indeed,
Funke* already suggests that, inasmuch as the function of
the rods and cones is one to which nervous tissue is confess
edly incompetent — namely, the transformation                                 of the wave
of light into that molecular process which takes place in the
conduction of the impression — we may readily admit that
their structure is different.
     From what has been already said, it will be easy to prove
that no images can be formed on the surface of the retina.
In    the first place, the retina, during life, is as transparent as
glass.      The rays of light must therefore pass through                            it,   and
enter the pigment layer, which, being perfectly black, ab
sorbs all rays.        Further,       it   has been proved that the                       optic
fibres are totally insensible to light.                      There       is  a   blind spot
in each     eye.   Would you know the peculiarity of that spot                               ?
It   is   where the optic nerve enters, and where, consequently,
nothing but nerve-fibres exist.                  There       is   also   a   spot in each
eye where the sensitiveness to                    light       is   at its maximum.
anatomists having mistaken connective tissue for nervous tissue in so delicate
a structure as the retina, what will be thought of the grey matter of the spinal
chord being almost entirely formed         of connective       tissue,    with only a very
slight admixture of nerve-cells   ?   Yet this   is   the conclusion     of two independent

               RETINA INSENSIBLE TO LIGHT.                                      347
Would you know the peculiarity of that spot             ?       It   is a mass
of cells, without a continuous surface-layer of fibres.                    After
proving that the fibres are insensible to light, and that no
image is formed where the fibres alone exist, we are called
upon to show that some apparatus exists for the reception
of these rays of light out of which the necessary images are
formed   ;   and to Professor Draper we must turn for the best
hypothesis to aid us.
  Franklin, he reminds us, placed variously-coloured                      pieces
of cloth in the sunlight on the snow.       They were so arranged
that the rays should fall on them equally.             After a certain
period he examined them, and found that the black cloth
had melted its way deeply into the snow, the yellow to a less
depth, and the white scarcely at all.        The conclusion which
he drew has since been abundantly confirmed             ;   namely, that
surfaces become warm      in exact proportion to the depth of their
tint, because the darker the surface the greater the amount of
rays absorbed.     A   black surface, absorbing all rays, becomes
the hottest.     This principle Professor Draper invokes in his
examination of the eye.      The pigment layer       is,    he maintains,
the real optical screen on which the images are formed                :
                                                                           " The
arguments against the retina, both optical and anatomical,
are perfectly unanswerable.         During life   it   is   a   transparent
medium, as incapable of receiving an image as          a    sheet     of clear
glass, or the atmospheric air    itself;   and, aswill be presently
found, its sensory surface     is   its exterior one — that     the       is,
one nearest the choroid coat.        But the black pigment, from
its perfect opacity, not only completely absorbs the rays of

348                      SEA-SIDE          STUDIES.
no matter how faint they may be, but also discharges the
well-known    duty of darkening the interior of the eye. Per
fection of vision requires that the images should form on a
mathematical superficies,           and not in the midst of a trans
parent medium.    The black pigment satisfies that condition,
the retina does not." *
    Now comes the difficulty.              If   the retina is insensible to
the light which passes through            it,it   will    be equally insensible
to the light which, according to some physiologists,                                  is   re
flected from the pigment layer.
    On the other hand, although             the pigment layer                  is   capable
of absorbing light, we cannot suppose               it   also sensitive to            light.
How, then,    is   the luminous                 Professor
                                       sensation produced                  1

a   yellow tint exerting, as has been said, the most energetic
action, and rays which correspond to the extreme                                    red and
extreme violet, the feeblest.            The varied images of external
objects which are thus painted upon the black pigment, raise
its temperature in becoming extinguished, and that in the
order of their brilliancy and colour.                .     .       .   In       this local

structure of the retina, the posterior surface of which                               is   its
sensory surface, and not the anterior, as                it    ought to be,           if   the
explanation usually given of the nature of vision                              is   correct   ;

and, therefore,       as when we pass the       tip of the finger over the
surfaces    of bodies, and recognise cold and warm spaces there
upon, the same process            occurs with infinitely more delicacy
in the    eye.   The club-shaped particles of Jacob's membrane
are truly tactile organs, which communicate to the sensory
surface of the retina the condition               of temperature of the
black pigment."
  It   is worth remarking that the analogy in structure between
the retina and the recently-discovered organs of touch is very
close.*     Professor Draper further insists on the fact that all
                   effects result from high
                                                                             " The
photographic                                         temperature    :
impinging of      a   ray of light on a point raises the temperature
of that point to the same degree as that possessed by the
source from which the ray comes, but an immediate descent
takes place through conduction to the neighbouring particles.
This conducted heat, by reason of its indefinitely lower inten
sity, ceases to have any chemical effect, and hence photo
graphic images are perfectly sharp on their edges.                      It   may
be demonstrated that the same              thing takes place in vision,
and in this respect       it might almost        be said that vision is a
photographic       effect, the receiving surface being a mathema
tical superficies,     acting under the preceding condition.                   All
objects    will therefore       be definite and sharply defined upon            it,
nor can there be anything like lateral spreading.                   If vision
took place in the retina as           a   receiving medium, all objects
would be nebulous on the edges."

 in the pigment becomes a luminous sensation will not be
 difficult,    if,   remembering that the luminous sensation                        is   one
not depending on the specific stimulus of light, but on the
 specific nature         of the optic centre, we follow this change in
its passage from the pigment to the rods and cones of Jacob's
membrane,            which   it   first affects   ;   these are       in direct connec
tion with the ganglionic nerve-cells, in which we may suppose
the nervous impression to be excited;                             this impression         is
thence       transmitted by means of the optic fibres to the optic
ganglion, and there             it    becomes        a   sensation.     This   is   hypo
thetical,    I     admit   ;   but    it   is   the only hypothesis which can
agree      with the present condition of our anatomical knowledge.
Funke has          a   good illustration.            The wave of light, he says,
can no more excite the optic nerve directly, than the pressure
of    a    finger on the air, or the walls of the organ-pipes can
excite musical notes.                The finger produces a tone by pressing
on the keys        ;   each particular key that             is   pressed brings     forth
a     corresponding tone as the air enters the pipe.                           In this
illustration the optic fibres are as the organ-pipes, the rods
and cones of Jacob's membrane as the keys, and the wave of
light as the wave of air.
      The most convincing argument against the retina as the

is,   in my opinion, to be found in the eyes of the Invertebrata,
where the pigment              is   in front    of the retina, instead      of behind
it,   as   in the Vertebrata.          I    have examined this point                with
great care, and the result                  is,   that, although in crabs and
insects,     for instance, radial fibres in connection with the
retina      pass     through        the pigment, and are                consequently

exposed to the light, yet in every case the vesicular and
granular layers and the optic fibres are beneath the pigment.
In    the eye of the Cephalopoda this position of the pigment
has long been a puzzle, and Professor Owen says that                           it must
doubtless be " perforated by the retinal papillae, or otherwise
a perception of light must take place, in a manner incompa
tible with our knowledge of the ordinary mode in which the
retina is affected by luminous                 rays."*     True, but the ordi
nary mode of conceiving the process, we have just seen to be
untenable. When Von Siebold                      says    that the "      mysterious
phenomenon rests only on an imperfect knowledge of the
structure of the organ,"f               he seems to me to forget that the
phenomenon is by no means peculiar to the Cephalopoda, but
is characteristic of the Invertebrata                   generally.        What, for
instance, is the simplest form of an                  eye,  disregarding          those
hypothetical        "eye-specs" which have been noticed in Infu
soria?       It  is that of a pigment spot on a ganglion, or a
nervous expansion.               Ascending        higher     in the scale, and
reaching even the complex structure of the crab's eye, what
do we find but a pigment layer covering the retina                        ?     If cer
tain processes do pass through the pigment from the retina,

seen such perforations.     I have  tried in vain to discover any.     In front of     the
retina there is a delicate membrane,      but it has none of the characteristics      of a
nervous tissue, nor have   I been  able to trace any communication      between    it and
the retina, throuijh the pigment.        Even should    such a communication exist,
the ordinary theory of vision would derive little support from it.

it is very questionable whether                   these are nervous             in struc
ture, and,       if   nervous, they are still only conducting-threads,
insensible to the direct influence of light.                        They are held to
be analogous to the rods and cones                    of the vertebrate retina,
which, as we have seen, receive their stimulus from changes
in the pigment, not directly from the light.                             It   is thus, as
Leydig says, "in the Vertebrata the rods form the outermost
layer of the retina        ;   in the Invertebrata they form the inner
most.        Herewith is connected the fact, which at first seems
so surprising, that the choroideal pigment lies in front                           of the
retina, therefore the contrary of what occurs in Vertebrata."*
In the blind      Crustacea no pigment is present                   ;   and   in Albinos,
in whom the pigment is of lighter colour, vision is imperfect.
If we    remember that, according to the hypothesis, light only
affects the retina after changing the temperature                             of the pig
ment, which change is communicated to the rods and cones,
and thence to the vesicular layer, there                    will    be nothing para
doxical in this inverse arrangement of the retina in Inverte
brata    ;   in both, the process is essentially the same, and the
mere difference         of position is not more than the difference of
the chain of ganglia, which in the Vertebrata is dorsal, and
in the Invertebrata ventral.-f-

difficulty in the way of the hypothesis just expounded,            namely, the existence
in some animals of a strongly reflecting membrane— the tapetum — between the
retina and pigment layer.     do not at all understand the way in which this

     SENSATIONS WHERE NERVES ARE INVISIBLE.                        353
vision is simply the perception of light and darkness.            The
changes    of temperature produced by the absorption of the
rays in their pigment, cannot be elevated into the perception
of an image, because the optical conditions for the formation
of an image are absent        : an indefinite sensation,    resulting
from change of temperature,         is all that they can perceive.
Nay, even were their eyes constructed so as to form optical
images, there is   little doubt that vision, in our human sense,
would still fail them, owing to the absence of the necessary
combination     of tactile sensations      with sensations   of light.
We    see very much by the aid of our fingers.
   Apropos    of tactile sensations,     are those anatomists who
assume the existence of invisible nerves        in parts of the skin
which, although revealing no nerve to the eye, seem to reveal
it to the mind by the manifestation of sensibility, warranted
in such an assumption       ?   Kolliker has shown that there is
no portion   of the skin, however minute, which is not sensi
tive.    But does this prove that every point must be supplied
with a nerve     ?  Admitting that sensibility resides only in
nerve-tissue (which, for my part,        I  doubt, and in the next
Chapter   will furnish my    reasons), I  think another explanation
will  do away   with such an assumption. It is unnecessary that
a nerve-fibre should be directly pressed upon at the imme
diate point of contact of the needle and the skin.         The sensa
tion will equally result if the pressure be communicated at
some distance from the point        of contact.    Strictly speaking,
this is always the case when the cuticle is not pierced.          The
needle presses on the cuticle, and the pressure is communicated

from the cuticle to the nerve      ;  and  it is evident that this
pressure may be lateral as well as perpendicular.          If a nerve
be  within the range of this lateral pressure, it will be affected     ;
and although those parts which        are liberally supplied with
nerves   are necessarily more     sensitive than others,       because
more filaments come    within the range of lateral pressure, yet
 no part of the skin is insensible, because no part is without
 the range of a nerve.
    Having ascertained that our Molluscs cannot          see, we have
 now to inquire whether they can hear.           As in the former
                                                           "
 case, the answer must depend on what is meant by hearing."
 If every sensation of light and darkness is to be called sight,
and every sensation of sound is to be called hearing, our
friends certainly both   see  and hear— as blind men          see, and
deaf men hear.      Let us examine the organ in a Doris or
Pleurobranchus    : instead of the complex structure found           in
higher animals, we find a microscopic           vesicle    containing
pebbles   suspended   in liquid.    In the Doris this vesicle has
 no nerve, but lies upon the cerebroid ganglion, immediately
behind the optic ganglion.        Nor have I, in a dozen dissec
tions, been able to detect a nerve in the Pleurobranchus,
although    Krohn describes      one  in the sub-genus Pleuro-
branchcea.    At  any rate, embryology proves the nerve to be
a subsequent addition, since     in the embryos of all the Nudi-
branchs the ear is a simple vesicle containing a single otolithe,
with neither nerve nor ganglionic attachment.           The mention
of embryological indications reminds me that Von Siebold
has    shown the close     analogy which      exists between the
permanent organ of hearing in the gasteropod Molluscs,

and the transitory form of that organ in the embryo of the
 fish.
     With such an         organ, a mere bag of pebbles              in liquid, only
a slight degree         of that exquisite sense, known by us as Hear
ing, can be claimed by the interesting                     animal which natu
ralists are fond of styling " the humble Mollusc."                           I never
detected any        humility in Molluscs          ;  and   if they seem      humble
in the eyes of haughty ignorance, a little knowledge of their
structure      will    soon remove       that misconception.              It is true,
they give no dinners, and are perfectly regardless of the
higher circles       ;  they trouble themselves very little about any
of the "great movements ;" they do nothing for the "Pro
gress    of the Species ;" leave the Jews unconverted                     ; have no
views on the           "Ballot;" and        are     utterly insensible to the
advantages of "Marriage with a Deceased                           Wife's Sister."
But they have their little world, and are as perfectly con
structed for        it   as we are, who           condescend       to notice and
patronisingly          admire them*           In    that world they do not
need what we need.               They hear nothing of the marvellous
inflections of speech, the tremulous tenderness of affection,
the harsh trumpet-tones of strife, the musical intonations
of mirth.        They cannot hear the prattle of children's voices,
which sends such thrills along our nerves                   ; nor can they hear
the untiring eloquence of a vexed virago, which also sends

thrills, not of so pleasant a nature.    Deafer than the deafest
adder    will they remain, charm we never    so wisely.     Equally
insensible must they be to music.         Beethoven's melodious
thunder, Handel's choral might, Mozart's tender grace, Bel
lini's languorous sweetness, are even more lost on them than
on the lymphatic      dowagers in the grand tier, who chatter
audibly of guipure and the last drawing-room, while Grisi's
impassioned expression, and Mario's cantabile, are entranc
ing the rest of the audience.      The Mollusc can only perceive
noises.     Sounds are by us separately recognisable in their
intensity,    their pitch   (or  note), and their quality.      The
Mollusc     only recognises    intensity— loudness.    A   wave of
sound agitates the otolithes in his ear, and their agitation
communicates to the ganglion a sensation of sound,          loud in
proportion to the agitation.
   Had we no other evidence,       this would suffice to show the
error of the vulgar      conception of hearing.     Sound is not
produced by waves of air striking the drum, these waves
being thence      transmitted   along the auditory nerve to the
brain   ; but the waves agitate the sensory apparatus, which
in its turn acts upon the Sensational Centre.         That is why
sounds are heard with painful distinctness when the sensory
apparatus is affected by other stimuli besides the pulsations
of waves of air.
   Few subjects are of greater interest to the philosophic
mind than the gradual complication of the organ of hearing,
with, of course, its proportional complication of function, in
the animal series.      Even in human beings we     see differences
only less considerable than those which exist between man

and animals.      The ear of one man is utterly incapable of
appreciating those delicate intervals and harmonic combina
tions which give to another exquisite delight.              The bird,
                " Singing of summer in full-throated ease,"
is insensible to music, and probably distinguishes nothing in
speech except the loudness       of the tone.        And this fact may
lead us to question whether           the general notion, so often
insisted on, of the superiority in the senses of animals over
those of man, is not a fallacy.         It   is quite true that a bird
sees  distinctly at greater distances than a man             ; but can   it
see such delicate nuances       of colour    ?   A   dog perceives some
odours to which       we are insensible        ;  but in the immense
varieties of odours we are capable of perceiving, our superi
ority is manifest.       In hearing, animals          are demonstrably
inferior.   Some of them may be as susceptible to certain
sounds,   but none are susceptible to the immense variety of
sounds    distinguishable      by our ears.        Indeed, when     from
Comparative Anatomy we learn how much more complex
are the Sensational      Centres in man, we may be certain that
the sensations also    will  be more various.
   Before quitting our Molluscs, let us for a moment consider
the shells with which the vast majority are furnished, and
with which all are furnished in their embryonic state.                    I
do not mean      that we should lose ourselves in the varieties
of a conchologist's collection, nor that we should inquire
minutely    into the structure        of the shell and its mode
of growth    ;  but    that   we should        pause    to consider    its
relation to the great forces of the universe.              You may pos

sibly look upon that phrase as mere rhetoric                  ; but    it is of
strictly scientific sobriety       ;  and you     will admit it      to be so,
on learning that the mighty ocean-currents mainly depend
on this said mollusc-shell.            Strange, yet true.        Were there
no secreting animals in the          sea capable     of removing from the
water its surplus lime, the stormy winds might agitate                       its
surface,    and rouse its waves like troops of roaring                    lions
shaking back their manes of spray               ; but there would be no
strong currents with beneficent effect             ;  and in a little while
the ocean would become a huge salt-lake.
    Let us rest from our hot hammering, and painful stooping
under ledges, and let us enjoy a few minutes' repose on this
reef, solitary    amid the waves, and distant from the shore.
Pleasant the breeze, pleasant the gentle cadence of the water
at our feet, pleasant the sight of that snowy mass of cloud
which lazily rolls landwards.             It rose from the surface      of this
brilliant, buoyant, volitant sea in airy bubbles of vapour, and
is now travelling       towards those green cornfields over which
the lark is poised in melody.             If the cloud should     there meet
a current of cold air,      it will drop gently down          as rain.    This
rain   will make its way through the earth to rivulets and rivers,
till it finally returns once more to the parent-bed of ocean ; but
on its way     it will have washed        with it various salts, which it
will dissolve and carry to the          sea,  thus adding to the already
saturated sea-water an amount of solid matter such as would
impede its flow, were there no provision ready to restore the
equilibrium.       For    observe,      the rain-cloud,      as  it rose by
evaporation from the          sea,   left behind     it all the  salts which
it contained, and       these would        make the rest of the water

denser        ;   but now the rain-cloud                    returns laden with as much
salt as       it originally           had,     and the very fluidity of the sea is
in peril, for evaporation is incessantly going on, and rivers
are incessantly returning                       laden with lime.                What becomes
of this excess of lime                 ?     Polypes and Molluscs, Crustacea and
Fish, but mainly the two former, clutch hold of                                       it,   wring   it
from the water, and mould                         it  into habitations for themselves.
It   is   thus that vast coral islands and oyster-beds are formed.
The       sea      is   a   great lime-quarry           ;   but the lime         is   arranged in
beautiful forms, and subserves                         a   great organic end.           Not only
are animals thus furnished with houses and solid structures,
but the water, relieved of its excess,                             is        enabled to flow in
mighty currents.                   This      is   the theory propounded by Lieu
tenant Maury in his fascinating book*                                  Assuming the waters
of the sea to be in               a    state    of perfect equilibrium, the animals
would, by their secretion of salts from                                it,   produce currents       :
" The Mollusc, abstracting the solid matters, has
                                                  by that act
destroyed the equilibrium of the whole ocean, for the specific
gravity of that portion of water from which this solid matter
has been abstracted                   is   altered.        Having lost         a   portion of its
solid contents,              it   has become           specifically lighter than             it   was
before     ;      it    must, therefore,            give place to the pressure which
the heavier water exerts to push                              it   aside, and occupy its
place     ;       and   it   must consequently travel about and mingle
with the waters of the other parts of the ocean, until its
proportion of solid matter                     is   returned to        it                         The
sea-breeze              plays upon the surface                ;   it   converts only fresh
water into vapour, and leaves the solid matter behind.                                            The

surface   thus becomes             specifically heavier,                     and sinks.      On
the other hand, the little marine architect below, as he works
upon his coral edifice at the bottom, abstracts from the water
there a portion of its solid contents                        ;   it therefore          becomes
specifically lighter, and up              it   goes, ascending to the top                  with
increased velocity to take the place of the descending column,
which, by the action of the winds, has been sent down loaded
with fresh food and materials for the busy little mason in
the depths below."
   Was    I   not justified in saying that the Mollusc was deeply
interesting in its relations to the great forces of the Universe ?
Does not this one example show how the great Whole is
indissolubly connected with its minutest parts                                ?    The simple
germination of a lichen             is,

linked with the grandest astronomical phenomena                                   ;   nor could
even an infusory animalcule be annihilated without altering
the equilibrium       of the universe.

     BETWEEN ORGAN AND FUNCTION— CONCLUSION.
The juvenile naturalist is often instructed in the facile art
of catching birds by first dropping a pinch of salt upon their
tails.     Excellent   as this plan seems,        it has never proved
perfectly successful, owing to a trifling initial difficulty.           If,
in your halcyon days, you have ever made the attempt, what
will your thoughts      be on hearing that an intense philosopher,
like the present writer, did actually imitate that attempt in
capturing the Razor-fish (Solen)          ; positively carrying a paper
of salt, in the firm confidence of dropping some grains on the
tail of that retiring mollusc      ?   Nay, what     will you think on
hearing that this was not only attempted in all seriousness,
but in all seriousness succeeded        ?
   The shells of the Solen lie scattered           on the sands of all
our bays, and are familiar to every sea-side visitor.               They
are not    unlike razor-handles, and as every marine animal is
called a fish, the Solen is hence named Razor-fish, although,
in truth, a bivalve mollusc.         Few persons, except naturalists,

   have seen the animal alive.        He bores     a hole many feet in
   the sand, and there passes his days, like the Pholas in             the
   rock,   never coming to the surface,         and boring out of all
  reach when disturbed.          The difficulty of getting at him is
  obvious, and may lead you to be sceptical          of the salting plan.
  Surely, you    will argue, the initial difficulty which discourages
  the ornithological      ardour of the boy must equally frustrate
  the philosopher     ; since, if the Solen   will allow himself to     be
 approached near enough to have his tail salted, he may                 be
 taken without this saline preliminary.               Thus   reasons  the
 reader,    not without astuteness      ;  yet, like many other      rea
 soners, he    will find that a priori deductions, however       elegant,
 frequently pass over the head of Fact.              Instead, therefore,
 of arguing what must be, let him come with me, and                   see
 what is.      He will find that the Solen must first be salted,
ere he suffer himself to be approached.
     It is a hot, quiet afternoon.        The tide is out, and a wide
sweep of sand lies before us.         We are armed with thin iron
rods, each barbed at the end        like a harpoon     ; we add thereto
a   paper of salt, basket, and jar.       Over the yielding     sand we
pass,    until we approach low-water        mark, and then we begin
peering about to find the trace of the Solen.                 This trace
consists of nothing more than two small holes close together,
sometimes      broken into one, and presenting very much the
appearance of the key-hole of a writing-desk.            An experienced
eye detects     the trace with an unerring         sagacity marvellous
to the stranger, for the sand is perforated by holes of all
sizes.     The amateur may, however, ascertain which are the

                         SOLEN HUNTING.                                 363
and, after a few trials, he     will gradually learn to      detect them.
If he  have an iron rod, about as      thick as a steel-pen-holder,
let him place the point in the hole, and            if   the hole be the
retreat of a Solen, the rod will pass some distance by its own
weight.     If  any force be required to push             it through the
sand, he may be tolerably sure that he is at a wrong hole.
It is in this way that fishermen habitually catch the Solen                ;
and the amateur      will find that considerable dexterity is re
quired to use the rod with effect.           It  must be suffered        to
drop by its own weight        till the fish  be felt   ;   then, by a half
turn of the rod, the harpoon end fixes the shell, and the
animal may be drawn up.              Having repeatedly tried, and
ignobly failed,   I could    not help admiring the dexterity with
which my companion whipped them up, one after the other,
scarcely ever missing      ;  nor would my amour propre suffer
me to quit the sands,      until  I had acquired sufficient skill to
bring up a fish in about every three trials.             This is the legi
timate mode.      It  is the only one      I find recorded in books         ;
and from what Professor E. Forbes says,            I  conclude    it is the
 only one known to naturalists.
   But any one who hunts these Solens for sport, and is less
greedy of time than of amusement,             will say that this mode
sinks into insignificance beside the Jersey plan of " salting
 their tails."   Having found a hole, we know that the Solen
is at some distance underneath            ;  it may      be only    a few
inches,   it may   be many feet.        The least disturbance          will
drive him irretrievably        away.    We must, therefore,          allure
him.    Placing a pinch of salt over the hole, we await the
result.    In  a minute or     two the water begins to well up             ;

 364                     SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
 this is succeeded by a commotion — the sand is upheaving —
 we hold our breath, and keep the hand ready to make a
 swift clutch — a final      upheaval has taken place,           and the
 Solen slowly shows the tip of his siphon               ;  but he is still
 buried in the sand, and we must wait               till   he has thrust
 himself at least an inch above ground, or we shall lose him.
 It  may be that, having        come     thus far, he      will suddenly
change his mind, and, instead          of advancing, make a preci
pitate retreat.       But if he raise himself an inch out of his
hole, and you are swift, he is your prize.           Sometimes, when
clutched, he clings so firmly to the sand, that you break the
shell or pull      it  out, and   see  half the torn body remain
behind.      At   other times he     will not appear        at all. You
have salted his hole, and after witnessing             the preliminary
commotions, you         are nevertheless balked, for he retreats
deeper and deeper, and his hole falls in.              It   thus appears
that salting his tail does not necessarily imply a capture               ;
and   it is this uncertainty which gives        a relish to the sport.
Often when he has appeared          at the hole,   it is merely to    see
what is the matter, and to indulge in a not altogether frivo
lous curiosity as to the being who can illogically offer salt
to  him who lives in salt water        ;   and he likes your appear
ance so little, that one glance is enough        — he is off again like
a   shot.    Two of them comported themselves                 in a very
singular manner.        They came to the opening, and defiantly
throwing      their heads at our feet, retired again in haste.
Did they imagine we should be satisfied with such an offer
ing ?     I picked   up their heads, and moralised.
    There is something irresistibly         ludicrous     in grave men

stooping over a hole         — their coat-tails pendant in the water,
their breath suspended,            one hand holding             salt, the other
alert to clutch the victim — watching the perturbations of the
sand,    like hungry cats beside the holes of mice                   ;  and there
is something very absurd in the aspect of the queer Solen,
poking up his inquisitive              person   ;   though why he is thus
lured by the salt,         I  cannot guess.          That he does not like
the salt, is pretty certain, from his spontaneous                   decapitation
under the infliction ;* but why this should lure him is not
intelligible.       In  conclusion, let me notice a passage in                  Mr
Woodward's         book, which not only contains an error, but
implies that the salting mode of capture is not known even
to well-informed          naturalists.      "Professor E. Forbes," he
         " has immortalised
says,                              the sagacity of the razor-fish, who
submits to be salted in his hole, rather than expose himself
to be caught, after finding the enemy is lying in wait for
him."-f-      I   suppose     the "sagacity"           was    immortalised      by
Forbes in one of his playful moods                ;  because not only is the
fact on which          the inference rests            inaccurate, the       Solen
readily coming to his captor              ; but the Solen can have only
slender pretensions to mental vigour of any kind.
    Indeed, we are incessantly at fault in our tendency to
anthropomorphise, a tendency which causes us to interpret
the actions of animals according to the analogies of human
nature.       Wherever       we    see   motion which           seems to issue
   * Strictly
              speaking, the Solen has no head at all.      What is called the head,
in the text, is simply the siphonal tubes, which are formed of muscular rings,
placed longitudinally.    In dissecting  the Solen   I  found these lings spontane
ously separate themselves in the water.

 from    some    internal   impulse,   and not      from      an obvious
 external cause, we cannot help attributing            it to " the will."
 No one seeing a bird snap at a fly with its beak, could
 doubt that the movement was voluntary             ;   but   if  the bird's
 head were cut off, and the beak          continued to snap, would
 not this throw a serious doubt on the voluntary                  nature of
 the former action     ?  Yet this is what occurs with the curious
                                                " of the Corkscrew
 avicularium,      or " bird's-head process
 Coralline   : an animal doubtless familiar to many readers,
 some of whom have mistaken         it for a Polype,      it being indis
tinguishable from a Polype by the naked eye (Plate                     VII.,
fig. 4), although the microscope,       revealing its internal struc
ture, shows     it to  be a Polyzoon.      The stem is twisted into
a corkscrew shape, sufficiently remarkable to attract atten
tion in rock-pools, or in tanks.           On examining it atten
tively,  it is generally   seen to be furnished      with a number of
processes resembling vulture-heads — one beneath each cup —
having two        mandibles, one fixed,     the   other movable by
means     of two sets of muscular fibres, visible within the
head   ; and these mandibles keep up an incessant snapping,
which     occasionally entraps some        worm,       or minute Crus
tacea,   in an inexorable      grasp.     Very interesting it is to
 watch these birds' heads snapping with vague vigour, while
above them the animals, to which they can scarcely be said
to belong, are protruding from their cups            ;  for, be   it noted,
the bird's head does not form part of the animal, but issues
from the stem on which the colony of animals abides                  ; as  if
a gentleman residing      in the parlour kept a watch-dog chained
to his area gate.      The position of this "                "

ally led to the question, Is it an organ, or a parasite              ?    The
invariability of the position, and there being never more
than one bird's head to each animal, seem to point to its
being an organ   ;  but  if   so,   what can be its function           ?   Mr
                                                              " Several ob
Gosse has suggested        an     ingenious answer        :
servers have noticed the seizure           of small roving animals by
these pincer-like beaks     ;  and hence the conclusion is pretty
general that they are in some way connected with the pro
curing of food.     But it seems to have been forgotten, not
only that these organs have no power of passing the prey
thus seized to the mouth, but also that this latter is situated
at the bottom of a funnel of ciliated tentacles, and is calcu
lated to receive   only such minute prey as is drawn within
the ciliary vortex.    I venture       to suggest a new explanation.
The seizure of a passing animal, and the holding it in the
tenacious grasp until    it   dies, may be the means           of attracting
the proper prey to the vicinity of the mouth.                 The presence
of decomposing animal matter in water invariably attracts
crowds of infusory       animalcules,         which     then breed       with
amazing rapidity, so as to form a cloud of living atoms
around the decaying body quite visible in the aggregate to
the unassisted eye   ; and these remain in the vicinity, play
ing round and round until the organic matter is quite con
sumed."*
   The animalcules thus attracted would be whirled into the
animal's mouth by means of its ciliated tentacles, and thus
the bird's head would be ancillary             to the capture of food.

  368                   SEA-SIDE      STUDIES.
 Mr   Gosse's explanation    will equally hold good if the bird's
 head be a parasite,   as  I incline to think it is ; for not only is
 it often   absent  from the very species on which           it is com
 monly found, but       it has independent      action  : last year    I
  separated one from the stem on which          it was fixed, never
 theless the snapping continued as long as          I was   enabled to
  watch it.   One is naturally reminded of the analogous          Pedi-
 cellaria of the Star-fish.
     Whatever may be the conclusion respecting these birds'
 heads,   the action of the bird being thus closely imitated
 puts us on our guard against the tendency to attribute
 psychological motives to the actions of animals.               Indeed,
 unless we have       previously    assured   ourselves of identity,
 or at least great similarity of structure, we shall always
 be  in error when concluding an identity of function.             Thus
 in the last Chapter we saw how improbable is the sup
 position   that the lower animals feel pain, in spite of our
 admission that all animals possess Sensibility.          And every
 where the study of Comparative Anatomy teaches us, that
 before   we can   truly understand the Physiology           and Psy
 chology    of animals, we must acquire the most minute
knowledge of their structure.         Much has already been done
in this direction, but much more remains to do.                There is
still work for thousands of laborious            students   ;  and all
genuine work     will aid the   science  in its progress.      Only let
men observe with patient zeal, and forego the temptation to
say they have seen what they have not seen, but what, from
the report of others, they expected          to  see  (a temptation
which leads to the continuance of error more than any other

both to what is old and to what is new, equally deterring
them from lightly supporting                 a current assertion, and from
lightly promulgating              a novel assertion, — only let this               be
done, and the humblest workers                    will bring their quota to
the general fund.            How much remains to be done may be
gathered from the fact that, in the nervous system, which
has been studied more than any other, recent investigations
have led me to some unexpected results which, unless                                 I
greatly      deceive      myself,     must      profoundly      modify current
 theory, and must assuredly modify our anatomical state
ments.*
     We laugh at the German who is said " to construct the
Idea of the Camel out of the depths of his moral conscious
          "
ness    ;   yet we are often really little better when we persist
in constructing the forms of the simpler animals according
to the analogies of our own structure, instead of directly                        ob
serving what Nature presents                 to us.     No sooner do we per
ceive certain manifestations               of Sensibility, than we at once

little or no knowledge      of the nervous    structure, is only surpassed    by the
facility and confidence    with which men attribute phenomena          to electricity.
It  may be well, therefore,   to state that our knowledge of the nervous system
is at present in its infancy   ; we have   not even established   a secure basis ; we
have not established    the primary data.    To quote the emphatic language of one
who has given    his life to this subject:    " Our  knowledge   even of the coarser
framework of the nervous system is still too much in its infancy to permit us
to venture, with any success, on tho construction of theories respecting the
functions of its various elements." — Stilling, Ueber den Ban der Nerven-primi-

 a glimpse    of a nervous system, than we at once conclude it to
 be similar    in structure with our own.        In  like manner, Con
 tractility is supposed       to imply the presence of a muscular
 system   ; and the muscles of the lowest animals are supposed
 to be only minuter forms of the same organs found in man.
 But direct study of Nature assures us that there may be
 Sensibility without nerves, and Contractility without mus
 cles ; it further     assures us that the nervous and muscular
 structures, when present, differ greatly in different forms          of
 the animal series      ;  and that we must understand these        dif
 ferences   if   we would understand Physiology.            The law   of
unity of composition, when rightly understood, is a guide of
great value     ;  but   it is too often  a  will-o'-wisp, luminously
misleading.         We get into       the habit    of naming organs
according to a general idea of their functions, instead               of
keeping the idea of special function dependent on special
organ constantly before us.            What would be said of a man
who called his gig a gondola, his steamer a railway, his
carriage a wheelbarrow         ?   The general function of all these
things is the same, but the special office of each differs from
that of the others, and its structure bears reference to such
specialty.        In like manner a " proboscis " is not a " hand,"
although both are prehensile           organs  ;  nor are   contractile
fibres " muscles," although both subserve the same general
function.
    Descending       from these     abstract  considerations    to the
particular      subject     now   before  us,  namely,    the  nervous
system,     we note first, that minute and laborious as the
researches have been, they have seldom             taken the direction

minute and extensive comparisons of the various specialties
of nervous tissue               ;    and the reason has been that men have
assumed         a nerve to be always                   of one structure, a ganglion

   When        I   first examined the nervous system of the                                Doris
and Pleurobranchus,                       I   was surprised to find the brain               (oeso
phageal ganglia) of an orange-red,                           and yellow colour, instead
of white or grey.                The fact is familiar to anatomists, but the
explanation given is more than questionable.                                      Von Siebold
attributes         it to pigment                 scattered     through          the investing
sheath  (neurilemma) and crowded on the surface of the
ganglion ;
           * and Owen assimilates this pigment to " an
arachnoid membrane                    between the dense outer membrane and
the ganglions."           "f*        These explanations are easily disproved.

pressing out the contents,                     I   found that the colour was not
due to pigment           in the membrane, but to the contents of the
ganglion, both cellular and liquid                      ;    and by careful pressure,

was the starting-point                         of a long series of investigations.
Finding the contents of the ganglion were coloured, I in
ferred that the coloured spots, irregularly distributed                                over
the upper portion of the nerve-trunks, and throughout the
bands connecting the ganglia into a collar, were also due to
ganglionic cells                ;   this being proved,       it followed that the cells
and granules of the ganglion were not anatomically separable
from the cells and granules of the nerves; instead of the
ganglion being a distinct structure from that of the nerve,
the two were identical, the only difference                              being that the
cells, both large and small,                       which predominated in the gan
glion,         became scarcer               as the nerve was prolonged, and               at
last only made their appearance                            by ones and twos, amid
the granular mass.
    Let us pause a moment to consider the theoretical diffi
culty which is raised by such a fact.                              Hitherto all physi
ologists have agreed in crediting the ganglion with the sole
production,          and the nerve with the sole conduction of nerv
ous force (whatever that may be).                             The ganglion has been
likened to a galvanic battery, the nerve to a conducting wire.
But     if,   as
               I     affirm, the structure of the two be thus identical,
their function cannot be so different.                           In   those animals pos
  * The error        is   probably owing to        a   generalisation from the fact that in
many animals the pigment               is   distributed over the membrane.   LEYDIG (Unsto

 ence,*    it is allowable to        assume a corresponding difference                  in
 function      ;  but with regard to the molluscs here referred to
 (namely, the genera Doris, Pleurobranchus,                       Aplysia, Solen,
and Limax), this structural difference                       does not exist        :  the
nerve is but a continuation of the ganglion, the whole form
ing one tube, through which, by a little pressure,                            the con
tents of the ganglion may be pressed out of the cut end of
the nerve.           If  only one example of such an arrangement
could be found,           it would    suffice to unsettle the whole theory
of nervous action, as at present understood.                            The battery
and wire can therefore no longer serve as a comparison                            ;  and
the theory of conduction needs revision.
     It may      readily be imagined that the doubt thus raised, left
me no peace.            I   dreamt of ganglia and their prolongations.

examination, the facts required by the doctrines were not
discoverable, but, in lieu thereof, facts altogether opposed
to them.
      A   passage from Professor               Sharpey, one of the latest, and
assuredly one of the best anatomical authorities, will present
the views held on this subject.    " When
                                            subjected to the
microscope,       the nervous substance is seen to consist of two
different structural elements                 — viz. fibres and   cells or vesicles.
The fibres are found universally in the nervous chords, and
they also constitute the greater part of the nervous                       centres          ;
the cells or vesicles,            on the other hand, are confined,                  in a
great measure, to the cerebro-spinal centre and the ganglia,
and do not exist          in the nerves properly so called, unless it
be at their peripheral                 expansions in some of the organs of
special     sense."*          According         to my observations, the fore
going statements are contradicted on the following points                                   :
1st, Nervous          chords exist in abundance               absolutely without
fibres.     2d,   The nervous centres                of some vertebrates             are
without fibres.          3d, Cells do exist         in the nerves.
      The physiologist          will   read    with surprise of the absence of
fibres in the nerves, which are universally held to be simply
fasciculi of fibres       ;   and, indeed, the discovery so much sur
prised me at first, that           it was long       before   I   could persuade
myself     it was no optical illusion, or the result of disintegra
tion in the nerve itself; but having examined both fresh and
prepared specimens, in great quantities,                  I   affirm, that      in the
genera     Doris, Pleurobranchus, Aplysia, Solen, and Limax,
the nerves are for the most part totally destitute of fibres.

 I incline     to think that in the               Doris no fibre           can be found
 anywhere       ;   but as all such negatives are perilous,                       I  simply
 state what       I have     seen, namely, that             for the most part the
 nerves are fibreless.*
    Within the investing sheath of areolar tissue -f is                                    con

 large and small, but not one primitive nerve-fibre.                                   If we
 compare the structure             of the nerves in the Doris with that
in the garden Snail, we shall immediately perceive the dif
ference, the latter animal having                   distinctly fibrillated nerves,
the former nothing but amorphous nerve-substance.                                   At    first
it occurred to           me that the granular                   structure might be
peculiar to the molluscs without shells                     ;  but the bivalve Solen
and the Aplysia contradict such a suggestion.
    Again, in the brains of several Tritons, or Water-Newts,                                  I

that of an adult Toad              ;   none in that of the adult Pipefish
   * Dr Inman, of Liverpool, informs me, while these sheets are passing through
the press, that he has examined         the nervous     system   of  three  very fine speci
mens of Dendronotus arborescent          in which he finds precisely the disposition          I
have described    :  "The    nervous    masses were made up        of very  largo   cells,  ilo
inch in diameter, full of granular matter, and surrounded by a thick coat of
granular material of a brownish colour.             These were most numerous            in the
four large ganglia, but were found sparingly in the main nervous trunks. Some
cells or vesicles were much smaller than others, the smallest about iiT of an
inch. The nervous trunks were filled with granular matter, in which no appear
ance of fibrillation   could   be traced, but on squeezing         out the neurine it was
found that there was an abundant supply of vesicles of various sizes, as well as
of granular matter.     In  one main tube at some distance          from the ganglia there
was a faint appearance     of fibres which were very small in length and breadth,
and quite solid."     This last fact is very interesting, and agrees with what                I
have noted further on     of the dragon-fly     larvae.
   t It may not be unnecessary       to warn the amateur who may verify these obser
vations, not to confound     the fibres   of the investing    sheath with nerve-fibres.

  (Syngnathus) ; none in that of a Dogfish (Acanthias) of
  about a foot and a half long. It would be perilous to assert
  that there were absolutely no fibres in the brains of these
  animals, but      if there    were any, they must have been exceed
 ingly rare, as      I  could not find one        :  and theory requires that
 there should be one or more for every cell.*
     These facts are important as well as novel, and force us to
 the conclusion that fibres are not necessary to the conduc
 tion of nerve-force, although they may be special organs of
 conduction, wherever they exist.                   The point to which the
 reader's attention is required is that nerve-force can be trans
 mitted —that nerve-actions can take place — in the absence
 of primitive fibres.            This might have been concluded from
 the structure of the olfactory nerve alone, which, by a re
 markable peculiarity, shows a break in the continuity of its
 fibres,   the intervening          space being occupied             with granules
 only.     This is the case in all animals.-|-               And I find a still
 greater break in the sympathetic nerve of the new-born
 puppy.       As the trunk is about to join the ganglion, the
 fibres disappear,        and give place to granules               ;   nor do fibres
 appear     in the ganglion at all.J               Now, as theory requires

applicable to those fish and reptiles   I have examined.

and by a fibre from the cell, we                         see    at once that the foregoing
facts, or any one                of them, must strike at the root of such a
theory, nervous impressions being indubitably transmitted
where no fibres exist, and where a solution of continuity exists.
      Since these              observations          were first              published,             I    have

that the theory of conduction                                  is    held         by authoritative
physiologists          ;    it will      be useful,            therefore,          to show that              I
was not combating an exploded error.                                    In England Dr Todd
certainly        holds place             in the highest ranks                        ;   and in 1856
he thus wrote              of softened brains              :

imperfectly           generates the nervous force, and the fibrous
matter becomes a bad conductor                                        it,   or even               non-con

all the sympathetic nerves of           a   now-born     kitten.      Let       me add that, except         in

 state  of science will fail to see the importance of such a result.
     In the first place, it does away    with many of the difficul
 ties which have puzzled anatomists when unable to trace
 fibres to their termination in cells.        In the  second place,  it
 may throw light on the startling           discovery of M. Brown-
 Sequard, that the transmission          of impressions along the
 spinal chord is not due to the fibres of the posterior columns,
 nor indeed to the fibres of either of the columns, but entirely
 to the grey matter of the chord.         The astonishment excited
 by this discovery, which utterly destroys the doctrine pro
 mulgated by Sir Charles Bell, and accepted            by all Europe,
 seems so to have absorbed       attention that its effect upon the
general theory of nervous transmission has escaped remark.
A    few sentences may put the reader in possession of the capi
tal points in this discovery.
    The spinal chord is composed of six columns of fibres, and
a central mass     of vesicular matter    ; two of the columns are
called the anterior, two posterior, and two lateral.         Imagine
a bundle    of six sticks enclosing a mass of pith, and a rude
conception of the arrangement of these              columns   will  be
formed.     When Sir Charles Bell came forward with his views,
the almost universal opinion was that the spinal chord was a
large nerve-trunk,      presiding, like other nerve-trunks,       over
both sensibility     and motion.      Every one knew that there
were nerves of sensation and nerves          of motion  ; but no one,
 till Lamarck,    seems to have conceived       that this diversity of

                                              says,
                                                     " qui sont destines
aux mouvemens musculaires, ils partent vraisemblablement
d'un autre foyer, et constituent, dans le systeme nerveux, un
systeme particulier distinct des sensations,            comme ce dernier
est du systeme     qui sert aux actes de l'entendement."*               In the
same year Alexander Walker, passing from this vague concep
tion to a definite localisation of the different centres, declared
that the sensory impressions were due to the roots of the
nerves issuing from the anterior columns, and motor impres
sions to the roots issuing from the posterior columns.                     But
although this was a felicitous hypothesis,            it  rested on no co
ercive evidence, experimental or pathological                 ;  and in 1811
Bell f demonstrated        that it was the posterior root which was
sensitive, the anterior which was motor.                This discovery has
been universally accepted.          It placed    Bell at once among the
great names in science.         But this discovery, which was sup
ported by ample and decisive experiments,              led him and others
to a conclusion respecting the columns              of the chord which,
although extremely plausible, was not founded on decisive
evidence, and is now proved by Brown-Sequard                        to be alto
gether erroneous.        The roots which issue from the posterior
columns are sensory       ;  what more natural than to suppose that
the  columns themselves          must be sensory?               Natural,   but
erroneous.      While the discovery respecting the roots met
with little opposition, the deduction respecting the columns
was   vehemently criticised.            Experiments        were instituted
which gave a mass of conflicting testimony, curious to consider.

Everybody contradicted everybody.                         Vivisection        seemed a
snare.      It   was Longet who put an end to the controversy by
explaining how the discrepancies                    necessarily arose, and by
establishing a uniform plan of employing galvanism as the
test* The doctrine of Bell, as modified by Longet, became
the
       " doctrine of the schools." It is briefly this : All the phe
nomena       of reflex action depend               on the vesicular substance,
which is itself entirely removed                 from the phenomena of sen
sation or motion.               The power of transmitting                 impressions
resides entirely         in the white, fibrous substance,                 and of this
the posterior columns are exclusively devoted                         to sensory      im
pressions,       the   anterior and lateral columns exclusively to
motor      influences.         An impression is carried                 to the     brain
by the posterior columns only                  ;  and  from      the brain by the
antero-lateral columns only                :  the one awakens            a sensation,
the other a movement.
     After having            devoutly believed this             theory for many
years, we are called upon to acknowledge that                         it is wrong in
every particular.              In   the presence        of many distinguished
physiologists M. Brown-Se'quard has demonstrated                              that   sen
 sibility, so far from being destroyed, is actually increased                          by
 section of the so-called sensitive columns                 ;  while, on the other
 hand, when a section of the chord was made which divided
 it everywhere except in these " sensitive columns," sensibility
 was totally destroyed.            He proved, moreover, that it is the grey
 vesicular substance of the chord — itself perfectly insensible                        —
 which transmits both sensory and motor impressions.                                   He

proved this in various ways, the most conclusive being                       a com
plete    section of all the white fibrous substance,                    which left
only the grey substance         : in this case sensibility and motion
remained intact.         No part of the white substance is capable
of transmitting                           " C'est            la substance

    There are several       points in M. Brown-Se'quard's                    experi
ments which disturb the reigning doctrine of nerve-action, but
he has not yet published his positive views on this subject                           ;
and as    it is  a subject   of which      I   have no direct knowledge,
I  shall only say that the facts             I  have discovered,            proving
fibres not to be necessary to the transmission of impressions,
must be taken into account, not only in this, but in most
other questions of the kind.
    But before we proceed further it will be requisite to ascer
tain, as far as possible, whether the facts                   I have discovered
had been already made public.                When Europe furnishes its
hundreds of diligent workers in any department, no one can
expect to stand       in isolated originality         ;  he must be prepared
to find that others have more or less anticipated him.                         I had
no sort of doubt that the facts, which to me were full of
significance, must have been observed by others                       ;  but  I  was
persuaded that no one had seen their significance, because no
 one expressed         a doubt respecting the theory which                      they

nerves stated as a fact, though without specific information
either respecting their discoverer or the animals                        in which
they existed; and without a hint                  of any physiological signi

     On procuring the memoirs referred to,+                I    found the fullest
confirmation of my own observations, but no appreciation of
their physiological significance.                 Muller and Gegenbaur say:
"Distinct fibres          are not discoverable            in the trunks, which
appear to consist          of nothing but          a   clear granular streaky
substance (aus einer            lzellen~ streifigen                     Substanz).
In      some   instances there were small groups                    of ganglionic
cells."     And this      is   all they remark.
     Meissner's observations are given                 in greater detail, and
appear to have suggested               doubts, as analogous observations
did to me.       " The four trunks,"          he says,

course soon melt into          a   homogeneous         band    in which no trace

conduction from the periphery to the centre must take place
by some other means than that of a completely isolated and
throughout equally constructed fibre." * On reading this
sentence,     I  fancied that the same idea must have occurred to
him as to me, and that he would follow it up by some further
observations, or at any rate by some physiological reflections.
Two years later, however,           he published      another Memoir,f
wherein he notices this peculiarity of the nerve-trunks                      as
" certainly very important for the physiology of the nervous

not be regarded as trunks, as anatomical bundles of isolated
fibres, but as peculiar and intermediate conducting organs
interposed        between   the central    organ and the peripheral
nerves.      If they    are really to be regarded as simple nerve-
trunks, in the sense in which the word is used as respects
higher animals, we ought to find them composed of fibres —
which is not the case."          I need  scarcely criticise such a sug
gestion   ;  the mere fact of a sympathetic ganglion being con
nected   with a nerve which, although fibrous, has its inter
space   of granules, is enough to destroy the hypothesis                ; not

to mention the fact of so many animals being without fibres
at   all*
    From what has been already said, the conclusion is inevit
able that the conduction               of nerve force        does not take        place
by means       of fibres only.          The fibres may by special organs
of conduction, and as special organs, a corresponding specialty
of function must be assigned to them                    ;  and into this we must
now inquire.
    Let us assume that the homogeneous                       nerve transmits the
impression in a mass, just as the sounding-board of a piano,
if   struck, will yield a certain resonance                    ;  but the fibrous
nerve    will transmit the impression along                   each separate        fibre,
like the sounding-board when struck by keys                        ;  the amount of
nervous impression and the amount of sound in each case
may be equal, but the varieties and combinations possible to
 the latter are impossible to the former.                    Or to vary the illus
 tration, let us assume two men to be equally susceptible to
 the general       effect    of colour, but one of them, an artist, to
 have more susceptibility to the minute differences                        of colour     ;
 although the nervous impression may be equal in the two,                               it
 will be less homogeneous             in the artist, whom we may suppose
 to have a more specialised              retina.
     The assumption that fibres are organs of conduction at all,
 may be disputed          ;  nor,   if  what was previously said respect-
    * Meissner's  observations   furnish a very noticeable fact, namely,       that while
 in Mermis Albicam the trunks are homogeneous,             in another species, Alermis
 nigruceru, they are fibrous   !   In  the face of such   evidence   no single exception
 to the facts  I have stated would surprise me — for instance,       that fibres could bo
 found in a Doris, a Pleurobranchus, an Ajilysm,          or a Solen — such exceptions
 would in nowise invalidate my conclusions,        for which, indeed, one single case
 of non-fibrillated nerve would be ample evidence.

                    FUNCTION           OF THE        FIBRES.                   385
ing the identity of cell and fibre, in ultimate structure, and
of the identity of ganglion and tube, be admitted, can we
allow the old hypothesis of conduction to be more than a
metaphor.         The notion of an actual conduction taking place,
analogous to         the     conduction      of electricity, is extremely
doubtful to me.           If  the nerves are identical          in elementary
structure with the ganglia, and consequently must participate
in the functions of the ganglia, they can no longer be re
garded as the conducting-rods of the battery, but as essential
parts of it.      In  our present ignorance of the true process we
may continue to employ the metaphor                    of conduction, if we
understand by        it simply the       change     which follows when a
nerve    is affected     ;  and we may then gain some glimmering
of the special function of the fibres, and the meaning of their
increase     with old age.        Nerve-tissue in its earliest stage is
wholly without fibres          ; as development advances,             the fibres
multiply*         In old      age the brain        hardens from excess of
fibres, as the bones harden from excess of lime                  ; so that what
originally constituted a source of strength becomes a source
of weakness.         Probably to this predominance of fibres may
be assigned the incapacity of acquiring new ideas                    in old age.
Intellectual vigour is often manifested by men of a very ad
vanced age, but the vigour is shown               in dealing with old trains

When the fibres first make their appearance in the brain, I know not, but in
the brains of a new-born puppy and kitten     I could find no trace of them.    In
deed,  the naked eye showed      that no differentiation had as yet taken place
between the grey and white matter ; and the Microscope,       with a power of 750
linear, confirmed this impression,   the structure of both grey and white matter
being wholly vesicular and granular.

of thought, not in originating new.             To   assume a new atti
tude of thought,      it may   be necessary to develop new fibres           ;
and this cannot be done in a tissue already too fibrous.                  A
similar hypothetical explanation suggests             itself for the for
mation of fixed ideas, monomanias,           habits, and tendencies.
    But  I will not venture    further into this hypothetical region        ;
the few anatomical facts hitherto ascertained presenting too
narrow a basis for such speculations.                One embryological
indication may, however, be added.               The nerves of insects
are,  it is known, distinctly fibrous (although in              the bee and
locust    I have observed      the fibres occasionally melting          into
mere granules), but        in the larvae of insects the nerves are
often   mostly granular.        Thus in the active predatory Dra
gonfly Larva — the water-tiger, as           it is called— I found       the
great ventral chord possessing distinct fibres, but in many
places   it was purely granular, the granules not having even
a linear disposition.*        In   the preparation       I  have made      of
this object a very interesting analogy between the develop
ment of nerve and muscle is presented.               Muscles are of two
 kinds, striped and unstriped, the former being generally, but
 erroneously,    called voluntary, the latter involuntary muscles.
 According to recent researches,          it has become evident that
 the striped muscle is only a more differentiated form                of the
 unstriped, there being several intermediate stages between
 the  two.f     In the preparation        I  have made      of the ventral
 chord of the dragonfly larva,           this is strikingly exhibited.
 A  fragment of muscle is attached, the fibrillae of which, in-

stead of being striped (all the muscles of insects are of the
striped kind), are partly striped, partly unstriped; that is
to say, in the same bundle some of the fibrillae are without
the transverse            markings,             and      those    fibrillae which have
such markings have them only part of the way down, the
remainder of the fibrillae being unstriped.                                This is not only
interesting          as a fact     in muscle development, but                         presents
a striking analogy to the development of nerve-fibres, which
we here see           in the     same       trunk partly emerged from their
primitive granular condition.
     I    conclude,      therefore,        that the differentiation                 of nerves
shows the following phases                  :   lst, As in many Molluscs and all
embryos, a granular homogeneous                              mass; 2d,          As in Insects,
and perhaps Crustaceans,                   a linear disposition of the granules
into fibres, but without an investing sheath                                ;   3d, Fibres, or
rather tubules, differing from the preceding in structure, hav
ing each an enveloping sheath, which isolates one fibre from
the other, so that the nerve becomes a fasciculus of tubulesf*
     It would        lead us too far to follow the many applications of
these facts to the vexed questions of nervous histology and
physiology. The hotly-debated controversy respecting the origin
of     fibres as prolongations from ganglionic cells,                            for example,
seems to me decisively settled                        by the fact that, in the            Mol
   *     Stilling,   op. cii. p. 11-13, decides that       all primitive   fibres have an invest
ing sheath ; but unless he would deny the claim of those named in the second
class to be considered       as fibres, he is certainly wrong.         It should be   noted that
what are called fibres in the vertebrate nerve-tissue              are really tubules with fluid
contents.      This fact   was discovered       by Lnnuwnnnonx, who describes them as
vessels (see his Select Works,       ii.   303),        discovery often erroneously attributed

luscs, we have      cells without    fibres,   and by the fact that, in
the   recently-born     dog, we have fibres        which have not yet
effected a   junction with the cells.         Again, when     Funke, re
viewing the controversy respecting the existence of ganglionic
cells destitute   of processes, says that, " from all we know of
 the functions of the nerve-elements         and the laws of conduc
tion in them, an isolated apolar nerve-cell appears                 as an
anomaly (Unding) to which we can in nowise                 assign a phy
siological purpose," * he is assuming that without                  fibres
terminating in cells no nervous transmission can take place
— an    assumption flatly contradicted by the facts we have just
been considering.
    Hitherto our remarks have been of a revolutionary tendency.
To unsettle established      opinions, to shake the very founda
tions of nervous physiology, and to show that we are in no
condition to propound theories, otherwise than as provisional
attempts, has been the serious business        of this Chapter. Brown-
Sequard has proved that the doctrine of the schools relative
to transmission by the spinal column is in every point erro
neous.     Stilling has proved that the dissident doctrines of
the schools respecting the ultimate structure          of nerve-elements
are erroneous     or incomplete.       And    I have    shown that the
doctrine of the schools relative to the function of the fibres is
erroneous   — that   conduction does not necessarily imply the
existence of a continuous fibre from the periphery to the cell,
and from the cell again to the periphery, but takes place where
there are no fibres at all, and where a solution of continuity
exists.

                     SENSIBILITY                WITHOUT NERVES.                          389
     Nor is this alL                   What we metaphorically call " nervous
                     "
conduction               takes      place not only        in the absence of fibres,
but also in the absence of any nerves whatever.                                   There is
nothing like the sharp angle of a paradox to prick the reader's
attention        ;   and here is one in all seriousness                      presented    to
him.         The fact is demonstrable,                that both Contractility and
Sensibility           are manifested by animals                   totally destitute of
either muscles or nerves.                       Some physiologists, indeed, misled
                                                 " construct " the
by the a priori tendency                      to                   organism in lieu
of observing             it,   speak of the muscles and nerves                of the sim
plest animals            ;     because, when they            see the      phenomena       of
Contractility            and Sensibility,           they are unable to dispossess
themselves           of the idea that these must be due to muscles and
nerves.          Thus, when the fresh-water Polype                   is   seen capturing,
struggling with, and finally swallowing                        a   worm, yet refusing
to swallow           a   bit of thread, we cannot deny that                  it   manifests
both Sensibility and Contractility, unless we deny these pro
perties to all other animals.                     Nevertheless,     the highest powers
of the best microscope                        fail to detect the slightest trace of
either muscle             or nerve in the Polype.                  Leydig,    indeed, de
scribes and figures what he calls the muscles                          of the Hydra.*
But what are they                  ?      A   network of contractile cells of irre
gular shape, such as Ecker   had previously described as the
                                              f
" unformed contractile
                       substance," with this difference, that
Leydig discovers               a   nucleus attached        to the wall       of each cell.

respect            to    Hydra viridis, in which                         repeated    examinations
have disclosed nothing of the                         kind       ;       in Hydra fusca     I   have
seen          it    often, but the observation                           by no means     warrants
the conclusion that this proof of the network being cellu
lar       is a proof of its being muscular.                                    The cells resemble
muscles             in no respect, except                   that they are contractile                   ;
and we are not warranted                         in calling every contractile cell a
muscle-cell              ;    otherwise       we must call the unicellular animals
muscles.*                The Hydra presents us with contractile substance
(or cells),             but to call the contractile substance a " muscle,"
is       to    outrage          language       more    than          if    a   wheelbarrow were
spoken             of as a railway locomotive                        ;    and even this latitude
of language                   will not        serve   our turn with respect to the
nervous system of the Polype, since nothing resembling                                                 a
nerve or nerve-substance                       is discernible in it.                We must either
deny that the Polype manifests Sensibility, or we must admit
that Sensibility may exist without nerves.
         In    presence          of these facts, physiologists, who cannot con
ceive Sensibility                  without a nervous system, but are forced to
confess that such a system                        is undiscoverable,                assume that        it
exists
                   " in a diffused state."              I    have noticed this illogical
position in a former Chapter.                               It       is a flat contradiction in
terms          :    a   diffused nerve is tantamount to a liquid crystal                        ;    the
nerve being as specific in its structure, and                                   in the properties
belonging to that structure, as a crystal is.                                       Now, this spe
cific structure — or anything approaching it —is not to be
found in the Polype.                    -f-

                THE ORIGIN OF SENSIBILITY.                                       391
    Whence, then, is the Sensibility derived                 ?   Either we must
admit the presence of what cannot be discovered                      ;  or we must
admit that a function can act without                   its organ     ;  or, finally,
we must modify our conception                  of the relation between          Sen
sibility and the Nervous system.                   Which of these three con
clusions shall we adopt ?
    Not the first     :  for, to admit the presence of an organ which
cannot be discovered,            even by the very highest powers,                  al
though easily discoverable in other animals by quite medium
powers,     would be permissible only as the last resource                          of
hypothesis, when no other supposition could be tenable.
    Not the second        :  for philosophic Biology rejects the idea of
a function being independent of its organ, since a function is
the activity of an organ.              The organ is the agent, the func
tion the act — a point to which we will presently recur.
    The third conclusion, therefore, seems inevitable                    :  we must
modify our views.           But how      ?   Instead of saying, "Sensibility
is a property of nervous tissue," we must say, " Sensibility
is a general property of the vital organism which becomes
specialised in the nervous tissue in proportion as the organ
ism itself becomes specialised."
    We have no difficulty in understanding how Contractility,
at first the property of the whole of the simple organism,
becomes specialised           in muscular tissue.              We   have no diffi
culty in understanding how Respiration,                      at first effected by
the whole surface of the simple organism, becomes specialised

 in a particular part of that surface (gills or lungs) in the
 more complex organisms            ;   nor should we have more difficulty
 in understanding how Sensibility,                from being common to
 the whole organism, is handed over                 to   a special structure,
 which then performs that function exclusively, as the lungs
 perform that of Respiration, or the muscles that of Contrac
 tion.      Nay, more     : just as animals possessing special organs
 for Respiration        do also,     in a minor degree, respire by the
 general surface, so, according to my observations, it is almost
 demonstrable that animals possessing a special nervous sys
 tem also manifest Sensibility in parts far removed from any
 nervous filament.           In the higher animals this is probably
 not the case.*          The division       of labour is more complete.
 The stomach digests, the glands secrete, the muscles contract,
 and the nerves feel.         Of course, the power is greatly increased
 by this division of labour          ; the more complex the organism,
 the more various and effective each function.                 In  the pregnant
 language of our most thoughtful poet,
                  " All  Nature widens upward.     Evermore
                       The simpler essence lower lies  ;
                     More complex is more perfect, owning more
                       Discourse, more widely wise."     t
    * I say probably, because recent investigations have shown that parts which,
in the normal healthy condition, are absolutely insensible, such as tendons,
ligaments, the dura mater, and the periosteum, become intensely sensitive in
a state of inflammation, and this cannot bo attributed to the nerves. — See

                 FUNCTION          DEPENDENT           ON     ORGAN.              393
     It  is truly remarkable that the zoologist who claims the
 merit of having originated this conception of the " division
                 "
 of labour          as a law      in the organic economy,* should be
 among the stanchest defenders of the old metaphysical idea
 that functions          are not      dependent on organs            ; and as this
 question is not only important                 in itself, but of interest in
 the present discussion,           it may detain      us for a moment.           The
 argument, as conducted by Milne Edwards, -f is irresistible,
 because       in it he confines         himself to showing that special
 organs may disappear, and the general function nevertheless
 remain     ;   for instance, that lungs and gills may be absent,
 but the function of Respiration               will still   be present     :
                                                                              " C'est
 une erreur grave de croire," he says, " qu'une faculty deter
 mine       ne puisse s'exercer           qu'a l'aide d'un seul et meme
 organe."         The grave error appears to me wholly on the side
 of those who hold the contrary opinion.                         The reader will
                                                                     "
 perceive that when Milne Edwards concludes,                           que la fonc-

 very frequent in biological discussions — the mistake of con

possessing     the special function of walking or flying       ;  it may
have the general function          of Sensibility, without the special
Senses    ;   the   general function       of   Assimilation,   without
special     Digestion   ;  for the special functions special organs
are required, legs or wings, eyes or ears, intestinal              canal,
and so forth.
   The peculiar faculty of locomotion              known    as "flying,"
can only be performed             by the peculiar organs known         as
"                                               of locomotion can

performed by a simple contractile tissue.                As soon as we
disengage      language of its ambiguity,           the truth is easily
seen   : the appearance        of each special     organ in the animal
series is coincident        with the appearance        of a special  and
corresponding function          ;  or, descending the scale, with     the
disappearance of each special organ, the corresponding spe
cialty of function disappears.           In other words, Function is
dependent       on Organ, as the       Act is on the Agent.      Would
it not   seem wholly        preposterous to say that railway loco
motion was not necessarily dependent              on railways, because,
before    railways were       invented, goods     and passengers were
transmitted by waggons and coaches              ?    Does not every one
see  that the special form of railway transmission gives             it a
power, velocity, and extent, wholly unattainable by waggons
and coaches      ; and that this power, velocity, and extent, are
due entirely to the peculiarity           of the methods of transit       ?
The railway        differs from the tramway, and the tramway
from the old coach-road,             in special modifications, as the
lungs of a mammal differ from the gills of a fish, and the
gills from a merely respiratory surface in the Zoophyte.               To

say that the same function is performed by all, is to con
found    the general with the particular        ;   and to say that
functions are consequently independent of organs, is worse
than this, because     it leaves   out of sight the fact that the
                  of the animal which respires is the " organ
                                                                       "

of that general respiration.        When acts can be performed
without agents, and animals can exist without bodies, in the
shape    of pure syntheses       of functions, then      will it  be a
"                "
   grave   error    to conclude that functions are necessarily
dependent on organs, and not        till then.
    Although we have been forced to admit that Sensibility
can be manifested without nerves, and the paradox therefore
of nervous conduction taking place without nerves was only
a paradox in its terms, yet inasmuch as functions are neces
sarily dependent     on organs,    we are also forced to conclude
that the various specialisations of nerve-tissue must bring
with them corresponding specialisations of function.              What
those are we know not, perhaps may never              know   ;  but the
 mere recognition     that such   things must be, will help us to
 understand     many points.      It   explains, for example,        the
 absence   of Pain in the lower animals, spoken of in the last
 Chapter   ; it explains the possibility of such myriads of subtle
 differences  in the perceptions of men so nearly allied as twin-
 brothers.
     And now, dear reader,        we    must part company,         after
 having wandered together over many a reef and bay, and
 skirted the great plains of Philosophy,          traversed    by many
 foot-sore pilgrims     who    beckon us      to follow.    We    have
 caught some glimpses of the marvels and delights which

 await us in every rock-pool      ;  and we have seen how a mere
amusement     will naturally   lead us into the solemn temples
 of Philosophy.
    The naturalist    may be     anything,    everything.        He may
yield to the charm of simple observation           ; he may study the
habits and habitats of animals, and moralise on their ways               ;
he may use them        as starting-points    of laborious research       ;
he may carry his newly-observed facts into the highest region
of speculation   ; and whether roaming amid the lovely nooks
of Nature in quest of varied specimens, or fleeting the quiet
hour in observation of his pets — whether he make Natural
History an amusement, or both amusement and serious work
— it will always      offer him     exquisite     delight.     From the
schoolboy to the philosopher, all grades find in            it something
admirably suited to their minds.          It  brings us into closer
presence   of the great mysteries of life       ;  and while quicken
ing our sense of the infinite marvels which surround the
simplest    object, teaches    us    many and        pregnant lessons
which may help us through our daily needs.
   In  suggestive   but untranslatable verse, Goethe asks what
higher aim can we have here on earth than to trace the
revelation of the      Divine in Nature       ;    how Fact becomes
etherealised into Thought, and how Thought             in turn becomes
incorporate in Fact— as Greece, which was once a mere
geographical boundary, containing a handful of men, has
been ever since a spiritual      influence moulding the destinies
of the world    ;  or, conversely,    as the mere        idea  of a loco
motive engine which arose in the mind of George Stephenson,
passed into the gigantic fact of the Railway system.

           " Was kann   der Mensch im Leben mehr gewinnen
             Als dass sich Gott-Natur ihm offenbare,
             Wie sich das Feste liisst zu Geist verrinnen,
             Wie sich dns Geisterzeugte fest bewahre." *
   All   the forms and facts of Nature carry with them a deep
spiritual significance, and cannot be reverently studied with
out revealing     it;  for are they not the manifestations of the
Universal Life      ?  Unreflecting minds often deem               it a trivial
occupation for serious men to devote themselves with patience
to the study of anatomical details, and the scrutiny of facts
which seem to have no practical bearing on the great affairs
of life.    These details, like all other facts of Nature, may,
indeed, be studied       in a trivial spirit, uninspired by a loftier
aim ;    but   under their lowest aspect             they have        still the
inalienable value attendant upon all             truth; and under their
highest aspect they teach us something of a noble wisdom
which     profoundly      affects    the practical      affairs of life, by
affecting the direction and the temper of our thoughts.

      DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
                            FKONTISPIECE.
Fig.  1. Group of    Plumatella. The figure to the right is of natural size ;
           that to the left is magnified, and shows one animal contracted
           and two expanded, with their ciliated tentacles in activity.
           The group is fixed on a stem of sea-weed.       (Copied from Milne
          Edwards.)
 ...  2. A Cydippe slightly magnified      ; the streamers contracted.
 ...  3. A Noctiluca Miliaria greatly magnified. The circular spaces are
           vacuolao, filled with granules of food ; these are only temporary,
           and are sometimes not visible at all.        (Copied from    Quatre-
          fages.)
 ...  4. Group of Clarellincp, about three times the natural size, rising
           from a creeping stem.       The two orifices open and shut rhyth
           mically to suck in and eject water. The lace-work structure
           is richly ciliated, and is supposed to represent the gills of the
           animal.     (Copied from Mr Gosse.)

Fig.  1. An Eolis coronata.
 ...  2. A Doris Johwtoni.       The two horn-like processes on the head are
           the antenna;     which retract, when the animal is touched, or re
           moved from the water       ; the coronet at the other end is the
           circle of branchial plumes.
 ...  3. A PhoUu dactylut, or rather the shell of one.        (Figs. 1-3 copied
           from Woodward's Mollusca.)
  ... 4. An Aplysia. The gills are seen under the fold of the skin, to
           the right.     (Copied from Milne Edwards.)

                                   PLATE IIL
   Fig.   1.  A   diagram intended to exhibit the structure of an Actinia, but
                which must not be taken as strictly accurate, a is the base, b
                the disk, c the tentacles, d the mouth, e the stomach, g and  f
                h the septa dividing the cavity into chambers, on the free sur
                face of which are the grape-like masses of ovary, and     in front of
                the ovary the convoluted bands.      (Copied from Sharpey.)
  ...    2. Represents a section of the     A ctinia  as seen in reality.   The con
                voluted bands are seen covering the ovary, and terminating on
               the inner wall of the stomach. (Copied from M. Hollard.)
  ...   3.   A    magnified view of one convoluted band and ovary, with the
               mesentery between them, as they appear when unfolded on the
               glass slide, previous to examination under the microscope.        (M.
               Hollard.)
 ...    4.   Three Thread^capmlet from an Actinia, greatly magnified ; one
               with the thread still inside, the other two after the ejection.
  ...   5. Vertical section of the Retina of a Perch, showing the relative
               positions of the pigment layer, the rods and cones, the granules,
               fibres, and cells.  (Copied from H. Muller.)
                                  PLATE IV.
Fia   1. Campamularia.       — The figure to the right is of the natural size ;
              that to the left is a branch greatly magnified. The Polype is
               seen, flowerlike, expanding itself at the summit.        An ovarian
              capsule, to the right, contains Medusae in various stages of de
              velopment.      (Copied from Van Beneden.)
 ...    2. Plumularia myriopkyllwn, natural size.           Five of the branches
              are seen developed into ovarian capsules.
 ...    3. Represents the spontaneous subdivision          of one worm into two.
              The head of the second worm is seen formed at the segment
              where the tail ought to be. (Copied from Milne Edwards.)
                                   PLATE       V.
Fio.  1. Lampnglena         pulchella,  one of the crustacean Epizoa, greatly
              magnified, and seen from below.          The figure is copied from
              Nordmann, with the addition of the ovisacs, not represented in
              his plate, but which Burmeister, whose copy I possess, has
              drawn in pencil. The Lamproglena is found in the gills of a
              fish [Oyprinug Jetet).

414                 DESCRIPTION            OF     THE PLATES.
 Fio.     2. Sagitta    Mariana greatly magnified; natural size quarter of an inch.
               I  believe this to be a new species, and I have named it the Mari
               ana.     The ova are seen on each side of the alimentary canal             ;
               and in the lower half of the body are the cells containing sper
               matozoa, which issue from the orifices in the fin near the tail.
   ...   3. Nymphon        gracile (one of the Pycnogonida?)     ;   natural size.   The
               three circles from which the legs spring convey an inaccurate
               idea of the reality ; they are not cavities, but enlargements of
               the trunk.
   ...   4. The same       animal in the egg, just before     it   is hatched;    greatly
               magnified.

   ... 3-10. Development         of Strongylui aurieularii, one of the Entozoa.
                 Fig. 3 shows the primary germ-cell, surrounded by the
                 yolk ; at 4, a division has taken place ; 5, a subdivision ; 6,
