                      PREFACE.
  THE main object of this little book is to
enable the reader, 'unacquainted with Natural
History, to recognise some of the different
objects frequent on our shores.                      There is not
one of them all, but has some interesting cir
cumstance connected with                   it,   familiar enough
to the man of science, but never suspected                        by
those who have not had opportunity or incli
nation to study them.                  Could we trace the
mental history of our great naturalists, we
should find that many who have devoted their
lives to the pursuits of science, had at first
their attention directed to                it,   like Linnaeus,   by
listening to      a   conversation,         or, like Sir Joseph
Banks,       by   musing, in           a   leisure moment, on
the beauty of         a   flower   ;   and thus the reading
of   a   little volume like this, on common things,
may serve to awaken an interest in nature,
which shall not sleep again.

    VI                         PREFACE.
         In   so small a book little reference could be
    made to any system of classification ; and though
    the alphabet of science is as important as the
    alphabet of literature to any who would make
progress in           it,   yet the use of scientific terms
would here be out of place.                   Perchance the
reader may be led to investigate more fully the
subjects          here presented;       and this book will
have well accomplished its design,              if      it   should
create        a   desire to study the works of our great
naturalists, of Dr. Harvey, or Dr. Johnston,
of Professor Forbes, or Rymer Jones, or other
writers here so               often   referred to   ;   or    if   it
should send him into the wide fields of nature
to observe and discover for himself.
         But should time and place be wanting to
pursue the subject farther, yet will he have
gained something,             if   he have learned aught of
common things.                 "Partial knowledge," says
an Arabian proverb,
                                 " better than total
                                   is                        igno
rance.         He who cannot acquire all that he
                                               "
would, should be careful to get all that he can.

            SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
                        CHAPTER             I.
      " For there, by sea-dews nursed and airs marine,
        The Chelidonium blows in glaucous green ;
        Each refluent tide the thorn'd Eryngium laves,
        And its pale leaves seem tinctured by the waves;
        And half way up the cliff, whose rugged brow
        Hangs o'er the ever-toiling surge below,
        Springs the light Tamarisk ; the summit bare
        Is tufted by the Statice; and there,
        Crush'd by the fisher, as he stands to mark
        Some distant signal or approaching bark,
        The Saltwort's starry stalks are thickly sown,
        Like humble worth, unheeded and unknown."
  IT is delightful on       some fine summer's morning
  to wake up to the loud continuous sounds of the
  waves, and to stray along the shore, with eye and
  heart alive to the natural beauty of this world.
 When the calm airs seem, as the poet describes
 them,
           " Like Music slumbering    on its instrument,"
 they are to the listener both sweet and soothing,
and serve — we know not how nor why — to awaken
memories of the past, and so to identify themselves
with our own being, that scenes far away, and
long absent friends, gradually mingle in the day
dreams begotten by their tones.
                                 B

2                      SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
    The glorious ocean ! Can we wonder that lin
gering groups gather daily close by its boundaries,
gazing hour after hour upon the silver waves?
Call them not idlers. They may have come from
scenes of busy toil for needful repose, and while
listening to sweet sounds, and looking on lovely
objects, they are getting treasures of memory for
other days, and store of health and strength for
future duty.
    What thoughtful person ever listened to the
ocean's murmurs without thinking over what a
mass of contents its waters roll : —
                     " Bones of dead men, that made
     A hidden Golgotha where they had fall'n,
     Unseen, unsepulchred, but not unwept
     By lover, friend, relation far away,
     Long waiting their return to home and country,
     And going down into their fathers' graves,
     With their grey hairs or youthful locks, in sorrow,
     To meet no more till seas give up their dead;
     Some, too, — ay, thousands, — whom no living mourn'd,
     None miss'd, waifs in the universe, the last
     Lorn links of kindred chains for ever sunder'd."
    We have often thought, on looking on the mul
 titudes of invalids who with their companions
 crowd our shores in summer, that they would
 possess a great advantage if they had some out
 door pursuit with which to beguile the time. Dr.
 Cullen used to say, that he had cured weak
 stomachs by engaging his patients in the study of
 botany, and particularly in the investigation of
 wild plants ; and many a head-ache, and a heart
 ache too, would be relieved if its owner could be
 brought to feel an interest in the shells or sea
 weeds which are strewed on the beach, or in the
 sweet wild blossom which smiles on the side of

                   SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
 the cliff.  But the time    spent at the sea-side is
 not usually the time for study.     Rest of mind is
 often absolutely necessary for health; and even
 where this is not the case, yet the many hours
 spent in the open air, while invigorating to the
 frame, render us indisposed to any continued
 mental exertion.     It is those already in some
 degree acquainted with natural history, who can
 now enjoy its results.     There are few, however,
who, while for a period they are residents on our
coasts, would not be glad to know some of its
familiar objects, if the knowledge could be ob
tained without study ; and it is for the unlearned
in these matters that these pages are written.
    It will be necessary to confine our remarks on
the plants of our shores to such as grow only by
the sea-side, or to such as grow more frequently
there than elsewhere.     The flowers which cluster
in some of the meadows at a little distance, and
many which spring up on the cliffs, thrive equally
well on inland soils of the same nature. The rich
clumps of the wild rock rose (Helianthemum
vulgare) are as bright on the chalky cliff which
skirts the green lane, as on those that lie about
the sea; and, find them where we may, have so
bright a golden tint, that we remember how
Pliny told of them, that the kings and wise men
of Persia anointed themselves with them, to make
them fair and beautiful, and called them the
" beauties of the sun." Then there is the wild
thyme (Thymus serpyllum), sending its sweetness
from among the short grass on the cliff, or on
the air of the heathland ; and the pale chocolate
blossoms of the wild marjoram (Origanum vulgare),
                                  "
which the Greeks termed the joy of the moun
                          B 2

                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
tain;"   and the pretty   little euphrasy, or eye-
bright (Euphrasia officinalis), which grows equally
well on the pasture land far away from the sea,
and which in the Greek language signified " de
light ;" and many another, with old names so ex
pressive, and so pretty withal, that we are re
minded of the words said to be spoken by Mary
Powell, before she married John Milton, that
" Adam might have named the animals, but that
Eve surely named the flowers."
    Notwithstanding considerable variety in the
 aspect of different parts of our coast, yet every
 one must have remarked the general barrenness
 of vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the sea.
 Such trees as are planted near the shore, have
 usually a stunted appearance, and have their upper
 boughs bent down by the strong winds which
 blow over them. The sycamore is the only tree
 which can be said to flourish close to the sea as
 well as on inland spots, and to lift as bold a front
 and as full a canopy to the sea breeze, as to the
 wind of the sheltered valley; and the tamarisk
 and the tree mallow are almost the only shrubs
 which seem to prefer the saline soil for their
 growth.    The presence of a large quantity of salt
 in the soil, has, from the earliest ages of the
 world, been known to produce sterility ; and not
 only do the early Greek and Roman writers name
 the practice of sowing a field with salt when they
  condemned it to barrenness, but we have an
 instance of this named in the Scriptures, when
  Abimelech in his fury beat down the city of
  Shechem, and sowed its site with salt, that never
  more the earth should yield her produce to gladden
  the heart of man.     The Psalmist, speaking of

                 SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                  5
some once beautiful     country, says,
                                       "  He turneth
the land into barrenness," literally, " into salt-
ness;" and the scanty herbage and the small
number of trees and flowers usually found on the
vast saline deserts of Africa, or the sandy regions
of the countries of the East, are proofs at once of
the injury done to vegetation by salt.       On some
lands of Cheshire, even of late years, when a soil
has produced too abundantly the rushes and weeds
which trouble the agriculturist, he has laid rock
 salt upon the earth to destroy them.
    But it is only lands very near . the sea whose
 produce is injuriously affected either by the
 muriates of the atmosphere which have passed
 over it, or by the saltness existing in the earth.
 A portion of salt is favourable to the growth of
 plants, and the supply of moisture derived from
 so large a body of water renders the land at a
 small distance more fertile than those parts of the
 earth's surface which are further from the coast.
 Every one at all acquainted with the southern
 part, especially, of our island, can call to mind
 some quiet nooks of sunshine in which the wild
 flowers attain great size and beauty, and crowd
 the hedgebank or meadow, only just screened by
  a cliff from the rudest breezes of the sea.    What
  Keats said of the Isle of Wight, might equally
  well apply to some parts of the coast of Devon
  shire : "I   have found," said the invalid poet,
  " several delightful wood alleys, and copses, and
  quiet freshes ; as for primroses, the isle ought to
  be called Primrose Island — that   is,
                                       if   the nation
  of cowslips agree thereto, of which there are divers
  clans just beginning to lift up their heads."
     But, barren as the soilis  close to the sea, yet
                                                    it
                           B   3

has its own peculiar plants; plants which will
grow nowhere else — saline plants, which, if carried
away to grace some inland garden, droop and
pine for their native shore.       Others grow not
only by the sea-side, but on pasture lands to
which saline waters have access ; and some which
grow in our inland fields, yet are so much more
luxuriant near the shore, that we must consider
that as at least an especial place of their growth.
So small, however, is the number of wild plants
of the sea side, that limited as is this little volume,
they can be enumerated in the chapter appro
priated to them.
   There are few subjects more interesting to the
botanist than the adaptation of plants to their
peculiar places of growth. The most lofty Alpine
hills have their blossoms, and the deep blue
gentian thrives amid the snows,
      " The living flower that skirts the eternal frost;"
 the sand has its sand-worts, which refuse to grow
 on richer soils.  The magnificent cedar is wild
 on its native Lebanon only ; Lapland boasts her
flower called Charles's Sceptre, which is never
seen beyond the limits of her own land.         Even
the dreary Siberia has her own beautiful Cypri-
pedium, or, as we in English term              it,

slipper. Our streams have their water-lilies, our
meadows their field flowers, our woods their
anemones and hyacinths.      At the extreme limits
of vegetation we find the wood sorrel, ferns,
lichens, and mosses cover the grey rocks; one
lichen growing even on the forbidding surface of
the stalactite. There are plants which are indi
genous to sulphureous springs, and     little flower

The sea itself has on its bed immense tribes of
marine vegetation, the food and home of its living
creatures ; and where but in the sound of its
waves shall we find that bright flower of our sand
and shingle, the yellow horned poppy ?
   There are some features in our wild saline
plants which, while they are not invariable or
peculiar to them, yet are very general.    They are
usually very succulent, and their stems and foliage
have on them more or less of a sea-green powder, —
a   kind ofpale green or whitish bloom.     Leaves
or stems covered with this are termed by botanists
glaucous, and a very familiar instance of glaucous
foliage may be seen in the outer leaves of the
common cabbage.         The succulent nature of sea
side plants renders them suitable for soils which
yield little nourishment ; for succulent plants have
many pores, by means of which they readily im
bibe moisture, which is long retained in their juices,
and which, deriving as they do from rains or dews,
renders them less dependent on nutriment to be
obtained from the root. The common houseleek
and stonecrop of our house-tops are nourished far
more by the atmosphere than by the soil ; and so
are the aloe and the fig marigold, and the ice plant
of desert lands, many of which are like the plants
of our sea- side, too, in the glaucous nature of their
green.
    One of our sea-side plants, the Samphire (Crith-
 mum maritimum), is known, at least by name, to
 most persons.    Several of our early poets have
 alluded to   it,
               and its frequent use as   pickle ren
                                         a

 plants can yield so good, and warm, and aromatic

 a  flavour for a pickle as this ; and it has been a
 favourite with good housewives for many years ;
 for an old song of Heywood's, enumerating the
 cries of London in his time, has this line, —
            "   I ha'   rock samphier, rock samphier."
     The inhabitants of places whose rocks abound
 with this plant use it not only as a pickle, but also
 as an ingredient in salads ; and they also eat it as
 a culinary vegetable.      It is sometimes grown in
 gardens and pots, and it appears under certain
 circumstances to thrive well. Thus Braddick, the
 horticulturist, who cultivated the samphire in
 Thames Ditton, on a sheltered and dry spot, well
 screened from the morning sun, and who sprinkled
 the soil where it grew with powdered barilla,
 remarks of      " This do to furnish the plant with
                it,        I
a  supply of soda, since, in its native place of growth,
it   possesses the power of decomposing sea-water,
 from which   ittakes the fossil alkali, and rejects the
 muriatic acid." This horticulturist also protected
it  from the cold of winter, and he found that by
 this mode of treatment the plants flourished most
 plentifully, and produced large supply of leaves
                                    a
 and shoots, which were cut twice in the season.
    The stem of the samphire         about
                                        is    foot high,
                                                   a
round and leafy; and             has dense clusters of
                                  it
greenish-white flowers. The whole plant            fleshy is
and glaucous, with         salt aromatic flavour. It

coast, but       not common in the north of Eng

               very rare on the rocks of Scotland              ;
and Sir William Hooker remarks of              — " It
                                                    it,        is
found only,I     believe, on the coast of Galloway,
and thence northward to Colzean Castle, Ayrshire

                        SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                      9
 (whence      I   have received numerous specimens),
 and at Aberlady, Haddingtonshire."                     He adds,
 that when the process of drying this plant for the
 Herbarium is aided by immersion in hot water,
 a number of opaque white dots make their appear
 ance on the surface.
     The samphire is always found on rocks or stone
 walls beyond the reach of the tide. The chalk
 hills of Dovor, which gave its old name to that
 ancient town, the Dwyr of the Saxons, from their
 " Dwfyrrha," a " steep place," have long been
 celebrated for the growth of samphire. Michael
 Drayton refers to it in his Poly-Olbion : —
    " Some, his ill-season'd mouth that rightly understood,
      Rob Dover's neighbouring cleeves of samphyre, to excite
      His dull and sickly taste, and stir up appetite."
And the very          name of the Shakspeare Cliff was
derived from its connexion with the passage in
which the great dramatist refers to this plant.
That cliff has recently suffered from the long-
continued action of rain and sunshine upon it ;
but as long as it exists, the samphire will probably
continue to thrive there. We must quote again
the oft-quoted lines on this subject, and which,
indeed, well describe the scene from the summit
of the cliff: —
                               " How fearful,
        And dizzy 'tis to  cast one's eyes so low!
        The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
        Show scarce so gross as beetles ; half-way down
        Hangs one that gathers samphire, — dreadful trade;
        Methinks he seems no bigger than his head;
        The fishermen that walk upon the beach
        Appear like mice, and yon tall anchoring bark
        Diminish'd to her cock, her cock a buoy,
        Almost too small for sight : the murm'ring surge,
        That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,

10                   SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
       Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,
       Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
       Topple down headlong."
   This trade of samphire gathering from the cliff
has indeed proved a dangerous one.                 A few years
since, a man, resident in Dovor, and who had for
many summers gathered the plant for sale in the
neighbourhood, was suspended, as usual, by a rope
attached to a pole at the summit. The rope, on
this occasion, suddenly gave way, and the un
fortunate man was precipitated to the base of the
cliff, and expired immediately.
   The word Samphire is a corruption of St. Pierre,
the plant having, in former times, been dedicated
to the memory of the Apostle ; and it was also
familiarly called St. Peter's Herb. It had, besides,
the name of Crest Marine. The monks, as we well
know, gave the names of the wild plants known
to them, according to the times when they came
into blossom, making them the remembrancers of
their saints' days and festivals. Upwards of three
hundred plants, now in use, and recorded in our
works of medical botany, under different names,
were known in years long passed away in the
monasteries, as the medicinal herbs used by the
religious orders.        A writer in Rees's Encyclo
paedia says that we ought to pronounce and spell
the name of this plant sampire, our modern ortho
 graphy and pronunciation being a corruption of
 this. But our quotations from the old writers
 serve to show that various modes of spelling the
 word were used in past times ; nor indeed need we
 wonder at this, when even in the days of Queen
 Elizabeth a man would spell his own name half a
 dozen ways if it could possibly bear such a variety

                       SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                             11
of modes of orthography.     The word samphier, as
Heywood spells         it,
                     seems to give the nearest simi
larity in sound to its original derivation.
   Crabbe, who resided at part of our coast where
                                 a
vegetation   ispeculiarly barren, refers to this plant,
as well as to one mentioned afterwards, the salt
wort. His pictures of sea-shore scenery are always
mournful and dreary, nor       this description of the
                                 is
salt river-side less so: —
    " With    ceaseless motion comes and goes the tide;
      Flowing,   it fills the channel vast and wide
                                                  ;
      Then back to sea, with strong majestic sweep,
      It rolls in ebb, yet terrible and deep
                                         :
      Here sampire banks and saltwort bound the flood;
      There stalks of sea-weed withering in the mud    ;
      And higher up, ridge of all things base,
                        a
      Which some strong tide has roll'd upon the place."
The samphire     found also on the rocky shores of
                  is
other countries, as in Italy, Spain, and France,
and   used there, as with us, as an article of food
     is
and luxury.
    Somewhat similar to this plant, and commonly
 known as the annual samphire,           the jointed
                                             is
 glasswort (Salicornia herbacea), so abundant on the
 salt marshes near our coast, or on muddy shores
 occasionally overflowed by the tide. It    a leaflessis
herb, of pale bright green, and much succulence,
and  it  flowers in August and September.         The
poor people who reside in the neighbourhood of
these marshes gather this plant, and sell     for the  it
purpose of pickling      and, assisted by strongly
                             ;
flavoured spices,     itcertainly as good
                           is               herb for  a
a pickle as many another one commonly used but                  ;
the aromatic flavour of the real samphire      want        is
ing in this plant, whose juices have in themselves
only a saltish mawkish flavour. Those who know

the real samphire are not likely to purchase this ;
and similar as it is in general appearance, it differs
much in its flowers, which consist of dense spikes,
jointed like the stem, and bearing at the base of
every articulation, on two opposite sides, a cluster
of three little blossoms.     It was formerly called
jointed glasswort, crabbe grasse, and frog grasse,
and we now frequently hear it termed marsh
samphire, to distinguish it from the rock plant.
 Its saltish taste renders it very agreeable to ani
mals, and it is one of the plants which, on our
 saline soils, prove so beneficial to cattle, that they
 are often sent there by their owners to regain lost
 flesh and strength.     Most animals enjoy feeding
 on this kind of herbage, as the whole of it must be
 more or less impregnated with salt, and it is not
 unlikely that the sea air has upon the frame of the
 inferior animals the same invigorating effect which
 it has upon the constitution of man.
    This glasswort, as well as several other species,
 abounds on the shores of the Mediterranean, and
 they are all included under the name of Erba-cali,
 by the Italians, while the German name of glass-
 schmaltz, like our glasswort, is significant of the
 uses of these plants in Germany.         In the south
  of Europe, as well as in northern Africa, this
  salicornia was burnt for the soda which its ashes
 contain; and this material was much in use by the
  soap and glass manufacturer of these countries.
  At Marseilles, especially, a great quantity was
  gathered from the sea-shores for the purpose
  of burning for soda. We have another British
  species, called the creeping-glasswort (Salicor
 nia radicans), which is very much like the former
  kind, only that it is more branching and strag

                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                13
gling;   and it is distinguished by having a per
ennial stem, which, at the lower part, is quite
woody, and about a foot long.       It grows some
times on the edge of a low muddy bank depending
from thence ; but it is a rare plant. It has been
found in the Isle of Sheppey, in Kent, and also on
the Norfolk and Sussex coasts. The botanic name
of the genus, taken from salt and a horn, is very
expressive of the nature and form of the plants.
   But the abundance of soda yielded by several
sea-side vegetables is in none greater than in the
genus of plants called Salsola, by botanists, one of
which is the prickly-saltwort of our shores. These
plants, like the samphire and marsh samphire, are
pickled with vinegar and eaten at table.         The
various uses of soda have rendered some species
of this genus of considerable importance ; and our
only native kind was once much valued for the
alkaline salts yielded by its ashes.    Carbonate of
soda has, however, of late years, been obtained
from common and rock salt, so that the impure soda
once procured from sea- weeds, and called kelp, and
the more valuable barilla yielded by the soda plants,
are no longer in request in this country.        The
prickly saltwort (Salsola Kali) is a spreading plant,
with awl-shaped leaves, tipped with spines, and an
angular stem with pale greenish flowers growing
close down upon it. It blossoms in July, and grows
very generally among the sands of the shore. This
 species is not a native of our coasts only, but is
 plentiful on most sandy shores in all parts of the
 world, and its value in producing soda is very
 generally known.     The species of saltwort called
 the round-leaved saltwort (Salsola sativa) was
 cultivated very extensively in southern Europe,

  14               SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
  and furnished the best soda used in this quarter of
 the world. Its produce is called by the merchant,
 the Spanish or Alicant soda. The large cultiva
 tors of this soda plant along the Mediterranean
 shores of Spain, found during the long war, in the
 early part of this century, so great an increase in
 the value of the soda, that they wished to extend
 the culture of the saltwort. They therefore tried
 the experiment of forming some salsola fields far
 ther inland.    But the plan proved unsuccessful,
 for although the plant was luxuriant, yet the quan
 tity of soda was so much diminished as to render
 it of little worth. The planters ascertained the
fact, that, as long as the land sloped upwards from
the sea, the saltwort was rich in its alkaline
products; but when the field sloped inland, the
soda decreased.     The saline soil, and the saline
winds and vapours of the ocean, were needed
to render it a true saltwort. Neither is our na
tive species a plant which flourishes remote from
the sea.
    It was observed, in an earlier page, that many
plants of the deserts resemble those of our sea
shore plants in their succulence, their saltish
flavour, and glaucous green hue.      These plants,
too, yield the same product.      Thus the ice-plant
which we rear in the hot-house, because of the
beauty of its ice-bespangled foliage, is cultivated
on the salt lands of Greece for its soda, and called
Barilla, and the knot-flowered fig-marigold of the
desert saline soils of Egypt, is gathered and
burned for the same purpose.
    But turning from plants possessing little beauty,
— though abundantly compensating for its absence
by their utility to man, — we must proceed to one

                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                   15
or two of the gayest flowers of our sea side.      We
have not one peculiar to the coast which is so
handsome as that large flower, the yellow homed
poppy (Glaucium luteum), whose deep gold-coloured
petals wave to every wind that comes murmuring
over the face of the sea, and fall at night from their
stem.    Though this flower cannot he found on
every sandy shore or shingly beach, yet it is very
common. At Sandgate and Dovor, as well as in
many other places, it grows on the beach scarcely
beyond the reach of the tide ; and, indeed, when
the winter storm brings the waves higher than
usual, they must flow above hundreds of the roots
of this flower. The petals of these large and
showy blossoms are crumpled, and, like those of
our field poppies, seem as if they had been rolled
up tightly in their flower-cups before they opened
to the light of day. The large leaves, sheathing
at their base around the stem, have the sea-green
bloom so often found on sea-side vegetation, and
the botanic name of the genus, Glaucium, originated
in the Greek word for sea-green. Nor do the
leaves lose their greenness when winter winds have
borne away all beauty from the few plants on the
shore. There they are lying over the barren shingle,
to remind us that nature lives, and still delights
in her own verdant tints. The upper leaves are
more smooth, but the lower ones are hairy, almost
prickly ; and the seed-vessels, which are pods like
horns, sometimes a foot long, and curved, are
rough with many minute tubercles on their sur
face.   This plant is found also in the Carolinas
and Virginia, and it may be cultivated in gardens,
but never grows wild inland. A beautiful scarlet
horned    poppy (Glaucium corniculatum)        is occa

 16                SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
 sionally found on the southern coast of England,
and is said to have grown both in Norfolk and in
Portland Island ; but most botanists doubt if this
is a truly British flower, though De Candolle thinks
it is a variety of our common yellow species. It
is a remarkably elegant blossom, the petals being
of richest scarlet, and having a black spot at the
base of each.
    The genus was once called Chelidonium, and
the yellow horned species is referred to, under that
name, in the lines which stand at the head of this
chapter. Several botanists have said that this
flower possesses an acrid copper-coloured juice,
which causes madness. The writer of these pages
has, however, examined many specimens, and found
only a colourless juice.     It is certainly of a most
acrimonious description ; so much so, that on ap
plying to the tongue the finger which had touched
the broken stem, a sensation of burning was pro
duced in the mouth and throat, which remained
for an hour afterwards. Ben Jonson mentions the
yellow horned poppy as one of the flowers used
by pretended witches and magicians in their incan
tations. That the practice of burning herbs ac
companied that of the magical art, there is no
doubt ; and it is equally evident that such plants
were selected as were likely, while burning, to
produce fumes of such a nature as to affect the
nervous system, so as to deceive the imaginations
of persons subjected to their influence. Various
plants of narcotic and stupifying properties also
were administered internally, just as the poor
Kamschatdales, when preparing themselves for the
service of their gods, are accustomed to produce
a kind of intoxication by eating their native plant,

the cow-parsley, by means of which they expe
rience a wild delirium of feeling.        If  the juices of
our yellow horned poppy cause madness, then it
seems likely that this was one of the herbs used in
the times of superstition ; and now that those dark
practices have passed away, no record save the poet's
song remains of this its former use in our land.
   Though not quite so common a flower as the
yellow horned poppy, the sea-side Eryngo is a
             SEA EBYNGO (Bryngium maritimum).

  well-known ornament of some maritime spots, and
  in many parts of the eastern shores of England it
 is abundant. The Rev. W. E. Drummond has
  well described it : —
                               " The Eryngo here
        Sits as a queen among the scanty tribes
        Of vegetable race. Around her neck
        A gorgeous ruff of leaves, with snowy points,
        Averts all rough intrusion.    On her brow
        She binds a crown of amethystine hue,
        Bristling with spicula, thick interwove
        With clustering florets, whose light anthers dance
        In the fresh breeze like tiny topaz gems.
        Here the sweet rose would die. But she imbibes
        From arid sands, and 'salt sea dew-drops, strength.
        The native of the beach, by nature formed
        To dwell among the ruder elements."
    The sea eryngo (Eryngium maritimum) has a
 stem about a foot high, much branched, with
 prickly strongly-veined leaves, resembling the
foliage of the holly, and dense heads of blue
 flowers.      This flower flourishes too on the coasts
 of Ireland and Scotland; and travellers tell us
that it grows equally well along the European and
African shores of the Mediterranean. It is known
on the several parts of our coast by a variety of
names, as the sea hulver, sea holly, and sea holme.
Our common prickly holly formerly bore also the
names of hulver and holme, as well as that of
scarlet oak, and the general resemblance of a
branch of this plant to the holly bough, naturally
led to its familiar names.              Not that the reader
must expect any similarity between the delicate
waxen-like flowers of our evergreen tree, and the
blossom of the eryngo ; for this is more like our
wild thistle flower, and so much so, that the author
has heard children on the coast call the plant the
blue sea thistle.         The roots of the eryngo were

                   SEA-SIDE PLANTS                   19
formerly candied and sold by confectioners as a
sweetmeat, and though they have lost their old
renown for their strengthening and stimulating
virtues, and no modern poet like those of older
days sings their praises, yet there are persons who
still sell the candied eryngo roots in London,
though they have not so many purchasers as in
the days of Queen Elizabeth.          There existed till
lately, and probably exists still, in the town of
Colchester in Essex, an establishment where these
roots are prepared, and it was in this very town
that these candied comfits first originated.      More
than two centuries since, an apothecary named
Robert Buxton, who had a high idea of their
medicinal properties, prepared the root in this
way for general use.       These plants grow on the
sandy soils of Arabia, and the Arabs regard them
as  an excellent restorative. The use of plants as
medicine was known long before men thought of
 seeking remedies among metallic or mineral drugs,
 and in Boerhave's time this plant was not only
 recommended by him, as a tonic, but seems to
 have been for many years generally so regarded.
 Linnaeus says that the young flowering shoots are
 eaten in Sweden, boiled as asparagus, and describes
 them as a good vegetable.         The young shoots of
 several of our wild plants are equally good for this
 purpose, and none are better than those of the
 wild burdock, which may be known by its very
 large leaves, purple thistle-shaped blossoms, and
 above all by the spiny flower-cups which children
  call burrs.   It grows by most waysides.
     We have but two species of eryngo, and the other
  (Eryngium campestre) is rare, though found occa

 than the sea-side kind, and was found originally
 in Ray's time truly wild in England near Plymouth,
 where it still grows. It has also been seen on
 some spots near the sea at the north of England,
 but it has probably been introduced there in
 ballast. Throughout Italy, France, and Flanders
it is a most common flower, and so general are the
 eryngos in North America, that nearly one hun
 dred species have been described as growing wild,
 and one is in so frequent use as a medicine, for the
relief of hysterical complaints, as to have acquired
the familiar name of Fit-weed.
    But, quitting for awhile the velvet-like sands
which border our sea, we must in imagination
linger by the cliffs near them. Tall venerable cliffs
are they, on whose brow time seems to have
written no changes, and which might give to
England its name of Albion, as well as they did
in days of yore. They have their own peculiar
herbage, besides being decked by the milkwort,
and the rest-harrow, and the beautiful yellow
chlora, plants of the chalk soil everywhere through
out our land. All up their sides we see the green
patch here and there, —
         " And down their   slanted glory move
           Scents from the flowers that grow above."
    One of the plants which is not wild elsewhere,
is the sea-side cabbage, or cliff cabbage, as it is
sometimes called; the Brassica oleracea of the bota
nist. It is not a common plant, though in some
places very abundant.          On the cliffs of Dover, as
well as on some portions of the beach, it is plenti
ful, and growing up beyond the reach of the waves,
yet requiring the saline air for its production, the
clumps of this plant, with its glaucous green leaves,

nised at once : but few who look upon its bluish
small scattered leaves and handsome pale yellow
flowers, much like the wild mustard or charlock,
are aware that to this sea colewort we owe all the
kinds of cultivated cabbage, the leaves and flowers
of which are eaten at our tables : and that red and
white cabbage, and the giant cow-cabbage, and

the delicate brocoli, had so humble an origin, not
to exclude that familiar vegetable, of which Dr.
Johnson most unsentimentally declared, " Of all
the flowers of the garden,   I like the cauliflower."
The Doctor should have lived at Tarragona, where
the cauliflower is said to reach the enormous
weight of forty pounds.       No instance exists in
which a vegetable is so altered by culture from its
original condition. Our kitchen-gardens, with their
compact cabbages, their Brussels sprouts and
Savoys, indicate this; but this is little compared
to the tall Caesarean cow-cabbage, which from its
arborescent nature is called the tree-kale, and
which in La Vendee is said to be sixteen feet
high ; while one of its varieties, the palm-kale, is
commonly ten or twelve feet in height, with a
heart sweet and tender enough to fit it for the
food of man, and leaves which furnish a plentiful
nutriment for animals. Our cliff cabbage is fre
quently gathered from the heights in the neigh
bourhood where it is abundant, and is said to be
a good boiled vegetable, but its uncooked leaves
are very bitter to the taste.      It was very early
cultivated; indeed, from time immemorial some
of its numerous varieties have been valued, though
the common variety with a close compact heart,
peculiarly called cabbage, was for some years
imported from Holland into this country.          Sir
Anthony Ashley first cultivated it in England :
but it was more than a century before its culture
became so general as to render importation from
 Holland unnecessary. This grower of our esculent
plant is said to have had a cabbage sculptured on his
monument at Wimborne St. Giles, in Dorsetshire,
in memory of this service rendered to his country.

   The kale or colewort of the gardener, is another
variety of this sea-side cabbage.     Of this kind is
made the sauerkraut of the Germans, and it is
probable that several varieties were formerly in
cluded in this name, as kale is mentioned among
the oldest English records, and the Saxon name
for our month of February, when leaves begin
again to clothe the ground, was Sprout- Kale. It
is at this season that the sprouts from the old
cabbage-stalks become fit for use, and hence their
name for the month. The brassica was cultivated
by the Romans, and also by the ancient Germans
from very remote periods, and this, the botanic
name of the genus, seems to have been derived
from the Celtic word Bresic, a cabbage.
   The flowers of the cabbage are of the form
termed by botanists cruciferous, and are shaped
like a cross, as in the single stock or wall-flower of
the garden. This is a numerous family of plants,
and to it belong a very large number of our escu
lent vegetables, as the turnip, the cresses, the
radishes, and many of our wild and garden flowers,
as the stocks, and rockets, and alyssums.       Plants
of this tribe universally possess stimulant qualities,
combined with an acrid flavour ; and none of the
family are poisonous. The roots, leaves, stems,
and buds of many of these plants are used as food ;
and in all cases their seeds abound in a fixed oil,
which is expressed from some species for various
economical purposes.     They may always be known
by the shape of their flowers ; and they are more
numerous in Europe than in either of the other
great divisions of the globe.      In our own land
some of their number are to be found in almost
every field.

24                 SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
   Among the clefts of the rocks we may, in the
months of July and August, see the tufted pink
blossoms of the common Thrift, or sea Gillyflower
(Statice armeria), called by the French, Spanish
turf, and by the Italians, Ladies' pins ; while our
old English writers term it Ladies' cushions, and
sea grass. We have the name of Statice from the
Greeks, but they probably applied it to another
plant. It signified to stop or arrest, and is now
appropriated to an extensive genus, whose wiry
and entangled stems seem well formed to stop the
hasty footstep of the passenger over the cliff, or
sandy ground, or muddy shore, where they grow.
But the familiar names of our wild flowers — those
by which they are known in country places — are
often expressive of some hue, or form, or supposed
virtue, or they tell a tale of spots where they grow;
and the old name of thrift is a good one for the
common plant of our sea shore, for it needs no rich
 soil, but grows on loftiest mountains and on boggy
 shores, and in crevices of maritime rocks, through
out Europe, as well as in North America. Lightfoot
 well designates it " the most humble and most lofty
of plants." On some of the highest of the Scottish
mountains this little flower rears its head, and
Balfour says that he has gathered it from the
summit of Muich Dhui, a mountain only second in
height to Ben Nevis. It has been proved that
this, and some similar plants, differ in their consti
tuents according to the situations in which they
grow. When adorning the sea shore, they contain
salts of soda and iodine ; but when they grow in
land they lose the iodine, and exchange soda for
potash. We have all seen the pink tufts and grass-
like leaves of the thrift growing around the city

                      SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                            25
garden, and even the smoke of London seems
scarcely to hurt its hardy little flowers.                Though
generally pink, yet in Cornwall it is often of a pure
white colour. Its roots, cut in slices and boiled in
milk, are said by Neill to have been formerly
highly valued in the Orkneys as a cure for pul
monary consumption.
   The Sea Lavender, or Lavender Thrift (Statice
limonium), though a flower quite unlike, in general
appearance, to the sea gillyflower, belongs to the
same genus of plants ; but this never grows on the
   SPIKED THRIFT (Statice spothulata), AND COMMON THRIFT (Statice
                               armeria).

rocky height, but blooms during July and August,
in salt marshes and on muddy shores. It has flat
bunches of close spikes of lavender-coloured flowers,
which, however, have not the perfume of the gar
den lavender, and large, thick, leathery leaves,
about five or six inches high.            It is called the
spreading spiked thrift, to distinguish it from a
third species which grows on some parts of the
sea-shore of Kent, at Whitehaven, on the Mull of
Galloway, and on some other spots, both of Eng
land and Ireland; but it is not, like the other
species, a common plant.             This is the Upright
Spiked Thrift (Statice spathulata), which has more
slender branches of flowers, and blossoms in August.
Both the last species and this are rare in Scotland,
and rare in every part of the United Kingdom is
the plant called Matted Thrift (Statice reticulata),
which has small, crowded, purplish-blue flowers,
and grows on the sea-shore at Norfolk.                They
have all scentless blossoms, and leaves somewhat
succulent and of saltish flavour, but are very pretty
plants ; and they retain so much of their beauty
when dried, that they do well to mingle with the
groups of grasses which sometimes ornament the
chimney-piece.
   We do not find rich green meadows growing
down close by the sea-side, but the short grasses
which cover the cliffs or downs open to the sea
breezes, have among them many lovely little
flowers ; and we can enjoy the music of the waves,
when amid our summer rambles we come upon
such a spot as Miss Barrett describes            :
                                                   —
          " A  nook that openeth unto
            The glorious ocean's stedfast view,
            Being most closely shut from all
            Its kindred earth's sweet pastoral !

                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                    27
             And yet its banks too smooth and steep
             To be o'erbrowsed by the sheep,
             Withal are slanted very greenly ;
             And flowers and grasses so serenely
             Grow up them, that I ween the sea
             Whereto their dewed faces be,
             Doth serve them for another sky,
             As warm and blue as that on high."
  We    have no marine grasses, yet we have some
essentially maritime, and others peculiar to sandy
districts, — grasses which are so valuable to our
shores, that we should be unwilling to look on
them with careless eye. They might speak to us
of the providential care of the almighty Creator
and Preserver of the world, and are among those
silent utterances of the universe which show forth
his praise.    Some are to be found on almost all
our coasts : some, in small green patches, lie like
oases among the barren sands or shingle. They
show God's care over minutest things, and so should
have their cheering influence over our spirits while
the great element itself    as Keats said, " no mean
                             is,
comforter, while the earth       our throne, and the
                                   is
sea, likea  mighty minstrel, playing before it, able,
like David's harp, to make such as we forget almost
the tempest cares of life."
   Most persons who frequent the coast have
remarked the sand sedges and sand grasses so often
grouped or scattered there.       Thus we have our
sea-side barley, sea wheat-grass, sea cat's-tail, and
other grasses, besides several of the rush and reed
tribe, all contributing in     lesser degree, to bind
                                   a
down the driving sands, and some more important
ones which will be named.        Some of the grasses
and sedges of the salt marshes, at little distance
                                          a
from the sea, afford     saline vegetation very ser
                         a
viceable to cattle.     But the sand sedges and

28                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
grasses of the shore have, in general, a far more
important office than that of even giving suste
nance to the beasts of the field. They serve to
bind the sands by their long roots, so that our sea
sands are not driven inland by the stormy winter
winds, which in their strength have been known
to carry the salt spray of ocean to a distance of
fifty miles from the shore.     Some of the grasses
destined for this especial purpose, as the upright
sea lyme-grass, flower but rarely, and few ripen
their seeds by the shore. Indeed, in such unshel
tered situations it would be of little use that they
should do so, for the high winds which prevail there
would either bear their seeds far away to some in
land soil, or cast them on the waters of ocean, where
they would float and die. But grasses growing on
sandy spots are either viviparous, and bear young
plants instead of seeds, or, like those of our shores
in general, they are propagated by means of sub
terranean shoots. Wide-spreading shoots, increas
ing continually by these suckers, give their value
to sea-side grasses ; and were it not for their aid,
inland regions would be desolated by the loose
sand of the large sand-banks which, on some shores,
the mighty ocean washes up from its bed.          The
excessively long and creeping roots of the great
sea-carex, as well as those of the upright sea lyme-
grass, and the sea reed or matweed, are often
planted, that they may hold the sand together. In
 Holland, and in our own county of Norfolk, these
grasses have been cultivated in order to restrain
the deluges of sand to which these places would be
 subject. It has been providentially appointed that
no animal will touch this grass for pasturage. In
Norfolk, where its service is very great, it is called

 Marram, a name much resembling Muran, which
 is its name in the Gaelic language.        The Dutch
 owe to these grasses the greater part of their
country, which but for the sand-banks, held down
by their roots, would have long since been swept
into the sea. The fact     is,that the sea retires from
some shores and encroaches upon others and such ;
is  the situation of the town of Hull, in Yorkshire,
that        generally believed    would long ago have
     it
     is                          it
been covered by the waves were             not for the

sand-banks at Spurn Point, on which their full
forceis   borne, before they reach the town. These
sea-side grasses bind together this useful natural
fortification, and thus Hull, like some places on
the Welsh coast, and like the shores of France
which lie between Boulogne and Dunkirk, espe
cially in the tract near Calais,     saved by its sand
                                      is
banks, thus preserved from dispersion by the strong
matwork of roots running under the surface of
their soil. In the sandy soils of Upper and Lower
Egypt, the driving sands have buried cities, the
ruins of which still appear among the wide-spread
heaps.
           " Nothing can be more melancholy," says
 M. Denon, " than to walk over villages swallowed
up by the sands of the desert to trample under
                                  ;
foot their roofs ;   to strike against the summits of
their minarets to reflect that yonder were culti
                 :
vated fields that there grew trees that here were
            ;                              ;
even the dwellings of men, and that all have
vanished."
     But
       it   is not only in countries remarkable for
large tracts of sandy soil that whole regions have,
by    the action of the winds, been converted into
deserts. Beautiful and fertile districts in our own
country, lands of cornfields and meadows, and trees

30                 SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
and flowers, have been overwhelmed by the sand.
In some cases this has been owing to the folly of
some persons in the neighbourhood, who have
persisted in gathering the grasses for fuel.    God
has given to the animals the instinct by which they
refuse to eat the mat-grass ; to man he gives the
higher faculty of reason, which should have taught
him to leave it untouched ; yet let us not blame
ignorance, unless our consciences tell us that we
are doing all in our power to lessen it. With such
perseverance have the peasantry on some shores
of our island continued to uproot the grasses, un
mindful of all but their own present convenience,
that an Act of Parliament was passed, rendering
the destruction of these grasses punishable by law.
   Burnet mentions several instances of the destruc
tion of property caused by the incursion of sands
upon fertile regions. Among others, he informs
us that near Downham, in Suffolk, the sand-hills
have encroached five miles during the last century;
and that in some parts of Scotland, hundreds of
acres have been entirely devastated. He also refers
to the well-known case of the Coubin estate, near
Fores, which was at one time worth three hundred
pounds per annum, but which has long been
overwhelmed by sand.         This terrible calamity
befel this estate in 1769; and so rapid were
the encroachments of the sand, which came upon it
 in sweeping heaps, that an apple-tree which grew
 there, was, in the course of the season, so buried
 as that nothing but the summit remained visible.
 This catastrophe was occasioned by the reckless
 pulling up by the roots, of a quantity of mat-.
 grass, when some trees were cut down.
    The difficulty of describing the grasses without

                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                  31
using botanical terms, renders it undesirable in a
little volume of this kind, to dwell at length on
any but those which seem, in an especial manner,
to have been given by the great Creator to our
shores for the purpose of holding them down. Of
these, the common Sea-reed, or Matweed (Ammo-
phila arundinacea) , is the most useful, because it
is so common a grass. It is entirely a maritime
grass, never found but on loose, driving sands, or
on such as were formerly so ; and as these by
degrees become consolidated, so, when the grass
has effected the purpose for which it was designed,
it gradually pines away, and we find it no more.
Very few of its seeds are perfected, but such as
ripen fall on the soil where they grow ; for, unlike
other grasses of this genus, this plant is destitute of
the loMg tufts of wool at the base of each floret,
which serve as wings to the seed, and the tiny tufts
formed on this are insufficient for the purpose of
bearing it away on the winds. Its creeping root
is often twenty feet long, and it has a stiff, green
ish-yellow stem, about two or three feet high,
and long, narrow, glaucous leaves.       It flowers in
July. It is often manufactured into door-mats and
brushes, and in the Hebrides it is used for various
purposes.    It is twisted into ropes, woven into
mats for pack-saddles, and into bags for holding
meal and grain ; while a common sort of hat is
made of its straw, It has also been planted in
many places for preventing sand-drift.
   Not less serviceable to the shores on which it
grows, though far less frequent a plant than the
matweed, is the Upright Sea Lyme-grass (Elymus
arenarius).   This is a grass which, if the reader
should chance to meet with, he cannot easily over

look.   Few of our native plants are more con
spicuous than this, as its tall stem rises four or
five feet in height, and its long leaves are so
glaucous, that they look remarkable for their
blueness of tint, even long before we come near
them. This plant may be known from the mat-
weed by its leaves, which are quite flat, and rather
broad and slightly notched at the edges ; but it
chooses for its growth just the same situation
as that.  Its roots are even tougher and longer,
and they form a superior matwork under the soil
to those of any other plant.      Knapp remarks of
it, " This fine grass not the promiscuous produc
                        is

dreds of miles of our coasts, and be disappointed in
the end. We have seen         in Norfolk bufc at the
                              it          ;
mouth of the Tees in Durham, called the Snook
of Seaton,   itabounds, producing in that situation
a larger number of spikes than we have seen else
where."     A coarse sort of fabric was formerly
made of its leaves      ;hence its botanic name of
Elymus  is   taken from      Greek word, signifying
                             is a

though, in analyzing the soluble matter of the
grass, Sir Humphry Davy found             to contain
                                          it
more than one-third of its weight in sugar, yet
none of our domestic animals will eat it. And so
the plant grows uninjured, and spreads life around
on the else desert sands; for under its shadow
rises up many     a  tuft of grass and tiny flower,
which can find soil firm enough around its roots
                  a

grass-like plants which offer some resistance to
the sand storm.      It is a smaller plant, with tri
angular rough stems, scarcely more than a foot
high, and yellow spikes of flowers; hut it is so
common, that it is truly a serviceable sedge on
our coasts, its wide and numerous suckers creep
ing among the loose sands. Several sedge plants
are equally useful in other places, for in some
cases they are the only vegetation on swamps, and,
by their growth and decay, ultimately prepare
a soil fitted for the growth of pasture.
   Our mat-grass or sea-reed seems to be one of
the grasses called bents by our older writers,
 " with which we in London," says Gerarde, " do
usually adorn our chimneys in summer-time, and
we commonly call the bundle of               it,
                                         handsomely
made Ap for use, by the name of bents." According
to the old poets, there was regular succession of
                                   a
these simple chimney ornaments, suitable to the
season.     Thus Herrick, having named some of
those of the earlier months, says, —
          " When yew  out, then birch comes in,
                        is
             And many flowers beside,

             With cooler oaken boughs,
           Come in for comely ornaments
             To readorn the house."
And though  the various kinds of reeds and rushes,
and grassy plants, are not of domestic value, as
they were when they were strewed on floors, and
when men blamed Cardinal Wolsey for his extra
vagance, because he had his strewings changed so
often, yet in villages, remote from large cities, the
sedge has its economical purposes, as the dim

rushlight in the cottage, and the homely chair, and
the useful basket might show.
    We might look on the reeds and rushes too
with the eye of a philosopher, as did Baron Hum-
boldt, when he saw the young Indian drawing
a sweet and plaintive accompaniment from an in
strument made of a series of reeds. " The Greeks
said with truth," observes this writer, " that reeds
had contributed to subjugate nations by furnishing
arrows ; to soften men's manners by the charm of
music : and to unfold their understanding by
affording the first instruments for tracing letters."
And we have seen, too, that to reeds of the shore
men are indebted for the very ground they tread on,
and for the clearness of the air which they breathe.
    Growing sometimes close by the sand-grasses,
 sometimes on banks and among pastures at a
little distance, some of the pretty little flowers
 called the sandworts are plentiful on our shores ;
 and the name of the genus, arenaria, from Arena,
 sand, is significant of the soils on which they
 grow.    Far away in sandy fields and on heath-
 lands, in woods, in pastures, and on high moun
 tains, thousands of them are found in our summer
 months, and one of the species considered as pe
 culiar to the sea shore,is,  by many good botanists,
 thought to be but  a    variety of the purple sand-
 wort of our gravelly or sandy lands. This    is  the
 Sea Spurrey Sandwort (Arenaria marina), which
is  very common near the sea, and,        the same as
                                         if
 the inland species, yet       it   is
                                    certainly usually
 larger  and  stouter in  its appearance when grow
 ing on the coast. It has small purple, star-like
                               a
 flower, with fleshy stem, and leaves of equal
  succulence, of semi-cylindrical shape, and scarcely

                     SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                  35
 thicker than the stem.          The numerous blossoms
 grow close down between the stem and leaves.
 This little flower opens at nine in the morning,
 and closes between two and three o'clock in the
 afternoon.      Charlotte Smith notices its early
 closing in one of her poems : —
           " Among the loose and arid sands
                The humble Arenaria creeps ;
             Slowly the purple star expands,
               But soon within its calyx sleeps.
           " And those small bells so
                                      lightly ray'd
               In young Aurora's rosy    hue,
             Are to the noontide sun display'd,
               But shut their plaits against the dew."
    A  much larger and more conspicuous plant
 than this is the sea sandwort (Arenaria peploides),
 which is very common.            On our sea-side sands,
the first-named species would perhaps be scarcely
 seen, except by botanists, and by children who
 espy the smallest flowers; but large patches of the
sea sandwort, with their smooth shining fleshy
leaves, cannot be unnoticed. The flowers are, how
ever, very small ; and as they will not open in the
shade, and close very early, extensive clumps of the
leaves may be found, on which the casual observer
would believe no flower ever opened to the sun.
The Icelanders, who use several wild flowers as
our sweet thyme, and others, to flavour their sour
whey, make much use of the sea sandwort for this
purpose.     They steep this plant in the whey
when it ferments ; they then strain it off the liquid,
and add fresh water to the beverage, which is said,
when thus prepared, to taste like olive oil. Some
species of Arenaria grow on the very borders of
the snow on the Swiss mountains, and several are
found on the high mountains of Dauphine.

36                 SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
   A little   spreading plant, with linear leaves,
called the sea pearl-wort (Sagina maritima), is very
common on the sea-coasts of England, Ireland,
and Scotland.     Those who know our other two
species of pearl-wort, would at once recognise
this, but it has no bright petals to invite attention.
Its little green calyx is its only flower. The
stems are about two inches high, spreading at the
base, and its leaves are slender, smooth, and suc
culent. The stems and flower-cups are often quite
reddish or purplish in tint.       It blossoms from
May to August.
   No pretensions to beauty have the tribe of
plants which will next be noticed, but they are a
marked feature of sea-side vegetation, on some of
our shores where they abound.          These are the
different species of atriplex, or orache, some of
which are to be found on almost all parts of our
coast.    They have mostly grey, or indeed whitish
green leaves, and the flowers usually grow in
green, or yellow, or reddish coloured spikes; but
excepting when they are red, are not at all showy
blossoms.     The leaves of the shrubly orache, or
sea purslane (Atriplex portulacoides), are of a sil
very whiteness.     This shrub -like plant, however,
is not common, though it grows on muddy sea
shores of some parts of England and Ireland. Its
stems are one or two feet high, and its flowers,
which appear in July and August, are small, and
 of a yellowish green. It makes a good pickle.
   The frosted sea orache (Atriplex laciniata) is by
no means uncommon on sandy shores, and has much
broader leaves than the shrubly kind. The whole
plant looks as if covered thickly with hoar frost.
 In salt marshes, as well as on waste inland grounds,

                    SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                  37
the    spreading halberd-leaved orache (Atriplex
patula) is also very frequent, growing, indeed,
everywhere, but becoming, when near the sea,
much more succulent and reddish in tint.           Its
leaves are, when not thus red, of a dull green
and mealy surface, and their triangular forms
lobed at the base, are well expressed by the
specific name.      Then there is the grass-leaved
orache (Atriplex littoralis), with its grass-like foli
age, found chiefly on the East coast in muddy salt
marshes; and the stalked sea orache (Atriplex
pedunculata), with its zigzag stem and spreading
 branches, which flourishes on the muddy salt
 marshes of the East and South-eastern coasts
 of England, and is well known to botanists by
 the scaly mealiness with which the whole plant is
 covered.     It is sometimes found on the muddy
 shores of rivers, and Sir J. E. Smith gathered it
 from the borders of the Ouse, just below Lynn.
 It is occasionally cooked for food, but unless cut
 while very young the stalks become tough and
 unfit for use. The tall shrubby orache, which we
 often see cultivated in our gardens for its beautiful
 silver-coloured foliage,  is,when wild, a   maritime
 plant, and    isbrought from the shores of Southern
 Europe and one species of this plant, called the
           ;
 garden orache, or mountain spinach, was formerly
  cultivated as culinary herb.
                a                  Several species are
 valued on the continent as edible vegetables and ;
  in the neighbourhood of Paris the orache   isplanted
  to  a great extent for the Paris market.
     It diflicult, by description, to convey to the

   only in their general aspect, but also in their pro
   perties.   We have thirteen British species of
   goosefoot, several of which grow near the sea.
   There is the shrubby sea-side goosefoot (Chenopo-
   dium fruticosum), a somewhat rare plant, yet found
   on the coasts of Devonshire, Cornwall, Suffolk,
   and Dorsetshire, and also on the Norfolk shore.
   It was formerly termed the shrubby saltwort, and
  was first discovered in this country in the time of
  Ray, by Sir Thomas Browne, the author of the
  Religio Medici. It is an elegant evergreen, and
  its leaves have a saltish and somewhat acrimonious
  flavour.
      The annual sea-side goosefoot or sea-side blite
  (Chenopodium maritimum), is a very common plant
  on our sea-shores, and the many-spiked goosefoot
  (Chenopodium botryodes), with its triangular leaves,
  grows on some cliffs by the sea; but there is one
  kind, equally frequent with the former, growing
  especially on the coast, but found also on waste
 places and on walls, far from the shore, and it
  certainly deserves its most inelegant name of
  stinking goosefoot.     It may at once be known
 from all the other kinds by its odour, which is
  such as would not induce us to gather it.         Its
 small leaves and stems are greasy to the touch,
 and covered over with a powdery substance, which,
 when bruised, causes the offensive scent. Professor
 Hooker well compares this to the smell of putrid
 fish.    Nor can we remember any plant of our
 lands more disgusting in perfume, except some of
the mushroom tribe. Yet this goosefoot is a really
 valuable anti-spasmodic medicine, and is held in
 great repute, not only by village doctors, but
large quantities were, until recently, sent to

 Covent Garden market from some extensive plan
tation of this vegetable at Mitcham.
   Several of the goosefoots are commonly boiled
as greens for the table, and several are planted for
this purpose.    Our own sea-side goosefoot is one
of the best of our native species for food. The
plant called Good King Henry, or mercury goose-
foot (Chenopodium Bonus Henricus), a very com
mon kind, growing on waste places and way-sides,
with large dark green triangular arrow-shaped
leaves, was formerly very generally sown in gar
dens for spinach, and is still planted in some
places, for it is very hardy, requiring little care,
and early coming into leaf. The name of good
was probably given to     it,
                            however, rather because
of its supposed virtue in healing wounds, than for
its excellency as  a table vegetable.   Our sea-side
species yields soda, and   isoften gathered for this,
with the saltwort and other maritime plants, from
shores where it  abounds. This substance   islargely
produced by several of the orache tribe         and,
                                                ;
indeed, almost all our sea-side vegetation furnishes
it in greater or less degree. Some of the goose-
     a
foots are common articles of food in Peru; and
when the mummy cases of the ancient Guanches
of Teneriffe have been opened,    ithas been found,
that among the aromatic plants used there in ancient
 days to make this mortal frame immortal, the
Mexican goosefoot (Chenopodium ambrosioides) was
constantly present.
   The plant of our waste places near the sea,
called the stinking goosefoot, has been remarked
by M. Chevalier, to give out pure ammonia, during
its whole existence.   Dr. Lindley remarks on this
fact :
      " This  is the only observation on record, of

40                 SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
a gaseous exhalation    of azote, by vegetables  ; and
the facility with which this principle is abandoned
by ammonia, may perhaps explain the presence of
azotic products in the vegetable kingdom."
    Of all our sea-side plants, boiled for table vege
tables, the one which seems to the writer of these
pages most to deserve commendation for the pur
pose, is the sea-beet (Beta maritima).          Unlike
the silvery glaucous foliage of the orache and
goosefoot, the leaves of this plant are of a deep
rich green colour, very succulent and wavy at the
edges. The stems are angular, grow down near
the ground, and are one or two feet long, and the
flowers are green, and appear in August.         When
properly boiled, it has the appearance and full
flavour of the cultivated spinach; indeed, it is
rather superior to that plant, but if not gathered
while young, the vegetable becomes too strongly
bitter. It is not general around our coasts, but
in some places in England it is very abundant,
and it grows also on the southern shores of Scot
land. At Dovor it is plentiful, not only on the
cliffs, but on the upper part of the beach, where a
grassy spot may sometimes be seen, on which the
bright blue viper's bugloss rises above its prickly
stems, and no less prickly leaves; and the lilac
mallow, and the yellow dandelion and hawkweed,
 unite with clumps of orache and sea-beet to
 make a green and gay patch on the stones.          On
 some parts of the coast it is gathered from the
 cliff or the muddy shore for food, yet it is often
 left unnoticed. The English proverb, which our
 old writer, Fuller, so often quotes, " Fetched far,
 and cost dear, is fit for ladies," applies, seemingly,
 as well to the other portion of humanity as to the

                    SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                41
fair sex. This sea-side spinach is certainly very
wholesome, and if it were not a wild plant would
be in much request.    The roots of all the beets
contain much saccharine matter, and the well-
known   experiments    of the French on another
species, the red beet, for the purpose of obtaining
sugar, need not be referred to. No such quantity
of sugary substance is yielded by other European
esculents as by this.    This plant is also common
as a culinary root, and is also frequently used for
salads, and its deep red colour deserves the name
given to the whole tribe by our Saxon ancestors ;
for " beet " appears to be the corruption of their
word "bet," which signified "red." The Italians
call the plant Barba Brettola, and the French term
it Betterave. The juice of our common beet is said
to cure head-ache, and if drawn up the nostrils to
occasion sneezing.
    We have not more than three or four shrubs
which can be called natives of our British shores ;
the yellow furze bush, however (Ulex Europaus),
 may be very well planted there, for it will bear all
 the rough winds and the salt spray, and still be
 rich with golden blossoms almost throughout the
 year.   One of our most beautiful sea-side shrubs
 is the tree mallow (Lavatera arborea), and even
 this is better known by its place in our shrub-
 berries than by its frequent growth on the cliffs of
 our island;  it,however, adorns some of the rocks
 on the south and south-west shores of England
 and the eastern shores of Scotland.        The Rev.
J.  A. Johns, in his interesting work, called " A
 Week at the Lizard," says of it—" It      is   a large
 and picturesque plant, and chooses to perch itself
 on the insulated rocks all along this coast, in which

                   SEA-SIDE    PLANTS.
situation it sends up its rigid erect stem in defiance
of wind and storm. It varies in height from two
feet or more."      It is very ornamental to spots
               TREE MALLOW (Lavcuera arborea).
where it abounds, for      it  has large purplish rose-
coloured darkly veined flowers, shaped like those
of the common mallow of our fields, and darken-

    ing in colour  at the base of their bell-like vases.
    It has leaves downy and soft as velvet, plaited and
    lobed with seven angles ; and though of a shrubby
    nature, yet it is sometimes six feet high, and its
    round stem branches chiefly at the top, where it
    forms a leafy canopy.    It adorns an islet off the
    coast of Anglesea, but always grows wild on in
    sulated maritime rocks. On the Bass rock, that
    lonely island in the midst of the waters, so re
    nowned in Scottish history, it thrives well ; and
    Balfour, who has given us some account of the
    botany of that island, says that the tree mallow is
    the most important plant which grows there. This
    author observes that the Lavatera, according to
     Sibbald, existed at one time on other islands of
    the Frith of Forth, as on Inch Garvie and Inch
    Mykrie ; but that it has now disappeared. He
    adds, that on the rocks, below the fortifications of
    the Bass rock, it grows in great profusion, and
    that in the month of July the place is quite gor
    geous with its flowers.   It also adorns the Ailsa
    Crag.    Like all the mallow tribe, this plant is
    very mucilaginous in its properties ; and its fibres
    are so tenacious as to fit them for making useful
    and strong ropes and cordage. Its name of Lava
    tera was given to it by Tournefort, in honour of
    two physicians who were friends of that botanist,
    but who are not known as men of science, and
    were no way related to the celebrated physiogno
    mist of that name.
       The shrub, which, because we see it so much
    in sea-side gardens, seems more than any other
    to be characteristic of our shores, and yet which
'   is, by some writers, thought rather to be a natu
    ralized than an indigenous plant,     isthe French

44                SKA-SIDE PLANTS.
Tamarisk (Tamarix gallica).      On many parts of
the British coast it is unknown as a wild plant,
but it is plentiful on the rocks, cliffs, and sandy
shores by the sea, about the Lizard and St.
Michael's, Cornwall ; and grows near Hurst
Castle, Hastings, at Sandgate in Kent, and on
several parts of the southern shores of England.
Its leaves are of a pale sea-green, and its young
twigs are red. The blossoms come upon this
shrub in July, and are most elegant feathery spikes
of pink flowers. Fuller says that the Tamarisk
was first brought from Switzerland into England
by Bishop Grindal, when he returned from the
exile into which he had been sent in the reign of
Queen Mary, and planted it in his garden in his
native land. It grows abundantly on the Tanaris,
now called the Tambra, on the Spanish side of the
Pyrenees, and hence the plant was named from
the Tamarisci, the people who inhabit these coun
tries. Very pretty hedges of it grow luxuriantly
around Boulogne, on the French coast, and Sir
 J. E. Smith observed there that the sheep so pre
ferred its branches to any other herbage, that they
never touched another plant so long as its boughs
 grew within their reach.     It is one of the most
common productions of the Arabian desert, where
its green leaves afford a welcome, though slight
 shadow, and the camels crop its graceful branches.
 The Oriental Tamarisk is by pre-eminence the
 tree of Egypt, for on its saline and sandy soils no
 other tree rises which can give wood enough for
 fuel or for furniture but this. They call it the
 Atle, and the Egyptians have a proverb, that the
 world would go ill with them if Atles were to fail.
    Our French Tamarisk, when it attains any size,

                    SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                 45
has a very hard wood. Fuller refers to the prac
tice of making cups of this wood in his time ; and
Gerarde records, as a fact, the fiction that ale or
beer is the more wholesome when drunk from a
cup of Tamarisk wood.         Our forefathers thought,
too, that their meat was the sweeter if roasted on
a spit made of the wood of this shrub. It has one
sad historic association, however, for the Romans
were accustomed to bind a garland of its cypress-
like boughs around the brow of the criminal con
 demned to execution, and from its frequent use in
these mournful wreaths, it was called the unhappy
 Tamarisk.
     More frequent than any other wild shrub on our
 shores is the common sallow-thorn, or sea Buck
 thorn (HippophaR rhamnoides) , which, because of
 its pretty silvery foliage, is often honoured with a
 place in our garden or shrubbery.       It is common
 on the sand-hills and cliffs of the east and south
 eastern coasts of England : and the small green
 flowers come out at the same season as the young
 slender leaves, in the month of May. It is a
 thorny shrub, and smaller when wild than when
 planted in gardens, seldom reaching, on the cliff,
 the height of five feet. In autumn the shrub is
 bright with the deep orange-coloured berries,
 which it bears in great profusion, and which are
 really very pleasant fruits, of an acid flavour, and
 very juicy. These berries are much eaten by the
 Tartars, and the fishermen of the Gulf of Bothnia
  gather baskets full of them in autumn for the use
 of their families ; and a preserve is made of them
 which imparts a delicious flavour to fresh fish. The
  leaves are of a very dark green above, but beneath
  are very silvery.   Stems, roots, and foliage, are all

 46                SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
 full of a yellow dye, which they impart readily.
 This plant never grows wild inland, though it does
 not require a saline air or soil.
    A flower called the sea campion, or catchfly
 (Silene maritima), is very frequent on the sea-shore
 above the water-mark, and it grows too beside
 some of those clear rivulets which run along the
 Alpine hills of Wales, and other mountainous
 parts of our island.   It very much resembles that
 common flower of our hedges and pastures, the
 bladder campion, and has the same glaucous green
leaves, and bladder-like flower-cup, beautifully
 marked with a net-work of purple veins. Like
 that, too, it has the white starry flower, but its
blossoms are generally larger.      Some writers con
 sider it only a variety of this bladder campion,
 altered, in some of its features, by its place of
 growth. This genus was named catchfly, from the
viscous substance which is found on the stems and
leaves of some of the species, but it is not on this.
It has a creeping root, and the stems are often
 quite prostrate near their sandy bed.        It has
generally but one flower, though sometimes a
little cluster of two or three may be found on the
 summit of its stem.
    One of the most common of the little flowers
which grow on our muddy shores and salt marshes
is the sea milkwort, sometimes called the black
saltwort (Glaux maritima).         It may be easily
described so as to be known when seen even by a
reader unacquainted with botany.        It has stout
branched stems, often lying on the ground, and
about three or four, or sometimes even five inches
long. The leaves are of a glaucous green tint,
opposite to each other on the stalk, and are small

                   SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                 47
 and succulent, and without leaf-stalks. Pretty
 little pink flowers, freckled with red spots, may be
 seen on it in June and July, growing singly be
 tween the leaves and stem. London observes of
 this little plant, that it is well adapted for pots
 and rock- work, and that it will grow at a distance
 from the sea, if the sand on which it must be
 planted is kept well moistened.      It rarely grows
 wild inland, except on the shores of salt rivers.
     Far less frequent, but an equally pretty little
 blossom, is the creeping pale-blue toad-flax (Lina-
 ria repens), which grows on chalky banks and
 rocks on some parts of the sea-side. The flowers
 are shaped like those of the common yellow toad
 flax, but are blue and yellow. It blooms in July
 and the two following months.
     Not unfrequently we may find, on rocky or
 sandy places about our coast, some handsome tufts
 of the white English stonecrop (Sedum Anglicum) .
Both in Scotland and Ireland this plant is abun
 dant, not only on cliffs near the sea, but upon
inland rocks ; and there are some shores of Eng
land on which it is one of the prettiest plants. Its
leaves are very succulent, and have somewhat of
the sea-green tint, and its flowers, which are at
first thickly clustered, but afterwards open into a
larger and more scattered bunch, are beautiful
white star-like blossoms, with purple anthers, and
a reddish mark on each petal besides being gene
rally covered at the tips with rosy spots. Few
would pass it by without notice when, in July, it
opens its flowers to the sunshine.      It is one of a
large class of plants, all natives of sandy or stony
soils, and all having the succulent foliage, and the
small roots of plants destined rather to thrive on

48                SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
rains and dews than on the substances sucked up
by roots from soils. Several of the Sedums, among
them the common yellow stonecrop of our walls,
were formerly used as a medicine, and another was
one of the plants much used in London for the
burning of bonfires on St. John's Eve. This was
the Orpine, or Live-long (Sedum Telephium).
These plants were, some centuries since, com
monly called Midsummer men ; and an old herbal
records of the Orpine, " The people of the country
delight much to set it in pots and shelles on Mid
summer Even, or upon timber, slates, or trenchers
daubed with clay, and so to set or hang it up in
their houses, where it remaineth greene a long
season, and groweth, if it be sometimes over
sprinkled with water."
   There is a plant found on our sea-side cliffs, but
which is more abundant on the high mountains at
the north of England and Ireland, as well as the
north-west of Scotland, where it is very common.
This is the rose root (Rhodiola rosea). To such of
our readers as know the Orpine, we may say that
this plant very much resembles it in its appear
ance. The blossoms are yellow, and grow in small
compact clusters.    The leaves are crowded about
the stem, and are of a broad oblong shape, and
notched at the edges ; in some specimens they are
much tinged with red, and they are very juicy.
The root is large and woody, and when dried in
the sun, it yields an odour which is scarcely in
ferior to that of the blossom of the rose. It is a
small plant, seldom exceeding ten inches in height,
and without branches.
   One species of our wild docks grows especially
on salt marshes, near the sea.    The Golden Dock

                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                 49
(Rumex maritimus) has flowers of a bright orange
colour, in crowded whorls, on an angular furrowed
stem, about one or two feet in height, and long
narrow leaves. It is well named, for the whole
plant, in process of time, becomes of a golden hue.
The docks generally are well known to those at
all familiar with flowers, and this has much simi
larity to the other species. They have little beauty
to recommend them to notice, and cultivators of
land well know the trouble given by the dock
plants.     Some of them, however, have very large
and handsome leaves, which the artist welcomes as a
suitable ornament to the foregrounds of his picture.
This family of plants produces an immense number
of seeds, and ripens them so rapidly, that were it
not, that being heavy, they are less easily dispersed
than others, and will not, like the thistle-down,
float far away on the summer air, the land would be
overrun with docks. Another circumstance which
renders them difficult of extirpation from the soil
is,  that unless the root  is   completely extracted,
little has been done; for     a very small remaining
portion will generate buds, and send shoots to the
surface.     In olden times, however, docks had their
repute as medicine; and the Alpine dock,      a   rare
British species, though common in France, was called
monk's rhubarb, from its frequent use in the mo
nasteries instead of the oriental plant.        Other
species have been used as external remedies, and
some cultivated as spinach.       Our common Red-
veined dock (Rumex Sanguineus), with its curled
leaves and red veins, is  said to be good vegetable
                                     a

they have grasped the blackberry or wild rose.
Most of us have fancied that it allayed the pain ;
and it may at least have the praise so often
bestowed by rural simplers, on their approved
remedies, that if it does no good, it will do no harm.
The golden dock of our salt marshes blooms in July
and August.
    An old writer on the art of Simpling, says of all
the plants of this genus, " Alle kinds of dock have
this property, that what flesh or meat is sod there
with, though it be never so old, hard, or tough, it
will become tender and meet to be eaten;" but it
would seem this, as well as some other herbs
named by old writers, had strangely lost their
ancient virtues.
    At about the same season of the year the rambler
of the sea-side may find two very pretty flowers
blooming on our sandy shores, and when they grow
in any quantity, giving a gay appearance to the
 spot.    One of them, however, is not a very
 common flower, though there are some places in
 which the Sea Bindweed, or Convolvulus, is plenti
ful. This pretty plant (Convolvolus Soldanella) has
large purplish-pink blossoms, with pale-yellow
 plaits, and succulent sea-green leaves. It is so frail
 a flower that we can scarcely gather     it,  andis   a
 native of the sea-coast of many parts of Europe
 and Asia. Its young stalks are sometimes pickled.
 The other flower, or rather flowers (for three species
 grow near the sea more than elsewhere), are the red
 Centauries. The dwarf-branched Centaury (Eryth-
 rtea pulchella)is common on the sandy sea-shores
 of England and Scotland, and        isgenerally about
 five or six inches high, with   a slender leafy stem.

afternoon. On similar places grows also the dwarf-
tufted Centaury (Erythraa littoralis), which is ge
nerally a lower growing plant, with a more dense
 cluster of blossoms, which appear a month earlier
in the year; while the broad-leaved Centaury
 (Erythraa latifolia) grows on the sea-shore with a

strong, stiff stem, and broader leaves. This species
is very frequent in the Outer Hebrides, where it
is gathered for the purpose of being infused in
spirits as a bitter. These three plants, as well as
the common Centaury of our inland pastures, are
thought by some writers to be all of one species,
varied only, in some slight particulars, by the cir
cumstances of soil and situation, which reminds us
of a celebrated botanist, who had written some
valuable papers on the rose, and who, on being
asked how many species there were, is said to have
                               I
replied, somewhat drily, " really cannot say, but
I am sure there is one."
    The Gentian is nearly allied to the Centaury, by
its intensely bitter principle, and until later years
the centauries were called gentians.         Our true
British gentians have all, however, deep blue or
purple flowers. The field Gentian (Gentiana cam-
pestris) is a beautiful purplish-blue flower, with
many blossoms, common in chalk or limestone soils,
and frequent in Scotland near the sea. This is one
of the plants used in Sweden instead of hops.
    A little flower called the Sea Heath (Frankenia
lavis), with slender, crowded leaves, wiry stems,
and p'ale rose-coloured blossoms, is sometimes found
on the salt marshes on the eastern coast, chiefly, of
England. It is not a common plant of our shores,
though it is so on many maritime places of Europe,
and on the Canary Isles it is very plentiful.
It is sometimes white. It is but an humble plant,
and so too is the powdery Sea Heath (Frankenia
pulverulent a), which is very seldom seen here, though
it has been found by botanists on the coast of Eng
land. This little flower grows plentifully by the
sea, in many parts of Europe and Asia. This genus

south-western coast of England, though but three
spots are named as its place of growth ; — the Star
Point, and the Slapham Sands of Devonshire,
 and the shores of the Loe Pool in Cornwall.            In
the latter place it thrives among the shingle, on
 several parts of the shore.            It always grows in
 places which in winter are covered by water. It
 has numerous slender leaves, somewhat fleshy,
 and very glaucous, and stems spreading over the
 ground, and numerous small white blossoms.
    In the South of England, too, as on the Babbi-
 combe rocks, by the sea, and on the rocks near
 Torquay, may be found the beautiful crumpled
 flowers of the white Mountain Rock-rose (Helian

 themum polifoUum), which is a shrubby plant, and
 so lovely a one that the botanist regrets that it is
 not more general around our island shores.
    A genus of plants which were highly valued some
 centuries since, for their antiscorbutic properties,
 and to which has therefore been given the name of
 Scurvy-grass, has several species, which grow com
 monly near the ocean, or on rocks which overhang
 its shores, or on the marshes which share their
 saline airs and soil.      The common Scurvy-grass
 ( Cochlearia officmalls) grows alike on rocks or muddy
 sea-sides, on the margins of salt rivers, and on the tops
 of elevated mountains ; and there is no doubt that
 it has powerful and valuable medicinal properties.
 Invalids often take its expressed juices ; and in days
when salad herbs were rarer in this country, this
 was cultivated for the purpose. It has thick succu
lent leaves, and white flowers, of the cruciferous
form, and blossoms in May or June. It may be
found on almost all parts of the coast in abundance.
The French term this plant Cranson offidnale, and
the Germans Loffelkraut . When fresh it has a
bitter and acrid flavour, which is lost in process of
drying.
    The Greenland Scurvy-grass (Cochlearia grcen-
landica) is much like the last-named plant, but not
so frequent, though it blossoms in June and July on
some parts of our shores, and on the Highland
mountains. More general than this is the kind
called English Scurvy-grass, which, with the
Danish Scurvy- grass, grows plentifully on muddy
and rocky sea-shores.       The Danish species is also
a native of Kamtschatka, and even more abundant
in the north of Europe than with us. Thick tufts
of the juicy leaves of these scurvy-grasses are found

 within the arctic circle, where scarcely any other
plants than lichens and mosses exist, and where
even the hardy race of pines, generally so fitted to
bear the blasts of northern tempests, yet dwindle
into stunted shrubs.      The Scurvy-grass and the
different species of sorrel, both of which are
welcomed by the mariner as an antidote to the
disease generated by the salt provisions of a long
voyage, were found by Captain Parry, flourishing
under the snow, at the very farthest limits of
vegetation.
    One of the handsomest of our sea-side flowers is
the Vernal Squill (Scilla verna), which cannot be
termed a common flower, as it is rarely seen on
the southern shores of this island. On the coasts
of the west and northern parts of Great Britain,
its beautiful deep-blue bell-flowers scent the air,
 usually bearing in it so little of the odour of wild
 flowers. It is about three or four inches high,
 with numerous deep-green slender leaves ; but its
 size varies much, according to differences of soil and
 situation. In August and September the Autumnal
 Squill (Scilla autumnalis) makes its appearance on
 some parts of our shores, especially at the south of
 England. The flowers are not so pretty nor so
 brightly blue as the spring species ; and it is not
 until they have withered that the leaves come
 up from the root.     They have a pinkish or lilac
 tinge.
     But rarely on the English coast do we find that
 very elegant flower, called by some botanists the
  Sea Gromwell, by others the Sea Lungwort or Sea
  Bugloss (Lithospermum maritimum), though on
 the sea-coast of the north of England it sometimes
  blooms among the sand or loose stones of the beach ;

but it is very plentiful on the north and west of
 Scotland. "This fine plant," says Dr. Walker, "was
described in Scotland above a hundred years ago, by

and is frequent upon the stony beach of most of
the Western Islands, where it highly ornaments
the shores with its beautiful flowers, and the ele
gant glaucous colour of its foliage. It is reckoned
by Dillenius the most beautiful plant that is native
to England. It is remarked by Linnaeus as being
sometimes annual and sometimes perennial, but
upon the shores of the Hebrides it appears to be
constantly biennial.    Upon the coast of Ireland,
however, where it likewise grows, it will probably
be an annual plant, and perennial in a warmer
climate than that of Britain." The sea- side Crom
well has been again seen on the shores of Berwick
within the last few years. It is quite a plant of
the north, extending even to the dreary arctic
regions. Its blossoms are of the most brilliant
purplish-blue tint. Sir William Hooker remarks
of it, that when the bloom      is rubbed off, rough
callous points are seen upon the surface, which
become white, and almost stony in drying, when
the rest of the plant  is nearly black. This genus
of plants contains   a  good deal of flint in their
composition, and  it  was from their shining, hard
nuts, that their botanic name was formed, of two
words, signifyinga   stone and seed. This hardness
was noticed of old in our own land for the English

very succulent.   It has been found on the coast of
Ayr, with white flowers, and blossoms in June and
July.    It grows along the shores of different
countries, from Sweden and Lapland to Gibraltar,
and is also found on both sides of the Mediter
ranean Sea.
   We have already noticed some of the culinary
vegetables which originated in the wild plants of
our shores. Indeed, some of our best esculents
have been derived from the sea-side ; and the wild
cabbage, and the wild kale, and the asparagus, all
have their native homes where ocean's roar is
heard, and where sea spray and salt soil water and
nourish them.    The French writers term our Kale
 (Crambe maritima) the chou marin d'Angleterre ;
and it appears to have been sent from England into
France before the middle of the sixteenth century.
It is a hardy perennial, and when fully grown, a
very beautiful plant, with its delicate sea-green
surface, powdered over with its whitish bloom,
and a tinge of purple here and there on its foliage,
and its white, honey-scented flowers.       It is very
common on some sandy and stony lands near the
sea; and where it is abundant, it has been cus
tomary, from time immemorial, for the people of
the neighbourhood to watch for the time when its
young leaf-stalks and shoots emerge from their
 sandy beds, which is in the month of March or
 April. They cut these off" as they might do the
 asparagus, and boil them for table; and the blanched
 shoots of the cultivated plant are too well known
 to require comment.     In some countries on the
 Continent, the large, purplish-green leaves have
 been boiled as greens, yet they are not of a very
 palatable description, unless eaten when very

                                            a
in  these matters;  for Dr. Walker, who gathered
this plant from the Bass Rock, remarks that the
leaves were large, tender, and succulent   and says   ;
that he and his friends had dish dressed of them,

other greens they had lately tasted.

Lettsom, who highly praised it. In English gar

   The Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) was by
our forefathers termed Sperage or Coralwort, while
some good old English writers called      by name    it    a
still in common use among uneducated persons,
Sparrow-grass.      It   a native of several parts of
                         is
the south and south-west coasts of England.      The
little island called Asparagus Isle, at Kynance
Cove, Cornwall, received its name from the abun
dance of this plant growing on that spot, to which
in   autumn its bright yellow feathery foliage and
 scarlet berries are a very picturesque addition. It
is  also described as growing in great plenty on
the pebbly beach near Weymouth, and on the
 Links near Gosford, in Scotland. On several
maritime places of Europe           an abundant pro

sea.   In North   America, too, the Asparagus grows
among the maize in fields, but in no wild state is
it equal in size to the cultivated plant. The
Asparagus of our own shores is seldom larger than
a goose quill, and not worth cooking.      This plant
is one of the few on which the praise of ancient
and modern writers have been alike bestowed, for
Pliny and Cato told of its virtues, and the Greeks
have transmitted it to posterity under the name
which it has now.     It must be observed, however,
that the Greeks, like us, had several plants whose
young shoots were used as food ; thus their term
Asparagus seems to have included not this alone,
but a variety of other pulpy stems. Long before the
culture of vegetables for the table had become
general in this country, this had received attention ;
but nowhere do we read of finer plants than were
said by Pliny to be reared by the Romans, as three
shoots of the vegetable grown at Ravenna are stated
by that naturalist to have weighed a pound.
    A large quantity of Asparagus is raised around
London, and it is thought by some horticulturists
that the plant might be cultivated to advantage
on many parts of our coast on soils consisting of
little else than sea-sand, and which afford too little
nutriment for the growth of other than naturally
maritime vegetables.      The French call the plant
Asperge, and it is much planted around Paris.
    In reading the travels of those who have gone
over the sandy deserts of other countries, we find
frequent mention of different species of the Aspa
ragus genus, very unlike our own plant, and
presenting a formidable barrier to the approach of
the passenger. The Cape Asparagus has crooked
thorns, which if they hold the traveller by his

clothes, will not let him escape without many a
rent, and the inhabitants of the country call the
plant Waht en beetje — "Wait a bit." Then there is
the linear-leaved asparagus of Ceylon, with shoots
five or six feet in height, thickly beset with spines,
and the roots of which afford food to the Cingalese ;
and another species, a native of Spain, with thorns
as large as a finger, which will not let you touch it
without tearing you. Well might the genus receive
the name of Asparagus, from a Greek word to lace
rate, for few except our native species are unarmed.
    On our salt marshes we may gather from May
till the end of summer, the sea-side Arrow-grass
(Triglochin maritimum), which is a common but not
a conspicuous plant, and not much unlike, at first
appearance, one of the plantains.   It has a stout
stem, long narrow leaves, and small greenish
flowers ; it has a salt flavour, and cattle, especially
cows, are very fond of it.
   On the rocky coasts of the North of England,
and very abundantly on the shores of Scotland, the
Scottish Lovage (Ligusticum ScoticumJ rears its
head and grows to a large plant, fearless of winds
and tide. It has broad, smooth, dark green leaves,
and a cluster of small white flowers with a reddish
tinge, which appear in July.       When bruised, the
foliage of this plant emits a powerful odour re
sembling that of parsley.     In the Isle of Skye the
Lovage is eaten in its natural state, and called
 Shunis, and it is also thus eaten in several of the
 northern isles of Scotland as well as boiled for
greens.   Ray mentions of     it,
                           that in his time the
Highlanders gathered and ate      early in the
                                      it
morning before they touched any other food, to
preserve them through the day from infection         ;

62                SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
and probably its strong aromatic flavour would
really render it a suitable plant for such a purpose.
They call the Lovage the Sea Parsley. Its acrid
root is occasionally chewed by the Hebridians as
a substitute for tobacco.   The boiled or raw plant
seems wholesome, and some writers describe its
flavour as agreeable, but persons unaccustomed to
it would wonder how so nauseous and acrid a vege
table could ever be valued or indeed used as food.
   The Lovage is an umbelliferous plant, as are the
samphire and some others yet to be named, and it
seems desirable to explain this term, as the whole
tribe are sufficiently alike to enable a reader un
acquainted with botany to recognise any individual
as belonging to it.
   The Carrot and the Parsley are very familiar
instances of umbelliferous plants.        Every one
knows their blossoms, and will remember that
the little flowers grow in a cluster on stalks, all
proceeding from one central point, and diverging
like the rays of an umbrella. Plants of this form
abound by our waysides, in hedges and in ditches,
and several on the rocks or salt marshes of our
shores.    Their blossoms are among the least
attractive of our wild flowers, but they are a tribe
most important to man ; they are, when cultivated,
extensively used as food, and though the most
dangerous poisons lurk among their juices, yet
skill and science have made these very poisons
contribute to the recovery of lost health. The
Parsley, Celery, and Carrot of our tables need no
praise ; and even some, which, when wild, are of
most dangerous quality, may be safely eaten when
cultivated. They have mostly hollow stems, and
cut leaves, clusters of tiny flowers, either white or

                    SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                 63
greenish, or yellow; now and then tinged with
pink.     It is generally considered that plants of
this tribe which grow in ditches and damp places
are poisonous, and indeed in some of the sorts
usually deemed wholesome, the damp soil seems
to have a pernicious effect and to render them
dangerous.      Dr. Walker remarks of our maritime
kinds — Though
           "         I would not propose it as a rule
to be depended on in so dangerous a case as poisons,
yet  I  think it highly probable that all the maritime
plants of this class are salutary and excellent.
       I
This am certain of, that none of the umbelliferous
plants known to be poisonous are stationed near
the sea-shore ; all the maritime plants whose
qualities are known are innocent ; and it is further
remarkable that this is not to be ascribed to their
dry situation among the maritime rocks, or upon
the sandy beach; for the Celery and Sulphur- wort
 grow in the salt marshes in as watery a soil as any
 of the umbelliferous aquatics that are poisonous ;
 but here    I  imagine lies an essential difference
 between plants that inhabit salt water and fresh."
 Although this remark may, as Balfour observes,
 be a little too general, there is doubtless much of
 truth in Dr. Walker's statements on this point ;
 and most important investigations are now making

 probably be in a few years better understood.
    Any one who has ever visited Dovor in the
 month of May may have noticed how completely
 some of the white cliffs at the eastern end of the
 town seem covered with the yellowish green
 clusters of a large and conspicuous umbelliferous
 plant. This plant is not peculiar to the sea-side,
 for it grows sometimes on inland spots, but it is

64                SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
one of those which seem especially to luxuriate on
the rocks around our coasts. It is the common
Alexanders (Smyrnium olusatrum), or, as the people
in some places term it, the Salamanders.        The
stem is about three or four feet high and very thick
and furrowed, and the leaves are of a bright yellow
green.    It was formerly much used as a pot-herb,
and it appears to be perfectly wholesome, though
by what means those who ate it were brought to
think its flavour agreeable one would wonder much,
for its very odour is most offensive, and it is very
pungent. Yet that it was really much used and
valued in bygone times appears from the fact that
its botanic name was formed from olus, a pot-herb,
and ater, black, the latter word probably alluding
to its black fruits. Pliny says of   it,
                                       that the juice
smelt like myrrh, and its generic name Smyrnium
is   asynonyme of the name of that valued resin.
It would probably be improved by culture. The
French call it  Maceron.
   The common Fennel (Fceniculum vulgare)
another plant of the umbelliferous tribe, which    is is
very plentiful on the chalky cliffs of England by
the sea, and also on chalky soils near salt marshes.
It   is rarely found inland, except in the neigh
bourhoods of some towns but little removed from
the coast.    It well known in the eastern parts
                 is
of England, by its frequent culture in the kitchen-
garden, where    it   planted, that its boiled leaves
                      is
may be served up with mackerel, though our
modern gardeners —happily for morality — have
forgotten the old notion, that the Fennel would not
thrive unless the plants were stolen.        It has a
hollow stem, three or four feet high, and slender
dark green leaves, and may at once be known

                     SEA-SIDE PLANTS.              65
—if   seen in July or August — by the deep golden
hue of its flowers, which colour is a rare ornament
in this tribe. It is of old repute as a seasoning
herb, and its almost sickly odour seems to have
been much esteemed in former days, as it is one
among the sweet flowers named by Shakspeare;
and Milton alludes to it : —
     " When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,
       Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense
       Than smell of sweetest Fennel."
   The roots are roasted and eaten by the Hot
tentots in the same way as anise ; and the seeds,
which are considered carminative, are often used as
medicine for infants.
   The wild Carrot is well known to all lovers of
wild flowers, with its cluster of white blossoms,
with a dark purplish red flower in the centre, and
its graceful leaves, once deemed a worthy ornament
for the head-dress of court ladies. There is a wild
species called the Sea-side Carrot (DaucusMaritimus)
found on the coasts of Kent and Cornwall, as well
as some Scottish and Irish shores, very much like
our common carrot or bee's nest, but smaller, having
broader and more succulent leaves, and wanting
the little purple blossom in the centre, which so
often helps those but little familiar with our wild
flowers to identify the Carrot among the many
white blossomed umbelliferous plants which re
semble it. The roots of both species are similar,
and there are writers who think that they constitute
but one kind. These roots have the colour and
something of the strong odour of the garden carrot,
but are too stringy and small to be to any extent
serviceable as food, though the people of the
Hebrides, who well know how to turn to good

account the wild plants, cook and eat them.       Bot
anists very generally believe the little wild Carrot
to be the origin of the valuable cultivated vegetable;
but Miller and other horticulturists have taken
great pains, by culture, to change the carrot of our
waysides into the edible one, and have failed.    If,
therefore, our native species was that from which
this valuable root sprung originally, it is probable
that the plant was first cultivated under a warmer
temperature than that of our island. The Carrot
was first sown in England in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, by the Flemings, who were compelled
by the tyranny of Philip the Second, to take refuge
on our shores. Our countrymen, at that period,
knew little of vegetable gardening, and the refugees
finding that the soil about Sandwich in Kent was
favourable for the growth of one of their favourite
articles of diet, they soon sowed their seeds in the
soil.    It shortly became a plant of general cul
 ture here, and it is not improbable that its seeds
dispersed themselves, and so naturalized the plant
in this island. It is cultivated most successfully
in a soil mixed with sand, and we generally find a
 good deal of the wild plant on sandy coasts.    Our
 word carrot is from the Celtic, car, red.
     The Wild Celery or Smallage (Apium graveolens)
 is another umbelliferous plant common on our
 coasts, though not peculiar to the sea- side, and a
 frequent plant of the salt marshes is the Parsley-
 water Drop wort. (CEnanthe pimpinelloides), with its
 flesh-coloured flowers growing on a stem about
 two feet high. This drop wort is certainly a most
  dangerous poison when growing in some of its
 native spots, yet soil and culture have a peculiar
  effect onit, andit   iscultivated about Angers for

 the sake  of its roots, which are there called Jouan-
 nettes.  At   Saumur, too, these roots are cultivated,
 and there     called Mechons.       This plant is re
markable     among its tribe for having undivided
leaves.
   An    umbelliferous plant, called the Slender
Harems-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum), is a native of
our salt marshes on the south and south-east coasts
of England.       It has very slender wiry stems, and
small green clusters of flowers, and is not a con
spicuous plant.
   The Sea Sulphur-weed (Peucedanum afficlnale)
is a much more rare plant of the salt marsh.          It
has been found on the shores of Kent and Sussex ;
it has bright yellow flowers, growing in large
clusters.   A resinous substance is found in the
roots of some of the species, and the whole of this
plant has a strong odour of sulphur.        The root is
highly stimulating, and very fetid and acrid.         It
has been used as medicine,           but is apparently
 dangerous for internal use.
   But leaving a tribe of plants which are rather
useful than beautiful, we must notice that very
handsome and not unfrequent flower of our salt
marshes, the Star-wort, or Michaelmas Daisy (Aster
tripolium).     Every one knows our common au
tumnal garden flowers of this name, some of them
very handsome blossoms, but all sufficiently like
this to enable the reader at once to detect it.      Its
starry lilac rays are arranged round the yellow disk,
and it grows in clusters at the top of a succulent
stem, which, as well as its no less juicy leaves, are of
saltish flavour.    There is little on the salt marshes
during the months of August and September which
is very attractive, and these flowers are often at

68                   SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
  that season almost the only bright things which
  invite the passing bee to taste their sweets. This
  flower is found not only near the sea, but on the
  shores of some salt rivers, as the Medway in Kent,
  and is so far from being a rare plant, that one
  would think most British botanists might, at some
 time or other, examine it for themselves. Yet the
  old writers told strange things of         it,
                                              and one
 excellent   old herbalist, Gerarde, says "It—               is
 reported by men of great fame and learning, that
 this plant was termed tripolium because           doth

 the admission of Gerarde, however, as to its changes
by the heat of the sun, had more in           of fancy

Our herbalist says that women by the sea-side call

    Another pretty flower of the sea- shore         the is
Great Sea-stock (Mathiola sinuata), which flowers
from May to September upon some sandy shores
of Cornwall, and also on the Welsh coast, but

                     SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                      O9
cannot often be gathered wild.         Its stem has
spreading branches, and is about two feet high,
with downy leaves.        The whole of the plant
is covered with dense starry hairs, and short
prickles, each rising from a little glandular base.
The large handsome flowers have little odour
during day, but when evening comes diffuse great
sweetness on the air, and the wanderer by moon
light, or even beneath the dark and cloudy sky
of night, might pause to wonder that so sweet
a scent should be wafted to him by winds, which
at that season he would not expect to bear
upon them the odour of the flower.         The hoary
shrubby stock (Mathiola incana), which grows
often plentifully on the rocks near Hastings, is
not truly wild there, though generally enumerated
in the list of flowers which form our British flora.
It is the origin of our garden stock gilliflower,
and  is,  as Dr. Hooker observes, generally treated
 by our gardeners as an annual or biennial.       The
 pale lilac Virginian, or more properly Mediter
 ranean stock,  is sometimes enumerated among our
 native flowers of the sea-shore.   It very plenti
                                        is

 like others, have been naturalized on our isle. But,

  consider the flower which we now call the Prince's
  Feather so beautiful as that the " pencil of the
  most curious painter is at a stay when he comes
 to set him downe in his lively colours."      But we
 can rejoice still with Hafiz, when he sang, "O cup
 bearer, the season of the rose is come," and could
 respond to the feelings of the writer of the
  "Wisdom of Solomon," when, rejoicing in the glad
 season of the early year, he sang, " Let no flower
 of the Spring pass by us. Let us crown ourselves
 with rosebuds before they be gathered." The rose
 is as much loved as ever, and gathered with de
 light, whether it hang out from the pleasant hedge
 of some green lane, or we meet with it unexpectedly
 growing on the sands among the sea-weeds and
 other objects which the wind has carried up from
 the waters, to strew the shore.     Few, indeed, are
 the roses to be found here, yet one is by no means
 uncommon, even close down, and unsheltered from
 the sea-breeze; while on sandy fields, at a little
 distance from the sea, it is very abundant.      On
many inland chalky and sandy places it is a well
known blossom, and generally a favourite with
those who are fond of wild flowers.       The Burnet
 Rose (Rosa spinosissima) is the earliest flowering
kind of all our wild roses, and though it has not
the delicate blush of the wild brier, it is extremely
pretty, with its small flowers, sometimes tinged
with cream colour, sometimes lightly tinged with
a dash or two of pink hue, but more often of pure
white. It generally, when growing near the sea,
lies very flat on the shore, but its branches are
covered with its sweet-scented flowers, the odour
of which is said by Sir William Hooker to be in
some varieties disagreeable.      It spreads widely,

                   SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                71
but never grows on the shore to any height, and
its leaves are very neat and pretty, being formed
of very small leaflets, generally about seven in
number, very finely notched at the edges, and of
a full green, with somewhat of a glaucous tint.
One might as well attempt to gather a handful of
thistles, as to make a nosegay of these roses, for its
stems are crowded with prickles, some of them
very long, and interspersed with multitudes of
 smaller ones, all of a dark brown colour. The
flower is not succeeded by the scarlet hip of the
 dog-rose, but it has a dark purplish black berry,
 which schoolboys call the Cat-hip.      Dr. Johnston
 says, this is the only wild rose found in Holy
 Island, where it grows on the sandy sea-banks ;
 and Dr. Walker observes, that several parts of the
 shores of Jura and Isla are highly ornamented
 with this beautiful little flower, which is in full
 blossom about the end of June, on the stony beaches
 of those islands.
     Another of our roses, called the Red-fruited
  Dwarf-rose (Rosa rubella), has been found on the
  sandy sea-coast of Northumberland, but it grows
 there very sparingly.       The Burnet-rose is the
  origin of our Scotch garden roses, and they are
  not greatly changed by culture.
     It is pleasant, when roaming along the sea
  shore, to linger near some of the salt-water pools,
  watching the lighter sea-weeds, as they float up
  and down, and seem to be brightened by all the
  tints of the rainbow. The naturalist loves these
  spots, for there he sees living creatures of minute
  beauty, finding their home and enjoyment. And
  the botanist loves them too, for here he may find
  some of the most delicate marine weeds, and here,

too, he may chance to meet with that interesting
plant, the Sea Ruppia, or Tassel-grass (Ruppia
maritima) ; flower it can hardly be called, since it
has no gay coloured petals to distinguish it. It
is not uncommon in salt-water ditches and pools,
growing wholly submersed.             Its stems are like
               TASSEL GRASS (Ruppia maritima).
slender threads, bending about and sending off
many branches, on which grow long pointed leaves
like bristles.  The whole plant might be at first
taken for a sea- weed, but its structure is in reality
very different from that of any marine vegetable.

                   SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                  73
 In their early  stage the flowers grow quite under
 water ; but as there comes a time when they need
 air and sunshine, the stalk which supports them
becomes spirally lengthened, until the blossoms all
rise up above the surface of the pool.        But the
 seeds will not ripen there, and after the blossom
 has for awhile remained   in the air, again the spiral
 stalk curls up in close coils, and goes down to the
 base of the waters.
    In wet shady places near the sea, and on salt
marshes and maritime cliffs, grows a plant with
bunches of numerous small, cross-shaped flowers,
on a stem about three feet high, and having large
leaves.    It is the broad-leaved Pepper-wort (Le-
pidium latifolium).    This species is not common,
though several of the pepper-worts are very fre
quent plants on inland fields. They are all remark
able for their antiscorbutic properties, and the
broad-leaved species yields an emetic on infusion.
The Narrow-leaved Pepper-wort (Lepidium rude-
rale), is a more common plant on waste places near
the sea, but is not confined to the coast. The Cress
of our gardens, the plant in which most of us de
lighted in childhood, because the vegetable crop
appears so soon after the sowing of the seeds, is the
Lepidium sativa ; and commonly as this plant has
long been cultivated, its native haunt was unknown
until Dr. Sibthorp found it growing wild in Greece.
Some species of the Pepper-wort were of great
value to the ships' crews under Captain Cook, when
they were suffering from diseases incident to a
long abstinence from vegetable food; and one
species is in common use among the South-sea
islanders, for intoxicating fish, when      they may
easily be taken, even with the hand.

74                 SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
    The Sea Radish (Raphanus maritimus), though
not a frequent production of the English shore, yet
grows on Beachy Head and in Cornwall, is very
abundant on the cliffs from the Lizard to Kennack,
and is a most common plant on the western
shores of the outer Hebrides; it has large, pale-
yellow flowers, and very rough leaves. Probably
a person but little acquainted with wild flowers
would consider it to be a species of wild mustard,
for it is much like those weeds.
    The Hare's-ear Treacle Mustard (Erysimum ori
ent ale), is another cruciferous plant of our cuffs,
and is very general all along the shores of Southern
Europe. It has cream-coloured flowers, and glau
cous leaves.    Two kinds of Rock-cress (Arabia)
also are found near the sea ; but, like the Hare's-
ear Treacle, they are rare flowers, and difficult to
describe.
    A  very pretty and fragrant flower, which in
summer time we are glad to welcome to our gar
dens, for its sweet, honey-like scent, is the Sweet
Alyssum, or Sea-side Koniga (Koniga maritima),
and it is found on the cliffs by the sea near Aber
deen, and at Budleigh Salterton, in Devon; but
it is probably not a native plant. It is very plenti
ful on the shores of the Mediterranean, and its
seeds were perhaps borne hither by the waves.
Its flowers are large and white, and it has long,
 slender, hoary leaves.    It flowers in August and
 September.     The whole tribe of Alyssums were
 reputed by the ancients to have the power of
 allaying anger; but we, in these later days, trust
 rather to moral remedies for the cure of this ill,
 than to any " herb of virtue."
     On many parts of our coast the Grass-wrack

                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                 75
 (Zostera marina) is very abundant, growing in thick
clumps, on sandy shallows and banks in the sea,
 and on stormy days being dashed in large masses
 on the shore.   One would call it a sea-weed, were
it not that this mode of fructification excludes it
 from that tribe of plants, and connects it with
maritime, rather than marine, vegetation.      It has
very long grass-green leaves, and hence its botanic
name is derived from the Greek word riband. The
 French term it La Zostere, and the Germans Sea-
tang ; and our coast people commonly call it Sea-
 grass. It abounds on the shores about Yarmouth,
 and it is there torn up by the waves, and thrown
ashore in such quantities as that it is used to heap
up into mounds, to serve as a sort of wall for
resisting the encroachments of the sea upon the
land. It is also used for thatching roofs, and
in one respect it serves this purpose better than
hay, as sun and wind do not decay it ; and a sea-
grass thatch is said to last a hundred years, though
the sun soon deprives it of its rich green hue, and
bleaches it white.     The Dutch and Swedes use
this plant more than we do, for they strew it largely
over their land for manure ; and in all the coun
tries of the north of Europe it is not only used for
stuffing beds, but it is preferred to almost any
other material. It is sold in our shops for filling
mattresses, cushions, and other articles of domestic
use, under the name of Ulva marina.       The rush-
like envelopes of the Italian liquor-casks are made
of Grass-wrack, and it is very much used for pack
ing glass bottles and earthenware.       The leaves
require to be steeped in fresh water, and well
dried before using them for bedding. A good
quantity of saccharine matter is found in the lower

part of the stem, which is of a reddish-brown
colour ; and the Highlanders chew this part of the
plant, and deem it very nutritious.       Horses will
feed on    it,but cows are not fond of it. Pallas
found it   among the pottery in the old tombs in the
south of Russia.
    Any one who knows that large and singular
plant, not uncommon on our heath lands, the Great
Broom Rape, would at once recognise, should he
happen to see    it,  the much rarer species of our
shores, the Red Broom Rape (Orobanche rubra).
Though seldom found on the English coast,        it is
frequent upon the basalt and trap rocks in the
 Hebrides and the adjacent shores of the mainland.
 It grows also on some maritime spots of Ireland.
 The broom rapes are numbered among our few
 native parasitic plants, as most of the genus grow
 on the roots of the furze or broom of our heath
 lands
     ;    and so parasitic in habit are some of the
 tribe, that the seeds of the Branched Broom Rape,
 which grows on hemp, are said to lie inert for
 many years, unless they come in contact with the
 roots of their chosen plant, when they will immedi
 ately nourish. So too the introduction of the broom
 and gorse into a neighbourhood, has soon been
 followed by the luxuriant growth of the Great
 Broom Rape, which sprang up on their roots. It
is   no wonder that they, long since, received their
 name from two words signifying      a  vetch and to
 strangle and they are in as ill repute as ever for
         ;
  destroying the plants on which they grow, and have
  several names used in country places expressive of
  the idea which the peasantry entertain of their
  injurious effect. They are all so acrid also in their
  nature as to be refused by cattle. The Red Broom

what similar hue, tinged with yellow.     It has no
leaves, but a scaly stem. Very similar, and equally
rare, is the Purple Broom Rape (Orobanche cosru-
lea), which grows in grassy pastures, near the sea,
and -is parasitical on the roots of other plants.
    A very pretty little bulbous flower of the genus
Trichonema (Trichonema columnts), which is one of
the beautiful Iris family, and the smallest of them
all, has been found on one or two spots on the
southern coast of England. Here and there, too,
on grassy sandy places, near the sea, one of our
three species of wild flax (Linum angustifolium)
rears its pale-blue erect bell, in June and July ;
and rare as are primroses, save beneath the shadow
of woodland boughs or in mountain solitudes, yet
there is one kind which graces the shore. This is
the Scottish Primrose (Primula Scotica), and a very
lovely little flower it is. Primroses generally seem
fearless of cold winds.     We know how they come
out by thousands in our woods, when the wild
winds of spring are not yet soothed into summer
stillness, and the traveller on the high hills stoops
down to smile on them amid the mountain snows.
 The breezes which play around the Orkney Isles
are none of the mildest, yet they often bow down
the blossoms of this Primrose; and rare as it is
 elsewhere, it is frequent on the northern coast of
Sunderland, and has been gathered from the north
 coast of Caithness.     It is so different from other
 primroses, and so peculiar to the shore, that the
 reader who should happen to find      it, might easily
 know   it.  It  hasa    deep  bluish  purple blossom,
 with a   yellow centre;     and  though a   stout and
 sturdy-looking plant, its flowers are small. Its

leaves are mealy, and it is much like the Bird's-eye
Primrose of the mountainous pastures of the north
of England, which, though rare in most places, is
not unfrequent in Yorkshire.
    The Sea Stork's Bill (Erodium maritimum) is a
little rare sea-side plant which grows among the
sands in some parts of the Welsh coast, and on the
southern shores of England. It flowers from May
until September, but its little pale red petals seem
no sooner to make their appearance than the wind
carries them off, and it is difficult to find specimens
in full flower. Like the other storks' bills, its
seed-vessels have so great a resemblance to the
beak of the stork as to enable any one to recognise
it by their form.
    Several pea-shaped flowers grow on our shores,
but the Sea Pea (Lathyrus maritimus), which
thrives on stony beaches in several parts of the
eastern and southern shores of England, as well as
on the coasts of the Shetland Isles, is the largest
and prettiest of them all. It bears a good many
purple flowers, finely veined with crimson, and it
yields enough leaves and stems to be a welcome
food to cattle ; while its long and deeply-spreading
roots are almost as useful in binding down the
sand as are the mat-grasses.         The seeds are of
bitter flavour, yet they were once very valuable
as food to many when England suffered from
famine.
    Another pea-shaped flower, the rough-podded
Yellow Vetch (Vicia lutea), is found on rocky or
stony ground, especially near the sea ; but it is not
confined to the shore, and is not a common flower.
It has large blossoms, growing singly. It is
abundant about the rocks of Dunure Castle, and

                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                 79
on the hills of Queensferry, but seems confined
to that part only of the neighbourhood. It grows
also in Suffolk and Sussex, and on some Scottish
shores.   Then, too, the smooth-podded Vetch ( Vi
na lavigata), with its pale blue or whitish flowers,
has a liking to the sea, and blooms in July and
August on the pebbly shore of Weymouth in
Dorsetshire; and the rare rough-podded purple
Vetch ( Vicia Bithynica), with its pale purple wings,
is to be searched for in maritime spots, as it grows
there more often than elsewhere.
    Every one has rejoiced in his country walks at
the sweet scent of the clovers or trefoils of our
meadows, and the bees rejoice over them too.
Our purple sweet-scented clover does not send up
its odour mingled with that of the salt wave, but
large patches of the white or Dutch clover (the
Irish shamrock), lie upon the beach ; not because
this clover thrives best near the sea, but because
it is hardy enough to thrive anywhere. We have
besides trefoils peculiar to the coast, and such as
may properly be called maritime species, but they
are not very frequent flowers. The Teasel-headed
Trefoil (Trifolium maritimum) is found in June and
July in salt marshes on the eastern and southern
shores of England.     It is of a pale reddish purple
colour.    On the sea-coast of Sussex, between
 Shoreham harbour and the sea, the very beautiful
species called the Starry-headed Trefoil (Trifolium
stellatum) is said by Sir William Hooker to grow
in great abundance. It is a singular and elegant
species, with long calyces or flower-cups, and while
young the small cream-coloured flowers are almost
hid among their straight bristly teeth, till becoming
 larger they open into a beautiful starry shape,

  80                SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
  and assume a degree of redness.    The rough rigid
  Trefoil (Trifolium scabrum) is found also on the
  Scottish coasts, as well as on sandy inland fields
  in England ; and sometimes, but rarely, that little
 inconspicuous flower, the Suffocated Trefoil (Tri
folium suffocatum) gratifies the botanist more than
 the ordinary lover of wild flowers, by springing up
 under his footstep, as he walks along the Norfolk
 or Suffolk coast.
    The reticulated Medick (Medicago denticulata)

                   SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                81
is another little plant which the maritine botanist
looks for in June on some coasts. It has been
found on exposed sandy shores in Kent, and also
near Weymouth. We have several wild kinds of
medick in our fields, and on our way-sides.      They
are all pea-shaped blossoms, remarkable after
flowering, for their broad flat sickle-shaped pods,
in some species twisted spirally. The flower of
the sea-shore medick is like those of most of the
genus, yellow ; though our common lucerne, which
is a species of this tribe, has pale purple blossoms.
The French call this Foin de Bourgogne; it was
highly extolled by the Roman writers as a good
plant for fodder, and is grown both in this and in
 continental countries. Another of the tribe, called
 the Moon Medick, was the Cytisus of the ancient
 writers.    It grew in the country of the Medes,
 and hence probably we derive the name Medick.
    The Cotton Weed (Diotis maritima) is common
 enough on some of our sandy shores in the east or
 south-east of England, though not sufficiently
 general to be much known to any but botanists.
 It is an autumn flower, and one which many would
 overlook, for its little yellow blossoms are almost
 hidden by the flower-cup.       It well deserves its
 English name, for it is really covered with a
  cottony down. Hence Linnaeus called the flower
 Filago, because it was enveloped with a delicate
  thread, fila.
     The Sea-wormwood (Artemisia maritima) grows
  along the shore and on the salt marshes in its
  neighbourhood, and is bitter enough to remind us
  of the Scripture expression, which marked this as
  the most bitter of plants.    It has in one variety
                            G

82                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
drooping brownish flowers, and in the other erect
blossoms, and both varieties may often be found
growing together.        Like other species of the
wormwood, it was formerly much used in medicine,
and a superstitious veneration attached to it. One
kind of wormwood, the Common Mugwort (Arte
misia vulgaris) of our wayside and waste places,
was so much valued by the older botanists, that
Pliny told of it that any one who carried it could be
hurt by no poisons, nor by any wild beast, neither
yet by the sun itself. The sea-wormwood has
downy leaves, and it flowers in September.
   A plant with a brighter, gayer flower, adorns
the salt marshes on the south and west shores of
England and Wales. This is the Golden Samphire,
or, as it is sometimes called, Samphire-leaved Flea-
bane (Limbarda crithmoides).     It is about one foot
high, and bears single flowers on its branches of a
bright yellow colour. In some parts of France it is
called Limbarde ; and there, as with us, its fleshy
leaves and stems are taken to the markets to be
sold as samphire ; but it has none of the aromatic
virtues of the plant whose name it resembles.
   The Sea-side Feverfew (Pyrethrum maritimum)
is common on many parts of the sea-coast, but is
probably only a maritime variety of the common
May-weed, so abundant everywhere.          It may be
distinguished from the sea-side camomile (An-
themis maritima), to which it is very similar, by
the faint odour of the latter plant. This camo
mile; too, has cream-coloured rather than white
rays.    It is almost peculiar to the sea-coast at
Sunderland.       The camomile tribe have their
name, Anthemis, from the Greek word " a flower,"

                    SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                     83
because of the multitude of their blossoms ; just as
the Persians call the lilac from lilag, their word for
" a flower ;" while the
                            people of the East often use
the same word for "a flower" and for "a rose/'
that being with them, as with us, on account of
its beauty, the flower of flowers.
   We have several species of knapweed in our
lanes and fields, far away from the sea ; and the
brown radiant knapweed, and the black knapweed,
with their bright lilac florets surrounding a dark
rough knob-like flower cup, sometimes make the
beach and other waysides gay.           The Common Star
Thistle (Centaur ea calcitrapa) is one of those flowers
which are more frequent on the shore of the south
of England than on any other spot. It may be
known by the long thick prickles, or rather thorns,
which beset its round green cup. It is the caltrops
of Virgil, and its name was given because its calyx
resembles the ancient instrument of warfare, con
sisting of an iron ball armed with spikes.         Its first
appearance is like that of a thistle, but it has not
prickly leaves, which thistles have. The country
people call all these knapweeds "iron-weeds."
Clare describes their haunts —
        " And  iron-weed, content to share
          The meanest spot that Spring can spare ;
          Even roads, where danger hourly comes,
          Are not without its purple blooms."
None of our true thistles are maritime plants,
though several of them raise their rich purple
blossoms near the shore, or in any other wayside
 or chalky soil.     The slender-flowered thistle (Car-
 duus tenuiflorus) flowers in July, especially on the
                              G 2

84                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
waste sandy places near the sea. It has numerous
pale purple flowers, and is not one of the most
beautiful of the tribe, though spiny enough to
remind us of the Scotch motto, " No one touches
me with impunity."
   We    find nettles every where, whether by
lane or woodland, by ancient ruin or on open
shore.    But the most venomous of all our British
nettles is not a common species of inland growth,
 and is oftener found by the sea than far from it.
This is the Roman nettle (Urtica pilulifera), which
has large leaves, on long thick stalks, and four-
sided stems.      If  all our nettles were like this,
they would well deserve their name, taken from
wo, to burn, for the pain inflicted by its sting does
not easily pass away. Like its companions, how
ever, it in some measure atones for its venom by
the uses to which it may be applied.        Very good
cordage is made of      nettle fibre, and in  Scotland
the plant is frequently eaten as food. Indeed, the
boiled tops of the young nettle are no despicable
table vegetable.      There are writers who greatly
recommend the culture of our larger species of
nettles for for,age ; and it appears that the common
large nettle (Urtica dioica) has yielded a good
supply of food for cows, by being planted in rows.
A singular purpose, too, to which nettles have
been applied, is that of stopping the leaks of
wooden vessels.        Some handfuls of the green
nettles are rubbed over the joinings of the staves,
into these the juice penetrates, and coagulating
there, forms a barrier to the escape of any of the
contents of the vessel.
   Almost every one knows the common Sun

                SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                 85
Spurge, often growing as a weed in gardens, and
called in villages Churn-staff, or Milk-weed, be
cause of its acrimonious milky juice, This belongs
to a family containing fourteen native species,
three of which are maritime plants. The Purple
Spurge (Euphorbia Peplis), with its oblong, heart-
shaped leaves, and yellow greenish blossoms, is to
be found flowering from July to September, on
the sandy coasts of Cornwall and Devon.       It may
be known from most other species by its stems,
often tinged with a deep purple tint. Like the
sun spurge it contains a quantity of milky juice.
Indeed, this corrosive secretion is common to all
the spurges, and it is so acrid, as that if not care
fully applied it will blister the skin. Village
people, however, make much use of the juice, not
only for curing warts, but they even venture to
apply it to the mouth in cases of tooth-ache, or
rub it behind the ears to raise a blister, which it
will certainly do very quickly.        The different
species of this plant were once so valued as a
medicine, that the name of the first physician
who used them was gratefully recorded by it ;
 and Euphorbus, the physician of Juba, King of
Mauritania, has been thus remembered for many
 centuries by those who were learned in medicine
 and surgery.    The spurge of the Materia Medica
 is a native of America, and so powerful is its
 milky juice in corroding the skin wherever it
 touches  it,that persons who collect it  are obliged
 to tie cloth over the mouth and nostrils to protect
      a
 them from the acrid dust of the withered branches,
 which causes sneezing. The two remaining species
 of spurge which are to be looked for on our

86                SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
coast are, the one termed Sea Spurge (Euphorbia
paralia) and the Portland Spurge (Euphorbia port-
landica), but they are not common plants, and are
 confined to a very limited portion of our island
 shores.   The former has been found at various
parts of the English sea-coast, and the latter on
the sandy sea-shores to the extreme south and
west of England, as well as on the Welsh shore,
 on the Isle of Man, and a few other places.        Sir
William Hooker remarks of this, that it is very
rare, if not unknown on the Continent.
    Two of our native plantains are common near
 the sea, the one on the salt marshes, the other on
 the beach, growing down among patches of grass
or little loose mounds of sand, just beyond the
reach of the waves.     The sea-side plantain (Plan-
tago maritima) is very plentiful on saline pasture
lands and in the clefts of rocks, and indeed some
times it grows on a sandy spot on the beach.         It
is also found, like several other of our maritime
plants, on the summits of high mountains. Most
persons are familiar with the plantain whose
brown spike is gathered for birds, and which has
the old name of Way-bred ; and this is much like
it, save thatit  has not the broad leaves which our
forefathers used for binding over their wounds,
but has long narrow foliage. Few plants, how
ever, vary more than this, under different circum
stances of soil and situation. Sometimes the leaves
are scarcely an inch high, while in a soil where    it
seems more thriving, they are often    a foot long.
   The Bucfs-horn plantain (Plantago coronopus)
grows chiefly near the sea, and   isoften one of the
commonest plants on the beach.        Its leaves are

                 SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                  87
cut into many segments, and lie in great profusion
close to the ground, all round the stem.         The
flower is like all our other plantains, a greenish
spike.   There is no doubt that the leaves were
formerly used in salads; but they are, in the
opinion of the author, very unpleasant in flavour.
A rather conspicuous plant, the Mountain Garlic
(Allium carinatum), with dull-coloured yellowish
or brownish white flowers, may be found in July
on sandy grounds on the south-east coast of Eng
land, and on one or two spots of the Scottish shore.
Its leaves are long and slender. Its odour forms
no pleasant addition to the scent of a wild-flower
nosegay, but all the garlics were once highly prized
for remedial virtues, and they were thought,
Fuller says, to be " Soveraigne for men and beasts
in most maladies," though, as this excellent old
writer adds, "the scent thereof is somewhat valiant
and offensive.''
    The Knot-grass, growing on many beaches, is
by most writers thought to be a distinct species
from the common knot-grass of our every way-side.
 The Polygonum maritimum is a larger plant than
that, covering some feet with its long woody
 stems and branches, and making many a green
 patch on which animals who may stray thither
 may make a sweet repast.
    On the south and south-western shores only of
 England, and on some parts of the Irish and Welsh
 coast, may be found the lesser Wart-cress (Coron-
 opus didyma), with its cut leaves and dense masses
 of small white cruciferous flowers.  It sufficiently
 resembles the common swine-cress, or wart-cress
 of our inland waste places, to be identified by one

88                   SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
familiar with this common plant. The latter species
was in former days in much use as a salad, but its
pungency is not agreeable to the taste of modern
days.    Both species have leaves something like
the foot of a bird, hence their botanic name was
formed of the two Greek words crow and foot.
They grow round the stem in such a manner as
has led to their familiar name,
                                     " The Star of the
Earth."      On the beach of Dovor, the common
wart-cress is abundant ; we might find a hundred
plants in five minutes' walk.        Both kinds have
seed vessels      beautifully crested with minute
tubercles.
   A far more showy, and indeed a beautiful flower
of our salt marshes, is the Marsh-mallow (Malva
afficinalis) ,with its soft downy greyish-green leaves,
and large blossoms of a delicate rose-colour. This
plant is thought to be the Hibiscus of Virgil, and
has been used medicinally in all countries in which
medicine has been cultivated. The mucilage con
tained in every part of the plant renders it va
luable, and so much of this is contained in the
roots that when they are boiled in water they
give out half their weight in a glutinous substance,
which is thought to be nearly allied to gum arabic
or starch.     The Marsh-mallow is very rare on
Scottish shores, and indeed is not plentiful on the
English coast, but it is one of the prettiest of all
the flowers of the salt marsh.
   We might tell of one or two ferns which, like
the sea spleenwort (Asplenium marinum), festoon
the sea-caves and clefts of rocks with their firm
dark green fronds, or leaves, as the unscientific
would term them; but they are so difficult to

                  SEA-SIDE PLANTS.                 89
describe without the use of botanic terms, that we
must leave them to glance at the fern-like Equi-
setum, or horsetail of our coast.  It is classed with
the ferns, but none but a botanist would discover
its resemblance to that interesting tribe of plants.
It has not a bright green leaf, studded like them
with dense masses of brown fructification in masses,
which when seen under a microscope, seem groups
of crystals and other gems ; but it has rigid hollow
stems, without branches or leaves, and with black
sheaths at intervals around it.      The variegated
horsetail (Equisetum variegatum) has been found
on some sandy shores of England and Ireland, and
also on the sands of Barry in Angusshire.        It is
the smallest of our native Equisetums, its stem
being rarely more than eight inches high. Every
one knows the tall stems of some of these plants,
which grow on the marshy or boggy places of our
lands, with their long whorls of rigid furrowed
branchlets. They may well be so hard as to have
been used so much in polishing ivory and wood
 and metals, for they have a framework of flint.
 If some species of the horsetail be carefully burnt,
 some remains will be left unconsumed by the fire,
 and if these are held up to the light, numerous
little points will be seen spirally arranged, which
 are portions of pure flint, and it is the saw-like
 flinty edge which renders the plant so useful a
 polisher. Its old name was pewter-wort, for good
 housewives in the olden times used it in brighten
 ing the ware, on which once the good roast beef
 of Old England disdained not to rest.
     The Equisetums are an interesting tribe to the
 geologist, for they appear to have formed a very

90               SEA-SIDE PLANTS.
considerable part of the original vegetation of this
world of ours. In modern days they are but a few
feet in height, but once they were tall plants many
yards high, or gigantic species more like trees than
herbaceous plants ; and the strata of the coal-fields
exhibit Equisetaceae, beside which our modern
horsetails dwindle into insignificance.

SOMETHING of the loveliness which the poet de
scribes, may be beheld in the salt pools among the
rocks, those miniature seas which on some shores
present us with a little world of beauty.                It would
be difficult to linger gazing into these hollows,
when the summer sun shines down upon them,
and through their clear waters we see the dense
silky tufts, or the waving branches of sea-weeds,
without forming some picture in the mind of the
scene presented by the ocean bed.                     But if we
could sail away a little from the shore, where the
water is clear and still, or yet better, if we could
glide over the blue waters where the base of a
deeper sea would reveal itself, we should espy
masses    of vegetation grouped in graceful forms,
and  intermingling their boughs together, like the

92                    SEA-WEEDS.
forest trees which group themselves now on many
a bright spot of earth, over which, as geologists
tell us, ocean itself once flowed. The dancing
waves carry the long leaves backwards and for
wards, and not a weed is there but some living
creature of wonderful and beauteous structure is
there too to enjoy it. We speak of the uses of sea
weeds, and the God who has given to man " the
sea and all that therein is," designed them in some
measure for his service. But we make only a faint
estimate of the worth of marine vegetation, when
we think of sea-weeds but as contributing to utility
by their use in dyes and manufactures, or in
 affording nutriment to us. They belong more
 especially to the myriads of creatures which in
 habit the great deep. They are their homes, their
 couches, their sources of food.     It is wondrous to
 reflect, that the worlds of water contain far more
 of animal life than exists on this green earth, or in
 the air which surrounds it ; for besides that a much
 larger portion of the globe consists of water than
 of land, the seas are inhabited in their depths.
 Few are the terrestrial creatures which, like the
 mole, know not the worth of light, and can make
 their homes beneath earth's surface, unmindful of
 its darkness.    The millions of animated creatures
 which float on air, or walk or creep over glade or
 mountain, dwell on the external portion of earth.
  But a great part of the depths has its living inmates,
  and the Psalmist expressed his sense of their mul
  titude, when he said, " Therein are things creeping
  innumerable, both small and great."         There they
  live and die, in a home suited by the great Creator
  to their wants and capacities of enjoyment. Nor
  is it all a home of darkness.      The deep has its

                          SEA-WEEDS.                      93
glowworms, bringing their tiny lamps to make it
luminous, and carrying in their track a gleam of
brilliant light. There are, probably, few marine
animals which are not more or less indebted for
their sustenance or enjoyment to some of the
numerous sea-plants, which lie beyond our ken in
the world beneath the waters. Every one of these
has its appointed dwelling-place and provision,
from
         " The
               aspiring fish that fain would be  a bird,"
down to
                                " The Zoophyte,
         That link which binds Prometheus to his rock,
         The living fibre to insensate matter."
 But amid this store of living creatures, Death has
 a work to do, and millions are born to live but a
 few hours or days.           In this vast basin, whose
 every wave contains living things,
         " Countless as sunbeams,   slight as gossamer,"
 and  in whose waters      move also the monsters of the
 deep, dead animal substances lie or float, whose
 putrefying remains would spread poison on the air
 above and around the sea, and gradually diffuse
 that poison to earth's farthest limits. The sea air,
 which now brings health on its breezes, would
 carry disease and death, were it not for the
 scavenger-like animals which prey upon its refuse,
 and for the sea- weeds, which, with continual and
 rapid growth, cover every part of ocean's bed.
 Their large tough and woody stems, crowned often
 with gigantic fronds or leaves, assimilate to their
 own support the masses of putrescence, arising both
 from this source and from the substances constantly
 carried by every tide from the shore. The decay

 of these sea-weeds, in their turn, renews the soil
  of ocean bed, by means of which it gradually rises.
 And thus the lovely and picturesque plants of the
 sea, aid with the rushing of the waters, and ebbing
 and falling tides, and with the saltness arising from
 the deposits of saline matter in the channels of the
 deep, to change, what else would be evil into good,
 and to spread purification and wholesome air, in
 stead of poison.
    The number of British sea-weeds is about three
 hundred and seventy, and of these many need the
 aid of a microscope to discover their beauty of
 structure. Growing both in salt and fresh waters,
 or forming crusts on rocks, or sea-caves, or on in
 land moist places, are to be found tribes of Algae,
 which seem formed of little riband-like particles,
which, when subjected to microscopic investigation,
 startle and puzzle the philosopher, at one moment
appearing to have animal, and at another vegetable
life ; or resolving themselves into those links, be
tween the two kingdoms, those tribes, half plant,
half animal, which until the recent improvements
in the microscope, have lived through countless
generations, unknown and unsuspected.         Some of
the Oscillatoria tribe are found in salt waters, for
they exist wherever there is water, though more
abundantly in ponds or rivers, or on moist places,
than in the sea ; and naturalists know not whether
to regard them as plants or animals.         Adanson
was the first who discovered their singular move
ments, which have since much interested men of
science.    They often form crowds of filaments of
greenish or brownish tint, each pellucid thread
having a diameter of about the thousandth part of
an inch.    Now they assume the crooked windings

of the letter S   ;  now they are perfectly straight ;
and the next moment finds them twisting them
selves up in various contortions, either with slow
or rapid motions. When these oscillatory plants
are fully grown, their movements cease ; but the
young fibres exhibit them, not only while in water
but when taken out and laid on a plate.          These
plants are of most rapid growth, acquiring ten or
twelve times their length in so many hours. They
grow and increase like vegetables, but when burnt
yield the odour of decaying animal substances.
Still more wondrous is that tribe of microscopic
Algae, called the Diatomacete.     Many of these are
marine, and are to be found in all seas ; even the
melted icebergs yielding masses of them. Thou
sands of these minute plants are contained in a
drop of water, yet every little plant has a beautiful
structure of flint, and exhibits a most singular
conformation.       Some of the delicate silk -like or
velvety tufts of the Algae of the seas, when ex
amined, seem like strings of beads; some like tubes
of glass filled with bright colouring matter ; others
composed of networks finer than the finest cob
webs; some like little bunches of slender hairs;
others branched, like minute trees of emerald
green or sparkling brown, or rivalling the rose and
violet in richest hues. We might linger over de
scriptions of the minute wonders of this tribe, and
tell how some small plants have filaments consist
ing of two tubes, one of which is exterior and so
transparent that it might be compared to a tube
of glass. Within this lies a jointed tube, filled
with colouring matter, often almost imperceptible,
but occasionally of most brilliant green or purple,
or faint yellow tint ; and pointing from these won

drous things to the great Maker of the universe,
we might exclaim with Job, " Lo, these are a part
of his ways, but what whisper-word is heard of
him!"*
   But in this chapter our        business is not so much
with the unseen as with the visible. It is not of
the hidden wonders of ocean that we must tell,
but leaving the less known forms of Algae, we
must proceed to describe some of the most com
mon kinds of our sea-weeds, in such simple manner
as may enable the wanderer by the shores of our
island to recognise the forms most familiar to the
eye. And attempting no scientific classification,
we shall simply divide the sea-weeds into the three
great groups into which botanists arrange them,
which are the olive-green, the red, and the green
sea-weeds.
   At almost any part of the year           we may find on
our shores abundant specimens of some of the
coarse olive-green sea-weeds, the Melanosperms of
the botanist. There they He, all withered up by
the sunshine, or fresh and tough as they have just
been dashed up on the shore,
      " Hurl'd out of darkness by the uprooting surges."
The piers about the sea are blackened by some of
them, and their long fronds are beaten by the
waves which fall upon the rocks on the beach.
The name of flags, derived from their flagging and
drooping positions, is frequently appropriate to
these sea-weeds, and often for miles along the
rocky coast, the distant scene seems black by
the profusion of their olive fronds, which, when

the sea comes up with its high tide, no longer
droop heavily, but float and play with every wave.
   Every one accustomed to the sea-side, or even
to the shores of salt rivers, knows that most com
mon of all sea-weeds, the Bladder Fucus (Fucus
vesiculosus), whose dark sprays lie on every line
of sand or shingle, or gather in clumps on rock or
pier. When fresh from the waters, it is of a dark
olive tint, but as it hardens in the sun it becomes
black as ink. Its frond has on       it,
                                     here and there,
a number of oval bladders or pods. These are the
air bladders, which enable the fucus to float on the
waters;    and these occasion the crackling noise,
when, as we walk upon the shore, we crush the
half dried sea- weed by our footstep. As this plant
dries,
     it  becomes covered with    awhitish salt crust.
It has the common names of Bladder- wrack and
Sea-ware, and was formerly very generally called
Sea-oak. The Scotch call    it   Kelp-ware, or Black
Tang.    Its fronds, when near the shore, are gene
rally about a  foot long, but when found in deeper
water, they are larger and more abundantly pro
vided with the air vessels, by means of which they
wave about in the sea; and large branches, four
or even five feet in length, may there be gathered.
The frond forms numerous young plants about its
roots, and if   torn,
                    it   will throw out new shoots
from the injured part. In Gothland         it famous
                                                is
                                                 a
food for cattle when boiled and mingled with meal.
Cattle are also fed on some other of the fucus
tribe, and in some of the Scottish isles the animals
go down regularly at low tide to feed on this
refuse of the waves, guided by that instinct, which
teaches them so surely, as that they never mistake
the time of its ebbing. This   is  also much used for

manure.       We may see in England the little
cart, or the larger wagon, loaded with these dark
tinted weeds, wending its way along some of the
green lanes in districts near the sea, and about to
deposit its load on the land.     But in Ireland this
kind of manure is often the only one which the
poor man can procure, and the storm which brings
up from the ocean depths the large masses of
fuci, is often a source of comfort to the Irish pea
sants, who gather on the shore in large companies,
at such seasons, in order to appropriate the store
of the sea.      Dr. Greville states that the dried
frond is used for fuel in several parts of the North,
and that in the Hebrides cheeses are dried without
salt, by means of the ashes procured by burning
this plant. These ashes contain half their weight
in alkaline salt. Its bladders also yield iodine,
the quantity of which is said by Sir Humphry
 Davy to vary according to the climate under
 which the plant grows ; for this sea- weed, unlike
 our other common fuci, has a wide range, and
 flourishes within the Arctic circle, and lifts a
 smaller frond to the waves which beat on some
 tropical shores. It was from this plant that Dr.
 Russell procured the black salt powder, called
 Vegetable Ethiops, which has been used in medi
 cine, and is also an excellent dentifrice.      The
 frond of the bladder fucus has a rib or vein up its
 middle, and air vessels, from the size of a pea to a
 hazel nut, in pairs, scattered irregularly over its
 substance.
    Another of the very common fuci is the Prickly
 Tang, or Saw-leaved Eucus (Fucus serratus), which
 is as frequent as the bladder-wrack, and much
 like it ; the length of its fronds varying from two

to six feet.   Itmay at once be known from the
former species by its notched or serrated edges,
and by having no air-vessels.  It often covers the
rocks to the limit of low water.   Our engraving
represents it in the condition in which we often
findit,as the place of attachment to various para
sitic objects. The thread-like coralline, and the
rough crust are two zoophytes, which will be
described in   a   future chapter    and the little

dwelling places of that singular and minute worm
the spirorbis.    They have not, like true shells,

varied markings or brilliant tints, and they are
attached by their flat sides to the sea-weed ; but the
beautiful animal within, when seen under the micro
scope, excites our admiration by its symmetry and
grace ; and its shell-like case was secreted, like the
home of the mollusk, by its outer covering or skin.
   Another of the most common of our marine
plants, and one of our largest kinds, is the
Knobbed or Knotted Fucus (Fucus nodosus).
It is a thick, leathery plant, of an olive-green,
often almost yellow colour, when fresh, but when
dried, of a black hue, and polished like ebony.
It may easily be known by its long stem, which
swells at intervals into large bladders, in fine
specimens an inch and a half in length, and look
ing altogether like a string of beads. The air-
vessels are said to be used, when highly polished,
for necklaces.     It has, when in fructification,
orange-coloured pods, on little stalks; hence the
people of the Orkney Isles call this plant Yellow
Tang. In Norway its large air vessels acquired for
it the name of Knop Tang. These bladders are
admirably adapted to the condition of the plant, for
it is coarse and heavy, and when growing in deep
water, it is seven or eight feet long ; so that the
stormy winds, which upraise the waves, dash it
with great violence against the rocky peaks. Were
the bladders of more delicate structure, and frailer
substance, it must inevitably be torn to pieces by
the force of wind and waves.          Were they like
those of the Bladder Fucus, which break by a
gentle pressure of the finger, they would not suit
this plant. But the Bladder Fucus grows in a flat
branch upon rocks, and needs not the provision of
a stronger fabric.   The Knobbed Fucus is known

on some parts of the coast of Scotland as the sea-
whistles, because boys make bladders of its large
air-vessels.  If these are thrown into the fire, they
burst with a loud report.
   One more Fucus only is very common on our
shores. This is the smallest species, and called the
Channelled Fucus (Fucus canaliculatus), from its
channelled stems and branches. It has no air
vessels, for it does not need them, as it grows on
the rocks, about the high-water mark, and on

    never fail to browse on    itin winter, whenever the
    receding tide leaves  it free of access to them.
       There are, besides these, two other species of
    Fucus, belonging to our British genus, of that
    name, but they will be left unnoticed as not being
    common plants. All these species, as well as some
    other of the olive-coloured sea- weeds, are burned
    for kelp, for the service of the glass and soap
    manufactories. The Knobbed Fucus seems the
    most valuable plant for this purpose ;    but the ser
    rated species, as well as some kinds of those large,
•
    leaf -like marine plants, called the oar-weeds, con
    tribute also to the kelp-burning.     Time was, when
    this preparation of kelp was a source of livelihood
    to many but among the changes which have been
            ;
    made by the improvements in chemistry during
    late years, other means have been found of pro
    curing soda by   a  less expensive process, and the
    kelp burners have had little to do. The weeds,
    when intended for kelp burning, were cut from
    the rocks, or gathered from the shore by men,
    women, and children, and laid in the sun to dry.
    They were then made up into little mounds, till
    the summer was over, when they were thrown
    into pits, where they were lighted and left to

burn.     They thus formed cakes of ashes, which
were in this state sold ; and Dr. Drummond
remarked a few years since, that almost the entire
rent of the Island of Ratlin, on the northern
coast of Ireland, was paid from the produce of
sea-weeds; and added, that from this source
alone, the rents of a Highland chief had of late
years increased 2,0001. per annum.                The picture
drawn by his brother, Dr. William Drummond, of
the Highlanders engaged in that occupation, is
such as to make us feel regret for that individual
injury, almost always sustained, on the accession
of any public benefit. He thus describes them :-
             " A race inured to toil severe,
       Of manners simple, and of heart  sincere ;
      Sons of the rock, and nurslings of the surge,
      Around the kiln their daily labours urge ;
      O'er the dried weed the smoky volume coils,
      And deep beneath, the precious kali boils."
The growth of these sea-weeds is remarkably
rapid, so that in a few months they will cover
with a dark vegetation the barren rocks on the
shore over which the white sea-Wave dashes.                So
readily do they increase, that on some parts of the
coast where the plants are not naturally abun
dant, they have been raised by merely placing
 stones at intervals, close to the sea.             In a short
time these sea-weeds yielded to their owner a
plentiful crop.      Scotland and its adjacent islands
are stated, at one time, to have furnished no less
than 20,000 tons annually of kelp, made from the
coarse marine plants.
    An anecdote related by Neill, is quoted by
 Dr. Greville, and, indeed, by many writers on
 sea-weeds, and well illustrates their rapid growth.

A  stone beacon was about to be erected on a low
rock, near the entrance of the Frith of Forth,
called the Carr Rock. This is about twenty feet
broad, and sixty feet long, and before the com
mencement of any operations, was blackened by
dark masses of sea-weed, particularly of the
Digitate oar-weed, and Esculent alaria, which
were only left uncovered at the lowest ebb of
spring-tides.    In the autumn of 1813, a great
part of the foundation for the proposed beacon had
been levelled, when it was found necessary for a
time to relinquish the project.      The sea-weeds
had then been cut away, and their roots trampled
down by the workmen.        In May, 1814, the work
was resumed, and great was the surprise of the
engineer, at finding that the surface of the rock
was again dark with its marine vegetation, and
that the long olive leaves were waving to and fro
in the waters.    Little more than six months had
expired since he saw the rock naked and barren ;
now freshly grown leaves of the alaria, six feet
long, and the specimens of oar-weed about two
feet in length, seemed waving their flags of
triumph over their old dwelling-place. It was
evident that they had grown from seed, for they
were flourishing over the soil whose surface had
been so completely cleared in the autumn by the
pick and chisel.
   The different species of Fucus have a variety of
uses besides those already mentioned.     The poor
Icelander, who can command no wealth, but who
can still with patriotic gratitude look on his
country, and say, "Iceland is the best land on
which the sun shines," makes use of many sea
weeds, and the commonest kinds on his shore

                     SEA-WEEDS.                 105
serve him for mattresses.     The Bladder Fucus is
the food of his horses, and in the winter time the
cows and sheep go down to the shore to feed upon
it. In Holland, both this and the Serrated Fucus
are used hy fishermen in packing their fish for
exportation.     Invalids who resort to our own
shores for the relief of glandular affections, de
rive benefit both from the outward application of
the Bladder Fucus, which contains the principle
of iodine, and from the iodine which they inhale
with every breath which they draw by the sea-side.
   But nowhere is sea-weed an object of greater
interest than in the Channel Isles, where the
gathering of these plants from the rocks is made
the subject of frequent legislative enactions.   At
all seasons of the year, groups of women and
children may be seen on the shores of Jersey,
diligently collecting the dark species of fucus.
It is used as a manure both in its fresh state, and
after having been reduced to ashes by being
burned as fuel. So general is its use as fuel,
that it is only on grand occasions that coal or
wood is added; and it must be on a festive
day, a birth-day, or some season sacred to the
" superstitions of the heart," that a coal fire
glimmers in the stove of a Jersey parlour.      The
sea-wrack fuel makes a hot, though not a cheerful
fire, even without the addition of wood or coal;
and as the ashes are so useful on the land, the
fire is suffered to burn by night as well as day,
so that, as Inglis says,
                         " a stranger in the country
would, on an early morning ride, imagine that the
Jersey farmer and his household were astir long
before daybreak; for he would see the smoke
curling from every farm house, and almost from

106                   SEA-WEEDS.
every cottage chimney."       The French name of
these plants is varech, and in Jersey dialect it is
vraic, being somewhat similar to our common
name of wrack.       In the daily gatherings from
the shore, the inhabitants are prohibited by their
island laws from collecting it between sunrise
and sunset, in order to allow some advantage to
those who reside at a distance from the coast.
But besides these daily gatherings from the tide,
there are two times of the year called the vraick-
ing seasons, when, at dawn of day, large parties
sally from every part of the island, and rest not
till they reach the shore. Merry parties they are,
for though they must labour hard, yet singing
gleefully to the music of the waves, they with their
scythes cut away from the rocks the useful weeds,
and filling their carts with them, sit down to their
humble meal of the vraicking cake, made of flour,
milk and sugar, and to other articles both of
eating and drinking which they carry with them.
The carts proceed as far as the tide will admit ;
but boats carry the vraickers to the more distant
rocks ; and the stranger to the scene is often
 amused at seeing the busy crowds covering the
rocks and the shore, while, when the ruthless tide
 sets in, the carts and horses may sometimes be
 seen floating on the waves.      The two annual
 seasons for gathering the weeds in this way are
 limited to about ten days in March, and a similar
 portion of the month of July; and there are
 many families who look forward to these labours,
 not only as furnishing fuel for their houses, and
 manure for their lands, but as the means of pro
 curing a commodity for sale, by which clothing
 and other necessaries must be purchased.

                       SEA-WEEDS.                  107
    On every part of the     shores we may find that
common        marine plant the Podded Halidrys
(Halidrys siliquosd), which lies in dark branched
masses about the beach, or grows on the rocks
and stones upon it.      It has the common name of
sea-tree, from its shrub-like appearance, and it
may be known by its numerous pods, about an
inch long, which grow on both sides of the stem
and branches.       It is of a pale olive-green, but
turns quite black in drying. In Norway this plant,
as well as the knobbed fucus, is called Knoptang.
     On many parts of the coast, the Strap-shaped
 Himanthalia, or Sea Thongs (Himanthalia lorea),
 attracts the notice of those who are interested in
 the productions of the ocean. Sometimes we may
 look for it in vain for weeks on the beach, but
 after a storm it will lie in great profusion, and
 hundreds of specimens might be collected in an
 hour's walk. It is commonly on our coast called
 Sea Thongs, and this name well describes it. It
 is a flat olive-green sea- weed, often ten feet long,
 and sometimes found in Cornwall of the length of
 twenty feet, looking like a continuation of flat,
 narrow pods or seed vessels, dividing every now
 and then into two branches, each of which divides
 farther on into two more, and so on through its
 whole length. When in a perfect state, however,
  it has one peculiarity by which it may at once be
 known from all our other sea-weeds.       It springs
 from a kind of cup at its base, and in the earliest
  stage of its growth these cups may be seen thickly
  scattered on the rocks in the sea, and looking just
 like those plants of the fungus tribe which are
  called Pezizas. Little projections arise from this
 hollow cup, after it has grown into a good size,

108                 SEA-WEEDS.
which gradually enlarge and lengthen into a long
flat strap of uniform shape throughout.     It has
on both sides small projections or tubercles, im
mersed in the strap-shaped portion, and plentifully
scattered over it. It is of leathery texture, but

                      SEA-WEEDS.                   109
its interior is pulpy and succulent. In some cases
it has a yellow, slimy substance on it : and the
author of these pages having wound a piece
around the hand, when gathering it up from the
beach, had a stain on the fingers remaining for
some time after touching it.      In Orkney, where
it is called Drew, it is very abundant, and it
yields excellent kelp. Dr. Greville observes, that
in regard to its duration it seems to commence its
vegetation in the spring, and to arrive at maturity
in the early part of the spring following. It turns
 black in drying, and requires well washing in
fresh water to deprive it of the slimy substance
 with which it is covered. The cup is in this case
 the true frond, the long thongs being merely the
 seed-vessels, and both parts should be preserved
 for the herbarium by the collector of sea- weeds.
     Most sea- weeds have some kind of root, or rather
 means of attachment to the soil on which they
 grow. This is merely a continuation of their leafy
 substance, the fixed end of the plant swelling out
 when it roots itself.    Some have a callous disc,
 others a tough leathery fibre, and there are besides
 species of marine weeds which grow on sand, and
 are therefore provided with branching roots, in
 some measure resembling those of land plants.
 There are, however, some few sea-weeds which have
 no point of attachment, but which grow in floating
 masses, or individual clusters in the sea itself.
 The celebrated Gulf- weed is one of these. This
 plant, which is the floating Fucus of the older
  authors, is by writers of our Marine Floras
  always enumerated among the British plants ; but
  all agree that it is not properly native to our
  shores, though often cast on them by the waves,

110                    SEA-WEEDS.
especially on the Orkney Islands.        The Gulf-weed
or Sea-grape, is the Sargassum vulgare of modern
authors; but another species, the berry-bearing
Sargasso, is also thrown up on our coast, and some
writers consider these as but varieties of one spe
cies. However that may be, this floating Sargasso
is a very interesting plant on many accounts.        It
has been found in almost every part of the world,
and it floats in an immense tangling mass, covering
a space of at least forty thousand square miles in
the Atlantic, just within the great Equatorial cur
rent. This was the mass of weed which Columbus
described as floating meadows, and these fields of
sea- weed (so new a sight to the Spanish navigators)
alarmed the crew of the " Santa Maria," when Co
lumbus was guiding them to the discovery of a
new world. Superstitiously regarding this obstacle
as an indication that their expedition had not re
ceived the sanction of the Almighty, they had
nearly, in their faint-heartedness, given up the
pursuit on which they had so far entered.          This
part of the ocean is believed to be the portion
called by the ancient Phoenicians the Weedy Sea.
The English mariner still terms it the Grassy,
and the Spaniard, El Mar do Sargasso.          This sea
extends from 22° to 36° north latitude, and from
25° to 45° west longitude, and its weeds often im
pede the course of vessels through them. Beyond
these limits there are few pieces of the sea-weed
seen, and sometimes even in the grassy sea, the
vessel may float 'for hours and scarcely see any,
till it shall at once find itself in a dense dark mass.
These floating tangles were formerly supposed to
have been brought by the Gulf stream from the
Gulf of Mexico. Then they were supposed to have

                          SEA- WEEDS.                    Ill
grown on shallows in that part of the sea where
they abound, and to have been rent from them by
fishes.    But it seems now to be ascertained that
this weed has no other station than the sea itself,
since among the thousands of specimens fished up
and examined, no root has been discovered.                It
grows, therefore, freely in the open sea.
    The Sea-grape is an olive-green weed, with long
slender leaves, and berries about as large as a pea,
from which it derived its name of Tropic Grape.
Our sailors call this sea-weed Midshipman's pickle,
because it is pickled in vinegar and eaten on board
of our ships. It is also made into salads, in some
countries of the East. Myriads of fishes and sea
animals live on these masses of weeds — these ocean
meadows ; and though they are not firm enough
to bear the foot of man, yet the birds which
          " Make  voyages amidst the pathless heaven,"
 find a temporary resting-place, and a pleasant food
 on these floating islands, and sing their thankful
 songs amid the waste of waters, heard only by the
 ear of Him, who, when He called them into being,
             " Forgot not one of his large family,
              But eared for each as for an only child."
    We have five British species of the olive-coloured
genus of sea-weeds called Bladder-chain, but they
 are none of them very common, except on the
 southern shores of England and Ireland.                The
 most   frequent is the Granulated Bladder-chain
 (Cystoseira granulata), which has a cylindrical
 stem, about as thick as a goose-quill, from two to
 eight inches high, with numerous branches, slender
 as a packthread.        The air vessels form a kind of

112                     SEA-WEEDS.
chain, sometimes running into one another. This
sea- weed is firm, leathery, and flexible in texture.
    Every one has seen those grey crusted, shaggy
lichens which hang about our old trees, and will
readily agree that two of our sea-weeds sufficiently
resemble them to deserve their name of Lichina.
The dwarf Lichina (Lichina pygmaa) is the more
frequent kind, and it grows on sea-side rocks, near

 to the high-water mark, but within reach of the
 waves.     When the tide is out it is often left dry
 for hours, and it is then a black, hard crust ; but
 the returning waves restore it to its native olive
 tint, and render it soft and flexible. It is common
  on many rocky shores in autumn, and in the
 West of England it is abundant.               The lesser
  Lichina (Lichina confinis) forms close tufts on
 rocks never inundated by the waves, but on which
  the spray is scattered at high-tide.            Its dark
  patches, though small, crowd and darken the rocks
  so as to be visible at some distance.
     Most of our olive-green sea-weeds grow on rocks
  often left uncovered by the tide, and the
                                               majority of
  them disappear in the deeper water, when
                                                   the base
  is never left exposed to the sun

all its brightness, and when the breeze

it is not then that our beaches are strewed with their
numerous black fronds. But when the leaden
clouds seem to give their own deep dull tint to the
once blue sea, and the winds rising gradually with
hollow moan sweep angrily over it till ocean's voice
 drowns all other of the storm voices, then the
waves dash with tremendous violence against the
rocks, tearing away the marine plants, and sending
them out to float on the waters, to tell the ap
proaching mariner that he is not far from the
 shore, or they strew them on the beach for our
 service or delight.       Then when the storm song of
 yesterday seems hushed in the quietness of to-day,
 or is singing to us only in its low and gentle
 murmurs, and we can stray again by the shore,
 what treasures do we find there —
                          " Crusted shells,
       Rich mosses, tree-like sea-weeds, sparkling pebbles
       Enchant the eye, and tempt the eager hand."
 Two common plants, which may be easily described,
 are almost sure to be among the offerings brought
 to our feet by the waters.           These are the Sweet
 and the Digitate Laminaria, or Oar-weed. The
 former of these consists of a frond or leaf, gene
 rally about three or four feet long, and about four
 or five inches wide; but when in its young state
 we may find it not more than two inches, while
                                 i

some fine specimens are ten feet long.       It has a
thick tough stem, and is of an olive-green, and of
leathery texture. In the young plant it is some
times like a thin flat leaf, but when older, its edges
are puckered like a frill, and it has a number of
raised projections down the middle, being what
botanists call bullated or blistered ; while a muci
laginous substance, with which it is covered, comes
off on the hand. This sea-weed has a large fibrous
root, if, indeed, that can be called    root, which
                                        a               is
never intended to penetrate the soil, but only to
hold the plant fast to the surface of the rock.         If
we examine the fibrous root of     a  land plant (one
of the grasses, for example), we find   itadapted not
only for keeping the plant firm in the ground, but
also, by tapering points, and minute orifices at the
extremities of its fibres, suited for deriving nutri
ment from the earth.        The sea-weeds, however,
are little affected by the soils on which they grow,
and they seem to require their roots, almost
entirely, as means of holding them attached to it.
   The Sweet Laminaria (Laminaria saccharina)
is called by fishermen the Sea Belt.         If
                                              washed,
and hung up in the sun to dry,     itbecomes covered
with an efflorescence of a white colour, and of a
flavour at once of salt and sugar, which          not,
                                                  is
however, very agreeable to the palate. This        not
                                                   is
the only sea-weed which deposits these crystals of
sweet powder, which are in the form of needles, and
which were by Dr. Stenhouse discovered to be man-
nite, the characteristic principle of manna, differing
from cane sugar, but resembling that procured
from grapes. The quantity of this mannite         very
                                                  is
great.    Dr.  Stenhouse   found  that  one thousand
grains   of  the  sea-weed, yielded, by means of a

                      SEA- WEEDS.                                 115
simple process, about twelve per cent. of mannite ;
which Dr. Landsborough describes as very beau
tiful, as purely white as loaf sugar, and almost as
sweet; and as having retained its properties for
four years from the time of the experiment.
   The Sweet Laminaria is eaten, boiled, when in
a young state, but it can be the food of those only
who are almost destitute of any other provision,
for it is neither palatable nor nutritious, though
valuable for manure, and for the kelp which it
affords.
  The people of Japan, according to Thunberg,
call this plant Komb. This traveller found it in
great abundance on the Japanese shores, and very
long and broad. When dried and cleansed from
impurities, it is used for several purposes, and
tough as it    is,
                 it    eaten occasionally, especially
                      is
when the people meet together to drink their
liquor called sakki. It       cut into pieces, which
                                is

taken with other food.      Sometimes       appears on

 scraped and cut into slips about two inches long,
 which are folded in the form of      square, and tied
                                          a
 over with a   narrow slip of the sea-weed. When
 presents are made, about half          score, or even
                                          a
 a score of these squares are strewed about among
 them. It   is  customary here, as elsewhere in the
 East, to make many gifts, and       forms part of the
                                      it
  ceremonial to accompany them with              compli a

                           is                folded and
  tied, and at each end of this   affixed     is a is

  easy to guess at the import of ceremonies of
  nations whose tone of thinking and feeling           so         is

  different from our own    ; but figurative as are the
  language and customs of Eastern people, the
  opinion of Barrow is highly probable, that this
  practice is significant of the resources of the sea
  to those who choose to avail themselves of its
  benefits.
     We have said that the Sea-belt is common
  every where around our island, and both this and
  the Tangle, or Fingered Oar-weed, often lie in
 heaps on the beach, ready to be carried away for
 the lands. Both of them, too, are brought every
  summer inland, by hundreds of visitors to the sea,
 who hang them up in their houses as hygrometers,
 and they afford good indications of approaching
 rain, by their damp flagging state when the atmo
 sphere is moist.
     The Tangle or Fingered Oar-weed (Laminaria
 digitata) is a long flat leaf of an olive-green colour,
 which, when young, is eaten, but after its early
 stage it separates into a number of segments like
 ribbons, from the point of the leaf, to within a
 few inches of the stem.      Children run about the
beach with handfuls of these waving ribbons, at
our sea-side towns, and the first idea which one
might have, would be that these plants were torn
into shreds by the waves ; but on examining them
the edges are found smooth as if cut by a knife,
and not rudely rent asunder.          This sea -weed is
known on our coast as the Sea Girdle and Sea
Hanger.      In the Orkney Isles it is called Red
Ware, and the Scottish Highlanders term it Sea-
wand. The dried stalks, often thick and woody,
and several feet long, are burnt for fuel on the
Orkney and Shetland Islands, and the fronds and
stems are boiled in Nordland as food for cattle.

                    SEA- WEEDS.                117
The young plants are also eaten by the people of
Scotland and the south-west of England, and
 numerous tribes of shell-fish find their food in
 this large plant.   This sea-weed, mingled with
 another called the Pepper Dulse, is still sold in
 Scotland, or was at least a few years since. Dr.
 Greville remarks, that he has heard the cry in the
 streets of Edinburgh, "Buy Dulse and Tangle."
 It is only while young, that the plant is at all fit

 to be eaten, for the fully grown fronds have stems
 as thick as walking sticks, and about as digestible.
 These stems become so shrivelled and hard by
 long exposure to the air, that knife-handles are
 sometimes made of them. These are tipped with
 metal, and when polished are scarcely to be dis
 tinguished from harfs-horn. Dr. Johnston says of
 the plant, " In some parts of the western isles of
 Scotland, it forms even a sort of soil on the peb
 bles of the beach, on which the natives sow barley ;
 and as the sea-weed rots, the grain drops with it
into the interstices, so that when the harvest is
ready, it seems growing on a surface of polished
pebbles."
    We have five British species of Laminaria, all
flat leaf-like sea-weeds, and it is in allusion to this
 that they received their botanic name from Lamina,
 a thin plate.   One other kind only will be noticed
here.    This is the bulbous Laminaria (Laminaria
 bulbosa), a plant not nearly so general as the other
two species, though thrown up in large masses on
 some parts of our coast, chiefly in the south and
western shores of England, and in some places on
the Irish and Scottish shores.        In the Orkney
Islands, where it abounds, it was long valued for
its supply for the kelp-furnace, for it is so large
a plant that a mass of the weed growing from
a single root is often a load for a man.       It has a
short stem, and like most of this family, a fibrous
root at first, but this swells at length into a bulb,
and forms a distinction of the species. Mrs. Grif
fiths measured a specimen of this plant which was
gathered from deep water at Torbay, and found
the bulb to be a foot in diameter; while the
whole fronds, when spread over the ground,

                      SEA- WEEDS.                     119
formed a circle, whose diameter was at least twelve
feet.   Like the fingered species, it is cleft into
ribbons, but it is much larger than any other of
 our native kinds.   Our fishermen call it Sea-fur
 belows, and Furbelowed Hangers, on account of
the waved margin of the plant at the base, which
 resembles a frill or furbelow, and at once distin
guishes the species from all others. It grows only
 in deep water, and       on account of its size,
                        is,                            a
valuable plant for manure.         It     the largest
                                            is
European kind.
    The Laminaria tribe have been well called the
 giants of the marine flora, but large as are our
native plants of this family, those of some other
seas far exceed them.    On the west coast of South
America, some of the tribe are        most important
                                        a
resource to the poor, furnishing them, as some of
them do also the aborigines of Australia, with
instruments, vessels, and food. In the seas near
these shores, they form       forest-like vegetation
                               a
under the waters  ;   among whose long leaves lie
the treasures of the deep, the pearls of ocean,
and the gems of mines     : and more precious still,
the forms of thousands, once gifted with light
and love, which the sea shall hold till      gives up
                                                 it
its dead.
   That very singular production, known by the
name of Sea-trumpet,    isone of this family. When
its large fronds are seen floating on the waves, the
sailor knows that he beholds a sure indication of
the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope. The
young Hottentots, as well as the children of the
Dutch settlers, make trumpets of its long stalks,
and Thunberg, who calls          the Trumpet-grass,
                                   it
says that the land-birds often come and sit upon it.

This plant is well known to contain a larger
quantity of iodine than any European sea-weed.
Iodine is the powerful remedy used in cases of
those swellings in the neck termed goitre; and
Professor Lindley observes, that it is a curious fact
that the stems of a sea-weed are sold in the shops
and chewed hy the inhabitants of South America,
wherever goitre is prevalent, for its cure.     This
remedy is by them termed goitre-stick, and appears
to belong to the Laminarieae.   To the same tribe
belongs also that wonderful sea-weed, called Ever
lasting Bladder-thread(Mawoc2/s/is^n/mz),which
navigators have described as being from five hun
dred to fifteen hundred feet long, and pieces of
which have, by measurement, been proved to be
three hundred feet in length. It is a remarkably
elegant plant, its stalks not thicker than a finger,
and its upper branches no larger than a packthread,
with narrow leaves, seven or eight feet long, while
at the base of each is a strong air-vessel, without
whose aid it could not support its great length in
the waters.    It has a strong root, which holds it
fast to its craggy rocky home.     Yet, long as it is,
it can grow in water less deep than might be sup
posed for as Meyan remarks,
      ;                            does not grow in
                                      it
a  straight direction from the bottom, but lies
somewhat horizontally.       This author observes
of it, that    it  distributed in the New World
                    is
throughout all the zones, from the extreme north
to the extreme southern point. Baron Humboldt
brought   it  from the tropical seas, but     it   is
found at Cape Horn of greater length than else
where.
  There   isone other British genus of Laminarieae,
containing, however, only one species, the Esculent

                       SEA- WEEDS.                 121
Alaria (Alaria esculenta),     a plant which, though
not common on all our coasts, yet on some, as
the shores of Durham and Northumberland and
Scotland, is abundant, and is found, though
rarely, on some southern shores of England. It is
indeed both general and plentiful on those parts
of our isle washed by the Northern Pacific and
Atlantic oceans; but wherever it flourishes it
usually grows in deep water. Many people of
the northern countries of Europe use this plant as
food, and the Irish and Scottish peasants gather it
from the rocks, and seem to eat it with great relish.
Its frond is a long green leaf, but it may be dis
tinguished from the oar-weeds by the midrib or
vein up its middle. It has, besides, on its stem a
number of slender leaflets from two to seven
inches long, and it is these leaflets and the midrib
which are eaten. We must not, however, expect
to find the leaflets in its young state, as they are
often not developed until the plant is a yard long.
This   sea- weed is of a thin substance, and of a pale
yellowish green, and it sometimes attains a length
of twenty    feet, but we cannot find a perfect speci
men, as the end of the frond is sure to be torn by
the action of the waves upon its somewhat frail
 texture.    Dr. Johnston remarks, that a botanist
found on the coast of Northumberland a variety
 of this sea-weed, with so broad a frond that it
reminded him of the leaf of a plantain-tree ; while
 in another variety of the same coast, the frond was
 no wider than a common ribbon.           It is called
 Badderlocks, or Hen-ware in Scotland, and has
 also in the Scottish isles the name of Honey-ware,
 and in Ireland that of Murlins.       Sir J. E. Smith
 remarks, that this sea- weed has, when first tasted, a

 122                    SEA- WEEDS.
pleasant flavour; but that it leaves upon the
tongue and mouth a disagreeable crust of greenish
mucus.      The midrib is eaten in its raw state, but
it would not easily be digested by any but persons
who can take robust exercise, for it is as hard as
the raw carrot or turnip of our fields, and to many
its fishy, coppery flavour is very unpleasant.
    Three species of Desmarestia are natives of our
shores in the summer; none are rare, but one
kind, the spiny species (Desmarestia aculeata), is a
very common and elegant sea- weed of most parts
of our coast. Most persons accustomed to gather
the sea- weeds know this, with its delicate, feathery,
graceful branches. Sea-weeds, in general, show to
greater advantage when waving in the water than
when brought to land, and many lose their beauti
ful iridescent hues when removed from their native
element.      But it is the waving form of this, which
bends with every ripple, which so much pleases us,
and which we miss in the dried specimen.         When
young, it is of a pale delicate green, but as it
becomes older it is of a deep olive tint. The
fronds are sometimes one or two feet in length,
without any vein up the middle, and not broader
than a small leaf of the meadow grass. They are
much branched ; and when the plant is young,
little bunches of green threads grow all down
them, which, as the plant becomes older, fall off,
and are succeeded by tiny sharp spines.          If ga
thered while in a young state, it not only assumes
 a bright verdigris hue in drying, but it will impart
 that tint to the paper on which it is laid.
    The strap-leaved       Desmarestia (Desmarestia
 ligulata), is a larger sea-weed, with a flat frond,
from each side of which issue branches situated

 opposite to each other, and the branches have on
 their sides slender narrow leaves ; it is olive-brown
 in the water, but becomes of a sea-green hue on
exposure to the air : and the species called the
green or nourishing kind (Desmarestia viridis), has
the same peculiarity.     This is a beautiful delicate
sea-weed, with slender, hair-like, bushy fronds, all
proceeding from one base, which is not thicker
than a goose-quill.      At first, it is in substance

hard and rigid, but when exposed to the air, it
droops and becomes soft, and in this state it closely
adheres to paper.
   Leaving unnoticed several genera of the Melan-
osperms, as being either too rare or too difficult of
description without the aid of scientific terms, we
proceed to a marine plant which on our rocky
shores is common during the summer.         This is the
Dichotomous Dictyota (Dictyota dichotoma), which
has flat fronds from about three to twelve inches
long, irregularly cleft, and the segments narrower
towards the extremities.       It is of a clear olive-
green colour, lighter in tint and thinner in texture
than most of the olive-green sea- weeds.
   Two frequent plants of our shores may easily
be recognized by him who gathers up the stores
thrown up by the seas. They are the two species
of Sea Whiplash, sometimes called by our sailors
sea catgut and sea laces.     One kind of this whip
lash (Chorda filum) grows attached to rocks and
stones, and is of an olive-green colour, and carti
laginous substance.      It waves about under the
water like a number of strings, and has generally,
at its tip, a bunch of thread-like sea-weed, which
is parasitic upon it. This cord is hollow, and inter
rupted at intervals by transverse partitions, which
are thought, by Stackhouse, to be designed to
confine the air or elastic vapour within certain
spaces, so as to act like air vessels and increase the
buoyancy of the plant. The fronds extend to an
amazing length, and always shoot upwards towards
the surface of the waters. They are sometimes not
more than a few feet long, and are spirally twisted.
 In its growing state, the whole plant is fringed
with small delicate filaments, which render it very

                            SEA-WEEDS.             125
  slippery to the touch. This species is very com
  mon in the North Sea, where it is frequently
  found of the length of thirty or forty feet. Dr.
  Johnston finds it in the Bay of Holy Isle, about
  twenty feet in length. In Scalpa Bay, in Orkney,
  this sea-weed forms meadows, through which a
  pinnace with difficulty forces its way.   And many
  an unwary swimmer has sunk, by means of this
  plant, to rise no more from the ocean bed. Often
  the calm quiet nook of water, whose sandy floors
  are covered with its long strings, seems to offer a
 delightful bathing-place ; but the entangling cords
 form masses, from which the bather finds it diffi
 cult, sometimes impossible, to make his escape.
  In Shetland, it is known by the name of Lucky
  Minny's Lines : and the Highlanders dry it in the
  sun, and take off its skin, when it makes a good
 strong cord for the fishermen.       It has also been
 much valued in the Orkneys for the produce of
 kelp.
     The Jointed Whiplash (Chorda lament aria) is
 nearly as common as this kind, and abundant on
 the coast of Devonshire, as well as on the western
 and eastern shores of Scotland.      It much resem
 bles the other species in general appearance, but
 is smaller.    Dr. Greville remarks of   it,thatit   is
 very similar to the intestine of an animal, tied at
 certain intervals. It        found in summer and
                              is
 autumn, and  is  of thin flaccid substance, and of
                        a                             a
 transparent olive-green colour.
     Another plant, which in the sea looks like fine
 strings,is  the Whipcord Fucus (Chordaria flagelli-
formis);    but
              it    not, like the whiplash, composed
                   is
 of one long cord-like frond, but has       a   central
 stem, with long branches, scarcely thicker than a

packthread, and equal in size throughout.       It is
very common in summer time on rocks and stones
in the sea, and may be but a few inches long,
though sometimes found of the length of three
feet.     It is a firm, dark olive sea-weed, and is
solid in its centre.    When seen under water, it
appears to have a fine fringe of little colourless
fibres, which render it very slippery to the
fingers.
   Very common in the       sea, both in summer and
winter,     on rocks and stones, are the spongy
branches of the sponge-like Cladostephus (Cla-
dostephus spongiosus).     It is not a very pretty
sea-weed, for it has thick clumsy branches, of
about the size of a cord, and about three or four
inches high, densely crowded with little branch-
lets.    It is a dirty brown or olive-green colour,
and so spongy in its nature as to be unlike most
other of our marine plants. A tuft of this weed
is often very useful to the naturalist, as it retains
a good quantity of sea-water, and therefore will
long preserve any living creature which he may
wish to convey home for examination. The
whorled Cladostephus is equally common, and is
a larger plant, much like this, but less spongy in
texture.
    With the description of one other of the olive-
green sea-weeds, we must close this short account
of them, leaving untold of many an interesting
plant on which the imagination loves to linger.
 Some, whole families, parasitic on other plants,
seeming scarcely more than tufts of brownish or
greenish threads; some with flat fronds like the
sea endive ; and others, whose crowded fronds form
a thick fringe on the leaves of large sea-weeds.

 The most beautiful of all the Melanosperms must
 not be passed over in silence. It is not a sea-weed
 which is very general on our coasts, but any one
 who finds         it,
                may at once recognise      by descrip
                                            it
 tion.    This singular
 production     the Pea
                   is
 cock's Tail Pavonia
 (Padina pavonia), and
is  an autumnal plant.
 The old writers called
it    Turkey Feather;
 and     was once con
         it
sidered a sea fungus.
Its frond        broadly
                   is
fan-shaped, becoming
narrow at the base,
sometimes cleft at the
edges, and marked with
numerous concentric lines. The margin         fringed,
                                                 is
and generally turned down or rolled backwards;
and every one will admit that its appearance quite
accords with its familiar name.      This elegant sea
weed has been found in various parts of Devon
shire, on the Scottish shores, and also on several
parts of the coast of Kent and Sussex, particularly
at Margate and Ramsgate, and          has been occa
                                      it
sionally seen at Dovor.       Its place of growth      is
usually in some of those clear rocky pools by the
shore, where the water      still and
                           is    ;       may then be
                                           it

waving       but a zephyr stirs the surface of the
              if

                   is
pale yellowish olive-green, with concentric zones
of   a deeper tint, generally covered with a whitish
powder on one or both sides, and its edges are

fringed with most delicate hairs. It has been
observed of this lovely plant, that while it is
growing it is not uncommon to see the rays of
light decomposed as by a prism by this mass of
minute filaments which fringe the margin.        Dr.
Harvey remarks of this sea-weed, that it is found
pretty extensively in the seas of warm countries
in both hemispheres, perhaps reaching its highest
latitude on our shores.
   The red sea- weeds (Rhodosperms) are more com
mon in the seas of the temperate zone than in the
colder regions or near the Equator, and among
them are the kinds sought with most eagerness by
the amateur collectors of sea- weeds on our coasts.
They exhibit marine vegetation in its loveliest
forms, and though not all strictly red, being often
of purplish or brownish hue, yet they have among
them the red colour in great beauty, sometimes in
its palest or brightest rose tint, and in other cases
of richest scarlet or crimson. Often they are like
delicate fragile leaves, rent even by the touch of
the finger, as we strive to unroll their plaits.
 Sometimes they are like little trees, with slender
hair-like branches, all entangling each other as
they hang dripping from the waters, but exhibiting
the utmost regularity, and minute beauty of
structure, when we dispose them on paper.        The
individual forms of several of our olive species, as
the Laminaria, and especially the Alaria, are
graceful and elegant ; but when they prevail, as
 some of the commoner kinds often do, at the half-
tide level, covering all the rocks and shores with
a dark vegetation, they have a melancholy influ
ence on the scenery ; and when waves are rough,
and clouds are dark, present a dreary waste. This

                       SEA-WEEDS.                 129
kind of    sea-weed usually lessens as we approach
towards the low- water mark ; while, on the other
 hand, these are the plants which vegetate at
 greatest depth, and form submarine forests, into
which the voyager, as he passes over the deep
 blue waters, looks down with wonder and delight.
 There he sees masses of sea-weeds whose trunks
 are as long as those of our highest trees, and whose
 leaves are like those of the Indian forests, and like
them wave to and fro in grace and beauty, while
their olive colour seems to deepen into blackness
as the water becomes deeper.        But many of the
red sea-weeds need close examination to discover
their beauty. No large masses cover our rocks or
shores.    Many are never seen at all by any but
the marine botanist, who goes from the land and
dredges them up from deep waters; and many
need the aid of the microscope to detect one species
from another. These sea-weeds seek the shade,
and will not grow exposed to light and air; and
where, as in some cases, they may occasionally do
so, yet their less perfect and brilliant colour shows
us that this is not their natural and most favour
able condition.    It is when far removed from light
that they deepen into rich and glowing beauty,
and strangely in this respect do they differ from
the plants of our upper earth.        We know well
when the clinging ivy lends its greenness to the
grey time-stained ruin, that should some branch
creep through a crevice into the ruined darkness,
it fades into a dull and sickly yellow or white.
We know that our flowers lose all their beauty of
colour when shut up where the sun's rays cannot
reach them ; but it is not so with sea-weeds. In
the depths the olive becomes darker, the red and

purple are most perfect in hue; and Humboldt
speaks of a beautiful marine plant which he found
in the sea, near the Canary Isles, the Vine-leaved
Fucus, which vegetates at the depth of one hun
dred and ninety-two feet, yet has leaves as green
as those of the grass of the spring oak tree.     OIL
many of our shores the loveliest sea-weeds are
never gathered, though everywhere some of the
commonest kinds, as the Hair Flag, lie strewed
about the sand or beach.        And where there are
rocky pools, we may gaze down upon some which
redden in the shady nook formed by some little
shelving eminence sufficient to protect them from
the sun's brightest rays.
    The division of the sea-weeds into the olive,
red, and green series, is not an arbitrary, but a
natural one, for, in a great measure, with similarity
of colour is connected a similar structure. It is
not, however, so invariable as to be a perfect dis
tinction.   Among the red sea-weeds we find every
 shade of purple tint, and of a few of the darker
kinds we almost hesitate as to whether we should
pronounce them to be red or olive-green ; while
exposure to air and light, in some cases, turns a
red sea-weed into a dull yellow or a dirty white
hue, or renders its crimson of a bright scarlet;
 and drying in the sun blackens almost all the
 olive-green species. Yet in practically studying
 sea-weeds, this presents little difficulty, for very
 generally we find the olive-green plants tough and
 leathery ; the red usually frail and delicate, while
 the grass-green are always of simplest structure,
 and of tint little liable to change.  In this almost
 constancy of colour the Alga differ greatly from
 the plants of our upper earth, among which colour

                       SEA-WEEDS.                 131
is almost useless as a characteristic, giving us
scarcely any idea of the nature or properties of
the plant, and varying under circumstances of soil
or culture.    Thus we see the wild hyacinth trem
bling in the spring wood, and we call it the
blue-bell; but we step into the next copsewood,
 and there we find our favourite woodland flower
 arrayed in purest white. The "brown or purple
heath" sometimes greets us unexpectedly with
 snowy bells, and white blossoms sometimes sur
 prise us on the root, where we expect to find the
 pink flowers of the Robert-leaved cranesbill.
     The fructification of the Alga is usually so
 minute, as to need the assistance of a microscope
 to detect it. Little wart-like excrescences, termed
 capsules, lie on the surface of the frond ; or spots,
 called granules, are imbedded in its substance, or
 scattered on its surface.    Some plants bear both
 these kinds of fruit, in which case the marine
 botanist terms the capsules the primary, and the
 granules the secondary fruit; though both cap
 sules and granules contain seeds (sporules), which
 can produce a new plant.       The grass-green sea
 weeds are remarkable for having seeds which
 possess a singular power of locomotion, in some of
 the plants of the series appearing to be voluntary,
 so that naturalists have not yet decided as to
 whether they may not be endowed with animal
  motion.
     The very commonest of all our red sea- weeds is
 the Hair Flag, or Landscape weed (Plocamium coc-
  cineum).    So frequent, indeed, is this plant, that
  every one who visits the sea-side must have seen
  it, and it is seldom omitted in those drawings of
  marine weeds which accompany pictures of groups
                           K 2

of shells.  It is common    also in the Atlantic,
Pacific, and even Indian    Oceans.   Its generic
name is derived from a Greek word, signifying
hair, or a head of hair ; but, as Dr. Greville has

                        SEA-WEEDS.                    133
observed,   it is not   very happy appellation, for
                        a
finely divided as is the frond, it cannot be said to
resemble hair.   The frond grows in tufts, varying
from two to twelve inches in length, very branched
and bushy, the main stem irregularly divided, and
seldom thicker than a coarse thread.        All the
smaller branches are set with uniform little
branchlets, like the teeth of a comb.     There are
three or four on one side, and then three or four
on the other. These produce a second series of
three or four tiny branchlets from their upper
edge ; and a third, or even fourth occur, each less
than the preceding one, but of the same number,
and always from the upper or inner edge. Though
these are minute distinctions, yet they can be
clearly seen without the aid of a microscope, and
serve to mark this sea-weed from all others.      It
is often called the Scarlet Hair Flag, but it is
rather between a crimson and a scarlet tint, and
sometimes of a rose colour.     Common as it      is,   it
well deserves Dr. Greville's praise of     it,
                                            as that
writer says, it    "
                  is one of the most charming and
symmetrical Alga in the world."
   Our beaches, after      stormy day, are strewed
                            a
with specimens of this plant sometimes large
enough to cover the palm of the hand, and now
and then of sufficient size to spread over the sur
face of a  half sheet of post paper. Some years
since, the poor people who lived on various parts
of our coasts, were accustomed to make for sale
very pretty landscapes of sea-weed and this was
                                     ;
a very suitable plant for their purpose, as      itre
tained its colour, and well represented a tree.
This practice  isless general now, but little groups
of shells and sea-weeds are still occasionally offered

for sale, and this elegant plant is generally selected
to ornament the picture.      Dr. Johnson says, that
fancy work with this sea- weed was once a favourite
amusement with the princesses, the daughters of
 George III.
   Scarcely less common than the hair flag is that
very different looking sea-weed, the Dulse, or
Palmated Rhodomenia (Rhodomeniapalmata) ; and
this, which so often bestrews the sands and beaches
of our British islands, is consumed in various
ways, both in the countries at the North of Eu
rope and in the Greek Archipelago, as well as on
the Scottish and Irish coasts.    Few of those who
pick up the plant from our English shores to
examine   it,are aware how useful    it   to others.

growing either on the rocks or on larger sea- weeds.

Its fronds grow in tufts of several together ; they
are flat, of a purplish red colour, and the seg
ments so divided as well to represent fingers, while
at the base, a portion remains undivided, forming
the frond altogether into the shape of the human
hand.      When the sea-weed is old, it is hard and
tough externally, but within soft and mucilagin
ous.      The young specimens are thin, and of a
lighter colour, and they are frequently seen of the
form represented by our engraving, consisting of
a central oval piece, surrounded by palm-shaped
leaflets, and situated on short slender stalks, and
 reminding us, when laid out on paper, of a sprawl
 ing insect with a small body and large limbs. As
 Sir J. E. Smith observes, this seems the most
 nutritious, and the most agreeable to the palate,
 of any species of sea-weed used in the northern
 hemisphere as food. Sir William Hooker remarks
  of it — " On the Scotch coast, it is eaten raw by
  the natives; and in the county of Caithness, in
 particular,   I  have seen a number of women and
  children gathering it from the rocks, and devour
  ing it -with great avidity." Both the Scotch and
  Irish also dry it in the sun, and roll it up and use
  it instead of tobacco. Nor is this dulse eaten only
  by the peasants.      It is not indeed a general article
  of diet, as it once was, in any part of our kingdom,
  save on those remote shores to which, as yet,
  refinement has not brought new tastes and new
   dishes ; yet many who can afford to procure costly
   food relish it still, perhaps because it brings with
   it some associations of childhood, as some of us
   may now like the blackberries or other wild
   fruits, because they remind us of by-gone times,
    and happy hours in the woodlands. Many, too,

 eat   this sea-weed before breakfast, because of
 its properties in cleansing the blood : and wisely
 do they thus adopt a plant containing the iodine,
 that powerful remedy in scorbutic affections.         In
 Iceland, on the coasts of which island it is strewn
 in profusion, it is used largely as food for cattle, and
 also much eaten by the people; and indeed this
 and a few other sea-weeds were, in earlier times
 (particularly before the introduction of the potato),
 almost the only vegetable food which the Ice
landers could procure.       These marine plants were
 eaten either fresh or dried, and were certainly a
nutritious food, though perhaps palatable only to
those long used to them.        The sea-weeds were at
that time an article of their inland trade ; but we
must rejoice with them, that they have now not
only the potato, but the different varieties of cab
bage, even the cauliflower, and several kinds of
turnip, growing in their gardens ; and though not
so luxuriant as in our more genial climate, yet
they add to the few vegetable luxuries which the
Icelanders can enjoy, and render the dulse a less
necessary article of diet.     The dulse in that island
is generally cooked; or, if eaten uncooked, it is
prepared for their meal by long drying in the sun.
Previously to this, it is usually washed thoroughly
from all remains of the sea-water ; and during the
process of drying, a fine white powder, of a
sweetish taste, accumulates upon it.       The plant is
then packed in casks, and preserved to be eaten
with fish and butter ; or it is cooked by boiling it
in milk, mixed with rye flour.             The Kams-
chatdales boil this sea- weed, and procure from it a
pleasant fermented drink.

It the celebrated Saccharine fucus of the Ice

stems.    Several species of Rhodomenia are found
on our coast, and one which          frequent on the

   The plant called the Pepper Dulse (Laurencia
pinnatifida)
           ,   isone of our most common sea- weeds,
its crowded tufts growing on the sides of the
rocks, and hanging to them very closely.       Several
fronds spring from the same base, varying in

138                SEA-WEEDS.
length from one to fourteen inches, but a common
specimen would about cover the hand.        Some
times they hang in crowded clusters in the manner
called by botanists imbricated, that   is,
                                        lying over
each other like the tiles of house. The branchlets
                          a
are all thickened and rounded at the end.   It    is   a
thicker and more juicy sea- weed while young than
most of the red kinds, often iridescent, and very
brittle. It in colour of yellowish or purplish
            is             a
red, being of so yellow  a   tint when growing in
places exposed to the sun, that one unaccustomed
to the marine plants, would probably place   it with
the olive series. There  is  also  avariety which  is
quite green, and one which    isyellow. This latter
varietyis common on the English coast, and grows
in dense erect tufts in shallow pools much exposed
to the light, while the plant in its usual form

                       SEA-WEEDS.                 139
prefers a shaded situation, nearer the ebb tide.
This is the sea-weed which was sold in Edinburgh
very generally with the dulse in former days. It
is still carried about for sale in Inverness as the
pepper dulse, and much relished in its raw state
by the Highlanders.       Lightfoot says that it was
formerly eaten as salad. Dr. Johnston observes of
this, that the custom is not likely to be revived,
both the taste and odour of the plant being dis
agreeable; to the English generally they are re
markably so, though the pungency in the young
plants is very slight.
   But turning from a sea-weed which is less
beautiful than useful, we must describe that most
lovely of all our British marine plants, the Red
Dock-leaved or Blood-coloured Fucus (Delesseria
sanguinea), a plant which may easily be recognised
by a familiar description. It is in its most beau
tiful state during the summer, and a very common
marine weed on most of our shores after rough
weather. It has a stem scarcely an inch long,
 dividing thence into two or three branches about
the thickness of a crow-quill, which bear a number
of clear shining pink leaves, each with a vein up
the middle, and about five or six inches long ; but
in fine specimens ten inches in length. This
plant is very lovely when waving its leaves about
in the water, and if well dried it scarcely loses any
of its beauty on paper. Like all the more delicate
 kinds of sea-weeds, it should be washed in fresh
 water, and then laid on paper, in a flat dish, in
 water about an inch deep. Care should be taken to
 dispose it in its natural form on the paper, with a
 needle or camel's-hair brush, and to remove any
 sand or other extraneous matter which may

140                     SEA-WEEDS.
adhere to it.      The paper should then be taken
gently from the dish, and held up that the water
may drain off. The sea-weed, on its paper, should
next be laid between two or three folds of linen
or blotting paper, and this plant, as well as the deli
cate red and green sea-weeds generally, will by
its glutinous nature, adhere to the paper, though
there are some which must be attached by means
of gum. The coarse olive sea- weeds need only to be
well washed in fresh water, and dried between
pieces of cloth or blotting paper.    If this Delesseria
is well pressed, it will lie so closely on the paper
that its elegant transparent wavy leaves resemble
a most beautiful painting.       Turner justly remarks
of this species, that in the elegance of its appearance,

                        SEA-WEEDS.                  141
and the exquisite colour of its most delicately
veined leaves, this fucus so much excels all its
congeners, that it carries away the palm with no
less justice from the vegetables of the ocean, than
the rose, the flower of the poets, from its rivals in
the garden.
    Equally common, or more so than this, is the
 Red Oak-leaved Fucus (Delesseria sinuosa), which
 often clings like some frail red flag around the
 stems of the tangle. It       is,like the last-named
 species,    tuft of transparent pink leaves, but its
margin  is a more deeply indented, in some specimens
 so much so as to have great resemblance in shape
to the leaf of our forest tree. It has, too, around
 its edges     number of small leaflets which suffi
               a
 ciently distinguish it.      It has always    a  much
 broader leaf than the blood-coloured fucus, and       is
 not nearly so brilliant in colour.
    Very frequent on our coasts, also, the Winged
                                          is
 Delesseria (Delesseria alata), which has      a  broad
 frond cut deeply into segments and veined like        a
 leaf. This species     transparent and rose-coloured
                       is
 or dark crimson while the Proliferous Delesseria
                   ;
  (Delesseria Hypoglossum), which    is not uncommon
 on rocks and on the larger sea-weeds, resembles       a
 mass of pale thin pink leaves, with smaller leaflets
 growing out of them. The frond or leaf        isat first
 entire, several growing from the same base. It     is   a
 beautiful, clear, rose-coloured sea- weed, but though
  not rareis  rather less frequent than either of the
  other species mentioned.
  A    very pretty common little marine plant, and
  one easy of description,    isthe opuntia-like Cate-
  nella (Catenella opuntia). Every one knows that

142                    SEA-WEEDS.
succulent plant called the prickly pear or opuntia,
which swells out into oval leaflets, contracting at
each end.     This is just the shape of our only
species of catenella, which is jointed so as to
remind one of a string of beads. It is to be found
on most of our rocky shores, growing in small
creeping tufts, densely matted and entangled,
scarcely an inch high, but the frond branched with
erect branches.     Its hue is not beautiful, as it is
of a dull purple, almost approaching in some indi
viduals to black, but it is somewhat transparent ;
it turns black in drying.
   Another sea-weed which soon darkens when
removed from its native waters, and becomes so
black as to resemble a dried plant of the olive-
coloured fuci, is that frequent plant the much
branched Forked Furcellaria (Furcellaria fasti-
giata), which grows on rocks in the sea, and is
scattered most profusely after a storm on the
shore.    It is of a pale pinkish purple, or purplish
brown colour, rather rigid, and becoming quite
crisp as it dries.    It is well termed forked, as it
branches off in a number of divisions, each like a
two-pronged fork.        During summer it is half
covered with a sand-coloured crust, which is in
fact a zoophyte, the crust being the home of many
minute polypes.
   Our tangle plants are often very interesting to
the marine botanist, on account of the number of
delicate sea-weeds which grow on them.            Some
grow only on their stems, and many which are
sometimes attached to other algae are often found
especially crowding on this.      This is the case with
that pretty, delicate, rose-coloured plant, the Dotted

                     SEA- WEEDS.                143
Nitophyllum (Nitophyllum punctatum), which is so
called from the little seed spots scattered over its
transparent frond. This plant is exceedingly thin
and clear, and when dried adheres well to the
paper.   It is not uncommon, though less frequent
than the Lacerated Nitophyllum (Nitophyllum
laceratum), which adheres so closely to the rocks
by its waved edges, that its delicate thin fronds
can scarcely ever be obtained in a perfect state.
It clings also to the fingers, so that the botanist
must manage it with skill, or he will tear it. The
margin of this species is sometimes delicately
fringed, and the plant is of a pinkish or brownish
red. Every plant indeed of the genus Nitophyl
lum, is remarkably fragile, even among our red
sea-weeds, and Dr. Greville named this group

 144                  SEA-WEEDS.
from two Greek words, signifying a bright or
shining leaf, as most of the species seem, when
 dried, as if varnished,
    It is in summer and autumn that we find the
greater number of our sea-weeds, but the Carra
geen moss hangs about our rocks, or grows in
handsome tufts on the tangle, very early in the
year; and there is no part of our shores where
rocks are to be found on which it is uncommon.
Often    when a walk     on the beach is scarcely
possible   because of the raging winds, and the

 waves now dash forward, and then with deeper
 sound, are drawn back again over the stones,
 awakening an emotion almost akin to awe as we
 listen to their wild music ; often will they at such
 times bring up the fresh tufts of this plant, con
 sisting of many fronds like that described by our
 engraving, all growing from one root.            This
 carrageen moss is a tough leathery sea-weed,
 generally of a purplish brown colour, often tinged
 with red, and having, when in fructification,
 roundish capsules imbedded in the frond, and
 forming on one side small hollows, and on the
 opposite surface corresponding prominences. The
 segments into which this frond is divided are often
 so twisted as to make the name of the sea-weed,
 the curled chondrus, very suitable, but it is com
 monly called Carrageen, or Irish moss, and is sold
 by the druggists under that name.        Plentiful as
 this plant is on our shores, and nutritious as are
 its qualities, it is to be regretted that it is not
 more generally used by the poor as food.         It is
 indeed often boiled into a jelly, and, made palatable
 by the addition of wine or lemon juice, is given to
 invalids and considered a good remedy for coughs
 and affections of the chest. But it is so gelatinous
 in its nature, that it serves admirably to thicken
 soup ; and a small portion of meat, accompanied
 by a good quantity of the carrageen moss, well
boiled, would furnish a wholesome meal to many
 a poor family, who, at the same expense, could
procure only a much less nourishing diet.          The
confectioner does not disdain to use it to thicken
his blanc-mange, as well as some other dishes. It
is also sometimes converted into size for the use of

146                  SEA-WEEDS.
the house-painter,   and    Dawson Turner availed
himself of its glutinous nature to form a glue by
which he pasted on paper such sea- weeds as would
not adhere to the papers on which he arranged
them.
   Dr. Greville calls this plant the Proteus of the
marine algee, for it varies so much according to
its situation and the measure of light which reaches
it, that the young botanist finds it almost im
possible to determine to which of the described
varieties an individual plant belongs. The width
of the frond is so different ; sometimes it is an inch
across its widest part, sometimes not a twelfth
part of that width. Then it divides itself into such
various shapes; sometimes the segments at the edges
being round, in others acute or jagged ; or forming
long slender points ; and if this sea- weed grows in
a spot where it is exposed to the influence of fresh
water, it alters so much, that an ordinary observer
of marine plants would think it belonged to a
different genus. Then its colour is variable. When
growing in a shady pool it is iridescent ; when it
has been lying in the sun it is bleached perfectly
white, while it may be seen in all the intermediate
tints between white and dark purple, often tinged
too with green.      Nor is it even constant in its
place of growth ; for on the very shore where in
one spring it lies in great profusion, it is not
unlikely that in the following year a few speci
mens only will be found.
   Another common species, which      is,equally with
this, termed Carrageen Moss, and which exactly
resembles  it  in its nature and properties,    is  the
 Chondrus mamillosus.      This grows on rocks and

                      SEA-WEEDS.                  147
stones in the sea, and is finest during the winter
months. It is generally of a lighter colour than
the former plant, and the segments of the frond
are not flat, but channelled.      The most obvious
distinction from the curled crispus, however, is
its producing on the surface of the broader seg
ments little capsules on short stalks, each about as
large as a turnip seed, which contain a mass of
 red seeds.    It is very variable in size and shape.
 It is of an East Indian species of this genus that
 the Chinese birds make those nests so much valued
 in the East, and which being sold at so high a
 price, are often procured at the hazard of life from
 some of the sea- caves.
    In the winter time, too, there is a common
  sea-weed   on the English shore, called the Red
  Phyllophora (Phyllophora rubens), with a fine but
                           L 2

 rather dull red tint, which is pale rose-coloured in
the young shoots. Its frond is wedge-shaped, with
 a midrib or vein sometimes plainly marked ; at
others not visible.    Towards the end of this frond
 arises one or more of the same shape, growing out
of it as it were, and then from that proceed others,
until the plant is sometimes five or six inches long.
 This is a very peculiar mode of growth ; and the
sea-weed can scarcely be mistaken if compared
with this description.
    There is a very lovely little sea- weed called the
 Feathery Ptilota (Ptilota plumosa), common on
our shores in summer and autumn, and found
more generally on the stem of the tangle than
elsewhere.    We shall only describe it as resem
bling a pink or dark purplish feather, having its
branches all feathered with little rays or pinnae,
seated opposite to each other on the main stem,
just like the red plume of a robin, only that it
is more flexible.     Dr. Greville remarks of this
          "
plant, — The finest specimens        I have ever seen
were communicated to me from the Orkney
Islands.    One of these, now lying before me, is a
foot in length, and completely covers a large folio
sheet of paper ; many of the long branches lying
over each other." When left to dry on the shore,
the plant turns of a violet-colour, then to brick-
red, and lastly, changes to green.
    That very abundant plant of our sea-side, the
Scarlet Dasya (Dasya coccinea), will be sufficiently
described by the engraving.       Its stems vary from
two to six .inches in height, and are rough, with
minute hair-like fibres, and generally of a deeper
red than the branches. It is of a dull pink colour
in the water, but on exposure to the sun becomes

of  a rich scarlet-crimson.    It is not common on
the Scottish shores.
   One of the more thick and substantial of our
red sea-weeds, and one which is so constant in its
general appearance as to be of easy recognition, is
the Esculent Iridaea (Iridtea edulis), which, as its
name imports, has often been used as a vegetable
for the table. It is too tough to be a good food if
eaten raw ; and indeed when cooked, is inferior to
the true dulse, though it is often called dulse in the
south-west of England.      It is there eaten by the
fishermen; and after having been pinched with
hot irons, it is said to have the flavour of roasted
oysters.   It is not one of the sea-weeds in which
the Scottish peasantry take much delight, yet it
                          L 3

1  50                  SEA-WEEDS.
is sometimes roasted by them in the frying-pan
and eaten.      Dr. Greville thinks that its reputa
tion as an article of food, has arisen from its
having been very generally mistaken for the true
dulse, the Rhodomenia palmata. It is indeed much
like that plant in colour, being of a deep blood-red,
which as it grows older, changes to green or dingy
white. It often becomes much darker in drying.
It is a fleshy thick leaf, without any veins, flat,
and the upper part somewhat egg-shaped, but
narrowing off into a slender stem at the base. It
 is seldom in a whole state when the waves dash it
 on the shore, but is often split to the very base
 into several pieces, for its succulence renders it
 less flexible than many sea-weeds, and less able to
 resist the force of the waves.     It is a favourite
 food too of the crabs and other living creatures of
 the deep, so that its edges are often bitten, and
 large holes made in its frond by the depredations
 which they have committed; and when full of
 water it bends by its own weight.
    This sea- weed grows on rocks in the sea, usually
 near low-water mark, and is one of our autumnal
 plants.     It is frequent on our southern coasts,
 and also on the western coast of Scotland, but is
 less general than the true dulse.    It is very pretty
 when young, as the fronds grow in tufts. When
 laid to macerate in water, it tinges the liquid with
 a fine purple tint; and an excellent lake colour
 has been procured from an infusion of the plant
 assisted by alum.
     That firm, almost horny, sea-weed, the Horny
  Gelidium (Gelidium corneum), of a dark red or
  even blackish-purple colour, is common on most
  rocky coasts of Great Britain and Ireland, growing

                     SEA-WEEDS.                 151
on rocks in the sea, usually at the margin of those
pools and hollows which are always filled with
water by each returning tide.      Equally common
too is the Red Ceramium (Ceramium rubrum),
with its pale pink fronds, with stems and branches
about as thick as coarse threads.      But we must
pass it by as difficult of description, and proceed
to another frequent plant of the genus, which will
be recognised by the accompanying illustration.
This is the Ciliated Ceramium (Ceramium cilia
                         L 4

152                   SEA-WEEDS.
turn), a plant common on our rocky shores, and
 often attached to corallines. It generally grows
 in tufts about two inches long, sometimes of bright
 red, but at others more purplish.       It is stiff and
 rigid, and has a singular structure. Most persons
 know those common plants of our moist lands,
the Equisetums or Horse-tails.       The rigid branch-
 lets of these weeds break off at intervals where
they are jointed ; and this sea-weed snaps in pieces
just in the same way at the joints ; and a circle of
small clear spines surrounds each joint, rendering
the plant very beautiful.
    A genus of our marine plants has been named
 Griffithsia, by Professor Agardh, in honour of
Mrs. Griffiths of Torquay, whose investigations on
British sea-weeds have contributed very largely
to all that is now known respecting them.            The
coralline-like Griffithsia (Griffithsia corallina), is
much like a coralline in its form, as the joints in
the main stem are swollen, so as to give them a
beaded appearance.       It is of a bright pink colour,
darker at the joints, and it stains the .paper red on
which it is placed.      This plant is common on the
southern shores of England, but becomes more
rare as we advance northward.            It is not so
general as the bristly species (Griffithsia setacea),
which is a rigid hard sea-weed of a rich crimson,
changing to a dull orange colour. If placed in
fresh water, this plant loses all its firmness, be
comes flaccid, and turns to a bright orange. This,
however, is not the only change which it under
goes.    When placed in fresh water for a few
                                    it,
seconds, and then taken from        it     gives out a
crackling    or crepitating noise, which Dr. Drum-
mond, who first discovered this peculiarity, de-

                        SEA- WEEDS.                 153
 scribes as like the sound caused by throwing fine
 salt into the fire. Besides this, when in fructifica
 tion, the plant projects minute globules of water,
 or some fluid, to the distance of several inches.
 This phenomenon may be seen several times in
the same specimen, by alternately putting it into
the liquid, and removing it ; but as might be ex
pected, the crackling noise is less audible the
oftener the experiment is repeated.          There are
now known thirty species of the Griffithsia; one
only belongs to tropical countries.         Some very
lovely kinds are found in the Mediterranean Sea
and Australia, and several in the waters of the
Cape of Good Hope and Western Africa.             They
are all, more or less, injured by being placed in
fresh water, or even exposed to air; and when
kept for a whole day in salt water, their colouring
matter will be ejected with violence.             Their
favourite haunts are the perpendicular sides of
pools, where they are well shaded by the long
frond of the notched olive-green fucus, or the
strap-shaped Himanthalia, which often wave above
these and a number of other beautiful and delicate
marine plants.     One very interesting fact is noticed
in one species, which grows on most of the rocky
shores of the Atlantic, from high northern lati
tudes down to the tropical regions. When viewed
beneath the microscope, its blackish purple tufts
display strings of small pear-like substances, most
beautifully and symmetrically disposed,            each
marked with a white cross, surrounded by a rich
red colour.      And so all nature has its hidden
wonders   —  its beauties revealed alone to the earnest
inquirer, as if to bid us search more deeply into
the works of God, and to come with humility

154                   SEA-WEEDS.
even to the lowliest weed of the rock, to ask a
lesson of his skill and care.
   The cause of the peculiar startings in the bristly
Griffithsia, are explained by Dr. Drummond.
The joints of the sea- weed are full of a coloured
fluid, and while in its natural condition, the
partitions between the joints remain perfect; but
no sooner does it come in contact with the fresh
water, than these partitions burst, and the con
tents of one joint is exploded into the next ; while
at the same time the colouring matter loses its
usual tint, and curdles into grains.      From the
force with which the fluids issue through the
partitions in the joints, the sides also of some of
them become rent, and then at every new starting
a quantity of colouring matter rushes from these
rents into the water. " The latter explosions,"
observes Dr. Drummond, "present under a com
mon magnifier, an extremely interesting appear
ance.    They are instantaneous; and when the
projected fluid has attained its extreme distance,
the colouring matter suddenly settles in a crowd
of dark grains, so as to give not an unlively idea
of a bomb-shell in the act of bursting. Sometimes
several of these occur in rapid succession, and
again half a minute or more intervenes between
them." It is most interesting to watch this pro
cess, which may be observed, in any fine specimen
of the plant, with the naked eye or with a com
mon magnifying glass. Dr. Drummond observed
a similar phenomenon in fresh specimens of the
Dotted Nitophyllum.
   Our engraving represents the coralline-like

weed of a bright pink colour, the swollen joints of

which are of so peculiar an appearance, that it
may be easily recognised.      It much resembles the
common corallines of our shore. We often find
this plant of a much paler colour, or sometimes
tinted with green hue, by exposure to the sun.
   Several of the large genus Polysiphonia, are
among the commonest plants of the sea-side. One
especially is known to every observer of marine
productions, by its frequency as a parasitic weed,
on the stems of the large knobbed fucus. This is
the Fastigiate species (Polysiphonia fastigiata),
which forms thick bushy tufts, of dark rigid hair-
like filaments, of a purplish-brown tint. In drying,
the plant becomes black, and gives this sea-weed

156                  SEA-WEEDS.
a remarkable    appearance.   Jn preserving speci
mens of the fucus, care should be taken to procure
one on which this parasite exists, as it is almost
peculiar to the knobbed fucus, and so frequent
as to seem almost to belong to it.
   There is very great beauty in some of these
Polysiphoneae, with their red or dark purple tufts
of filaments. They were named " many siphoned,"
in reference to the numerous little canals by
which the coloured matter is carried from one end
to the other of the plant; and this colouring
matter seems greatly affected by circumstances.
When growing, these plants are brown, but when
plunged in fresh water they become purple or
pink.   Several of the species are common, but all
too much alike to admit of popular description.
The Bushy Polysiphonia (Polysiphonia fucoides)
is a frequent plant on rocks, and on other sea
weeds. It is from four to six inches long. The
main stalk, which is about as thick as a coarse
thread, is very rigid and dark at the lower part,
and very bushy with numerous branches above.
The superior branches are of a dull reddish-brown,
and rather flaccid.   Dr. Johnston observes of this
species, that though subject to some variety, the
practical botanist recognises it by the dark dull
colour of its rigid stalk, its elongate flattened
form, and by the bushiness of its superior branches.
    Another plant of this genus, the Lobster-horn
species (Polysiphonia elongata], is a firm, though
slender sea-weed, with a main stem as thick as
twine, and branches which somewhat resemble
the horn of the shell-fish from whence it has its
name.     It is slightly marked with rings on its
 stem and branches.    It is very common on rocks,

                    SEA-WEEDS.                   157
and so also are several other species. One of
them, the dark Polysiphonia, sometimes covers
rocks by the sea-shore with dense patches, and
varies in height from a few inches even to two or
three feet.
   A very common production of our shores, the
strong- jointed Coralline (Corallina offidnalis), is
now placed, with the other species of the genus,

158                   SEA-WEEDS.
among the red series of sea-weeds. Our figure
represents this plant, which is covered with a cre
                           taceous   substance, so as
                           to look more like some of
                           our zoophytes, as the sea-
                           fans and other corals.     It
                           is only of late years that
                           this production has been
                           well understood to belong
                           to the vegetable kingdom.
                            Ellis ascertained, that like
                            the corals it effervesced if
                            vinegar was poured upon
                           it ; but the entire absence
                            of polypes, or of any indi
                            cation of animal life ; and
                            the fact of its yielding
                            sporules, contained in re
                            ceptacles like those of the
                            red sea-weeds, mark its
                            vegetable nature. We find
 it sometimes covering the base or sides of rocky
 pools with its pale lilac, or pink, or ash-coloured
 sprays ; or its tufts are blown about by the winds
 on the shore till they lodge themselves in some
 nook, and then bleach to an ivory whiteness.          If
 the plant is immersed in fresh water, it imme
 diately becomes of a pink or bright orange-colour.
 There are several other species of the jointed
 corallines on our shores, but they are at present
 imperfectly defined, and the one here named is the
 most general.
     Many of our rocks are quite green with some
  of the Confervas tribe, which grow on them in such
  profusion as to render them so slippery that we

                     SEA- WEEDS.                159
fear to set our foot on their surface.  Everywhere
we find stones by the sea, as well as the stems of
other algae, clothed with the long filaments of the
green rock conferva, sometimes called the Arctic
Conferva (Conferva rupestris), and with the paler
green   species  (Conferva latevirens), with bushy
tufts of a fine yellowish green colour, which, as
they dry, become of a grey green, and are without
any gloss. During a greater part of the year these
plants are found in great abundance.     The writer
once heard a friend playfully describe some stones
which were covered with them, as the " green-
haired rocks," and their fibres might well be com
pared to tufts of hair, for multitude.    When we
gather a tuft, these fibres all hang drooping toge
ther, but a very small portion is sufficient for a
dried specimen ; as, when carefully preserved, the
slender threads of a small tuft may be easily laid
out so as to cover a large piece of paper like a

160                  SEA-WEEDS.
miniature green tree. They will not, however,
usually adhere to paper without the aid of gum.
   These plants belong to the group of grass-green
sea- weeds, the chlorosperms of the marine botanist.
They are found on the shore near high-water
mark, and in the shallow pools into which the
rising tide daily pours its liquid nutriment.     They
are the sea-weeds which have the simplest struc
ture, and are the least varied in species on various
shores ; and they form the chief marine vegetation
of the polar seas. Some of the green sea-weeds
are known to all who have observed the marine
plants on our rocky shores.
   The Ulvae, or Lavers, are flat green leaves, very
transparent, and easily torn, and when laid on
paper are scarcely thicker than gold-beater's skin.
The broad green Laver (Ulva latissima), is of a
bright, herbaceous tint, becoming tinged with
brown as it decays. It has a broad, ovate, plaited,
glossy leaf, and as it waves up and down in the
water is extremely elegant.         It is sometimes
called green sloke, green laver, or oyster green.
Gerarde tells us whence it received its latter
name ; he says : " It is very well known even to
the poore oister women, who carry oisters to sell
up and down, who are greatly desirous of the said
mosse for the decking and beautifying of their
oisters to make them sell the better."           These
leaves keep their green tint so well, that they
would indeed be highly ornamental to a fish-
basket, only that their thin texture prevents their
retaining the leaflike form.
   This laver is often brought to table as a stewed
sea-weed.    Sir J. E. Smith remarks of      it,  that
within a  few years past  it   has been  " introduced

                     SEA-WEEDS.                   161
to fashionable tables, being stewed and seasoned
with lemon-juice, which lessens its saltish flavour
and sea- weed scent; nor is this dish unpleasant,
after a short trial, to most palates.    We suspect
it to have been originally contrived with a medical
intention, for the benefit of scrofulous patients:
how numerous, alas ! in the gay circles of the
opulent and great."       This plant is not, however,
the true laver.
    Tender and delicate as is the frond of the broad
green laver, the species termed the Lettuce Laver
 (Ulva lactuca) is still more so. This is a smaller
plant, and a less common one, though found on
rocks, stones, and corallines, during May and
 June, on many parts of our coast.        It is rarely
 six inches long, while the former species varies
from that length even to eighteen inches.         It is
 also lacerated, more or less, and at length irregu
larly cleft down to the base, and the jagged and
 cut appearance which it presents, somewhat similar
to endive, originated its name of lettuce laver,
 though the broad green laver is really more like
 a lettuce leaf.  None of the Ulvae are more beau
 tiful when displayed on paper than this species.
     The species called ribbon-green Laver (Ulva
 Lima) has a long narrow frond like a slender
 leaf, about an inch, or an inch and a half in width,
 which is beautifully curled and waved.         It be
 comes paler as it grows older, unless growing on
 a spot well shaded from sunshine ; but the dried
 specimen long retains its grass-like tint.
     Of the same clear green colour as the Ulvae,
 are the Enteromorphae, some of which, with their
  long slender grass-green leaves, wave about like
  so many shreds of bright ribbons, filling the clear

162                    SEA- WEEDS.
pools, or hanging, with thousands of fronds, over
the smooth rocks. One very common kind is the
compressed Enteromorpha         (Enteromorpha com-
pressa), and it abounds on the shores of almost
every land from the Arctic to the Antarctic
Ocean.    Useless as it is to us, except as its beauty
may give us pleasant thoughts as we pause to look
upon  it,yet it    a valuable article of food to the
                  is
poor natives of the Sandwich Isles, whose rugged
rocks  it covers with    a verdant vegetation.    Its
fronds are from six to twelve inches long, from
the fineness of   a hair, to half an inch in width.
At first, the fronds seem but threads, but as        it
grows in deeper water they grow long and broad,
and when the plant      isfully grown, the frond      is
divided nearly to the root into many long branches,
which produce others, all narrow at the base, and
widened at the extremities. They are tubular,
though more or less compressed.
                         The intestine-like Entero
                      morpha (Enteromorpha intes-
                      tinalis)     equally common,
                                  is
                      not only on our sea-shores,
                      but in brackish and fresh
                      water ditches, and in summer
                      time its fronds are often two
                      feet or more long, and some
                      times two or three inches in
                      diameter.    It tubular also,
                                       is
                      and inflated, and often waved
                        and wrinkled, and    is  of thin
                        texture and pale yellow-green
                        colour, fading at last to white,
                       though when very young its
                       tint  bright as the meadow
                             is

grass.      This species is not branched, and may, by
this circumstance, be distinguished from the com
pressed kind.
   These are some of the beautiful grassy weeds,
which render a walk by the sea at low tide so
interesting to all who observe Nature, not alone
in its vast magnificence of sea and sky, but in
minute details, its rocky fringes of sea-plants, or
its delicate glass-like shells, handfuls of which
come up when we put our hands into the salt
water pools.          On a calm summer evening it is
delightful to linger among the smooth boulders, or
rugged rocks, looking now at the minute beauties
of the water, and then at their wide expanse,
bounded by the rich horizon of a glowing sunset.
Calder Campbell has well described such a scene : —
      " The tide is out, and every wave that breaks
        Bids a brief farewell to the shelving shore ;
        Leaving pink weeds, white shells, and dripping ooze,

it seems,  as  it  waves hither and thither in the
waters, or when we gather it thence, as it clings
around our fingers as if their smallest movement
would rend it. Nor is it less beautiful when care
fully preserved on paper ; it often becomes of the
most delicate amethyst tint, rivalling the pride of
the marine botanist, the red Delesseria, in rich
ness of hue.      Any one may recognise this plant
by a familiar description; and from spring to
autumn it is a common sea-weed of most of our
rocky shores.      Its thin leaves grow together in
numbers; they are from three to eight inches
long, very narrow just at the base, but widening
immediately, and deeply and irregularly cut and
waved, besides being very often torn into holes by
coming in contact with some rough object, or by
being eaten by shell-fish.       The smooth glossy
plants of this genus received their name from the
Greek term for a purple colour, and all the species
are, more or less, of this tint when in a perfect
state, though when old they become tinged with
green, and when very young they are sometimes
of an olive hue, but still of the same transparent
substance.
   A very useful plant is this purple laver, good
enough in flavour to be esteemed by the epicure
a delicious dish, and valued often by the poor as
a vegetable delicacy.     It is more eaten in Scot
land than in England, and on the coasts of the
Western Islands, where it is abundant, large
quantities are gathered for food. The Highlanders
call it sloke kale, and also by the appropriate
name of purple-green.       They pound it and stew
it in water into a kind of marine sauce ; it is after
wards made into a dish with pepper, or with vine

                      SEA-WEEDS.                 165
gar and butter, or it is eaten stewed with onions.
In England it is usually pickled with salt in jars,
and when prepared for the table is stewed, and oil
and lemon-juice added to it.          Sometimes this
pretty sea-weed is washed up by the waves cling
ing round the stems of other algae ; and at other
times it hangs about the piles of wood which sup
port our piers.
    The Common Porphyra (Porphyra vulgaris) is
not so general a sea-weed on all the shores of our
sea-girt isle, but is very abundant on Scottish
coasts.   It is a large plant, its fronds being com
monly one or two feet in length, and two or three
inches wide ; and Dr. Greville mentions having
seen one plant which measured no less than three
feet and a half.     The margin is much less waved
than in the former kind, so that the frond seems
almost flat, and the colour is more brilliant, being,
when dried, of a rich purple. It is very thin, but
not nearly so easily torn as the purple laver.     A
very slender species of this genus, too, covers
some few rocks on our shores. This is the narrow
Porphyra (Porphyra linearis), which, though not a
quarter of an inch wide, and usually but three or
four inches long, is of a beautiful tint.         Dr.
Greville remarks of it, that it is a singularly neat
little plant, invariably constant in its form, and
adds, that covering the rocks beneath Peakhead,
near Sidmouth, in great abundance, it rendered
 them purple by its delicate fronds.
    The Ulvae, as well as the different species of
 Enteromorpha, and of Porphyra, are found on the
 shores of every land save those bound up in the
 regions of perpetual ice and snow.         They give
 their green fringes to the rocky shores of the

Arctic Seas, and make many a little emerald
island in the midst of the waters of tropical climes.
One singular species of laver (Ulva thermalis),
flourishes in the hot-springs of Gastein, where the
water is at the temperature of 117° of Fahrenheit;
while the thin gelatinous leaf of the Crisp Ulva
( Ulva crispa), growing in our land on moist ground,
and covering the old thatched roof of the cottage
with its wrinkled frond, was the last land plant
gathered during the Antarctic Expedition, at
Cockburn Island, 64° south lat., beyond which
the land seems destitute of even the slightest
vegetation.
   There are large genera of the Chlorosperms
which must be left unnoticed here ; and although
several contain common sea-weeds, yet they are
not so likely to be observed by the rambler on the
shores who may not have studied marine plants,
nor are they easily described in familiar language.
One beautiful and elegant green sea-weed, how
ever, the ornament of our rocky pools, must not
be omitted.     That graceful little plant, so like a
bunch of soft green feathers, is the feathery Bry-
opsis (Briopsis plumosa) ; nor is it an unfrequent
ornament of our sea-rocks and stones. It is usually
two or three inches in length, with a thread-like
stem, and generally without branches at the lower
part. The branches then spread off, and are set
with one or two series of the little feathers.    The
young plants, especially, resemble them. The
plant is of a bright green, very tender and deli
cate, and when laid out on paper, to which it
adheres very closely, it looks as if it had been
covered with varnish, and the stalks become clear
and colourless in drying.     Its root consists of a

                    SEA-WEEDS.                 167
few threads, and its whole appearance well accords
with the generic name, which is derived from two
Greek words, expressive of the resemblance of the
plants to some species of feather moss. Dr.
Greville names a beautiful exotic species, the
Bryopsts rosea, which he says is the loveliest
plant of the genus, and which is twelve inches
long, and was compared by Bory de St. Vincent
to an Italian poplar in minature. It is a native
of the Falkland Islands.

        SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS                 ANIMALS.
    " Even as the rainbow-tinted shell which lies
      Miles deep at bottom of the sea, hath all
      Colours of skies, and flowers, and gems, and plumes."
IT is   an    interestingquestion, and one which
yet is not fully answered, how far living creatures
can exist below the surface of the deep.        The
wondrous architects of the coral reef cease to live
at 100 feet below that surface, and so vast a
number of shell-fish and crustaceous animals, of
corallines and other zoophytes, dwell within a few
yards of     it,
              that the statement seems probable,
that below the depth of      few hundred feet life
                                a
ceases in the ocean, from the want of air and light,
and from the pressure of the waters.
   Yet the words of the poet are true enough.
Miles deep at bottom of the sea, must lie the
structures of myriads of once living animals and         ;
shells of graceful form and glowing colours add to
the constantly accumulating substance at the base
of the ocean. Many are strewed upon our sandy
shores, and so beautiful are they, that we wish, in
our summer rambles, that the waves would bring
them up to us in greater numbers, or that we
could look down on clear day into those recesses
                        a
where
                        " Buoyant   shells,

    We   gather     up those which we find, and
 looking at their structure would fain know some
 thing of the inmate of such a dwelling. All
 nature proclaims the goodness of God. We hear
 that the bird which wings its way over our heads
 has a song of joy ; the bee hums delightedly by
 us ; and the little shrimp which darts in the clear
 pool, seems full of merriment.       Was the inmate
 of the shell less cared for by its Maker ? No doubt
the little builder had some sense of joy, as he
framed from his own substance the house which
excites our admiration.       Doubtless his existence,
 short and sluggish as it was, had its own con
sciousness of pleasure ; and obscure as is his history,
and little calculated as such a creature might seem
to perform an important part in the economy of
creation, yet we know that he had a work to do,
not only for the living creatures of the sea, but
for the well-being of man himself.
   Those living mollusks which glide along in such
multitudes in the waters, are among the appointed
messengers of death to the smaller animals, whose
numbers would else exceed their destined limits ;
they, like other inhabitants of sea and earth, are
the equalisers of life and death.       In their turn
they serve as food for the rich man, and are often
the only meal of the peasant, or of the savage.
The land bird stays his song, as he descends to
pick up the limpit from the rock; and the sea
bird, white as the foam over which he skims, dips
among the shell fish for his food ; while to fishes
they furnish the daily meal. Thus much is evident
to any observing person ; but science has revealed
to us other important uses of shells.     Those shells
are made of carbonate of lime, which, by some

mysterious process, the mollusk derived from the
materials forming his food : materials which in
themselves possess scarcely any portion of this
substance, and yet which, when mingled with
animal matter, serve to compose the calcareous
habitation : and those towering chalk cliffs on which
the short grass is now growing, or that long stra
tum of limestone, extending for miles away, is
formed almost entirely of shells mingled with the
skeletons of zoophytes and sea urchins, and other
marine animals. The block of marble, hard as it
seems, reveals, by the aid of a microscope, masses
of shells, some of them perfect and unbroken, and
rivalling in symmetry the loveliest shell in the
cabinet of the collectors : while the myriads of
 shells lying in crushed heaps among the mountains,
 are hourly undergoing those processes by which
they shall, after the lapse of ages, form the com
ponent parts of the gem to deck the coronal of
 princes, or the marble statue to be reared to the
memory of worth or genius.        Fossil shells were
 elegantly termed by Bergman the "Medals of
 Creation." The geologist reads in the masses of
 species of shells now extinct, histories of by-gone
 times and of earth's changes ; and distinctly
 deciphers traces of revolutions, of which, but for
 their aid, we should know nothing. Fossil shells
 are among the most valuable records of the earth
 on which we live.
    Though the study of the shells of land or sea is
 important to science, yet Conchology is much less
 popular than most of the other departments of
 Natural History. It may be that it is owing to
 the costliness of the pursuit.   Foreign shells are
 expensive, and even a good collection of native

           SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS     ANIMALS.     171
  shells is not to be procured without considerable
 trouble, as there are many parts of the coast on
 which few marine shells can be gathered.        They
 are not like the wild-flowers, which grace every
 way-side ; or the song-birds of the woodlands ; or
 the insects of our summer pools; and comparatively
 few are among the common things of earth.        But
 perhaps the study of conchology has been in
 former times rendered uninteresting by the neglect
 of the animal inhabiting the shell. The collector
 had long prided himself on the beauty of the rare
 shells brought from distant seas, or on some well
 arranged cabinet of native species. He could des
 cant on their rarity and beauty of form and tell
 their names and classification ; but he had nothing
 to relate of the animal within.    Until the labours
 of recent naturalists, scarcely anything was known
respecting the structure or habits of the shell-fish ;
 and even yet, the details which can be given of
them are very few, not only from the difficulty of
making observations, but from their having less
activity and fewer modes of life than most living
creatures with which we are familiar.        Nor are
they so easy of description as are most other
natural objects ; and the terms of science, often
unpleasing and perplexing to all but the student,
are almost necessary here, if we would convey
a good idea in writing, either of the animal or its
dwelling-place.     And yet those who do examine
the contents of the shell find matter of deep
interest, and now that many are engaged in this
pursuit, and monographs with beautifully coloured
plates are publishing on different tribes of the
molluscous animals, we shall gradually learn more
of their nature and history.

    Most of the common shell-fish are of a greyish
or brownish white, or of a straw colour, sometimes
clouded with dark spots.       Yet some of them ex
hibit great beauty of tint, in which every shade of
red, and orange, and yellow, and blue, may be seen.
A writer in   London's Magazine of Natural History
says of our native Cowry (Cyprtea europaa), that
it is a most beautiful creature, viewed from beneath,
with colours unrivalled among the order to which
it belongs. " The proboscis is dark vermilion ;
the tentacles yellowish red, spotted with yellow;
the upper part of the foot streaked longitudinally
with yellow and brown, and the mantle greenish
brown, edged with brownish red ; but notwith
standing, the shell is of a dull uniform white."
    This writer tells us too of other shell-fish, which
have fins or lateral expansions elegantly speckled
with bright yellow, and the fleshy parts of the
body marked with pink colour : while another is
dotted over with milk-white spots, and others are
 mottled with black and white.         Then the part
 called the foot of the mollusk is in some tropical
 species of blackish red ; in some, green ; in others
 black ; in some deep red, with faint designs resem
bling those of the shell ; and in others it is bright
yellow and deep brown.           The inmate of the
beautifully marbled harp shell, he says,
                                                " glories
in a rich vermilion-red skin. "       This writer also
 quotes a passage from a paper of Broderip in the
 Zoological Journal.      "In the Mauritius," writes
 this gentleman,   " it is the amusement of the place
 to watch over the trim apparatus of lines, hung
 over some sand-bank to tempt the various species
 of Oliva which there abound, or to wait for the
 more rare approach of the

rich hues of its inhabitant are seen glowing through
the clear blue water in the rays of a tropical rising
sun." Nor is the colour of these animals all that
is remarkable.      They have a beautiful and won
derful mechanism, offering continually objects of
interest, from the delicate net-work, or gills rayed
like flowers, which in some species serve the pur
pose of lungs, and the strong fleshy foot by which
the cockle leaps up, to the tongue of the limpet,
which is two or three inches long, and armed with
hooked teeth, that serve as a rasp in fitting its
food for nutriment.
    The large class of Mollusca comprises not only
those animals which live in shells, but a great
number of similarly constituted animals, which are
destitute of this external covering. Their name,
given by Cuvier, and derived from the Latin
word mollis, soft, expresses the nature of their
substance, and the oyster and snail are familiar
examples of these soft fleshy creatures.     Differing
greatly in different tribes, yet they have some
marked resemblances common to all. They have
no internal skeleton, are all of a fleshy consistence,
have no legs; and though their fins are often
 spoken of, yet these are mere expansions of a
portion of their skin, and not separate appendages,
though by their means the mollusks glide through
the waters.      The greater number among them
 have shells, either consisting of one piece or valve,
 like the periwinkle ; or of two valves, like the
 oyster; or of more valves, as in the barnacle.
 When composed of two valves, the shell opens by
 means of a strong elastic hinge, and is closed, at
 the will of the animal, by means of muscles which
 pass from one valve to another.         They usually

174     SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS ANIMALS.
present a development of skin, which, covering
the body more or less, like a mantle, has received
that name from naturalists.    This mantle in the
greater number secretes those beautiful shells,
whose variety of form and tint is so pleasing to
us ; while in other groups we have only the naked
 animal.
    A large number of the mollusca seem destined
to remain near the spot on which they first entered
into life, and clinging to the rocks, are fed by the
 draughts of sea-water which convey to them
thousands of minute animals. There are, however,
 among the bivalved groups, many which have an
instrument of movement admirably adapted to
their uses.    Naturalists call this part a foot, and
 in the cockle and some others, this fleshy lump is
 shaped something like a human leg and foot ; but
in most it is an unsymmetrical mass of flesh. Its
muscular structure   is,  however, very powerful, for
it consists ofa  number of fibres, so interwoven as
to confer the power of movement in every direc
tion.    Thus some bivalved mollusks half open
their shells, and raising themselves upon them,
urge themselves along in successive movements,
by means of this foot, leaving  a   long tract in the
sand or mud which they have passed over.       Some,
like the cockle, are enabled by this foot to leap to
a  great height; while others, again, will by its
means delve deep down into the sands.          Some,
as the scallop, swim along in the water with most
wonderful quickness, opening and flapping the
valves together as they go; while on the shore
they can move onwards or backwards, by using
the valves of their shell in
                           a   similar manner.
   The mouths of the shell-fish are formed accord-

ing to their conditions  ; thus, those which live on
sea-weeds have horny jaws, or minute teeth ; and
those which, like the whelk, feed on flesh, have
generally a long pliable tube, armed with teeth,
by which they pierce the shells of their neigh
bours, and draw out their juices ; while such as
are destined to be fed only by the minute living
things of the water, are destitute of these organs,
and have mouths formed only of a little aperture.
   Shells are of two kinds, porcelanous and mem
branous. Some are, like the cowries, which are
brought from far distant seas to ornament our
rooms, of a compact texture, resembling porcelain,
and the surface is beautifully enamelled and va
riously tinted. The membranous shells, like that
of the oyster, are formed of layers, composed of
mother-of-pearl, and are often covered with a
strong epidermis, or skin. All shells consist of
carbonate of lime, mingled with animal gelatine,
but the porcelanous kinds contain a far less pro
portion of animal matter than exists in the mem
branous shells. If the carbonate of lime contained
in the last-named shells be subjected to acid, it
will dissolve, and leave nothing but the thin mem
brane from which they take their name ; while the
more brittle porcelanous shell has its substances
more equally blended in a crystalline arrange
ment.
   Beginning at the lowest orders of molluscous
animals, and gradually rising to the highest, we
must select some of the common objects on our
shores belonging to the class Cirrhopoda of the
naturalist, the barnacles,      which every sailor
knows by their familiar name, and upon which
most of us have often looked. The commonest

 176     SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS      ANIMALS.
kinds are the acorn-shells, or Balani, which we see
 on all parts of the sea-shore, or on the shores of
salt rivers, looking like shelly cones with the tops
cut off, crowding over the shells of mussels, whelks,
oysters, or on pieces of wood, and more or less im
bedded in the substance to which they attach
themselves.     These cones are formed of hard
shelly pieces, most neatly and compactly fitted
together, and becoming larger as the animal grows
older and adds to their size by periodical addi
tions. A thin plate connects the cone with the
substance to which it adheres, and at the summit
is a small lid, which the animal can open or close
as it pleases, when it needs to put out its arms in
search of prey, or to withdraw them within the
shell. Rocks near the sea are sometimes covered
with these sea-acorns, and on pieces of wood drifted
on shore they are clustered by thousands.        The
edges of the shells are very sharp, as those know
well who have ever bathed in the floating-baths
lying in salt rivers, when it is necessary some
times to go into the water with shoes and stock
ings, to escape the wounds on the feet which are
inflicted by them. So quickly do they encrust the
wood- work of these places, that it needs great care
and diligence in those who attend to them to keep
the sides and floor of the bath clear of them.
The balani are called sessile barnacles, to distin
guish them from the stalked barnacles, and there
are several species of the genus. Some kinds even
lodge in the coats of the whale, deeply imbedding
themselves in the defenceless fish ; and others fix
themselves on corals or sponges.      We often see
very large foreign shells of the sea-acorn in mu
seums, and these have been the homes of animals

large enough to serve as food for man.        The
ancients regarded them as forming a dish for an
epicure; and in the present day one species is
cooked and eaten by the Chinese, and said to
resemble the lobster in flavour.
   Sometimes when wandering along the shore, or
stooping among the rocks to pick up the treasures
which the naturalist finds hidden there, we alight
upon some stray piece of drift-wood.    It may be
but a part of a tree borne down long ago by a
river to the spot, or it may be a piece of wood
stranded from some wreck, awakening thoughts of
pity as we look upon      it,
                         reminding us of
            " Shipwrecks and their spoils,
      The wealth of merchants, the artillery
      Of war, the chains of captives, and the gems
      That glow'd upon the brow of beauty crowns

 are crowded on     a piece of wood but     few feet   a
 long, all twisting about, and presenting    moving    a
 mass of life, almost disgusting    to any but the
 accustomed eye of the naturalist, who knows that
 among this mass he may find curious shells, coral
 lines, and other objects which are not scattered on
 the shore. The growth of these animals must be
 very rapid, as the keel of    ship which has made

When ships thus covered arrive in our ports, the
barnacles are eagerly scraped off by men who take
them for sale as marine curiosities, or who make
their delicate white porcelain-like shells into some
kinds of fancy shell-work.     The barnacles them
selves are eaten on some of the coasts of Africa,
where they are very abundant.      The shell of this
animal is at the end of a fleshy stalk, generally of
a purplish red, sometimes of a bright orange colour,
and is of the form called multivalve, being com
posed of five pieces of valves, two of them on each
side of the animal, and a narrow piece down the

         SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS       ANIMALS.     179
back.    It is a pretty shell, clear and brittle, of a
white colour, tinged with pale blue. The food of
the barnacle consists of small crustaceous or mol
luscous animals ; and at times, when it is actively
engaged in catching its prey, we may see pro
truding from its shell, its six pairs of arms, many-
jointed and delicately fringed.       They are most
vigorous animals, and of so sensitive a touch that
they can lay hold of the minutest object, and,
entangling it in their feather-like arms, they can
draw it to the mouth, seize, and devour it.
    Very curious transformations occur in the con
dition of the barnacle tribe during their brief lives.
 Seeing them as we do, fastened to the timber or
the rock, or encrusting the oyster-shell, shut up in
their little dwellings, and without any eyes, one
would not imagine that they were, at an earlier
 stage of their existence, endowed with active facul
ties.   When first emerging from the egg these
 animals have a large pair of limbs, provided with
 hooks, which they are not slow to use when they
 choose to fasten themselves to any objects ; then
they have six pairs of swimming limbs and a jointed
tail, the limbs acting like oars, and the tail also
serving them as a means of motion, so that
they are among the most active creatures of
the sea. Their bodies, too, are at this period of
their history covered with a shell of the na
ture of that of the crab, and they have large
eyes set on stalks.      In the course of time the
limbs become changed into the fringed arms, and
 the shelly crust becomes a regularly valved shell ;
 the stalk in some of the species developes itself, or
the cone arises from the wood, or shell, or rocky
 base.    The whole animal is so different when
                           N 2

young, as that it would readily be supposed to
belong to the crustaceous tribe ; but that excellent
naturalist, Mr. J. V. Thompson, watched one of
these animals through all the wondrous changes of
its existence, and clearly ascertained and described
them.
   When we see how common an object the duck
barnacle  is,  we wonder how, age after age, the
strange story came to be generally believed, that
this shell-fish was the young of species of goose,
                                  a
and that as     increased in size the goose gradually
               it
developed itself.    Nor was this the notion only of
the unthinking, unobserving portion of mankind.
 Scientific men of former ages beUeved it. The
Doctors of the Sorbonne in Paris declared that the
geese were not to be considered as birds, but that
having their origin in the sea, they might be eaten
as fish on the fast-days.    Old writers, not content
with graphic descriptions of the animal, have left
engravings representing barnacle-goose trees, on
the branches of which hang the young half-formed
ducklings, suspended by the bill, while the full-
grown ducks are quietly swimming beneath the
shadow of the boughs whence they have fallen.
But those were days when,    if   men believed not as
the ancients did, that the dew-drops which glis
tened on the grass were shed by the stars, yet
they thought that they fell from the clouds, and
had wondrous virtues when gathered at early
morning; and time, and study, and patient thought
have been needed to bring us to our present state
of knowledge of Natural History, incomplete and
imperfect as     yet is. Gerarde, to whose memory
                it
all praiseis  due for the skill and intelligence of his
great work, the "Historic of Plants," closes that

          SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS              ANIMALS.        181
valuable book with his own account of the bar
nacle-goose.       He describes certain trees found in
the north of Scotland and the adjacent islands, on
which grew these geese in shells, "which shells,"
says our naturalist, "in time of maturitie, doe
open, and out of them grow those little living
things, which, falling into the water doe become
fowles, whom we call Barnakles : in the north of
England, Brant-geese; and in Lancashire, Tree-
geese; but the others that doe fall upon land,
perish and come to nothing." This he asserts on
the testimony of others, and he then proceeds
gravely to declare, as he says, "what our eies have
seen and our hands have touched ;" and describing
the degrees of progress by which the fish is trans
formed into the bird, he tells us, " that as the shells
gape the legs hang out, that the bird growing bigger
the shells open more and more, till, at length, it is
attached only by the bill, soon after which it drops
into the sea." "There," he adds, "it acquires
feathers and grows to a fowle."               At what objects
beneath the skies our worthy naturalist could have
been looking when he fancied all this, it is difficult
to tell ; but it is strange to see how an earnest, and
truthful, and intelligent man may have even his
senses beguiled by the prejudices or prepossessions
cherished from childhood. The poets followed in
the train of the philosophers, and Du Bartas thus
adverts to the common notion, and also to the
fancy that the barnacle-goose sprung from a
 fungus : —
        " So slow Bootes underneath him sees
          In the icy islands goslings hatch'd of trees,
          Whose fruitful leaves, falling into the water,
          Are turn'd, as known, to living fowls soon after ;

         So rotten planks of broken ships do change
        To  barnacles.   0 transformation strange !
        'Twas first a green tree, then a broken hull,
        Lately a mushroom, now a flying gull."
 Gerarde's picture is very amusing, as the young
geese are represented as having their heads out of
the shells, which are hanging on the branches, and
 seem as if calling to their companions gliding be
neath them. Our great naturalist, Ray, however,
whose work was published in 1678, opposed the
popular notion, and a writer has ridiculed it a cen
tury earlier.
   But leaving the barnacle tribe, we turn to some
equally common molluscous animals which have no
shells, but have a cartilaginous, flexible tunic, or
outer coat. They are on this account called tuni-
cated mollusks.        Often in our rambles along the
shore we pick up one of those strange looking
things, commonly called sea-squirts                   (Ascidias),
which have been thrown up from the sea by storms,
or which sometimes seem growing on the stones,
or large dark sea- weeds which lie among the rocks.
If  we press them ever so gently, we are imme
diately saluted by a jet of water. These animals
consist of a shapeless sort of bag, sometimes of a
pale brown colour, though often marked with
beautiful and bright tints, and they have so little
the appearance of animals, that we should at first
hardly recognise them as living things, were it not
for their habit of ejecting the liquid.            This water
issues from two openings in the rough skin. They
feed on the contents of the water, which are brought
to the mouth by the current. As yet the habits
of these Ascidiae are little understood ; but it has
been ascertained, that while in an earlier stage of

        SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS        ANIMALS.           183
life, the animal is not the helpless creature which
we find hanging to the sea-weed. When young it
somewhat resembles the tadpole of the frog, though
it is extremely minute, and it swims actively in
the water, by quickly moving its tail. When in
clined to fix itself to the rocks, a few fibres spring
 from it,  which form   a  holdfast, and it  then gra
 dually changes into the condition in which    it meets
 our eye on the beach.      Some of these Ascidians
are valued in China as articles of food, and are
 probably relished by a people who seem to have           a
 singular taste in articles of diet, though their ap
 pearance   isnot such as would recommend them as
 fit for the table. In their internal structure, they
 much resemble the mollusks which form bivalve
 shells, the flexible tunic, or case, being analogous
 to the shell.
     There  is one group of Ascidiae, which, unlike
 the sea-squirts, are not single individuals, but
 consist of number of aggregated beings, forming
            a
 one living mass, in some measure resembling the
 zoophytes, though they do not secrete either             a
 stony or horny framework. Some of the commoner
 kinds may be found on our shores in plenty and     ;
  many of the tribe Botryllidae form      a   jelly-like
  crust on some of our olive-green sea-weeds, or
  other marine substances, almost covering the stems
  of the marine plant, and presenting a beautiful
  array of starry objects, of the most delicate blue
  tints, or rich in every variety of red or purple,
  or of all the bright hues of the glowing sunset.
  These star-like objects on the surface of the jelly,
  contain about ten or twelve individual creatures,
  whose structure  is  found to resemble that of the
  sea-squirt, and the jelly-like substance     common

 to them all.     Our figure represents the starry
 botryllus (Botryllus stellaris), of its natural size, and
 a magnified single group.       Other families of the
 Ascidiae move through the waters, linked in chains,
giving out their lights in the darkness; and to
this tribe belongs the wondrous Pyrosoma, whose
greenish phosphorescent light gleams at night from
its living shoals, upwards of a mile in breadth, and
as the vessel dashes among them, illumines the sea
with gleams of light.
   Interesting and wonderful       as are some     of the
shell-less mollusks, yet the forms which are found
in greatest number and variety are enclosed in
their beautiful ornamental coverings. The bivalve
mollusca compose the class termed Conchifera.
Our shores are strewed with multitudes of the
common kinds; our limestone rocks and chalky
cliffs are full of the double valves of animals of
past ages.    The dredge brings up many of those,
which we know must be lying in countless myriads
in the deep sea. Gaze into the rocky pools among
the crags, and we see them among the thousands
of living creatures revelling there ; and, perhaps,
no spot exhibits in so small a space so many
individual and varied forms of life. The large
sea-weeds have, tangling about their fibres, or

He observes, that      a  great volume might be
written, describing the inhabitants of bed of this
                                          a
marine plant. "Almost all the leaves, excepting
those that float upon the surface, are so thickly in-
crusted with corrallines as to be of white colour.
                                      a
We find exquisitely delicate structures, some inha
bited by simple hydra-like polypi, others by more
organized kinds, and beautiful compound Ascidiae.
On the leaves also, various patelliform shells, Trochi,
uncovered mollusks, and some bivalves, are attached.
Innumerable Crustacea frequent every part of the
plant.   On shaking the great entangled roots, a
pile of small fish, shells, cuttle fish, crabs of all
orders, sea-eggs, beautiful Holuthuriae, Planariae,
and crawling nereidous animals of     a  multitude of
forms, fall out together."      Life may not be so
abundant among our masses of sea-weeds, yet those
only accustomed to the use of the microscope, on
some of the contents of salt pools, or the objects
among the mass of marine vegetation, can form
any idea of its abundance in these places.
   The animals of the Conchiferous tribe are head
less mollusks, and are affixed to their valves by
muscles which stretch from valve to valve.        Shut
up in their shelly homes, destitute of organs of
vision, and with very limited means of moving from
place to place, they can have little communication
with objects around them. Many are fixed to
the rocks; some, like the oyster, lie in compact
beds; some fasten themselves firmly, like the
mussel, to the rock, by means of chains spun out

of their own bodies, and some by the help of a foot
shovel out the sands, and bury themselves in a hole
of their own making. The hinge which unites the
valves of the shells has a saw-like edge, or little
teeth, which fit exactly into corresponding cavities.
The beautifully constructed elastic hinge binds it
together, and is designed for opening the shell;
while the animal is endowed with one or more
muscles, by which it can close  it,and keep  it firmly
shut.    The valves of some bivalve shells are formed
exactly alike, while others are dissimilar.   Some
times one     smooth, the other rough frequently,
             is                          ;
one    flat and the other convex, and often one shell
      is
is shorter than its companion.
   Among the most common of our bivalves are
those deeply violet-tinted shells of the common
mussel (Mytilus edulis), which are found in great
abundance  on rocky shores, fastened by no slight
hold to the rocks, and, however wildly the waters
may dash over them, are rarely loosened from their

        SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS        ANIMALS.        187
moorings. But though abundant chiefly on rocky
shores, yet we may find mussels, too, on low, rock-
less strands, lying about sometimes in such numbers
as to render the shore very unpleasant by their
decomposing masses. The peasants of many lands
are accustomed to eat them, though on the coasts
of Yorkshire the belief in their unwholesome pro
perties is so general, that they are universally
rejected by the inhabitants. The fox is said some
times, when pressed by hunger, to leave his lurking-
places and come down to the coast, to make a
meal of these and some other bivalve fish, which
he may chance to find there.        Mussels are eaten,
too, by sea birds, and are of great use as baits for
fish. They are certainly eaten, year after year,
 with impunity by the people of some of our island
 shores.   That, however, the mussel    is,under some
 circumstances, of   a  deleterious nature, there are
 too many well authenticated cases on record for
 us to doubt.     Dr. Combe gives an account of        a
 circumstance which occurred in the town of Leith,
 in June, 1827, at which time numbers of poor
 persons became ill in consequence of eating mussels
 which they had gathered from the docks.       So great
 was the excitement occasioned in the town by this
 event, that the magistrates issued orders, pro
 hibiting their use as food. About thirty persons
 suffered from having partaken of them some were
                                          ;
 severely affected, and two died.        Some writers
 have thought that the illness arising from eating
 this food would not have occurred had not the
 mussels been in     a state of putrefaction; others
 have ascribed  it  to the little crustacean, the pea
 crab, often found in the shell of the mussel.   There
is  no doubt that the flesh of the mussel       isat all

188        SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS                ANIMALS.
times indigestible, and probably the ordinary cases
of illness are sufficiently accounted for by the fact,
that the persons rendered ill by them were in a
state of health little fitted for the digestion of food
of this nature ; but this will not account for every
case.    The best mussels are procured from Ham-
bleton, a village in Lancashire, at which place,
having been taken from the sea, they are put in
the river Weir, where the tide can reach them,
and where they become plump and of delicate
flavour.
   The byssus, or silky beard, by which the mussel
moors itself to the stone, is a familiar object of
our sea rocks. It         in its nature, like the silk of
                             is,
the silkworm, or the silvery thread woven by the
spider, and      exudes, in
                 it             glutinous state, from an
                                   a
organ at the base of the foot. A groove extends
along this part of the foot, the sides of which fold
over to form the little canal, along which the
glutinous substance runs, which shortly acquires
the consistence of         silky thread. The animal
                             a
then protrudes its foot, and fastens the thread to
the rock, then       fresh thread
                         a              again formed in
                                           is
this little groove, until the mussel has made enough
for his moorings. The animal can spin many
hundreds of these strong and durable silken cables,
but   it  does not waste its powers, but skilfully
adapts their numbers to its condition.             When
attached to      rock over which the sea-wave rushes
                     a

           it       strong and many-threaded cable
                         a                                 ;
but when lying on some sheltered spot, where its
dwelling       in no danger of being torn away,
                is                                         it
spins but few.       Daniel, in his " Rural Sports,"
mentions an instance in which the mooring of the
 mussel was useful to effect      purpose which human
                                       a

skill could not accomplish. A large bridge, with
twenty arches, in the town of Biddeford, in
Devonshire, crosses the Towridge river, near the
spot of its juncture with the Taw.    The tide flows
so very rapidly here, that it was found impossible
to keep the bridge in repair by means of mortar.
" The corporation therefore,"
                                  says this writer,
 " keep boats in employ to bring mussels to    it,
                                                 and
the interstices of the bridge are filled by hand
with these mussels. It        supported from being
                             is
driven away by the tide entirely by the strong
threads these mussels fix to the stone-work and;
by an act or grant,   it   is crime liable to trans
                                a
portation for any person to remove these mussels,
unless in the presence and by the consent of the
 corporative trustees."
    The Indian tribes of America, when deliberating
on important matters, ratify their agreements by
an interchange of strings or belts of wampum,
The string  is  simplya  cord, on which are strung
several square pieces of mussel-shell.      The belt
consists of many of these strings, and each has its
appropriate meaning. When intentions are not
pacific, defianceis   expressed by  a  figure of the
tomahawk, rudely sketched on the piece of mussel-
shell. And then follow the savage war-whoop
and the wild dance, and all the precursors of bar
barian warfare, the records of which would fill us
with unmingled horror, but that we have some
times to contemplate instances of an heroic spirit
triumphing over bodily suffering, which, in           a
better cause, were worthy of highest admiration.
The mussel-shell, too, is, among these tribes, often
the record of past treaties, and    isbrought forth
occasionally, year after year, that the old man

190        SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS ANIMALS.
may remember, and the young may learn, the
history of his tribe ; and as it is handed round the
assembly, each one reads the hieroglyphics traced
there, significant to the savage as is the written
document to the civilized man.
   The shell-fish called the Pinna is less common
on our coasts than the mussel, and has a frailer
shell, the two valves of which gape open at one
end.    It is of a fan shape, and larger than the
mussel-shell.    Indeed, the Huge Pinna (Pinna
ingens), a native of the British seas, has a shell
twelve inches long, almost triangular in shape,
and horn-coloured.      The threads by which the
different Pinnae attach themselves to rocks in the
sea, are much larger than those spun by our com
mon mussel, and in Italy are woven into a silken
fabric. They are of a fine glossy brown colour.
The ancient Romans greatly prized articles manu
factured from this byssus, and at Naples and
Palermo, stockings, gloves, and a silky -like fabric
have, even of late years, been made from it.     The
                                                it it,
Italians have also fabricated a substance of        in
some measure resembling our broadcloth, but              is
so expensive that   a  coat of this material costs
about ten pounds of English money.          Stronger
still isthe byssus of that shell of the Indian seas,
called the Great Clam, whose silvery inside often
shines among the shells of grottos.       The cable
attached to this sometimes supports    a shell of the
weight of four hundred pounds, and repeated
strokes of the axe are needed, ere the animal can
be dislodged from its hold.
   But of all the common shells which the tide
throws over the shore, none    is more general than
that of the oyster (Ostrea edulis). There     it lies,

          SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS              ANIMALS.      191
whitened by sunshine and rain to the colour of
snow, crowded sometimes with the twisting shelly
tubes of the Serpula, or pierced in a thousand
holes by minute sea-worms, or forming a ground
work for a little grove of plant-like corallines, or
for the mossy tuft of sea-weed. A strong and
tough shell it is also, and useful, as we see, to other
animals besides the one which made it for its
dwelling.      We all know the worth of the inmate.
The Greeks and Romans valued the oyster very
highly, and their epicures spared neither trouble
nor expense to procure those which they considered
the finest flavoured kind.         They were good judges
too, if we may trust the satirist Juvenal, who, in
describing an epicure, says : —
        " He, whether Circe's rock his oysters bore,
          Or Lucrine Lake, or distant Eichborough's shore,
          Knew at first taste."
They procured them from the Dardanelles, from
Venice, from the Bay of Cumae, and from England,
and valued most those which were brought from
different lands, and afterwards fattened in the
Lucrine Lake.           It was a Roman also, Sergius
Grata, who first thought of this plan of making
artificial beds, and turning oysters into " natives."
Oysters dwell in the ocean, some lurking in the
sands, others adhering to rocks; while on the
 shores of the West Indies a species attaches itself
 in thick clusters to the large roots of the mangrove
 trees, which grow in groves around the sea.               The
 finest edible oysters are those of Britain, and they
 are frequent on many parts of the shores of this
island.      At Milton, in Kent, as well as many
other places, large beds are formed of them. They

lie there with their flat shells uppermost, that the
animal may breathe by opening its shell, and
gather in thus its food from the water ; and the
fishermen who have looked down through the clear
waters into these oyster-beds, state that the ani
mals are so sensitive, that if even the shadow of a
boat passes near them, they instantaneously close
their shells. Designed as they are to be the food
 of man, as well as of fishes, birds, starfishes, and
zoophytes, they are most wonderfully prolific.       It
is stated by Poli that one of these shell-fish con
 tains 1,200,000 eggs, so that a single oyster might
 furnish enough to fill 12,000 barrels.
    The structure of the bivalve mollusks is beauti
 fully fitted to their condition. On gently opening
 the shell of an oyster, we find within, a membrane,
 in some species having a delicate fringe of little
 threads. This membrane is the mantle from which
 the animal secretes the outer layers of its shell,
 in such manner as to admit of its being made larger
 as the shell-fish grows.      Between the leaves of
 this mantle lie four delicately fine membranous
 leaves, composed of slender fibres.     These are the
 branchiae or gills, the aerating organs, and the
 mouth is placed between the innermost of these
 leaves.    But these gills have another office to per
 form, besides that of preparing the blood for use.
 They are the organs by which the mollusk procures
 its food.     Shut up in its cell on the sea-rock,
 or lying, during life, on the bed where it grows,
 the oyster might seem to be little fitted for making
 any effort to secure its prey.     But the filaments
 of these gills are thickly covered with minute cilia,
 or fringe-like hairs. The incessant action of these
 cilia causes successive currents of water around

          SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS       ANIMALS.     193
them,    and thus the animalcules, with which the
water   is full, are brought to the lips of the animal,
which    are so sensitive, that they admit or reject
what    would nourish or what would be useless.
Small as the cilia are, they are visible only when
seen by the microscope, and none except those
accustomed to make microscopic observations can
imagine their use, not to molluscous animals
merely, but to zoophytes, jelly fish, and a vast
number of marine creatures.           The strong and
rapid currents which these cilia make in the water
 cannot be imagined by those who have not wit
 nessed the little whirlpools caused by their perpe
 tual motion. Even after the shell is closed over
 water previously admitted, their vigorous action
 never ceases ; and when a portion of the branchiae
 is cut off, still the cilia move up and down, as
 long as any vitality remains, and acting as paddles
 to the part on which they grow, they row it through
 the water so quickly, as that one might fancy the
 detached piece to be a separate and living animal.
 In the mass of the body lie the heart, the stomach,
 the liver, and other viscera ; and such, with some
 slight variations, is the general structure of the
 great number of bivalve mollusks.
    That beautiful mother-of-pearl, or nacre, of
  which so many ornamental objects are made, with
 its glistening silvery surface, tinted with rainbow
  hues, consists of layers of membrane in conjunction
  with particles of lime. These bright colours have
  been proved to be the effect of the parallel grooves
  which are caused by the regular arrangement of
  the successive deposits of shells.    A similar effect
  may be produced with other materials similarly
  arranged, and casts of the surface of mother-of

pearl, made of gum arable, sealing-wax, or shell-
lac, have been made to assume the shiny appear
ance of that substance.   Pearls are secreted, not
only by the oyster and mussel, but also by
several bivalve mollusks; and they are of the
same substance as the nacre, consisting of animal
matter and carbonate of lime, arranged in con
centric layers around a nucleus.   They appear to
be originated by some local interruption to the
comfort of the animal.     Thus small grains of
sand by some accident get in between the valves
of the shell, and become encrusted with layers of
nacre, slowly increasing and assuming the round
shape of these beautiful gems ; or the annelidous
worm pierces a hole in the shell, and the oyster
 forms a little plug to stop up farther intrusion.
 Linnaeus said that he could make pearls at plea
 sure, by perforating the shell with a pointed wire,
 and introducing grains of sand.
    " Pearls," says Mr. Gray, " are usually of the
 colour of the part of the shell to which they are
 attached.      I
                have observed them white, rose-
coloured, purple, and black, and they are said to
be sometimes of a green colour.     They have also
been found of two colours ; that   is, white with a
dark nucleus which
                ;     is occasioned by their being
first formed on the dark margin of the shell,
beforeit   iscovered with the white and pearly coat
of the disk, which, when    becomes extended over
                           it
them and the margin, gives them that appearance."
    The frequent mention of pearls by the Scripture
writers, shows how highly they have ever been
esteemed among Oriental nations.      Indeed, in the
East, they seem to have been prized even more
than the brilliant diamond. " In the West," says

         SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS       ANIMALS.     195
 Heeren, "the passion for the elegant luxury was
at its height about the period of the extinction of
Roman freedom, and they were valued in Rome
and Alexandria as highly as precious stones. In
Asia this taste was of more ancient date, and may
be traced to a period anterior to the Persian
dynasty.     A string of pearls, of the largest size,
is an indispensable part of the decorations of an
Eastern monarch. It was thus that Tippoo was
adorned when he fell before the gates of his capital ;
and it is thus that the present ruler of the Persians
is usually decorated." Pearls have one disadvan
tage, however, that they lose their lustre in the
course of years, especially if worn near the skin.
The pearls found in our native species of oysters
are far inferior to those brought from the Persian
Gulf, from Ceylon, or any of the Oriental pearl
fisheries, and have, generally, a milky and more
opaque appearance.
   We have several British species of oyster, and
the shells of some of those of distant countries are
highly prized by conchologists.       A shell termed
the hammer-oyster (Malleus vulgaris), from the
Indian seas, is not uncommon in collections, and
in some specimens the shell is shaped so much like
a hammer as to lead to its immediate recognition.
   Several species of the scallop are abundant in our
seas, and their shells are strewed about on our
shores. Cuvier called these shells the butterflies of
the ocean, not so much because, when the two
valves are expanded, they in some respects resemble
the wings of our summer-insect, as that they ex
hibit such various and beautiful colours. Numbers
of the little shells belonging to the speckled scallop
 (Pecten varia), are to be found on almost any part
                          o 2

of the sea-side, where a ridge of sand borders the
ocean.    They are often about two inches and a
quarter long, variously clouded and speckled with
a variety of colours, most generally of an orange
brown tint, though sometimes of purple or voilet,
and marked with about twelve ribs.
   Our wood-cut represents the large scallop
 (Pecten maximus),   which, though not general on
all our coasts, is plentiful on many ; and its fish,
as well as that of several other of the species, is
used for food.      In former days its flat valve
served for the dish, and its hollow one for the cup,
at the feast to which the less polished inhabitant
of our island once invited his friends, when, in the
words of Ossian, "the joy of the shell went
round."     Either this shell, or the species termed
Pecten opercularis, was also, in former days, the
badge of pilgrimage, when men travelled wearily
to the sites of the histories of Scripture, there to

perform some superstitious vow, or, perhaps, with
the view of making merchandise.                  This pilgrim
shell, affixed to the front of the hat, is frequently
adverted to by our older writers.               Thus we have
Ophelia's song :    —
            " How should I your true love know
                From another one ?
              By his cockle-hat and staff,
                And by his sandal shoon."
And in that quaint old poem of Sir Walter
Raleigh's, entitled "The Pilgrimage," beautiful,
but fanciful, we have an allusion to this           :
                                                      —
            " Give me my scallop-shell of quiet,
              My staffe of faith to walk upon ;
              My scrip of joy (immortal diet) ;
              My bottle of salvation ;
              My gowne of glory, hope's true gage,
              And thus I'll make my pilgrimage .
              Blood shall be my body's balmer,
              While my soul, like a peaceful palmer,
              Travels towards the land of Heaven."
   After  a stormy day, when more shells than usual
have been dashed by the waves on the strand, we
may often pick up some of the different species
of Anomia, or silver oysters, as they are called by
people on the Kentish coast.               This shell has one
valve flat, and the other gibbous, and one of the
valves has often a small hole just at the base.
These shells are so transparent and wrinkled, that
if we found only one valve, we might almost
imagine it was the pearly lining of an oyster-shell,
detached from its place.             The waved anomia is
about one inch and a half wide, marked with fine
irregular thread-like lines crossing curved ones,

delicacy.   Both this and the saddle anomia (Ano-
mia epiphippium) may be met with attached to
the oyster and other shells.    The mollusks fasten
themselves thus to shells, stones, or sea-weeds in
the sea.   The latter species sometimes sufficiently
resembles a saddle to deserve its familiar name.
The upper valve is convex, the under flat. The
inside of the shell is beautifully pearly, exhibiting
very lovely tints of green, purple, or yellow. It
is of a much larger size than the waved species.
   Some species of the Noah's Ark shells are found
on various parts of our coast, but they are not
very general, though we may often find, in our
rambles on the sandy shore, the little species
called the silvery ark (Area nucleus), with its
somewhat triangular and slightly convex shell.
This is covered with a smooth olive-green skin,
and when this is removed, the shell is seen to be
white with olive rays from the beak to the margin,
and often marked with flesh-coloured and bluish
transverse bands, and a few coarse ridges.       It is
usually rather less than half-an-inch round, and
its internal part is beautifully white and silvery.
The larger Noah's Ark (Area Noa), so common
in collections, of a deep umber colour outside, and
having a pure white interior, is also found on our
coasts ; but the largest specimens, of two or more
inches broad, are brought chiefly from the shores
of the Atlantic.
   Every one who has noticed the rocks about our
sea-shores, within reach of the tide, must have
seen how they are often pierced with large holes,
which seem as if the rock had at one time been
soft, and that these smooth hollows had been made
by putting some round object, as a stick, into

them.     The apertures which lie exposed to the
surface are often empty, or contain shells in
which the fish are dead; but break away a crag
from these pierced rocks, and we shall find numbers
of living shell-fish shut up within. These are the
different species of Pholas, well-named from the
Greek word pholeo, " to hide," for they live and
die buried in their homes in the rock, save when
some naturalist brings them out for observation,
or the fisher goes and collects them for bait. It
is wonderful to look at their frail delicate shells,
and see how they can make their way into rocks,
hard clay, limestone, and wood, enlarging their
cavity as they increase in size, and clustering in
multitudes in the wood-work of piers, sapping the
foundations of jetties, boring into the hulls of
 ships,  and, if their ravages are unperceived,
causing the shipwreck of the mariner, and the
 destruction of the works of man's art.         How
 creatures apparently so helpless, and with such
 fragile shells, should accomplish this, is yet a
 mystery. Hidden as they are, within their rocks,
 our means of observation on their habits are very
limited. Some naturalists think that they pierce the
 hole by the rotatory movements of the shell within
 the cavity, yet one would think that a slender
 shell would rather break than force its way into a
 hard rock.     Others, familiar with the action of
 minute cilia in causing currents in the water, have
 thought that the Pholas, by producing these cur
 rents, wore away the stone. Yet this force, power
 ful as it is in entangling animalcules, is not great
 when directed against a firm object, and one can
 hardly imagine that the forest tree, lying on the
 shore, and filled with these piercers— a tree whose

wood was hard and firm, and whose constituent
fibres adhered so closely — can have been per
forated thus.       Other naturalists believe that
some chemical solvent is possessed by the animal,
which exudes from      it, and causes the cavity by
dissolving the rock. But this idea has its diffi
culties too, and we ask how the solvent which
destroys carbonate of lime, should leave the shell
uninjured, and how the same chemical substance
which dissolves limestone should act in          similar
                                                       a
 manner on wood and clay.        Each solution of the
mystery has its difficulties, and      remains yet an
                                            it
unsettled question, by what means these dwellers
in the rock effect their purpose.
    The Pholades emit        amost remarkable light.
 This secretion not only shines during darkness,
 but illuminates whatever       touches or happens to
                                 it
 fall on.  " There is," says Dr. Priestley, "a remark
 able shell-fish, called holes, which forms for itself
                       P
 holes in different kinds of stone.    This fish illumi
 nates the mouth of the person who eats           and  it,   it
is  remarked, that contrary to the nature of other
 fish, which give light when they tend to putres
 cence, thisis  more luminous the fresher        is, and
                                                       it

 either with salt-water or fresh brandy, however,

    Whether this light   is, or   not phosphorescent,
                                  is
 yet, that this secretion does not effect the cavity,

prickly pidduck, or prick-stone (Pholas dactylus), a
valuable animal to the fishermen of our coasts, as
it is extensively used for bait. In some countries
it is eaten as food. Indeed, all the mollusks of
 the bivalve family might be eaten; as there are
 none which are known to be poisonous, though
 many are somewhat indigestible, and a few are of
 unpleasant flavour. A general description of the
 shell of this species will suit, more or less, several
 others of the genus Pholas.      It is so fragile, that
 it may be easily broken, and a thicker shell would
 only encumber an animal shut up in the rocky
 seclusion.   It is white, thin, and in its early stage
 transparent, about one or two inches in length,
 and the two large valves, instead of fitting into
 each other, are open at both ends.      Just inside of
 each of these valves is a little spoon-shaped piece.
 Besides this, the shell has several lesser pieces, or

202      SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS ANIMALS.
valves near the hinge, which, however, sometimes
fall off, and are so easily broken, as that they
cannot be relied on as characteristic.       The shell
is marked with ridges set with prickles, which
are thicker and larger at one end than the
other. The animal has a long siphon, and if we
place a stone-piercer in a vessel of water, it will
elongate this wonderfully.
   The Pholades are not the only family of mollusks
which pierce their way into stone and wood. Not
less remarkable are the boring powers of some of
the genus Mya, and the Rock-boring Venus, and
others which dwell in cavities exactly fitted to
their shells.  The well-known Ship-worm (Teredo
norvagicus, or navalis, as it is often called) , is very
destructive to submerged wood, insinuating itself
into the bottom of ships, even when the oak is
perfectly sound, and by its ravages destroying
many a noble vessel, a valuable floodgate, or sub
stantial pier. The teredo works with astonishing
rapidity, and will completely riddle a hard and sound
piece of wood, in the space of five or six weeks.

         SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS      ANIMALS.     203
The ravages of this animal were so extensive in
the dockyard at Plymouth, that in the course of
four or five years it became necessary to remove
the wood which it had penetrated.          The very
submersion of Holland has seemed at times pro
bable, from its destructive effects ; and in the
years 1731 and 1732, great alarm was excited in
the United Provinces, by the discovery that the
teredo had so injured the piles which support the
banks of Zealand, as to threaten them with entire
destruction.    Happily, however, after a time, it
disappeared, no one could tell why, unless it
might be, that the winter having been unusually
severe, it was unable to live in that latitude in
such extreme cold.
    Linnaeus called the teredo the Calamitas navium,
and common as it now is in all the seas of Europe,
yet it was formerly believed to have been intro
duced into them, during the last century, from
the East, though several species are now con
sidered as natives of Britain. On examining the
piers and woodwork about our harbours, we shall
too often find specimens of this animal embedded
in it. Little canals are formed by it in the wood,
 sometimes one or two feet long, not always
 straight, but bending according to the grain of
the wood.     Inside of these the worm-like animal
lies enclosed, usually in a shelly case, secreted by
its mantle, but to which it is not attached by any
 muscles.    The true shell is at the end of this
 ivory case, and consists of two valves, by means
 of which the teredo cuts its entrance into the
 wood.    The body is a long worm-looking object,
 and is merely an extension of its two siphons, or
 tubes.    Happily, the teredo, like many other

204     SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS      ANIMALS.
marine animals,    cannot exist in fresh water.    A
species lives in the hardened mud on the shores
of the Indian seas, which, however, never bores
 into wood.
    The shelly tube of our common ship-worm
varies in thickness in different circumstances.
Mr. John Mummery, of Dovor, who has made
many observations on the habits of the marine
animals of that coast, informs the writer that he
possesses specimens taken from a portion of an
old wrecked vessel, lying on the sandy shore at
the north of Deal, in which the calcareous tube is
                                         " But, in a

jetty near the railway terminus at Dovor, the
wood-work of which jetty has been almost de
stroyed in the course of a few years by the
teredo, the calcareous lining, when removed from
the wood,  I  find to resemble more nearly the shell
of a serpula than the ordinary coating secreted by
the former animal. It is nearly one-eighth of an
inch in thickness ; and   I attribute the increase in
substance to the fact, that the water was always
turbid with the immense quantity of chalk sus
pended in      it, consequent upon the extensive
masses of cliff which were thrown into the sea by
the railway excavators.      The animal being thus
supplied with unusually abundant material, was
enabled to secrete solid crystalline and extremely
                     a
hard shell, instead of the ordinary fragile depo
sition.I     have similarly thick cases from the
tropics, where lime      ismuch more abundantly
present, either in solution or suspension, as may
be inferred from the greater number of calcareous
 corals in those seas than in ours."

   The common cockle (Cardium edule), is one of
the most familiar objects on our shores, lying often
by hundreds, with the valves opened, because the
fish within has died; or we may see the living
fish hastily scooping out a hole in the sand, just
below the surface, that it may bury itself, now that
our presence threatens danger.      Nor is this the
only office performed by its strong fleshy foot,
bent, elbow-like, about the middle.       When the
cockle wishes again to rise to light, it will double
up this foot, and pushing it downwards against
the sand beneath, it can easily, by this process,
emerge from its hiding-place.     By means of this
foot it can also leap so vigorously, that it has
been known to jump over the gunwale of a boat.
The number of the shells thrown on our sandy
shores, proves how numerous are these common
cockles in our own seas; and the cockle tribe
abound also in the seas of temperate climates, as
well as in those of warmer regions. The fish is
eaten either raw or boiled in our land, and im
mense numbers are sold for food in Holland during
winter, while it forms a truly valuable resource in
lands less provided with other means of food. The
shells of many of the species are also highly prized
by conchologists for their beauty. A small shell,
called the smooth-keeled-heart shell, is so valuable,
that Wood, in his work on conchology, states that
Dr. G. Fordyce, who had one in his cabinet,
valued it so highly that he refused to take fifty
pounds for it.    Several of the cockle species are
covered with spines, which probably serve to resist
the action of the waters, and hold their shells fast
in their sandy beds. Unlike the mussel, it has
no means of mooring itself, but all the species have

   Another common genus of mollusks, whose shells
lie about on sandy coasts, contains the different
species of Solen, or Razor-shells.  The animal is
provided with a cylindrical foot, admirably adapt
ing it for burrowing in the sand. This organ
tapers at the end, and             is,
                              however, more shaped

sand, pierce the animal, and bring it to light. The
slight motion of the sand, made by the foot,
sufficiently alarms the fish to induce it to throw
out jets of water, or it would lie secure enough,
for the holes are not often easily discovered.   In
some cases salt is thrown into the cavities, which
so irritates the fish, that it immediately comes to
the surface ; but the eye must be watchful, and
the hand must be ready, which is to secure       as,it,
if not seized instantly,    plunges down again, and

it to come out to face farther danger. The French
call the Solen Manche de couteau, from the shape
of its shell. Several species are found on our
coast.    Our figure represents the common Razor-
shell (Solen ensis)   .
     Notless difficult of capture, from the depth in
which they bury themselves in the sands, are the

of Tyrone and Donegal, in Ireland. " One of
them," says Captain Brown, quoting from the
Philosophical Transactions, "weighed thirty-six
carats, and would have been worth 40/., but owing
to its being impure, it lost much of its value ;
other pearls from the same places have sold at from
4il. 10*. to 10Z. each. One of the latter price was
sold a second time to Lady Glenlealy, who had it
placed in a necklace and refused 801. for it." This
writer adds, that there was a great fishery for
pearls in the river Tay, and that pearls sent from
thence for the years 1761 to 1764, were worth
10,000/., while the pearls in the Scottish crown,
forming part of the Regalia, exhibited in the
Castle of Edinburgh, are the produce of the
river Tay. County tradition tells us that a pearl
found in this pearl mya in the river Conwy in
Wales, was presented by Sir Richard Wynne of
Gwydin to the Queen of Charles II., which
was afterwards placed in the royal crown.

   Some very pretty little shells of the Donax
family are among the very commonest of those
which we meet when we ramble along the sands.
They may be described as triangular, flattened and
wedge-shaped.    These shells                bury themselves in
the sand, often to the depth                 of sixteen fathoms,
with the short end of the shell              uppermost, in order
to admit the entrance of the               sea-water, through

shaped than this.    They are all small shells.

   Several species of Tellina are also among our
common shells, and are generally found with the
Donaces buried in the sand, or left by the waters
on the shore. Many of them are much thinner
and clearer shells than the Donax, and beautifully
marked with pale or deep rose-colour, and various
                    shades of purple, yellow, and
                    buff. Our figure represents the
                    common Tellina (Tellina car-

                    shell, and marked with pale flesh-
                    coloured bands. It is a thicker,
                    firmer shell than most of the
genus, and among the most frequent on our sandy
shores.
   More highly organized than the inhabitants of
bivalve shells, are the univalve mollusks, com
posing the class Gasteropoda.     This name refers to
the broad expansion on the under part of the body
of the animal, which is called a foot ; and the snail,
as it creeps over our plants, makes use of this
organ, and exhibits its form to us.     The Gastero
poda is a large class, including not only the
univalved shell-fish, but a number of animals,
which, like the slug, have not a calcareous habita
tion.   The mollusk of this class is far more
symmetrical in form than that of the Conchifera.
It has a clearly marked face, with two or four
tentacula, like the horns in the snail, which have
either eyes at the summit, or, as in most of those
belonging to the sea, at the base of these organs.
Zoologists arrange this class into several orders,
according to the form and situation of the gills
by means of which they breathe.          Those which
breathe air, like the snail, have a delicate network,

         SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS ANIMALS.           211
 like the lungs of other animals destined to inhale
 atmospheric air ; but the Gasteropoda, formed to
 inhabit the sea, have gills or branchiae placed on
 different parts of their bodies.     The structure of
 some of these gills is exquisitely beautiful. In some
 they form a number of rays, like a lovely flower,
 on the back of the animal : in others they are like
 long rows of leaflets : while in many they are
 shaped like the teeth of a comb, thus forming
 good characters for a scientific classification.
    Every one is familiar with some of the common
 shells of the animals of this class. Our beaches
 are strewed with them, they lie among our rocks,
and some are found on our sandy shores.           Many
little shells of great beauty lurk in the heaps of
drifted sand, or hang about the roots of sea-weeds,
needing a microscope for their examination. Not
a lake, or pond, or ditch but has its own tribes
lying among the mud at its base, or hiding among
the plants which surround    it,or forming carpet on
                                             a
its surface.    Land shells, too, of this order exist
everywhere, and the bitten leaves of our choicest
garden flowers, too often leave the silvery traces
of the snail or slug, which has remorselessly made
its meal upon them during the rainy day or the
moist evening.     The sea itself has its myriads of
these animals, and a greater number of genera
and species belong to this class than to the
Conchifera.
    All who have wandered among the rocks on
our shores, know that univalve so frequent upon
them, the common Limpet (Patella vulgata), which
adheres as firmly to the rock as   if    were
                                        it   a  portion
of it,  while its empty shells, like so many little
cups, lie strewed around.      It  is often completely
                         p   2

212    SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS       ANIMALS.
embedded in a cavity which it makes, of exactly
the size and form fitted to hold its shell. So firmly
can it attach itself, that if by any movement of
the hand we allow the animal to guess at our
intention of taking it,
                      it becomes almost impossible
to tearit  away, unless by putting the blade of     a
knife between  it   and the stone.  The power of
holding itself thus is owing to the great number
and strength of the fibres of its foot, which by
raising the middle part, form     a hollow in the
centre and act as     a     sucker.    This means of
adhesion protects the limpet not only from the
violence of the waves, but also from the strength
or skill of the numerous birds and animals which
relishit  as food.  There are many species of limpet,
but even the practical conchologist finds some
difficulty in distinguishing them from each other,
on account of the power which the animal has of
altering its shell to suit its circumstances, adapting
the rim to the shape of the substance on which      it
is found.     Thus, when limpet makes
                          a              a   dwelling-
place on the leaf of  a   large sea-weed or on flat
                                                a

         SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS      ANIMALS.     213
stone, the base of the shell is flattened, and the
mouth roundish ; but if it grows attached to some
crag, or on the cavity of some refuse shell, the base
is flat and internally convex, and as the limpets
move from place to place, several changes may
occur in the form of the same individual shell.
Some species seem to move continually from one
reef or rock to another, but others are fixed, and
appear to depend for sustenance on such food as
the wave may bring them. Yet it is generally
believed that they can eat marine plants, and the
long and curiously formed tongue of our common
limpet, armed with spines and tiny hooks, is a
wondrous piece of mechanism, admirably adapted
for sawing the sea-weeds into little pieces.
     The Patella? are found on rocky coasts, on
 almost all shores, excepting those of the Arctic
seas, and as they grow to a much larger size on
tropical rocks, they form a most valuable article
 of food. Even our smaller native species are of
 great value in some parts of this kingdom, and
 the peasantry of the Western Isles of Scotland
 look to the periwinkles and limpets which abound
 on their rocks for their daily meal, often for long
 seasons, subsisting almost entirely upon this
 humble food. In the Isle of Skye the inhabitants
 are often, at one time of the year, without any
 other source of provision. Darwin, in his Journal
 of Researches, describes the poor people of Tierra
 del Fuego as living almost entirely on the mol
 luscous animals which they can gather from their
 rocks. "Whenever," says this writer, "it is low
 water, winter or summer, night or day, they must
  rise to pick up shell-fish from the rocks ; and the
  women either dive to collect sea eggs, or sit
                            p 3

 214     SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS        ANIMALS.
 patiently in their canoes, and with a baited hair
 line, without any hook, jerk out a little fish."
 These poor creatures often suffer severely from
 famine, when, by a succession of strong gales,
 they are prevented from reaching the rocks on
 which the limpets grow.
    Nor was the limpet destined for the food of
 man only.   The sea-gulls and ducks feed on them,
 while the pied oyster-catcher receives its name
from its habit of devouring the oyster and common
limpet.    The bill of this bird is admirably con
 structed for opening the valves of the one, and
loosing the other from its hold on the rock, while
the crow, not thus favoured, has recourse to a
 device for getting at the shell-fish.   "A friend of
 Dr. Darwin's," says an interesting writer in
London's Magazine of Natural History, "saw
above a hundred crows on the northern coast of
Ireland, at once preying upon mussels.          Each
one took a mussel up in the air twenty or forty
yards high, and let it fall on the stones, and thus
broke its shell.     Many authorities might be
adduced in corroboration of this statement.        In
Southern Africa, so many of the shell-fish are
consumed by these and other birds, as to have
given rise to an opinion that the marine shells
found buried in the distant plains, or in the sides
of mountains, have been carried there by their
agency, and not, as is generally supposed, by
eruptions of the sea.
                      " Crows even, and vultures,
as well as aquatic birds, carry off these shell-fish,
and Mr. Barrow, who is of this opinion, says that
shells are thus carried to the very summit of the
Table Mountain. He adds; — "In one cavern at
the point of Mussel Bay,    I disturbed some thou-

          SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS      ANIMALS.     215
sands of birds, and found as many thousands of
living shell-fish scattered on the surface of a heap
                           I
of shells, that for aught knowy would have filled
as many thousand wagons."
    The shell of our common limpet is sub-oval, of
a yellowish or greenish     ash colour, and marked
with many ribs. Should the reader happen to
find on the frond of the Oar- weed, or any other of
our large olive sea-weeds, a beautiful clear little
shell, shaped something like that of the common
limpet, of an olive-green colour, with blue inter
rupted rays, he may recognise it as the Pellucid
limpet (Patella pellucida).
     Then there are the shell-fish, commonly called
 the Key -hole limpets, of the genus Fissurella, some
 of them frequent, and all easily known by the
 aperture at the summit of the shell, shaped exactly
 like a key-hole.     This aperture is exactly over
 the breathing apparatus, and serves to conduct
 the water necessary for respiration.
     On the rock on which we find the limpet, we shall
 probably also see some one of the several species
 of the canoe shell, as they abound on rocks between
 the high and low-water marks, often being com
 pletely embedded in them. They also attach them
  selves to the stems of the coarser sea-weeds, and
 to the hulls of ships. These Chitons have a very
  remarkable shell, formed of eight distinct portions,
  arranged in a row down the back, and so similar
  to the plates of ancient armour, that this animal
  is often called coat-of-mail.  When we take it up
  in the hand, it rolls up in a ball like the common
  wood-louse. It has very sharp little teeth in its
  mouth, with which to nibble sea-weeds or other
  food.    The species are difficult to determine, as
                           p 4

  216     SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS      ANIMALS.
  the only certain character is afforded by the
  number of little notches on the sides of the valves,
  and these cannot be ascertained but by taking the
  shell to pieces. The tufted canoe-shell (Chiton
                            fascicularis) is one of the
                             commonest kinds, and
                             very plentiful on our
                             southern coasts, and may
                             be known by the little
                             tufts of hair around the
                             margin of the shell. The
 whole surface of the valves, when seen through a
 microscope, appears to be covered with fish-like
 scales, excepting the beak, which is smooth, and
 of a yellower colour than the other part. The
 Emarginate canoe-shell (Chiton marginatus) is also
 a frequent species, and is of a dingy brown or
 reddish colour. These shell-fish are much larger
 in hot countries.
    Sometimes, when wandering among the rocks
 near the low water mark, we find, among the
 groups of sea-weed, that singular molluscous
 animal, the Sea hare (Aphysia depilans).       It is a
kind of soft slug, of a blackish colour, tinged with
purple, not of an attractive appearance, and
having, besides, an unpleasant odour.          A sub
stance exudes from its skin, which in days of
superstition was believed to cause the hair to fall
off from the person who only touched it. The
ancient writers told, that from it was produced
the poison by which tyrants destroyed their
victims, and relate that Nero mixed it with the
food of those whom he hated, and that Titus used
it to destroy Domitian.        But the charges of
antipathy to man, so repeatedly urged by them

          SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS     ANIMALS.       217
 against this little animal, were most unfounded,
 for the sea-hare is guiltless of either intent or
 power to injure, though, like the cuttle-fish, it has
 a means of defence against its enemies, in the
 dark purplish liquid with which it can surround
 itself, when threatened with danger, or when
 caught by the fishermen.
    Our engraving represents a shell which is also
very frequent on some parts of our island, and
commonly called the Torbay night-cap, or Hun
garian bonnet (Pileopsis ungarica).       It fastens
itself to rocks or stones, like the limpet, delving,
by some mysterious means, a cavity in the sur
face.    This shell is usually about two inches in
diameter, covered with a fawn-coloured skin, and
inside very smooth and glossy, of a white or rose
colour.
    The shells hitherto described are without a
regular spire, but many of the univalves are tur-
binated or spiral shells, like that of the common
periwinkle (Turbo littoreus). This shell-fish, Le
Vogneau of the French, is too well known to
require any description.      It abounds on rocky

218       SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS         ANIMALS.
coasts, and the shore near them is often strewed
with its dark olive-green shells.           This fish is
indigestible as food, though, like the limpet, it
forms an important article of diet to many people.
In some places the fish is called Pin-patch, because
the lid or operculum is so generally removed with a
pin when it is eaten. This cartilaginous substance
is attached to the foot of the animal within, and
 acts as a lid or door, protecting it from the intrusion
 of its enemies, and exactly closing up the aperture
 of the shell. The large whelk is also furnished
 with a strong similar lid, as are other species of
 univalves. Some of the turbinated shells have
 lids of this kind of a more thick and solid nature,
 and calcareous      substance,  and these were     once
 much valued for medicinal purposes.             Pennant
 tells us that the Swedish peasant believes, that
 when these shell-fish crawl high up the rocks, a
 storm is brewing in the south; but Linnaeus
 quotes a Norwegian writer, who says that when
 the periwinkle climbs thus high, it foretells the
 coming of a land wind, and a calm in-shore.
     A shell of a dull red, or fawn, or drab colour,
  very thick and shaped like that of the periwinkle,
  the Turbo rudis, is not unfrequent on our rocky
  shores.    It is about three-fourths of an inch long,
  and its outer lip thick and glossy within; and
  several other British species may also be found in
  similar places.
     The foot of the animals of the genus Turbo, as
  well as some others of this class, is so compressed
  as to serve as a kind of paddle in the water, while
  its breathing organs are little tufts like plumes on
  the back. These animals feed on vegetables, and
  are provided with a tongue, armed with very small

         SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS        ANIMALS.    219
hooks, by means of which they catch and tear their
food.
   That very common shell, the Muddy -red
Trochus (Trochus Ziziphinus), has, as well as the
other species of the genus, an in
mate similarly formed to the peri
winkle, and like it, is a spiral shell.
It is of a dull grey hue, marked
with dashes of a reddish flesh-
colour, or brownish pink.        It is
generally about an inch long. This
genus received its name from the
resemblance of the shells to a top.          We have
several native species, some of them among our
 commonest shells.
   The grey Trochus (Trochus cinerarius) is .very
much smaller than the last-named kind, and is of
an ash colour, varied with darker spots, and its
spire is not so pointed ; while the little spotted
Trochus (Trochus maculata) is smaller still, and is
called by children on the coast, Pepper-and-salt
shell, perhaps because its colour resembles that of
the cloth of that name, worn some years since.
They are both very frequent on our sandy
shores.
   A  singular shell of this genus, called the Carrier
shell (Trochus phorus), a native of Eastern shores,
is in great request among conchologists.            It
attaches to its outer surface as it increases in size,
a variety of foreign objects, as stones, shells, and
corals. The species of Trochus are very numerous,
and some of them may be found in almost all seas.
Fossil Trochi too are very abundant; some of
them of existing species, as our muddy-red and
grey kind ; others of species now extinct.

220      SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS    ANIMALS.
   Another frequent shell   of our coast, is the
common False wentletrap (Scalaria communis),
which is generally of a whitish colour. Its form
is sufficiently described by our engraving; the
ribs are somewhat thick and smooth, and they are
sometimes marked with purple spots, while the
whole shell has occasionally a pinkish purple
tinge. More than eighty species of wentletrap
are described by naturalists.   The Royal Stair
case wentletrap (Scalaria pretiosa), was once a
rare object among collectors, and a fine specimen
is known to have been sold in France for a
hundred louis, and in England for twenty or thirty

         SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS       ANIMALS.    221
pounds; but the shell, though beautiful, was
prized chiefly because it was rare, and now that
plenty can be obtained, a few shillings will suffice
for its purchase.
   There is a shell lying about most of our beaches
and sandy shores, commonly called the Sea Snail-
shell (Natica monolifera).     It is shaped like that
of the garden snail, but highly
polished, and of a bright brown
colour    marked     with darker
streaks.    The eggs of the Na
tica are most singular.      They
resemble thin cakes of biscuit
several    inches in     diameter,
which, if held up to the light,
seem composed of a number of cells covered with
sand.
   Still more like our garden snails in the form and
brittle texture of its shell, is the beautiful and
fragile Oceanic Snail (Janthina fragilis), which is
found too rarely on our shores to be named among
their common productions, though it is abundant
in warmer latitudes. Its shell is of a beautiful
violet colour, and the little animal within is
remarkable for the beautiful apparatus by which
it floats gracefully along in the waters. This con
sists of an assemblage of air-cells, and resembles
a frothy mass.     This singular float has no organic
connexion with the little mollusk.        "It is pro
bable," remarks Captain Cook of this animal, "that
it never goes down to the bottom, nor willingly
 approaches any shore, for its shell is exceedingly
brittle, and that of few fresh-water snails so thin ;
every shell contains about a tea-spoonful of liquor,
which is most easily discharged upon being touched,

 222       SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS              ANIMALS.
 and which is of the most beautiful red purple that
 can be conceived."
    But returning to the commoner objects of our
 native shores, the accompanying figure will at once
 recall to every one who has strayed along the sandy
 margin of ocean the form of a familiar object.
 Perchance it may recall the hours of childhood,
 when we gathered up the cowries as treasures, and
 long prized them for their beauty, and because
 they told of velvety sands on which the waves
 washed over them, making sweet music as they
 passed.     The large foreign cowries too, the Map
 cowry with its brown or yellow marks and lines,
 and the Spotted cowry, and the common white
 Poached-egg cowry, and many others, well known
by their uses in adorning our chimney-pieces, even
to those who live inland, can bring their memories
of childhood, when we held them to the ear lis
tening to the music of the sea shell, so like that
of the moaning surges, and dreamed that they told
of the rising tide. Our philosophic poet Words
worth alluded to this : —
                                    " I have seen
         A curious  child, who dwelt upon a tract
         Of inland ground, applying to his ear
         The convolutions of a thick-lipp'd shell,
         To which in silence hush'd, his very soul
         Listen'd intensely ; and his countenance soon
         Brighten'd with joy ; for murmurings within
         Were heard ; sonorous cadences ! whereby
         To his belief, the monitor express'd
         Mysterious union with its native sea."
   The little white-ribbed cowries, which are plen
tiful on our coast, are commonly called pigs, from
some fancied resemblance in their form to that
animal.      The different common species are much

         SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS      ANIMALS.      223
alike, the Louse-pig cowry, or Nun cowry (Trivia
pediculis), represented by our engraving, being very
general. It is of a pale reddish colour,
with six square black spots on the
back. The flesh-coloured Pig cowry
is thinner and clearer, of a beautiful
rose tint; and the European Pig
cowry has ribbed ash-coloured or pinkish shells,
marked down the back with a white streak and
three black dots.
    The cowries live at the base of the sea or along
 the shore in sands, and their beautifully polished
 surfaces are preserved free from any extraneous
 matters, by means of a membrane with which the
 animals are provided, and which they throw over
 the shells.    They are found in greater number in
 the Tropical than in European seas, and in climes
 in which all the colours of nature deepen into
 richer and more glowing hue, they are far more
 highly tinted.      The foreign species have been
 prized from time immemorial for their beauty, and
 the little Money cowry (Cyprtea moneta) is used
 for current coin in many parts of India, in Siam,
 and on the coast of Guinea.       Though inferior in
 value to gold or silver, yet so long as the shell is
 unbroken it will pass for money, and accounts are
  kept in cowries in some departments of business.
  This cowry is obtained from the Philippine Isles,
 and it is very common in this country. It is called
 the trussed chicken, which object it much resembles
 in shape. The shell is yellow or white, with a
  yellow ring.
    Among the commonest of our marine mollus
  cous animals is the waved whelk (Buccinum
 undatum).     Its large firm shell frequently lies in

224       SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS     ANIMALS.
large numbers among the beach stones, and the
hard indigestible fish, boiled and placed for sale in
 saucers, is a well-known object in London shop
windows. In our walks along the shore, we see
the whelk creeping about in quest of food, and he
 seems to have an extraordinary appetite, making
 sad havoc among the shells of his neighbours,
which he pierces through, and then sucks out the
juices of the fish within.      The mouth of this
mollusk is provided with a long flexible proboscis,
moveable in many directions.      At the end of this
is a spiny tongue, with which he drills and rasps
away the hole, and reaches the animal within in
spite of a calcareous covering, which would have
seemed a sure safeguard.        This whelk is often
called, by the fishermen, the Conch, or the Buckie.
The shell is about four inches long, of a brownish
or yellowish white colour.
    Scarcely less common on most parts of our
 coast, is the Stone, or Dog whelk (Buccinum la-
pillus), sometimes called the yellow-bandy, from
the spiral bands of dark orange or yellow which

         SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS       ANIMALS.     225
often surround the shell.      This is usually about
an inch in length, of yellow, white, chestnut, or
dull orange colour : in its perfect state much
wrinkled, but often worn smooth.        This whelk is
found on rocks at low water, and its fish is in
teresting, because it is believed to have been one
which afforded that rich dye by which the ancient
Tyre, whose merchants were princes, was so
enriched.     The ancients included under the
word which we translate purple, a variety of
tints, and applied it to the crimson and scarlet,
and much paler shades of these hues, derived from
shell-fish, as distinguished from vegetable dyes.
Pliny, from whose writings much information is to
be gathered on this subject, tells us that the juice
being extracted from the small sac in the throat
of the fish, was mingled with salt and boiled. The
flesh which adhered to it was strained off, and the
wool plunged into the liquid dye. Several shell
 fish, doubtless, contributed these purples, but
 Pliny ranges them all into two classes, one of
 which, he says, was found on cliffs and rocks, and
 yielded a dull blue dye, which he compares to the
tint of the raging sea; the other, the Purpura,
 the proper purple shell, taken by fishing in the sea,
 yielded the rich crimson hue, which he likens to that
 of rich red roses, or to coagulated blood. This was
 the valued ancient purple colour. There is no doubt
 that the ancient Tyrians used a species of rock-shell
 common all along the shores of the Mediterranean,
 the Murex trunculus, in their dye, as Wilde found
 a concrete mass of the shells in some of the ancient
  dye-pots, sunk in the rocks of Tyre.        The dye
  was very costly, owing to the small quantity which
  could be procured from each fish, and to the many

226      SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS      ANIMALS.
processes which were used in the dyeing.       In the
time of Augustus, one pound of wool dyed with
the Tyrian purple, could not be bought for thirty
pounds. But when once stained, the colour was
permanent, for Plutarch relates that the Greeks
found in the treasury of the kings of Persia a
large quantity of purple cloth, which was still rich
and beautiful, though it was one hundred and
ninety years old.
   It was not until the year 1683, that our common
dog whelk was known to furnish the purple dye.
In that year Mr. William Cole, who is described
as a lover of Natural History, heard that a person
living at a sea-port in Ireland had dyed fine linen
of a deep and durable crimson colour ; he, upon
inquiry, ascertained it to have been yielded by this
whelk.    He found that the juice, when taken
from the vein in the neck of the fish, and squeezed
on silk, acquired, on exposure to the sun, a pale
yellowish-green hue ; that it then changed to
blue, finally to a deep purple tint, and that on
washing the cloth with scalding water and soap,
it became of a rich crimson. When the linen was
marked with the juice, it yielded a strong odour,
like that of garlic and asafatida, and as a similar
scent is stated by the ancient writers to have
attended the process of their purple dyeing, this
seemed to confirm the idea that this shell-fish was
at least one of those formerly used for this purpose.
The eggs of this mollusk are very remarkable.
They are found in little clusters, and look like a
number of little vases on stalks, all standing near
each other.    They are of the colour and size of
grains of wheat.
   One other common kind of whelk is well known

        SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS           ANIMALS.    227
— it  is the Netted whelk (Buccinum reticulatum), a
firm shell, much smaller than the preceding species,
though shaped much like them. Its surface is
marked with lines from the base to the summit,
and again with lines around
                               is it,
                                which crossing each
other, gave it  its name.  It of a yellow colour,
often tinted with an ashy grey, and about an inch
long. Several of the different species of rock-shell,
or Murex, are common on our shores. The shells
are somewhat similar to the whelks in form, but
thicker and more wrinkled.       Like the whelks,
they seem destined in an especial manner to pre
vent the bivalve mollusks, and other shell-fish of
their own class, from becoming so abundant as to
fill our seas. They are all carnivorous, and con
sume a large amount of prey, which they get at
by boring holes in the shells of the helpless
creatures destined for their food.   Some of them,
as the Humble murex (Murex despectus), common
on our shores, serve the fishermen for bait.
  Our figure represents   a    very pretty shell, not
uncommon on some of our rocky shores. It       the is
Pelican' s-foot strombus (Strombus pes-pelicanus).
This shell, in its younger state, has not the

 spreading portion, and is often mistaken for that
 of some species of whelk.     Even in a later stage
 of progress, it is again very dissimilar to the fully
 formed shell, and we might pick up three specimens
 so differently formed, as that an inexperienced
 conchologist would deem each to be of a different
 species.   Some of the foreign kinds of Strombus
 are very large and handsome shells, and some
 species are known to have produced pearls.
    Another common univalve may be easily de
 scribed. This is the Tooth-shell (Dentalium entails),
 which is just like a little horn in shape, hollow,
 slightly curved, open at both ends, about an inch
 and a half long, and of a white or yellowish
 colour. Its polished surface is sometimes marked
with rings of yellow or brown. It is found on
sandy shores, placed in a perpendicular position in
 the sand or mud.       Some species of the Tooth-
 shell are found in the seas of almost all countries.
The animal which inhabits this shell is of a conical
form, with an enlongated fleshy foot. It has beau
tiful thread-like tentacula on the back of its neck,
which are its breathing organs, and serve to en
tangle its prey.
    But we must pass on to another order of Mol-
lusca, the cuttle-fish tribe, Cephalopoda, which
exhibit a far higher order of organization than the
animals of any other division of this large class. In
these only are to be found the rudiments of an
internal skeleton. There is a skull containing the
brain, distinct organs of hearing and smelling, and
eyes very superior in structure to that of any other
of the mollusca. The term Cephalopoda signifies
head-footed, the feet of the animal being placed
round the head. These feet are of great strength,

          SHELLS AND MOLLUSCOUS      ANIMALS.     229
and have horny suckers in rows, there being in
the common cuttle-fish no less than two hundred
and forty distinct suckers on each of these flexible
and muscular limbs.        By means of these the
animal seizes its prey, and firmly holds any object
within its grasp. This tenacity of hold renders
some of the species of this group so dangerous,
that   they have power to excite terror in the
breasts of those not easily dismayed by the sight
of the monsters of the deep ; and the prey of the
cuttle-fish can often be extricated from its clutches,
only by cutting away the limbs which encircle it.
   One of the commonest kinds of cuttle-fish, the
Poulpe or Preke (Octopus vulgaris), is a familiar
object on many parts of our coast; but its ap
pearance would not invite to a farther acquaintance.
It has really a fierce and evil look, as, with a fixed
gaze, it stares at us from the sands, moving its
long muscular arms in all directions. Nor would
it be very desirable to come within the grasp of
these arms, for their touch is said to cause pain
and inflammation to the human limb ; and as to
the luckless fish which they encircle, no power of
escape remains to it. Held fast by the suckers, it
is dragged to the mouth, and voraciously eaten.
The mouth of all the species is furnished with a firm
strong beak, like that of a parrot, and with this
the Poulpe breaks into the hard shell of the crab,
rending its coat of mail in pieces, and swallowing
the defenceless prey, watching with its staring
eyes, until another and another crab has come
within its reach and satisfied present hunger.
Among all the molluscous animals the cuttle-fishes
 stand pre-eminent for their voracity. The different
 species of Octopus crawl along the bottom of the

sea,  feeding even upon the largest crustacean
animals, which have no chance in a contest with
them ; and the fishermen of the Mediterranean
dislike them so much, that they regard them almost
as the evil spirits of the waters.     In the summer
season, few of these animals can be drawn up from
the ocean without showing, by their mutilated
condition, the enemies with which they have con
tended.    The early naturalists believed that the
cuttle-fishes entrapped their prey, in some measure,
by stratagem ; and a writer in Loudon's Magazine
of Natural History quotes Holland's Pliny on this
old notion.    Of the cuttle, he says, " And albeit,
otherwise, it be a very brutal and senselesse crea
ture — so foolish withal, that it will swim and come
into a man's hand — yet it seems after a sort to be
witty and wise, keeping of house, and maintaining
a familie ; for all that they can take, they carry
home to their nest.      When they have eaten the
meat of the fishes, they throw the empty shells
out of dores, and lie, as it were, in ambuscade
behind them, to watch and catch fishes that
swimme        thither."   Pliny    also   adds, that the
Cephaloda are
                     " most   desirous    and greedie of
cockles,  muscles, and such-like shell-fish, and in
order to get them they lie in wait to spie when
the said cockles gape wide open, and put in a little
stone between the shells ; but yet beside the flesh
and bodie of the fish, for feare lest if it touched and
felt   it,
        she would cast    it forth again.     Thus they
thieve, and without all danger, and in securitie,
get out the fleshie substance of the meat, to devour
it. The poor cockles draw their shels together
for to clasp them better (as       above said), but all
                                  is
in vaine, for by reason of wedge between, they

subtle and craftie, in this point, those creatures be,
which are otherwise most sottish and senselesse."
Alas ! for these old romances, they have all passed
away as the light of science has increased, and we
must be content to believe that the marvels per
formed by the cuttle-fish, are wrought rather by
dint of his strong arms than his cunning head.
   None of the cephalods are, in our seas, dangerous
to man, but the natives of the shores of the Indian
seas have good reason to regard them with dread,
never going out in a boat without providing them
selves with an axe, by which they may cut away
their formidable arms. Even on the shores of

wherever they appear.        Men who have been
rescued from their grasp have afterwards become
 delirious and died.
    Scarcely more pleasing in appearance than the
 common poulpe, is the Cuttle-fish (Sepia officinalis)
 so frequent on our shores.     Its form is oblong,
 and its colour a dull white, spotted with red
 and brown.      It is about a foot long, and of
 a soft jelly-like substance.    The shell, instead
 of being like that of the other shell-fish, an outer
 covering, is, in this animal, an internal plate, en
 abling the fish by its buoyancy to rise in the
 water, and also giving firmness to its soft and
jelly-like body. This shell       well known to all
                                  is
accustomed to walk on our shores, on many parts
of which  it     is,
                in rough weather, strewn in great
numbers. One side        a white firm shell, but the

shelly nature. This was formerly much used for
pounce, and the ancients attributed to         greatit
medicinal virtues. It      still sometimes powdered
                           is
and used as       dentifrice.

Besides his offensive and destructive weapons — the
strong arms and the hard beak— the cuttle-fish has
also a valuable means of defence.       It too has its
enemies ; for in the economy of nature, one race
of animals serves as prey to another, or earth and
sea would not be large enough to contain them.
The grampus and the cachelot lie in wait for      andit,
the fishermen entrap the cuttle-fishes for bait, and
for purposes of commerce.       When attacked, this
animal can throw out an inky substance, which
darkens the water around, and in its cloud                  it
eludes its pursuers; but this very ink forms the
pigment called sepia, which           so valuable to
                                     is
painters in water colours, and thus becomes an
additional cause of its being sought. This             is   a
very thick brownish-coloured substance.         Cuvier
made his drawings of the cuttle-fish from the sepia
procured by himself from the animal. Even the
contents of the ink-bag of fossil cuttle-fishes retain
their colour and properties and Dr. Buckland has
                           ;
drawings of species now extinct, executed with the
colour taken from the remains of these once living
animals. Our cuttle-fish yields as good       pigment

is naturally of a green colour, but can change itself
to a dull brown hue.      It is so rapid in its flight,
that it is often compared to a flying-fish; while
an allied species has received the name of Sagitta
from its arrow-like movements.         Our common
pen-fish is called by fishermen the sleeve, or hoe-
fish, and is a valuable article for bait. It is said
that one half of the cod of Newfoundland is
caught by its use. On those chilly shores it is
found in abundance in the early part of the month
of August. The Capelin — the fish which is used
for bait when this is not in season — is at this time
not to be found, so that the two kinds of bait alter
nately serve as a supply to the fishermen. Hun
dreds of tons of these animals are thrown up during
the stormy weather on the flat beaches, where they
lie in a decomposing mass, emitting an insufferable
effluvium, and the cod is considered to be in the
best condition when it has fed upon it.
   The beautiful Nautilus, or Argonaut, belongs to
the Cephalod tribe, though its shell is not internal,
but forms for it a light and elegant dwelling.

FEW who have read the records of travels made
by intelligent naturalists in the warmer latitudes
of the world, are quite unacquainted with the
nature and labours of zoophytes. We read of tree
like fabrics, interweaving their branches, and pre
senting the exact image of a stony forest far down
in the depths where the fan-coral waves in the
clear blue sea ; and isles and even continents are
gradually formed by the united labours of myriads
of tiny architects. There the coral rock or reef
rises to the surface of the waters, till the sea throws
up its mud and sand, and forms a level; or till
some volcanic action brings it up to light and to
man ; and the island of the ocean is clothed with
verdure and beauty, and the succulent plant, whose
seeds were borne thither by ocean winds, prepares

                          ZOOPHYTES.                     237
a soil  for the brilliant flower and the stately palm
tree, and soon thousands of living creatures are
creeping among its verdure; and as the winds
play amid the boughs, they stir the plumage, and
awake to song, the birds which have made them
their dwelling-place.           Man comes and finds a
home of beauty, and among its lights and shadows
dwells on the coral isle, nor dreams that he owes
it to the humble architects whose labours were
directed by the will and guidance of the Great
Creator.
     " The turf looks  green where the breakers roll'd,
       O'er the whirlpool ripens the rind of gold ;
       The sea-snatch'd isle is the home of men,
       And mountains exult where the wave hath been."
   There are many, however, who are not aware
that on our own shores, delicate and beautiful
zoophytes, many of them like plants, are brought
up by the waves to their feet continually, and are
lying almost on every beech, or grow among our
rocks, or creep by entangling fibres or sand-
coloured patches, over our sea-weeds, or are
dredged up by the fishermen in multitudes.              It is
true, that the corals of the British coast are few
and inconsiderable, but the skeleton of zoophytes
from which the polypes which made them have
died away, are among its commonest objects ; and
picked up often, and looking like plants, they
puzzle the inexperienced marine botanist, who
wonders that he cannot find their description in
his work on sea-weeds. Nor is it much more
than a century since, that men of science thought
these zoophytes were vegetables, and led by their
plant-bike appearance, their fixed place of growth,

point of attachment, they hesitated not to describe
them as sea-weeds or mosses. They could discover
in their leaf-like expansions, in their graceful
sprays, no similarity to any living creature yet
known as the resident of earth or air, or of the
deep waters ; and they had not as yet unfolded
that page of Nature's book, which, after a series
 of patient and diligent investigation, has revealed
to modern observers a new world of wonders, a
new lesson of Almighty skill and design, as indi
 cative to the thoughtful mind of the work of God,
 and as sublime in its influence over our spirits as
 are the teachings of the stars and suns of the lofty
 skies.
    In  the few pages to which we must limit our
 remarks, little can be done beyond describing some
 few of the commonest zoophytes of our shores, and
 naming such facts respecting them as may awaken
 an interest in the subject, and lead the reader to
 seek for further information.     The zoophytes are
 well described as plant-like animals, the greater
 number of them being also compound animals.
  Thus when we speak of a zoophyte, we usually
 include the stony, or horny, or membranous fabric
  or case, and the polypes, the little living creature
 which dwells in these structures, which make
  them, and are indeed a part of them. In these
  skeletons or polypidoms, it may be that thousands
  of individuals exist, all united by a living thread,
  running through every part, and constituting a
  common circulation.       Different individuals are
  they, and yet the same; their feelings, their in
  terests, and labours, all under the influence of one
  harmonious instinct; and yet each flower-like
  polype having so far independent consciousness,

                       ZOOPHYTES.                 239
 as to  shrink  if  touched, while the other polypes
 seem quite unaffected by the movement, and fear
 less of harm.     It is these cases, or polypidoms,
 which so often attract us on the beach or sands,
 where they lie; blown about by every wind, or
 finding a resting-place in some hollow among the
 stones.   Beautiful horn-coloured sprays, like little
fir-trees, or resembling brittle withered leaves, or
forming crusts on sea-weeds, we see them every
day in our summer rambles on the shore, and per
haps admire their graceful forms, and see how they
are adapted to bend before the wave; but when
we behold them through the microscope, and
discover    their wondrous living inmates, their
active star-like polypes, all instinct with life and
vigour ; their beautiful cup-like, or bell-shaped,
cells; their vesicles, now resembling a pomegra
nate flower, now shaped like some antique model
of a vase, we feel how much there is of beauty
lying unperceived by us even in common things,
and bow in humble reverence before the Almighty
Maker, to whom the little and the great seem
alike deserving of his wondrous skill, alike the
objects of his constant care.
    Interesting as are the permanent fabrics of the
zoophytes, the sea-fans, of far distant seas, the
corals of commerce, or the white stony mushroom-
like corals which greet us in museums; and ele
gant as are the horny branches on our sands, yet
the little polypes, unseen by the naked eye, are
no less beautiful, and present a far more wondrous
structure than the skeletons themselves.      Let us
gather up from the beach one of those horny
sprays, which the wind blows hither and thither,
and place it under a good microscope, and down the

240                   ZOOPHYTES.
side of every branch, or in some species on both
sides, we see a number of little horny cups, some
close to the branch, others raised on stalks, and
constituting, it may be, some hundreds or even
thousands of cells.     If our specimen is fresh and
living, we may see, at the opening of these cups,
the tentacles of the active polypes, arranged like
rays around the centre, looking like so many
daisies or other rayed blossoms, and, in fact,
forming so many mouths and stomachs to feed one
common body, placed within the horny spray, and
each retiring, if alarmed, within its own cell.
Every little thread-like branch, and every stem,
 is hollow; and the pink fleshy substance of the
 zoophyte, like a mere thread, may be seen filling
 up every part, and this is the living portion to
 which so many mouths are furnishing the needful
 food, when moving their active feelers about in
 the water, they catch the living prey which every
 drop of ocean contains.
     If we gather up our specimen in spring-time
 we may in some species, easily, with the naked
 eye, discover a number of clear little vesicles, which
 look like seed-vessels; and are quite distinct from
 the cells in which the polypes reside. These con
 tain the germ of the polypes, and from these pro
  ceed new structures ; each horny fabric originating
 in a single polype. When viewed beneath a micro
  scope, even these minute objects are found to be
  most beautifully varied ; each species having vesi
  cles of a form peculiar to itself.      Thus in one
  common coralline we find them ovate or pear-
  shaped ; in another they resemble an oblong pouch,
  marked with numerous and crested ribs.           One
  species has vesicles reminding us of a swollen pod,

                       ZOOPHYTES.                 241
girded round with from five to nine bands, and
rising into short spines ; another has them covered
over, at top, with a rounded lid.         The germs
within these vesicles, or seed-vessels, are seen by
the aid of the microscope to be very small gra
nules, their surfaces covered with minute hairs
 (ciliae), and actively floating within these vases.
They are extremely irritable, and if they come
in contact with a hair, a grain of sand, or other
 small substance, they are capable of contracting
their bodies into various forms. They whirl about
 in constant motion, until they select some point of
 attachment, where they fix themselves, and thence,
 in course of time, arises the goodly spray which
 delights our eye.
     Zoologists arrange the zoophytes into two large
 classes; the Anthozoa, which have symmetrical
 bodies, capable in every part of contraction, with
 a single aperture for food; and the Polyzoa,
 sometimes called Bryozoa, whose bodies are un-
 symmetrical, and incapable of contraction. The
 Anthozoa contain the larger animals; but those
 forming the polyzoa, have the more perfect organ
 ization, and are in a higher scale of animal life.
     A few common examples of the first class, to be
  described, will, by the aid of our engravings, be at
  once recognised by every one accustomed to the
  shores of our island, as objects long familiar.
      A very frequent and pretty zoophyte, is that
  called the Small Coryne (Coryne pusilla), which
  may be found on old shells, or on stones or sea
  weeds, between the tide marks.       It differs as to
  size, but is not often more than an inch in height,
  adhering to the shell or other substance on which
  it grows, by means of a fibre, which creeps over it.

With this fibre the zoophyte    commences, and an
erect stem rises, from which shoot branches in all
            directions, each terminated with a little
            fleshy shining red knob or head, on
            which are a number of short thick
            tentacula or arms, which are very
            vigorous, ever moving up and down to
            catch such prey as comes within their
            reach ; and each tipped with a little
            globular end. These are the polypes ;
             the mouths of the fleshy living thread
which runs through every portion of the zoophyte.
The tentacula, though always moving, yet do so
very slowly; and it is most interesting to watch
the gradual motions of this little creature. It may
be preserved for some time in salt water, if the
liquid be frequently changed.      The stem of this
coryne is horny, tubular, somewhat clear, wrinkled
and ringed.     Occasionally this zoophyte is para
sitic on other species. When growing on another
coralline, the Tubularia, it sometimes gathers all
about the stalks, covering them with little horny
threads, not thicker than such as are used for sew
ing. It is also itself sometimes covered with small
parasitic sea- weeds, composed of slender threads ;
so that, Dr. Johnston remarks of     it,  that he has
seen specimens so completely overrun with this,
that they appeared, under the microscope, nearly
as mossy and glandulous as the stalks of the moss-
rose.    Our figure represents the coralline in its
natural size.
   There is   agenus of zoophytes called Tubularia,
from the tubular-like pipes of which they are com
posed. The fibres of this family are all hollow and
erect, and a   soft pulp runs through them; while

at the extremity the fleshy polypes, surrounded with
their thread-like arms, protrude like a starry flower.
Our figure describes the Tubu
lar Coralline (Tubularia indi-
visa), a very common zoophyte
on shells and stones, from deep
water; and it may often be
found entangled among sea
weeds, cast up by the waves
on the beach.      Many who are
accustomed to pick up sea
weeds, and other marine ob
jects, are perplexed by this
zoophyte, as it seems a bundle
of fibres, which, at first ap
pearance,     resemble     a  root
torn from some sea-plant. On
closely examining     it, however,
even without      a   microscope,
the hollow pipe-like nature      is
 clearly evident.    Ellis compared    to oaten straws
                                      it
 with the joints cut off and except that the diameter
                       ;
 of the tubesis   often smaller, this well describes it.
 In fine specimens they are quite as large as an oaten
 straw, but more commonly they are not larger than
the stalk of primrose. These tubes are of the colour
            a
and texture of thin horn, sometimes divided at
the base, and twisted into serpent-like forms and
                                                ;
they are occasionally ten or twelve inches high.
A reddish pink pulp, which unites all this singular
family of polypes into one animal, runs through
 the tubes, from the open ends of which issue the
 polypes.    A scarlet knob, forming itself above
 into kind of proboscis,
     a                      is  surrounded by  a  num
 ber of short scarlet tentacula and at the base of
                                 ;

the body, is another circle of much longer ones,
and thirty or forty in number.         None of our
common zoophytes are better for examination,
when picked up from the shore, than this. In
scarcely any of the others, unless brought up by the
dredge, and carried home immediately to be placed
in salt water, can we discern the living wonders.
A few hours on the beach will usually deprive
them of life. But this coralline, if placed in a
tumbler of water, will often, some hours after, ex
hibit its living flowers in full vigour; and he
must indeed be indifferent to grace and beauty,
who could look upon them without interest.
After being thus kept for some time in the house,
its decline is apparent ; and the starry head drops,
as would the daisy flower, if some ill wind snapped
it from its stem. Let but an interval of a week
or more pass over   it,  however, and again  a  new
head appears, though in   a   less perfect condition
than the original one. The stem       always length
                                     is
ened by the new formation   ;   and numerous heads
may also be produced by cutting the tubes into
several pieces.     Thus twenty-two heads were
derived, in the course of five hundred and fifty
days, from the sections of single stem. A species
                          a
of Tubularia (Tubularia dumortierii), growing not
in clusters, but in unbranched solitary tubes of
horny colour, and unwrinkled and narrowed at
the base, seems somewhat like the last-named
species in miniature, but       it    not common.
                                     is
There are, besides, two other species of the genus,
and the engraving will sufficiently convey an idea
of the general appearance of the whole, to lead to
their recognition as members of this family. The
graceful Tubularia (Tubularia gracilis),   is  often

                      ZOOPHYTES.                 245
parasitic in tufts upon our common Tubular Coral
line.    A beautiful species of the Indian seas
 (Tubipora musica), resembles a cluster of organ-
pipes, with several transverse floors or stages run
 ning through it.     The pipes are of a rich red
 colour, and the polypes of loveliest crimson hue,
 with arms of bright green.
    There is a curious British zoophyte belonging to
 the Tubulariadae, which, though not frequent, de
 mands notice from its great beauty.       The Cory-
 morpha nutans is about four and a half inches long,
 and its stem about half an inch in diameter. When
 young, part of its stem is enclosed in a thin horny
 tube, which afterwards disappears : it grows rooted
 in the sand, and has a clear white stem, delicately
 tinged with pink, and pinkish brown lines running
 down it.     A head terminating in a pink trunk,
 and surrounded by tentacles of pure white tint,
 above which are placed numerous orange-coloured
 processes, completes this beautiful animal. Forbes
 and Goodsir thus describe an individual which they
 found in the Bay of Stromness, Orkney : " When
 placed in a vessel of sea-water, it presented the
 appearance of a beautiful flower.    Its head grace
 fully nodded, bending the upper part of its stem.
 It waved its long tentacula to and fro at pleasure,
 but seemed to have no power of contracting them.
  It could not be regarded by any means as an
  apathetic animal, and its beauty excited the admi
  ration of all who saw it."
     But turning from this rarer beauty, to some
  common species, known to all familiar with the
  sea-side, we proceed to the family of Sertularia,
  many species of which are generally taken for sea
  weeds.    Our engraving will enable the reader to

identify one of the most frequent, the common
Sea-fir(Sertularia abietina); its elegant sprays clus
tering often upon shells and stones, or snapped off
by wind or wave and thrown upon the shore, has
met the eye of every rambler there, who observes
the objects around him. It grows upon any kind
of shell, and it is seldom that oysters can be
dredged up from the sea, without having some of
their number adorned with this graceful coralline.
It rises upright like a little fir-tree, or it resembles

 a branch   of the plume-like brake of our woods and
heaths in shape, and tiny shells often hang about
its branches.       It is of a horn colour, becoming
more clear and transparent in drying, and placed
in the herbarium it seems
like a branch made of amber.
It varies in height from four
to twelve inches. The stem
is slightly zigzag, and some
times the branches have
other branches on them.
Even when seen under a
common magnifying glass,
 such as naturalists usually
have about them, we can dis
 cover in the little teeth which
 are adown the branches, a
 minute aperture, which is
 the opening of the polype
 cells, the little tube or flask-
 shaped dwellings of the
 animals.       In the winter AMAOXIFODRRAICCHOFSEA-FIR.
 time the little vesicles or bladders containing the
 germs,    are thickly scattered over the branches.
  Sometimes the sea-fir is tinged with a red hue,
 which in some cases remains on the shining stems
 of the dried specimens.        Other species of Sertu-
 laria are also occasionally tinged with this hue,
 though the cause of this peculiarity is undis
 covered.
     Very often,      on  examining the Knobbed, or
  Serrated, or Bladder Fucus, we find growing on
  its frond the horny shoots, scarcely larger than a
  sewing thread, of the zoophyte called the Sea-oak
  Coralline (Sertularia pumila), which received its

familiar name from its frequency on the bladder
fucus, known in old times by the name of Sea-oak.
The shoots often cover a large portion of the sea
weed, originating from a slender hollow thread,
which is a link between them all.       This small
coralline is very common, being sometimes found
on other species of our marine plants.    Few who
look at this little horny thread, would think that
it was the production and home of innumerable
living flower-like polypes, each provided with
fourteen arms, by means of which it can catch prey
for the food of the community ; and which, though
low in the scale of animal organization, yet seems
to have been created for active enjoyment.
   Another delicate and elegant coralline, often
found on old shells on the stems of Tangle, and
also as a parasite on other zoophytes, is the Lily
or Pomegranate-flowering      Coralline (Sertularia
rosacea).   It is of a white or pale horn colour,
very slender, and only one or two inches high.
Its vesicles are most elegantly formed, and Ellis
compared them to a lily or pomegranate flower
just opening.
   There is a pretty zoophyte, so common, that if
our engraving or description convey a just idea of
it, every one frequenting our shores will remem
ber to have seen     it, perhaps to have placed  it
among  a   collection of sea- weeds, or brought some
of its delicate tufts home as an ornament for the
mantel-piece.      It has the same horny texture,
the same plant-like appearance, as all the other
species of this interesting family of zoophytes.
The common Sea-hair (Sertularia operculata) grows
in long tufts of fine horny threads, on several of
the sea-weeds, but especially on the Digitate
Tangle. It       sometimes even twelve inches high,
                is

                            ZOOPHYTES.               249
but more generally the tufts vary in height from
four to five inches. Ellis remarks of      "This
                                               it,
very neat and most regularly formed coralline,

teeth placed exactly opposite each pair seems to

be jointed into the next.       The slender branches
grow in tufts like branches of hair." Sometimes,
when of  a   pale horn colour, and dripping with
the sea-water,     looks almost like tufts of silver
thread. There   is it  little cover or lid to the vesi
                        a
cles of this species, and hence its scientific name,
from operculum,   a  lid. In summer time the tufts
are covered with these little clear vesicles.      Our
figure represents them both in their natural size and
magnified appearance.        The sea-hair is  generally
placed among our finer sea-weeds, in those little
landscapes sold in the shops in sea-coast towns.
   An elegant zoophyte on shells in deep water,
called the Bottle-brush Coralline (Thuiaria Thuia),

its name from the fishermen on the northern coast
of England. It is common there, particularly
about Scarborough.     Another is called Squirrel's
Tail (Sertularia argentea), because it is so like the
tail of our woodland animal ; but as neither of
these is a very general coralline, we will proceed
to one well known to every one at all used to sea
side productions.     This is an elegant species

                      ZOOPHYTES.                  251
familiarly known     by the name of Sickle-beard
(Plumularia falcata) . It is common every where,
oil shells and stones, or often torn from its native
spot of growth, lies about the shore, becoming the
sport of every wind and wave, when we may find
it lying with its stems twisted into diffuse and
distant coils, like a lady's ringlet.   On a slender
spiral stem, usually about four or five inches high,
though in extraordinary specimens attaining the
height of twelve inches, are feathery branches
with little branchlets, about as thick as a common
needle, and a quarter of its length.         The cells
which contain the polypes are not on the main
stems, but on the branches and branchlets, where
they are placed down the side in rows of little
teeth, which bend inward like a sickle. Our en
graving represents them in their magnified con
dition, and the coralline in its natural size.
   The Podded Coralline (Plumularia cristata),
though not so general as the sickle-beard, yet is
not an uncommon object on our sea-side stones
and shells.     It is found too sometimes on sea
weeds, especially on that common one, the podded
halidrys.    It has an erect instead of a spiral
stem, and is usually smaller than the last-named
kind, and being generally of a deeper yellow
colour it is much prettier.       Ellis compares the
polype cells to the flowers of the lily of the valley,
and they are indeed like our favourite spring flower,
being shaped like bells, with the rim cut into about
eight equal segments, while in front there is a
strong spiny process, which does not project
beyond the cell.     The vesicles, or little bladders,
plainly seen in this coralline with the naked eye,
are described by Dr. Johnston, when seen under

252                   ZOOPHYTES.
a magnifying    glass, as resembling a swollen pod
girded round with from five to nine cristated ribs
or bands.    A quotation given also by that valu
able writer from another, will here show how
deeply interesting are these little common pro
ductions of our seas, to those who have carefully
examined them.      " Each plume," says Mr. Lister,
in reference to a specimen of the podded coralline,
"might comprise from 400 to 500 polypi, and a
specimen of no unusual size, before me, has twelve
plumes, with certainly not fewer cells on each
than the larger number mentioned : thus giving
6,000 polypes as the tenantry of a single polypidom.
Now many such specimens, all united too by a
common fibre, and all the offshoots of one common
parent, are often located on one sea-weed, the site
then of a population, which nor London nor Pekin
can rival.   But Plumularia cristata is a small spe
cies, and there are single specimens of Plumularia
falcata, or Sertularia argentea, of which the family
may consist of 80,000, or 100,000 individuals!"
 Surely if we could gain, here below, any idea of
the infinite Creator, it would be when we con
 sider wonders like these, and were it not that they
are facts susceptible of actual demonstration, such
statements would demand as great a degree of
faith as even the sublime declarations of the mys
teries of Revelation.
    A very pretty coralline is common on the sea
 weeds which grow near low-water mark.           It is
 often parasitic on the fronds of the tangle, or
podded halidrys, though not confined to them.
 Sometimes its tiny knotted roots creep about the
 broad tangle leaves, like a regular piece of net
 work, and, as Mr. W. Thompson has remarked,

                      ZOOPHYTES.                    253
 " the meshes are of different sizes, with their junc
tions tied in a knot as it were by fairy fingers."
From each knot, in due time, springs the knotted
thread coralline (Laomedea geniculata).            This
 zoophyte is about an inch in height, very little
branched, and sometimes not at all so, of a very
clear white colour, now and then tinted with red.
 Minute as is this animal, it presents under the
microscope an exceed
ing beauty.     Its po
lypes may be seen, in
a fresh specimen, pro
truding like   so many
daisy flowers, and in
summer time when the
vesicles are plentifully
scattered about, we see
objects which appear
like antique vases,
sculptured into most
graceful and elegant
form. This coralline
is often found on the
common grass-wrack
of our shores.
    Almost as common
as this, is the Gelati
nous Laomedea (Lao
medea gelatinosa), one
of our most elegant
zoophytes. Our figure
represents part of a
specimen about eight
inches long, which was
picked up on the beach at Dovor, but      it is seldom

more than three or four inches long, with a stem
 about as thick as small twine.   Figure g describes,
 however, the more common appearance of this
 zoophyte.
             " It occurs thus," says Dr. Johnston,
 "in  Berwick Bay, growing gregariously on the
sides and under surfaces of stones, lying in shallow
pools between tide marks, and seemingly giving
a preference to shores that contain an impure and
brackish water.     The shoots are all connected
with one another by the radicle fibre which creeps
in an irregular manner on the rock, rarely above
an inch in height, simple or sparingly branched,
consisting of a single tube of a light horny colour,
ringed above the origin of the long twisted thread
like stalks on which the polype cells are raised."
The vesicles are urn-shaped.
   Both the species of Laomedea are remarkable
for the luminous properties which appear to be
more or less exhibited by all the transparent

                      ZOOPHYTES.                 255
zoophytes.  Dr. Johnston, as well as other writers,
quotes Mr. Hassall's interesting remarks on this
subject. Speaking of the phosphoric light emitted
by corallines, Mr. Hassall remarks, "This fact     I
first discovered in a specimen of Laomedea gela-
tinosa, and subsequently in a great variety of
other species.   If  a portion of    it,
                                      adhering to the
sea-weed to which     it   attached, be taken from
                           is
the water, and agitated,    agreat number of bright
phosphorescent sparks will be emitted; these
sparks proceed from each of the denticles of the
coralline containing polype, and the phenomenon
is  equally apparent, whether the specimen be in
or out of the water." In another work this writer
adds, I " lately had an opportunity of beholding
this novel and interesting sight of the phos
phorescence of zoophytes, to great advantage, when
on board one of the Devonshire trawling-boats
which frequent this coast. The trawl was raised
at midnight, and great quantities of corallines were
entangled in the meshes of the network, all shin
ing like myriads of the brightest diamonds." Mr.
Hassall also states, that once each week he re
ceived from the master of      trawling vessel on the
                                 a
Dublin coast, a large hamper of zoophytes in the
fresh state.    In the evening these were taken
into a   darkened room, in which several persons
were assembled to witness this beautiful exhibition.
"I   then," says this writer, "used to gather up
with my hands as much of the contents of the
hamper asI    could manage, and tossing them about
in all directions, thousands of little stars shone
out brightly from the obscurity, exhibiting a spec
tacle, the beauty of which, to be appreciated, must
be seen, and one which       has been the lot of but
                            it

few persons as yet to have looked upon. Entangled
among the corallines were also minute luminous
annelides, which added their tiny fires to the ge
neral exhibition."     The light given out by the
polypes seems caused by irritation.
   There is a beautiful little coralline, called by
Ellis the Small-climbing coralline, with bell-shaped
 cups (Campanularia volubilis), which creeps, like
 so many threads, over sea-weeds, and often also
over other corallines, and which is well worth
observation with the microscope.     Its polype cells
are graceful little bells, and so beautiful is its
construction, that each little cup has, at its base,
a delicate joint or hinge, which is thought to have
been designed, by the great Creator, for the pur
pose of enabling this delicate and fragile creature
to bend before the force of a wave, which else
would dash it into atoms : but we must pass by
this lovely little object to some more easily de
scribed, and which cannot fail to attract the notice
of every passer-by.
   The horny, hollow -jointed shoots of the Lob-
ster's-horn coralline, or Sea-beard (Antennularia
antennina), lie about in summer-time, upon every
shore.    They have been rent away from their
place of growth on the stones which lie among
the sea-sands, or perchance from the sands them
selves, on which they often grow in erect clusters.
The polypidoms of this species are straight shoots,
growing together in a cluster of about a dozen in
number, sometimes as much as seven or eight
inches in height, of a clear yellow horn colour;
and the fisherman knows them well, for they
crowd upon the oyster-shells in profusion.       The
shoots are surrounded with hair-like branch

                     ZOOPHYTES.                257
lets, in numerous whorls, a whorl to each arti
culation.  The number of these branchlets in
each whorl varies from five to nine; and Mr.
Hassall has remarked, that in the same specimen,
the number usually remains the same throughout.
When magnified, these hair-like processes present
the form of sickles, and bend in, towards the main

  stem.    The specimens which are found on the
  beach, after rough weather, are generally much
  broken, and their whorling branchlets often torn
  away; so that the zoophyte, in that condition,
  more nearly resembles the horns or antennae of a
  lobster than when perfect.
     The branched Antennularia (Antennularia ra-
  mosa) differs little from the foregoing species,
  except in the fact of its having branched instead
  of straight shoots. It is found on old shells and
  stones, in deep water; and most visitors of the
  sea-side have seen it lying about the shore. Some
 writers think the two species should be considered
 but one.
     As Ellis has observed, the greatest variety of
 corallines are to be found on what are generally
 called rock oysters, or upon those beds of oysters
 for some time disused or neglected.           In places
 like these, they sometimes cluster in such quan
 tities as to look like little fairy groves.   If we can
 procure them immediately after being dredged
 up, and, taking them carefully from the oysters,
 place them in dishes full of sea-water, they will
 soon recover from their temporary alarm, and we
 shall shortly see the polypes expanding their ten-
 tacula fearlessly, like living flowers. Observations
 are best made in summer, as in winter the ani
mals become torpid and contracted.
    It would not be often that a dredge of oysters
would come up, during the summer season, without
having, on some of the shells, that pretty and
common species, the Herring-bone coralline (Ha-
lecium halecinum) which grows on stones and

zoophyte is of a deep yellow hue; but it soon

it assumes a dingy brownish colour, like that of
wet sand.      It is very brittle, and irregularly
branched, and from four to ten inches in height,
growing upright from numerous fibres matted
together like a piece of sponge.
   A large number of these pretty plant-like
zoophytes must be left unnoticed here ; nor shall
we linger long over the division of the large class
Anthozoa, called the Asteroida.         Zoophytes of
this order consist of a calcareous or horny axis,
or internal skeleton, surrounded by the fleshy
parts of the compound body. Our British species
are all natives of the deeper parts of the sea, and
cannot, therefore, be considered as common ob

jects of our shores; though several of them are
 well known to our fishermen, and also to the in
 habitants of sea-side towns, from being frequently
 brought up in the dredge.      It is in this division
that we find those beautiful sea-fans which most
 of us have seen among the curiosities brought
home from the tropical seas, and which looking
to us like so many stony sprays of sea-weed, yet
convey little idea of their beauty in their native
haunts.     Waving about, under the emerald-
green waters, like willow-trees before the wave,
bending in most graceful attitudes, and coloured
with brilliant hues of violet and purple, and paler
blue, they may well attract the young voyager
who stoops over the side of the vessel to look down
into the deep ; and we wonder not that he hastens
to the coral reef, where they are waving, and re
turns with bleeding feet from their sharp ridges,
rich with the spoils of the sea.       Cuvier, in his
''Theory of the Earth," describes the beauty of
these lithophyta, which abound in the seas of the
tropics, and are propagated with great rapidity,
their tree-like forms being variously interwoven,
and often forming frightful snares for navigators.
We have four British species of these Sea-fans
 (Gorgonia), and one of them is common on the
Devonshire coast; but they are far inferior in
beauty of colour, as well as in size, to the natives
of warmer latitudes.      Our fishermen may well
call them sea-shrubs, for few would look upon
them without deeming them some plant, encrusted
with lime. The sea-fan branches out into a com
plete network, the whole mass of which is or
ganized and living, and receives its food and
means of increase from the food abounding in

every drop of ocean, and gathered in for the sup
port of the whole body, by the vigorous polypes,
whose arms, expanded like flowers, convey the
prey into their stomachs.         Yet the axis of this
sea-fan is not, as we might at first suppose, of a
stony nature; it is horny, and covered with a
fleshy substance or crust, the living link which
unites the numerous polypes into one harmonious
whole.    As this crust dries, it becomes friable and
porous ; and it is in this state that we see it when we
look at the sea-fan in the museum, or place it in our
houses for ornament. Nor is the flat and fan-like
shape of the zoophyte a mere accidental figure.
The prevalence of this form in submarine vege
tation long since attracted the attention of our
great naturalist Ray, who, in his work on the
"Wisdom of God in Creation," thus remarks on
it — " That the motion of the water descends to
  :
a good depth,   I provefrom those plants that grow
deepest in the sea, because they all generally
grow flat, in the manner of a fan, and not with
branches on all sides, like trees, which is so con
trived by the providence of nature, for that the
edges of them do, in that posture, with most ease
cut the water flowing to and fro ; and should the
flat side be objected to the stream, it would soon
be turned edgewise, by the force of      because in
                                        it,
that site it  doth least resist the motion of the
water whereas did the branches of these plants
      :
grow round, they would be thrown backward and
forward every tide. Nay, not only the herbaceous
and woody submarine plants, but also the litho-
phyta themselves, affect this manner of growing,
as
 I    have observed in various kinds of coral and
pori."

   Then there are, in our seas, the Sea-pens,
shaped so much like our writing implements, that
if our fishermen brought them up from the mud
in which they are sticking, the reader would at
once recognise them. There is but one British
species known, and this the fishermen call the Cox
comb, for it has a broader expansion than some
other kinds, and consequently has a less perfect
resemblance than some others to the feathered
part of a quill.     The Phosphorescent Sea-pen
(Pennatula phosphorea) is about three or four inches
long, of a purplish red colour, tapering, and naked
at the lower end, and feathered about half-way
down, with closely set pinnae.       Here, along the
margins, are placed the polype cells, and hence
may be seen their clear white arms, eight in
number, protruding themselves, in search of prey.
The pinnae are curved backwards, and move up
and down, sometimes altogether, sometimes with
separate motion, so that this zoophyte has been
said by some zoologists to have the same oar-like
motion as that given to fishes by their fins. This
lovely object is remarkably phosphorescent, as
are all the species of Pennutalida.     It appears to
be luminous when it chooses, and apparently only
emits its light when under some irritation.        Dr.
 Johnston calls the zoophytes     " Will-o'-the-wisps
of the sea, put out to frighten feeble assailants.
                                                     "
When plunged in fresh water, this beautiful sea-
pen scatters sparks in all directions.
   The Virgularia, which the fishermen call Sea-
rush (Virgularia mirabilis), is a less frequent
marine production, but is found on the eastern and
north-eastern shores of Scotland, as well as on
some other parts of our coasts.    It varies in length

from six to ten inches, and is like a quill, stripped
of its feathers.
   But quitting rarer for familiar objects, we must
proceed to that common zoophyte of our coast,
familiarly called Dead Men's fingers, or Dead
Men's toes, because it is sometimes found divided
into lobes somewhat re
sembling those parts of
the human frame. The
Alcyonium digitatum is
very often a shapeless
mass, and sometimes a
mere crust on an oyster
shell.   It  is of a deep
orange -colour, with a
tough, leathery skill,
filled inside with a jelly-
like substance. Its first
appearance is ratherun-
inviting, the more espe
cially, as, even in its
fresh state, its odour is
most disgusting ; yet if
we take it home, and
place it in a tumbler of sea-water, we shall soon
become not only reconciled to     it,
                                    but filled with
admiration at its beauty.      Gradually, the mass
imbibes the fluid, and swells to        larger size;
 and, looking down closely upon         it, a
                                         we find its
 surface thickly scattered over with starry figures,
 divided into eight rays, from which emerge the
 eight tentacles of each polype, all moving about
 with great activity, and forming  a most beautiful
 assemblage of animal-flowers, arranged round      a

 clear cylindrical tube or column.   This zoophyte
may be found on almost any part of our coasts,
adhering to stones or shells brought up from deep
water, and in some places is so common, that if
a dredge of oysters were to be brought up from
the deep, not a shell or stone but would exhibit
one or more of the conspicuous tufts of this in
teresting zoophyte.
    Perhaps the zoophytes best known as such to
visitors at the coast, are the beautiful Sea Ane
mones, which offer their loveliness to every eye,
and need no microscope to reveal their tints or
forms. Clustered by thousands on sea-side rocks
or sands, adorning the sides of rocky pools, with
flowers which resemble marigolds or China-asters
in their form, but which are brighter in their co
lours than any flowers which our garden can show;
redder than roses, of richer purple than the violet,
and wearing the rainbow hues of the gorgeous
cactus flower, which the painter in vain essays to

lated to attract our notice than are these living
flowers.     There they grow —
       " Rooted and slumb'ring through a dream of life,"
making a little isle of beauty of the rock where
they abound, waiting, with the dark, lank sea
weeds, the return of the tide; and perchance
awaking in the mind of many a poet such thoughts
as arose in that of Southey, when he described
them, in his poem of " Thalaba :" —
      " Meantime, with fuller reach and stronger swell,
            Wave after wave advanced     :

We may find          these sea anemones on almost all
parts of our coast; but we must not go out to
look for them when the shades of evening are
soon about to gather over the ocean, or when the
bright moon is silvering over the waters. They
delight in sunshine; and their clear white, or orange,
or scarlet, or pink arms, moving about to catch
the food within their reach, can be seen only
under the cloudless sky.              Beautiful as they are
beneath our summer noon, yet they cannot com
pare with the species peculiar to those warmer
latitudes, in which every tint brightens into more
glowing hues.          When in a state of repose, the
sea anenomes lose all that is attractive in their
appearance.         They assume the form of a wrinkled

266                 ZOOPHYTES.
fleshy cone, or they lengthen themselves into a
flabby cylinder, with only a small aperture at the
summit.     The surface of the cone is in some
cases smooth, in others covered over with little
bead-like prominences.      Sometimes it is glossy,
like silk, or it may be covered, as with a coat of
velvet.   Some of these animals encase themselves
with bits of broken sand or gravel, or other things
within their reach, making for themselves a coat of
mail, to compensate for the want of that protection
which is given to some polypes by their horny or
calcareous polypidoms.     It is not easy to detach
them from the rock without injury ; but, by in
serting the blade of a knife carefully under them,
we may unloose them from their hold, and bring
them away, and long preserve them.           By the
next day they will have recovered from the shock,
and in the dish of salt water we may see their
numerous tentacula, surrounding the central disc
in clear and lustrous beauty. By changing the
water frequently, they will live for many months
in-doors, though, after a time, we perceive that
they become more languid.        Sometimes we may
see these large polypes,      these sea -anemones,
drawing in water through their tentacles, until
they become wonderfully distended, and their
rays are thus rendered more clear and beautiful
and plump by imbibing the water.          Sometimes
our sea-anemone becomes so distended as to lose
all its symmetry, and the stomach lies like a clear
bladder over the sides of its circular form, in large
lobes.   After a while, the water thus imbibed is
projected in jets, or in a stream, from several of
the tentacula ; and Dr. Johnston remarks, that if
the contraction is sudden and strong, the water

                     ZOOPHYTES.                    267
may be thrown out with so much force as to rise
to the height of at least a foot.
   To look down upon these flowers, one would
 deem them the most helpless of living creatures.
The water, with its myriads of tiny insects, seems
to afford their proper nutriment, and none would
guess, to glance at them, that they could possibly
kill, and swallow crabs and shell-fish larger than
themselves. But the great Creator, when he made
them, furnished them all, helpless as they seem,
with the means of securing their appropriate nu
triment. They possess a poisonous secretion which
soon extinguishes life in the animal which comes
near them, and which can make us conscious of its
power to sting.      This poison is not of equal
strength in all the species ; in some, it is sufficient
to cause only a slight sensation of tingling in the
fingers which have touched the anemone ; in others,
the sensation is more of a smarting or burning
nature. It appears, too, that different persons are
variously affected, even by touching the same
individual.   The author had placed in a vessel of
sea water, a fine specimen of the Fig Marigold Sea
Anemone (Actinia mesembryanthemum), which she
was accustomed to touch many times during the
day.    The tentacula closed immediately around
the intruding finger, producing only a slight ting
ling. Her surprise was great at finding that the
same anemone, on being touched by another person,
communicated a more powerful sensation, which
her friend assured her was felt up the whole of
the arm.    More than twenty persons touched this
anemone, and the writer was amused by observing
how variously they were affected; some being
only slightly tingled, while others started back as

                      ZOOPHYTES.
if stung by a nettle. The poison has a great effect
on the inferior animals. Woe to the crab or the
lobster which strays near the innocent looking
animal-flower : strong and active as he seems, he
has little chance of escape.        Slowly, and with
apparent caution, the zoophyte seizes his prey,
and crowding around all his brilliant petal-like
arms, drags it into his stomach.      He is swallowed
whole ; and so much of him as can be converted
by the animal into nutriment, digests there ; while
again the anemone turns out of its mouth the shell,
or harder and indigestible portion of his victim.
Mr. Cocks remarks of one British species (Anthea
cereus),
          " The fish which has been so unfortunate
as to be embraced by the tentacula of this ane
mone for a few minutes, loses its activity, becomes
 stupid, the eyes injected, and death soon closes the
 scene.    In August, 1845,     I removed from the
stomach of an individual, a partly digested fish,
nearly four inches in length ; and        I  have fre
quently taken from the stomachs of others, crabs,
two and a quarter inches in diameter."        Another
writer once remarked one of those mistakes in in
stinct, which animals sometimes exhibit, in the
case of our most sagacious little insect, the bee.
It hovered over the anemone, which was just then
only covered by a rim of water, and evidently mis
taking it for some gay marigold or other blossom,
the luckless insect darted through the water to
the mouth of the polype.      It struggled to get free
for some time, but was held down till being
drowned, it was swallowed.         Hungry creatures,
too, are these anemones.      A little bee would not
serve one of them for his dinner, for delicate and
frail as they seem, three or four mussels are only

                     ZOOPHYTES.                   269
sufficient for a single meal, and they are all dis
solved before the anemone casts forth the useless
shell.
    Dicquemare, by changing the sea-water of the
vessel in which they were held, kept sea anemones
for some years, and tried numerous experiments
with them. He says that they foretell changes
of weather as surely as the barometer. Even
when kept within doors, they are sensible of at
mospheric changes long before these are evident
to our less acute sensibilities; and that great
naturalist thinks that they might be kept in sea
water, daily renewed, and might serve the mariner
as a sea barometer.
    The Actiniae are not easily injured. They pos
sess, in common with other creatures low in the
scale of animal organization, a great tenacity of
life, and a wonderful power of renewing any muti
lated portion.     They may be immersed in hot
water, or frozen ; their arms may be cut off, their
very bodies cut into two or more pieces, yet, give
them time, and again we find them forming into
a circular body, and little arms growing out afresh
on the portion from which they had been severed ;
while the rays, in the course of a few weeks,
again form themselves into a living flower. Eyes
they have none, and yet not a cloud can pass over
the blue sky on a summer's day — a cloud which
would hardly warn the scarlet pimpernel to close
against coming rain —but the anemone shrinks as
if injured ; and so sensitive is it to the presence of
fresh water, that a plunge of only a few minutes
destroys it.   Rooted as they are to the rock, yet
they can, at will, unfasten themselves from their
attachments, and creep about over its surface,

270                  ZOOPHYTES.
experiencing, doubtless, a sense of enjoyment,
when, in their rapacity, they devour their prey.
The Actiniae all grow singly, but the allied family
of Zoanthus, consists of a number of small animal
flowers, seated upon one fleshy base, and connected
together by it.
   The bodies of our British sea anemones are, in
some, of a deep scarlet tint; in others, of green
hue, like the young spring leaf ; or of dull olive
green, or of the pale hue of the green sea.       Some
are liver coloured or of dark claret, or of all shades
of red or buff; and for whiteness, some of them
rival the snow itself. One of the commonest
species is the Fig Marigold Sea Anemone (Actinia
mesembryanthemum), which may be found on almost
any of the shores of our island, where clustering
rocks or stones can afford it a habitation.         The
older French writers called it La plus petite des
orties de mer ; and a nettle it is in its stinging
powers, but they are not so pungent as in some
other species, though some writers still call it the
small red sea-nettle.       Its body  is,  when fully
grown, about an inch or an inch and     a   half in dia
meter, forming  a   half globe in shape. It of dull
                                             is
liver colour or olive green, sometimes marked with
blue and greenish lines. The base which surrounds
the hemisphere like a ruffle, has sometimes, though
not always, a bright blue rim around its edge,
 and  it   isoccasionally streaked with red. The
 arms are long, and usually of the same colour as
 the body, but paler and clearer in tint. Around
the central aperture, and just within its margin,
 are twenty-five little blue tubercles, which resemble
 so many turquoise beads.        This species expands
 only when covered with water.

                       ZOOPHYTES.                     271
    Another frequent species, and one which adorns
 the rocks and reefs about our southern shores, and
 makes them like a blooming garden, is the lovely
 tinted Purple Sea Anemone (Actinia crassicornis).
 Not that it always exhibits the colour which gives
 it its familiar name, for it varies much in hue. In
 one of its varieties it is of brilliant scarlet, studded
 with spots of a paler colour. Now we see it revel
 ling in the subdued sunshine, enjoying its warmth,
 yet screening itself from its glare in the crevice of
 the rock or under the shelter of some large stqne,
 and we pause to admire its delicate cream tint or
its sulphur-coloured beauty. A little further on, and
our sea anemone displays itself in greenish hue,
with orange stripes ; or marbled with red and white,
would lead the inexperienced naturalist to believe
that he has found some other species. The tenta-
cula are very often, indeed almost always, marked
with white and red rings; but sometimes, when
the body of this actinia is of a pale flesh or cream
 colour, there are no rings on the tentacula, but
they are of the same hue as the body.           The body
in this species is rough, with minute glandular ex
crescences.
    To look at the     sea anemones      when they are
closed, or to put our finger on their cold slimy coats,
one would not be very ready to suggest the pro
posal of making a meal of them, yet in tropical
countries they are much used as food, and a beau
tiful species, with crimson tentacles, which is
abundant on the shores of the Mediterranean, is a
favourite dish of Italian epicures.        Our common
Purple Sea Anemone (Actinia crassicornis) is said,
by the Abbe Dicquemare, to be preferable to any
other for the table. " Being boiled in sea-water,"

272                   ZOOPHYTES.
says this writer of these polypes,
                                     " they acquire a
firm and palatable consistence, and then may be
eaten with any kind of sauce.        They are of an
inviting appearance, of a light shivering texture,
and of a soft white, and reddish hue. Their smell
is not unlike that of a warm crab or lobster." After
all, they would not, to any of us, be more unin
viting than a dish of snails, yet to the Hungarians
this is agreeable, as it was to the ancient Romans;
and delicate ladies dine on snails, cut into small
pieces and dressed with seasoning, while they
would shudder at the sight of a raw oyster.
    Twenty different kinds of sea anemone are found
on our coast, some of them much larger than the
common species which we have described.
    Passing by many interesting zoophytes to pro
ceed to the other large class, the Polyzoa or
Bryozoa, often called the moss corals, we find
there a very different structure of the animals,
though much resemblance in the skeletons.         The
Polyzoa, though smaller than the Anthozoa, are of
higher organization.     In the compound anthozoa,
as in the sea fir and sickle beard, the polypes seem
each to be a bud issuing from a common fleshy
trunk ; but, in the polyzoa, every individual is
 distinct, though they are all connected by one
 common bond of union. Dr. Johnston's compari
 son of the former to a
                           " chain, of which all the
 links are welded; and the latter, to a necklace
where the beads are strung together by a common
thread," presents us with a good idea of the dis
tinction.   In the anthozoa, the horny plant-like
fabric, or the stony substance of the coral, has
little or no organic connection with the fleshy por
tion ; for although it originates in the polypes, and

                      ZOOPHYTES.                 273
is secreted by them, yet, when once formed, it has
no further power of development, nor is any circu
lation carried through it. But in the moss corals,
the outward skin, the polypidom, continues to be
always a living part of the animal which dwells
within; it adheres closely to the polype, and is
connected with its flesh. None of the animals of
this class are separate or naked, like the sea ane
mones; they all grow in compound bodies, and
are lodged in cells, in which, during a state of
repose, the polypes lie doubled up.     The species
of moss corals are very numerous.         Hundreds
of fossil kinds, undiscovered but by the aid of
most powerful microscopes, have recently been de
tected by Ehrenberg and D'Orbigny, their shelly
coverings entering into the composition of chalk
beds, mountain limestone, and the flints of the Jura
limestone, sea sands, and the sands of the Libyan
desert.   Many of these are altogether invisible to
the unassisted eye; others appear like minute
points, smaller than the grains of the sandy shore.
So minute are some of the species of moss corals,
that great accumulations of them are found in the
finest prepared whiting, uninjured in form, amid
all the processes of its preparation. And when we
call in the aid of the microscope we may behold
them, of exquisite symmetry, in the chalk coating
which covers the walls of our apartments, forming
there a beautiful mosaic work when the chalk,
mixed with water, is spread out before us.
   A large number of the moss corals appear to us
merely as scaly crusts upon the surfaces of the
rocks and sea-weeds, often covering them with a
thick coat of dirty sand colour, and, as those un
acquainted with zoophytes would think, spoiling

274                   ZOOPHYTES.
the beauty of our prettiest marine plants, and in
festing alike animal and vegetable productions of
the ocean.     In some cases we can at once see that
these scaly patches are congregated cells ; but it
needs microscopic aid to reveal to us the fact, that
in different species these cells are of different
forms, and that in each cell lies a living creature,
which, when it needs to bring the prey to its
mouth, can awake to most vigorous activity, and
extend its arms, covered with minute cilia or hairs,
from the opening of its dwelling.       The Lepraliae,
or sea scurfs, are thin calcareous crusts of white,
yellow, or reddish, or purplish tints. There are
more than thirty-five described species, and more
probably remain yet to be discovered.       The care
less passers by would scarcely see them, or deem
                           them but deformities ; but
                           our engraving, which re
                           presents    the magnified
                           cells of two species, will
                           show that they possess
                           a    beautiful  symmetry.
                            Some of these scurfs are
confined to particular species of sea-weed ; others
seem quite indifferent as to what surface they
encrust, some grow only on shells, but all are
parasitical.
   The most common zoophyte of this class is that
represented by our figure, which is known, though
perhaps not by name, to all who have ever roamed
by ocean's margin, with high intent upon the
objects scattered around them. The large, horny,
brittle, leaf-like substance, of the colour of moist
wood, yet reminding us of a withered leaf, and at
some seasons almost as plentiful as if it had been

 scattered by the wind from some neighbouring
 tree, is the Broad-leaved Hornwrack (Flustra
foliacea).   If held up to the light we can see
 plainly that it is composed of clusters of cells.
 These cells are formed on both sides of its sub
 stance, and their raised margins make the surface
 so rough to our touch.    When placed under the
 microscope, we can see that the upper part of the
margin of each cell is armed with four projecting
horny spines, which appear to be designed as a
protection to the polypes when they extend their
arms.    It has been observed, too, by Dr. Farre,
that the transparent horny cell which closely sur
rounds the body of the animal, is nearly unyield
ing at the lower part, but is terminated at the

upper by a flexible portion, which serves to protect
the upper part of the body when the whole is
expanded, at which time it is as large as the rest
of the cell ; while, when the animal retracts, it is
folded up and drawn in after              it,
                                        and completely
closes the mouth of the cell. The aperture of the
cell  isformed by lid, which folds down when the
                         a
polype     about to advance from it.
            is                              These cells
appear, under the microscope, like so many crystal
cups, and each one        the dwelling-place of a per
                             is
fect animal, united to its neighbours in the cells
above and below him, by a common circulation.
Wondrous, indeed,          the structure of these po
                             is
lypes  ; their little tentacles, or arms, surrounding
the body like small bristles, are covered with innu
merable minute cilia, or fringe-like hairs, all quickly
vibrating, and acting on the water like so many
 paddles, producing all around them strong and
rapid currents.
                      " Constantly," says Professor
 Jones, " these streams of water pour along, some
 rushing along the aspect of each tentacle towards
 the mouth, and hurrying thither whatever food            is
 brought within their influence. Escape out of the
 living whirlpool seems impossible, and every tiny
 being that approaches its dread margin perishes.
 Charybdis, with its fabled terrors, could not bear
 comparison with the fierce vortex thus produced.
 Soon as an animalcule comes within          given dis

                is
 the gulph, where,       if
                         admissible as food,      enters
                                                     it
 and   is swallowed; or,          if
                                rejected,        dashed
                                                it   is
 away by other currents, running different ways,
and hurried to distance. Neither does our admi
                     a
ration cease after the food has passed the opening
of the mouth, for, in the throat itself, innumerable

                     ZOOPHYTES.                   277
cilia are busily in motion, turning round and round
the swallowed victim, urging it along until it
reaches the stomach, where its struggles end." In
a common-sized specimen of this hornwrack, at
least 36,000 living beings have been computed to
exist, each actively and rapidly vibrating the cilia
which covers the tentacles.      Nor is this all : this
Flustra is often the point of attachment to other
corallines, minute threads which creep over its
surface, or crowd upon it in dense little tufts, or
cover it with a mossy-looking substance, like a
coating of down.      Every filament, there, has cells
 containing living creatures, each perfect in its
 structure, and no less highly organized than the
 polypes of the sea-mat.     Many persons, to whom
 this hornwrack is familiar, have observed its
 peculiar odour, and, when the polypidom is newly
 thrown up from the waters, it is often very plea
 sant.   Pallas compares its scent to that of the
 orange ; Dr. Grant, to the perfume of violets ; and
 another writer describes it as mingling the per
 fumes of the rose and geranium. This latter
 description seems to the author to convey the best
 idea of the odour, such at least as she has found
 it ; but it is probable that it may vary in different
  specimens, and she has sometimes picked up a
  dozen pieces, in not one of which any pleasant
 perfume was apparent, while some of them had a
  strong and disagreeable fishy odour. This horn-
  wrack has been called Duck's-foot Conferva, and
  Curious sea-weed. A writer in London's Maga
  zine of Natural History, remarked of     it,that, on
  exposure to the fire, it   emits "a powerful acid
  smell, similar to that of lemons." The author has
  subjected many specimens to this experiment, and

  in one or two cases detected a faint odour of
  lemon ; but in most instances all sweet odour was
  overpowered by the strong scent of burning bones,
  or other animal substance, which the hornwrack
  gave out in the flame.   This and the other horn-
  wracks were formerly included under the name
  of Sea-mat ; hence Linnaeus gave the genus their
  scientific name from the Saxon flustrian,
                                                    " to
  weave."
     The narrow-leaved Hornwrack (Flustra trun-
  cata) much resembles this, but it is of a thinner and
  more papery substance, and its segments are nar
  rower at the base.   Though very common in deep
  water on the Scottish coast, and on the northern
  shores of England, it is less generally distributed
 than the broad-leaved kind. Then there is a
 pretty yellowish-brown      species,   called Flustra
 carbasea, not uncommon on some coasts.            The
 polypes in this species have about twenty-two ten
 tacles, on which Dr. Grant remarks, "They are
 nearly a third of the length of the body, and there
 appears to be about 50 ciliae on each side of a ten-
 taculum, making 2,200 ciliae on each polypus. In
 this species there are more than 18 cells in a
 square line, or 1,800 in a square inch of surface;
 and the branches of an ordinary specimen present
about 10 square inches of surface, so that a com
mon specimen of the Carbasea presents more than
18,000 polypi, 396,000 tentacula, and 39,600,000
ciliae."
    Some sea-mats form patches on our common
marine plants, some inches in length, and they
may be seen by the naked eye to be composed of
a mass of cells.    The membranous species (Flus
tra membranacea) , so common on the fronds of the
Laminaria, and different species of Pucus, forming

                           ZOOPHYTES.                   279
on their surfaces a gauze-like crust, is exquisitely
beautiful under the microscope.              The Rev. David
Landsborough and Dr. Johnston have seen a spe
cimen of this, five feet in length by eight inches
in breadth : and Dr. Landsborough counted the
cells on every square inch, each of which cells had
been inhabited by a living polype, and found that
this " web of silvery lace " had been the work and
the dwelling-place of above "two millions of in
dustrious, and doubtless happy inmates ; so that
this single colony, on a submarine island, was
about equal in number to the population of
 Scotland."
    Many are the wondrous zoophytes belonging to
our own seas, and strewed about among the refuse
of the ocean on our shores, which we must here
leave unnoticed.          Though familiarly acquainted
with the objects named in this paper, yet the
author is indebted for many of its details to the
interesting facts discovered and accumulated by
 Dr. George Johnston. His valuable work on the
 British Zoophytes cannot be read by any intel
 ligent person without wonder and delight. To
 many it has opened a new world of ideas. View
 ing the subject with the feelings of a philosopher,
 a poet, and a Christian, his book is a source of
 gratification both to the scientific and the un
 learned reader.

ONE of the most frequent objects on our shores
is a yellowish ball, composed of a number of little
bladders, of about the size of a pea, and of a
membranous and tough material.                       These balls
skim over the stones or sands on a rough day,
never stopping till they fall into some cavity, or
lodge themselves            against the side of a boat
or pier, where they often lie in numbers. They
are the egg-shells of the common whelk, and when
first deposited, are soft and full of a cream-like
substance.      They shortly harden, and the bladders
then become full of small roundish eggs. There
are sometimes as many as a hundred eggs in each
case, though not more than four or five on an
average come to perfection.               The young animals,

282      COMMON   OBJECTS   OF   THE SHOKE.
when first hatched, are covered with a minute
shell, which they enlarge as they grow older. The
ball is often as large as an orange, and contains a
great number of these egg-cases.       One of an or
dinary size was found by the author to consist of
as many as two thousand five hundred. This mass
of eggs is called on the coast bladder-chain, oyster-
spat, sea-rose, or soap-ball or wash-ball.      Ellis
says of it, that in his time, sailors used itas soap,
to wash their hands.
   Our engraving will at once remind all accus
tomed to the sea-side, of another object on which
they have often looked; at which, perchance, in
childhood, they have wondered much, doubting
whether that olive-green leathery bag were not
some kind of sea-weed.    The Mermaid's-purse, or
the Fairy-purse, was the name by which they
called it in those days; and     it the egg-case of
                                      is
some of the several kinds of Ray-fish, or skate. It
is open at both ends to admit the sea- water, and  if
we pick up any of the specimens so numerous
during the months of September or October, we

  find within, a substance resembling the yolk and
  white of a bird's egg. A little later, the partly
  developed fish may be seen ; and finally, the skate
  fully formed, looking exactly like the large-sized
 fish, and lying with its tail turned over its back,
 seems only waiting for a little more strength to
 emerge from the end open next to its head, into its
 new life in the waters.       If taken home in this
 state, and placed in a bason of water, the young
 fish will gradually glide forth, and swim very com
placently about in its native element.       After a
stormy day in November, numbers may be found
in this condition.
    But the Mermaid's-purse belonging to the dog
fish, a small species of shark, is a much prettier,
though not so frequent an egg-case as this. It is
smaller and thinner, sometimes of a dark brown,
but frequently of a transparent horn colour, with
threads proceeding from the four corners, often
many feet long, making beautiful curled tassels,
like the tendrils of the vine. These are coiled

around the stems of sea-weeds, or broken wood,
or on the projections of rocks, and fastening the
egg-shell firmly till the little inmate is ready for
its entrance into the waters, the waves may dash,
and the storm may roar ever so wildly, yet is it as
safe as if the sea were unstirred by a passing
breeze.
   Several crabs are to be seen on most parts of
our shore, and few are commoner than that kind
which, hermit-like, shuts itself up in a lonely cell,
and passes the greater part of life away from its
kind.    Bernard the Hermit, or the Hermit-crab,
or, the Soldier-crab (Pagurus Bernhardus), has a
peculiar structure. The hinder part of this animal
is destitute of the usual shelly crust in which most
of the species are enveloped, and in an early stage
of its existence, made conscious by its instinct of
its frail and unprotected condition, it takes pos
session of some empty spiral or turbinated shell,
which it finds upon the beach, among whose coils it
can entwine itself, and putting forth its claws,
crawl along, like the snail, with its home upon its
back. Various shells may be seen thus inhabited ;
the crab, as it increases in size, setting forth in
quest of a larger dwelling, into which it enters
backwards, gradually winding itself in, and taking
 hold of the end of the spire by means of a hook
 attached to its tail.   When the hermit-crab be
 comes larger, there are few common shells of size
 enough to receive   it, except that of the whelk  ;
but as these are usually plentiful, it   iseasy for
                                                  it
 to find  a castle. So frequent on some coasts are
 the hermit-crabs in the whelk-shell, that the writer
 found thirteen specimens in the course of an hour's
 walk on the beach of Dovor.        The animal well

          COMMON OBJECTS     OF THE SHORE.        285
 deserves its name of soldier-crab, for it fights with
 most determined spirit in defence of its shell ; and
 the contest between the rival crabs contending
for one dwelling, is most vigorous and fierce ; and
 if the opening of the castle is attacked by an
 enemy, the warfare maintained by the soldier is
most amusing to witness. This crab creeps quickly
over the shore, cautiously peeping forth to avoid
danger.     The right claw is generally larger than
the other, and is protruded when the animal is at
rest ; but if any danger approaches, the crab re
treats far into its shell, and putting the left claw
over its head, and clasping it down with the right
limb, it ensconces itself so securely, that it is not
easily injured, unless .the shell be broken. This

           COMMON   OBJECTS  OF THE SHORE.
 crab is said, when seized, to utter a faint cry.   It
 certainly takes so strong a hold of its foe, that the
 finger thus grasped would be glad to withdraw
itself, as the hermit will suffer itself to be killed
rather than relinquish the hold.
    We have several common crabs, as well as other
crustacean animals, hiding in the holes among the
rocks, some of them walking sideways over the
sand, and if touched, making most rapid efforts to
hide themselves behind a sheltering stone, or under
the friendly leaf of a large sea- weed.    One of the
most frequent kinds, the common            shore-crab
 (Carcinus mtenas), really well deserves the name of
le crabe enrage, by which it is known on the French

shore.    If   any attempt is made to touch                      it,   it
runs along in most excited state, and hastens to
               a
bury itself in the sand.           If
                                  seized before       can       it
make its escape,     fights most desperately, striving
                    it
with all its might to seize and pinch the fingers,
and moving its claws in most defiant attitudes,
                                             it,

                                             it
claws behind, and get away by means of its smaller
limbs. Nor does the animal appear to suffer from
its loss, for though      can move but slowly, there
                         it
is   no indication of pain. Could we again see this
 maimed crab, we should probably find, that after a
 while it   had renewed its limbs; for in common
 with other crustaceous animals,         has the power
                                             it
 of reproducing them from the remaining portion
 of the old ones. We often see lobster brought
                                             a
to table with one limb longer than the other;                          a
 condition which was probably caused by its having,
 in some encounter with an enemy, dropped               in       it
 its grasp, while the one more recently produced
 had not attained its full size at the time when the
 lobster was captured.
     This crab isa  common article of food in towns
 contiguous to the sea, and          sold in the streets

 generally around our coasts, and usually abounding

in boats, with creels made of basket work, baited
with thornback, skate, or other fish ; and like other
crustaceans, the crabs are not particular as to the
nature of their food, being destined to consume the
refuse of the sea.
   Some of the most beautiful of our British crabs
are those termed Velvet-crabs, on account of the
velvety down with which the shell is covered, and
which extends even to the limbs of the animal.
They are of reddish colour, tinged with blue. One
of these, commonly found on our shores (Portunus
puber), is about two inches and a half long, and
much esteemed as food.      Its colours are remark
 ably bright.
   Then there are crabs on our coast with triangular

           COMMON OBJECTS    OF THE SHORE.        289
 bodies, and long thin hairy legs, so like the spider,
that fishermen call them the spider-crabs; and
there is a little crab not at all unfrequent in the
 shell of the mussel, which is the subject of many
an ancient legend.     This is the Pea-crab (Pinno
theres pisum), a tiny creature, belonging to a group
of small crustaceans, which dwell between the
mantle lobes of the mussels and pinnae, as well as
those of some other bivalve mollusks. The ancients
had strange poetic fancies respecting these pea-
crabs, nor were they entirely rejected by naturalists
or poets of modern times, though disproved by the
investigation of recent science.    Old writers told
of a singular friendship existing between these
little animals and the mussels, relating how, while
the mussels lay with open shell to catch their prey,
the crab, espying its approach, would give the
shell-fish warning, so that it might suddenly close
its shell upon the animal. In return for this, the
mussel was reported to give the crab its home and
food, for no sooner was the shell closed than the
two friends shared the feast. Hasselquist, who
visited Smyrna about a century since, writing
thence, expatiates upon the valuable services of
this little crab, though he has a different tale to
tell of its doings. He observes, that the great
silk mussel is found there, and that some of the
cuttle-fish watch for it to open its shell, when,
putting in their long arms, they would seize and
devour the fish. But the sentinel crab, through
the small opening of the shell, was said to keep
so good a watch upon all enemies, that on their
approach it moved, and gave warning to its hos
pitable entertainer, which immediately closed the
doors of its dwelling.    It appears, however, that

290        COMMON OBJECTS     OF THE SHORE.
these little crabs have a soft and thin crust for
their only covering, and that they repair to these
 shells for shelter, as the hermit-crab would to that
of the whelk.
    The lobster (Astacus marinus), though not so
general on all our coasts as the common species of
crab, yet is by no means rare on rocky shores, and
in some places very abundant.           Every one is
familiar with its general appearance, its eyes set
upon stalks, enabling it to see all around ; its long
ringed jointed horns, and the articulated plates
 of its tail. There is not altogether much in its
appearance which at first sight would excite an
interest, but to the careful observer it presents an
object iii which the skill of the great Creator is
most beautifully manifest.      Its plates are moved
by very powerful muscles, and if the lobster sud
denly contracts these, it has power to dart back
wards with astonishing rapidity. Sometimes, when
coming out of its hole in the rock, in search of
food, it meets with an enemy lying in wait to
seize it ; but no sooner does it see its danger, than
it expands the moveable plates of its tail, contracts
the muscles, and bringing it down with much
force, flaps it up against the lower part of the
body, and darts backwards with inconceivable
velocity, so that the eye can scarcely follow its
motion, and that of the bird of the air, or the flash
of lightning, may serve as a comparison. By these
means the lobster will secure himself in small holes,
in little crannies where we should deem it im
possible that it could enter.     In the water it can
run nimbly along, or dart forwards by means of its
tail, with great quickness.     The claws, too, pre
sent another instance of a beautiful contrivance

         COMMON    OBJECTS OF THE SHORE.            291
for its use. In looking at the nippers of the larger
claws, they may be seen to have little knobs or
tubercles at the margin, while the edges of the
smaller are toothed or serrated. With the knobbed
pincers the lobster keeps a strong hold on the stalks
of the sea-weeds, while the other serves it for cut
ting and mincing its food, which it is said thus to
do very dexterously.     It is well known that the
lobster is a voracious and active hunter, eating
all kinds of food, preferring it in a state of cor
ruption, thus aiding essentially in clearing away
putrescent substances, its large strong claws fitting
it for tearing stronger and tougher objects than
the leaves of the marine plants.
   The immense consumption of this animal as food,
is provided for by the great number of its eggs,
sometimes nearly twenty thousand being produced
by one lobster.
   The lobster, in common with other crustaceans,
changes its coat of armour ; for it cannot, like the
molluscous animal, add to it by secreting a fresh
layer, as it increases in size.  Its crust is of one
piece, and formed at once, not of the same sub
stance as the shell of the mollusk, but consisting
of animal matter and phosphate of lime. Nor is it
alone the coat of mail — the crust of plates — which
the crab or lobster throws off to take another.
Even the covering of its eyes, the living membrane
of the stomach, the teeth connected with      it, and
all the expansions or tendons to which the muscles
of the claws are fastened. Slipping out of all these,
the soft body soon secretes  a  crust better fitted to
its later stage of development.       Instances have
been known in which the ever-hungry lobster has
been lured by the bait into the creel of the fisher

292      COMMON OBJECTS     OF   THE SHORE.
man, just when about to cast its shell, and when
the fisher has handled his prey, the animal has, to
his surprise, slipped out, and left him holding in
his hands the empty case.
  Equally provided with the lobster for swiftness
of motion, is the little shrimp, whose cunning-
looking eyes seem watching our every movement,
as it darts about in the pool. The common shrimp
(Crangon vulgaris) is remarkably active; and, des
tined to serve as food, and to perform the no less
important service of devouring the refuse of the
sea, it is very abundant. Paley says of  it,— " Walk
ing by the sea-side on calm evening, upon a sandy
                      a
shore, and with an ebbing tide,  I    have frequently
remarked the appearance of dark cloud, or rather
                             a
very thick mist, hanging over the edge of the
water, to the height, perhaps, of half-a-yard,
stretching along the coast, as far as the eye could
reach, and always retiring with the water. When
the cloud came to be examined,      it  proved to be
 nothing else than so much space filled with young
 shrimps in the act of bounding into the air, from
 the shallow margin of the water, or the wet sand."
 We have here an instance of a mass of numbers
                              reminding us of the
                              overwhelming flight of

occurring, in some places, in abundance ; but the
Opossum-shrimp (Mysis Fabricii), represented by
our figure, is almost as plentiful.           Its name relates
to the pouch or bag which holds the eggs in the
female shrimp.
     Who has not looked upon sea and sky — on such
a scene as that described by the poet : —
       " Star after star, from some unseen abyss,
         Came through the sky, like thoughts into the mind,
         We know not whence : till all the firmament
         Was throng'd with constellations, and the sea

         Strown with their images.
Was it the bright reflection of the glittering orbs
of heaven, of which the poet sang when he wrote
these lines ? Did their bright images, strown over
the calm surface of the waters, on some still sum
mer evening, suggest the poetic resemblance to the
thoughts coming we know not how, arising from
some association of which even those who are most
intellectually observant can take no cognisance?
And yet his statement would have been no less
true, had he been thinking of the literal fact of the
 multitude of star-like forms with which the sea is
 teeming — forms so radiant, and some of them so
 bright with phosphorescent light, that even the
 peasant calls them star-fishes, and the philosopher,
 ever in some sort a poet too, once said of them, —
 ' ' As there are stars in the
                                       sky, so there are stars
 in the sea." Assuredly, both sea and shore are
 strewn with myriads of starry animals, though
 they are few in number, compared with what they
 were in these olden ages, of which fossil remains
 tell us, when star-fishes, of extinct and beautiful
 forms, affixed to stalks, waved in multitudes in the
 seas, and having performed their appointed living

part in creation, went to form the crust of the
earth on which man was to dwell, and leaving
their petrified figures in the limestone rocks, in
the mountain chains, traced there a history which
should be read by the thoughtful and intelligent
of future ages of mankind.
    Every one accustomed to examine collections of
geological specimens, or to roam about the regions
of limestone districts, must have seen the stony
remains of these extinct star-fishes, in their most
perfect state resembling the stem and flower of a
lily, and hence called popularly lily-stones, and by
the geologist termed Encrinites. The stalk is com
posed of little lozenge-like pieces, resembling small
and nearly solid wheels, with a cinque-foil in the
centre, and the fragments of these are very
abundant. They are commonly called St. Cuth-
bert's beads, and old tradition had much to tell of
these and of some other common fossils.             Some
fossils are still in the North of England popularly
called snake-stones, and petrified snakes, and stories
are yet in existence of which ancient tales —
                              "told
           How of a thousand snakes each one
           Was changed into a coil of stone ; "
while to the broken fragments of the star-fishes of
the older world belong legends to which Sir
Walter Scott alludes : —
        " Nor did St. Cnthbert's daughters fail
          To vie with these in holy tale :
               On a rock by Lindisfarn,
          St. Cuthbert sits and toils to frame
          The sea-born beads that bear his name :
          Such tales had Whitby's fishers told,

           COMMON OBJECTS OF THE SHOKE.           295
    When we think of the immense strata of En-
crinite marble which in some regions, as in Derby
shire, are composed of these innumerable lily-stars,
showing that our seas must once have been full of
them, it seems strange that stalked star-fishes
should now be so rare.       Once they clung by their
long stems to the rocks down deep in the blue
seas, and firmly fixed there, spread out their
fringed flower-like arms to entrap the living nutri
ment afforded by the waters.         Perhaps, like the
modern tribe of star-fishes, they were the scaven
gers of the sea ; but we have no means of knowing
whether they were at any time enabled to free
themselves from their stalk, and glide about in the
deep.      One beautiful stalked star-fish alone re
mains, and this is affixed to a stalk only at an
early period of its existence.     The lovely Feather
 Star (Comatula rosacea) is found attached to the
stems of sea-weeds and corallines, and is a bright
rose-coloured animal, much resembling a flower,
but not, while in this condition, more than half or
three quarters of an inch in height.
    But this lovely object is not one of the common
things of the sea-shore, though various other species
of star-fish are among the most frequent and fa
miliar of all the things to be seen there. Commonest
 of all, is that star-fish known on the coast by the
 name of Five-fingered Jack, because its rays are
 usually five in number, though in some instances
 it has six.      This animal (Uraster rubens) is on
 some parts of our coast termed the Common Cross-
 fish, and the people of Cornwall call it Clam, or
 Clamp.      It is so abundant as to be sometimes col
 lected for manure, and well may it be so, for one
 single star-fish will produce a thousand of its pro-

 geny in one season. Every one knows this com
 mon animal, which is more or less of a reddish
 yellow colour — in some cases of a purplish tinge,
 and varying in size from a specimen which might
 lie in the palm of the hand, to one six or eight
 inches in diameter.     This star-fish, though at first
 sight not a particularly attractive one, should be
 taken home and placed in a large vessel of sea-
 water, or carried to some rocky pool, if we would
 see its wondrous and beautiful structure. If placed
 in a glass jar on its back, one of its first movements
 will probably be to turn itself round. This it does
 by folding over two or three of its rays, and then,
 with a sudden jerk, placing itself in its right
 position.   If we look at its under surface, we shall
 discover, along each ray, a calcareous framework,
 composed of regular portions, commencing at the
 central mouth, and extending in a furrow to the
tip of the ray. In this groove are many orifices,
 through which are protruded small fleshy suckers,
which serve as legs, and each of which is termi
nated by a disc. More than three hundred of these
suckers are placed on each ray, and we need no
microscope to enable us to see them, moving
sometimes all together, at others, only a few at a
time. And well do these moving legs serve also
to hold down the prey.          Our star-fish has an
appetite not easily satisfied.    It has to cleanse the
waters near the shore of that offal which else
would pollute the atmosphere; and the great
Creator, who appointed to the star-fishes their
occupation, gave them the inclination and the
power to perform it. Nothing comes amiss to
them. They can feed on the decomposing mass
of dead animal matter, can swallow alike the

gliding silvery fish, and get from within its hard
 shell the mollusk apparently so well protected.
 Helpless as this animal would seem as it lies on the
 beach, it can conquer creatures which have greater
 strength and activity than itself. While lying in
wait for its prey, it may chance that a crab comes
within the grasp of its rays, which are ready bent
in attitude for seizure. No sooner does the animal
come in their reach, than the rays are closed down

of their orifices, hold     down, and drag

mouth, where         swallowed.

                               is
with the fishermen.        The ancients, and many
modern writers too, have told that       contrived to
                                                 it
reach the mollusk enclosed in its shell, by in
sinuating one of its rays between the valves, when
they happened to lie partly open.           Thus the
poet says   :   —
      " The prickly star-fish
                              creeps with fell deceit
          To force   the oyster from his close retreat   ;
          When gaping lids their widen'd void display,
          The watchful star thrusts in pointed ray
                                         a               ;
          Of all its treasures robs the rifled case,
          And empty shells the sandy hillock grace. "
But though the star-fish does not thus " employ its
rays as an oyster-knife," yet Professor Jones, in
his most delightful book, " The Natural History of
Animals/'              this process, which, as he
                describes
says,is unique. The animal seizes upon the shelly
valves of the oyster, and
                           " proceeds coolly to turn
its stomach inside out;       then, perhaps, instils
                                    it

298        COMMON OBJECTS    OF THE SHORE.
between     the shells some torpifying fluid, which
deprives the oyster of strength, and soon com
pels the prey to open its defences.     The stomach
of the star -fish, now distended like a bladder, is
pushed in, and made to enwrap the oyster, which
is soon digested, even in its own shell, and fur
nishes a meal for its uncourteous visitor."
    Professor Forbes, too, considers it probable that
the star-fishes have some acrid stinging fluid, which,
like that of the sea anemone and sea nettles, serves
to stupify the prey. It is commonly said, that
this species possesses it in such power, as that
it will sting those persons who touch it. But
this is an assertion which may easily be disproved ;
as we may pick up hundreds on the shore, and
find them all harmless to the touch. Their great
destruction of oysters has been long attested;
Bishop Sprat, in his "History of the Royal
 Society," treating of the oyster, says, "There are
great penalties, by the Admiralty Court, laid upon
those that fish out of those grounds which the
 Court appoints, or that destroy the Cultch, or that
take any oysters that are not of size, or that do
not tread under their feet, or throw upon the shore
 a fish which they call a Five-finger,   resembling a
 spur rowel, because that fish gets into the oysters
 when they gape open, and sucks them out."
    Scarcely less frequent is the common sun-star
 (Solaster papposa), which is much handsomer than
 the cross-fish. It has usually ten or twelve, though
 occasionally fifteen rays.    It is commonly of a
 reddish purple colour, but sometimes the centre
is red, and the rays are white, tipped with red and
 white or straw-coloured beneath.     Like the cross-
 fish, it is found on oyster banks; but it is fre

 quently thrown by the tide on the shore, or dragged
 up in nets, or on the hook of the fisherman. Some
of the largest specimens measure nine inches
across.   It is very voracious, and generally found
in deeper water than the last-mentioned species.
   All our British star-fishes are not so distinctly
rayed in the star-like form. Thus we have the
Bird's-foot Sea-star, an animal of a pentagonal
shape, with very blunt angles, and of a white
colour, marked with a red centre and fine red rays.
It is thin, and when alive, flexible, like a piece of
leather. Then we have the pretty little Gibbous
Starlet, rarely measuring an inch across, and very
common on some shores, though apparently con
fined to the south and west coasts of our island ;
and the knotty Cushion-star, and others which may
be described as having five angles rather than
rays.

300      COMMON OBJECTS      OF THE SHORE.
   These and some others, with the exception of
the Comatula, belong to the true star-fishes, but the
Brittle-stars and the Sand-stars are placed in the
family termed by Professor Forbes Ophiurida.
These are the star-fishes which are most numerous
in our seas. Not that the species are many in
number, there being twelve only, but that the in
dividuals are very plentiful.   Our engraving re
presents one of them, often thrown by the wave on
the shore, and on some coasts, as at- Dovor, it is
one of the most frequent species.      The common
brittle-star (Ophiocoma rosula) is a more elegant
species than any other of the very general star
fishes.  Brittle, indeed, it is,
                             not only breaking up
by   touch from its natural fragility, but evidently
     a
possessing the power of dismembering itself at its
will. " Touch it," says Professor Forbes, " flings
                                             it
away an arm   : hold   it,
                         and in a moment not an
arm remains attached to the body.''       Its disc is
often of dim rose-colour, with grey scales, some
         a

          COMMON OBJECTS     OF THE SHORE.         301
times white, spotted with red — often marked with
a star   of red or yellow, and occasionally nearly
black. The rays are usually white, banded with
pink — often of a deep blue, with rose-coloured
spines, banded with bright yellow, or speckled
with brown and orange. It is fond of rocky shores,
and rarer in sandy localities.      The Professor re
marks of these brittle-stars,   " I  have seen a large
dredge come up, completely filled with them; a
most curious sight, for when the dredge was emptied,
these little creatures, writhing with the strangest
contortions, crept about in all directions, often
flinging their arms in broken pieces about them,
and their snake-like and threatening attitudes
were by no means relished by the boatmen, who
anxiously asked permission to shoot them over
board, superstitiously remarking, that the things
'weren't altogether right.'"       These brittle-stars
feed on small shell-fish and crabs, and are, in their
turn, food "ir the larger fishes. This species is
most brilliantly coloured, and is very general around
our shores.
   Another very pretty, though less common
species, is the brightly tinted Daisy Brittle-star
 (Ophiocoma bellis), with its long twisting rays. Its
disc presents a surface of intermingled spines and
plates, which sufficiently resemble our meadow
flower to suggest its name.          "Nor," says the
writer before alluded to, "is the flower at all de
graded by the comparison, for but few daisies can
show such beauty of form and colour, as is pre
sented by this sea-star."
    All the brittle-stars have long slender rays, and
some have rays like tendrils, scarcely thicker than
twine, and composed of many articulations.       They

 302      COMMON OBJECTS    OF THE SHORE.
 are in some species seven or eight inches long,
 and twisting about in most graceful convolutions,
they could not fail to interest those who regarded
them. Fragile creatures are they all, not only
having the power of breaking up the arms into
pieces, but these pieces again actually dividing
themselves into others, so that when seized they
will often leave only their disc whole. Equally
with the true star-fishes, they can reproduce their
rays, and may therefore safely indulge their ex
cited feelings.
   One of the species of the true star-fishes, is
brittle as even the most fragile of the brittle-stars ;
this is the Lingthorn (Luidia fragilissima), an
animal which is sometimes two feet in diameter,
and has five or seven rays.     It is of an orange or
red colour. Its singular power of breaking itself
up, in its indignation at being taken, is related in
so amusing a manner by the Professor, that jus
tice can be given to his description only by quoting
his words.     This as well as several other species
is rarely cast on sand or shingle, but must be
fetched up from deeper water by the dredge. The
author had succeeded in getting a Lingthorn into
the boat, and not aware of its peculiarites, had laid
it on a bench for examination. " On attempting,"
he says, "to remove it for preservation, to my
horror and disappointment,   I  found only an assem
blage of rejected members; my conservative en
deavours were all neutralized by its destructive
exertions, and it is now badly represented in my
cabinet by an armless disc and a discless arm.
Next time    I  went to dredge on the same spot,
determined not to be cheated out of a specimen in
such a way a second time,     I  brought with me a

          COMMON   OBJECTS OF THE SHORE.           303
bucket of cold fresh water, to which article star
fishes have a great antipathy.     As I expected, a
Luidia came up in the dredge, a most gorgeous
 specimen.    As it does not generally break up
before it is raised above the surface of the sea,
cautiously and anxiously    I sank my bucket to a
level with the dredge's mouth, and proceeded in
the most gentle manner to introduce Luidia to the
purer element. Whether the cold air was too much
for him, or the sight of the bucket too terrific,     I
know not ; but in a moment he proceeded to dis
solve his corporation, and at every mesh of the
dredge his fragments were seen escaping.            In
despair  I grasped at the largest, and brought up
the extremity of an arm, the spinous eyelid of
which opened and closed with something exceed
ingly like a wink of derision."     The red spots to
be seen at the end of every ray of many star-fishes,
surrounded by spines, have by some writers been
called eyes, and it is to this part of the animal
which the Professor alludes in the latter sentence.
   Very nearly allied in structure to the star-fishes,
are those animals generally called sea-eggs, or sea-
urchins, whose rounded shells are so often thrown
on the beach. All have seen some of the commoner
kinds lying among the rocks, or placed on the
chimney-pieces of houses near the sea, or deposited
in the museums of science ; while their fossil re
mains, often perfect in form, are found in the flint
and chalk in abundance.      These shells are covered
with tubercles, placed in regular rows all down
their globular surface, and to these tubercles,
during the life of the animal, were affixed jointed
spines.   Minute differences exist in the form of
the spines in various species, but so regular and

304       COMMON    OBJECTS  OF THE SHORE.
exact are they, that a good zoologist can determine
the species by the examination of a single spine ; a
circumstance most important when investigating
their remains in a fossil state, as sometimes this
may be the only portion which he can procure.
Most wondrously suited to the wants of the living
creature within the cell, is the structure of these
spines.    No rock is so smooth or so rugged but
that by their help the animal can make its way. Its
meal lies before it among the rocks ; the zoophytes,
the shell-fish, the crabs, are all welcome prey, nor
are they longed for in vain.        To look at it, it
would seem a mere ball, incapable one would
imagine of attacking or seizing any living thing
that had limbs with which to walk away, or fins
by means of which it could glide out of its
presence.    One would deem it almost like the
zoophyte, chained to its native rock.     Not so; it
can climb to places where animals which seem
better fitted for locomotion would find access im
possible.   Cased in a coat of mail, and furnished
with hundreds of spines which serve as legs, the
ball moves gently onwards.        If an approaching
enemy gives notice of danger, it can either with
draw behind some nook, or with the spines dig a
hole in the sand, and lie there till it is past.
Besides the spines, countless suckers aid the pro
gress ; suckers, which like those on the star-fish,
emerge from the calcareous case, and which are as
long as the spines themselves.      These suckers are
like little feet, and adhere firmly to rocks, and
serve too as means of offence and defence to the
animal ; for if the crab or fish is touched by them,
the touch proves fatal, and the victim is at once
dragged to the mouth and devoured.         Its mouth

          COMMON    OBJECTS  OF  THE SHORE.       305
is most curiously constructed. It is an orifice sur
rounded by a fleshy ring, and set with little teeth
so sharp, and jaws acted upon by muscles so
powerful, that it can bite through very hard sub
stances.    The whole structure of these sea-urchins
is truly wonderful.       The description given by
Professor Bymer Jones of the shelly case, is most
simple and striking.
                        " The crust of the Echinus,"
observes this writer,
                       " when denuded of its spines
or stripped of its external covering, would seem to
be an ordinary shell, having its outer surface
covered over with polished tubercles, regularly
arranged. Of these the largest are disposed in
lines that pass from pole to pole of the round box,
like lines of longitude on the globe of the geogra
pher. Intermixed among the larger tubercles, are
seen innumerable smaller eminences of similar
construction, but dispersed with less precise
arrangement, upon all of which, when in a living
state, spines were attached in correspondent num
ber.    Moreover, placed at intervals between the
 spine-crowned tubercles, are ten broad bands
 disposed in pairs, all pierced with countless holes :
 these too extend from pole to pole of the round
 box, and through them, during life, the locomotive
 suckers passed, used for climbing rocks and for
 attachment to some foreign body.         On cutting
 through the shell so far as to see its inner surface,
 we perceive, to our surprise, that far from being,
 as it appears externally, a simple shelly exudation
 moulded to the form of the Echinus, like the shells
 of lobsters or mollusca, it is a very complex fabric,
 built with most consummate art, consisting of
 some thousand pieces, varying in size but shaped
 with mathematical precision, and composed with

 306        COMMON OBJECTS    OF THE SHORE.
 so   much accuracy that the eye can but with
 difficulty trace the lines of union.  Tell a human
artisan, however versed in geometrical proportions,
to cut a thousand plates, polygonal in form, and
fit them to each other, leaving not the slightest
space between their margins anywhere, so that
the whole shall form a hollow sphere of certain
given proportions, how would he succeed ? Doubt
less he would pronounce the problem quite im
practicable.     But in the shell before us, this is
just what nature has achieved most perfectly.
 First we should observe five double rows of oblong
plates, pentagonal in form, which on their outer
 surfaces present the spine-supporting tubercles.
 On either side are found innumerable pieces, of
 smaller size, but equally exact in shape, through
which are bored the perforations for the ambulacral
feet ; and these are again separated from another
row of perforated plates, by other intermediate
pieces, having spines affixed externally.      These
plates are mostly pentagons in form, with sides of
various length ; but all combined, fit each other so
closely that their combination serves to form one
solid compact shell."
    The species of sea-urchin which is most frequent
on our shores, is that called the Common Sea-egg
 (Echinus sphara).       Forbes gives as one of its
familiar names that of Sca'ad man's head. Though
usually of globose shape, it varies in form, and is
sometimes so much flattened that even experienced
zoologists have mistaken it for another species.
These stony balls are to be found of all sizes up
to a globe of fourteen inches in diameter.      This
sea-egg    has usually a reddish or purplish tinge,
with white spines sometimes tipped with purple.

           COMMON    OBJECTS OF THE SHORE.         307
It lives in  various depths of water, and the animal,
like the rest of its tribe, has a number of sharp and
hard teeth, and feeds exclusively on animal prey.
It is in some countries much used as food, and
resembles in flavour the species known as the
Esculent Sea-urchin.       The people of uncultivated
regions, who live near the shores, consume many
of the sea-eggs, and the ancients regarded them as
delicacies, eating them either raw, or dressed in
various ways.      The sea-gulls feed on many of the
smaller species, as the Green-pea Urchin, breaking
the shells with their strong beaks, and sucking out
the animal within.
     This green-pea urchin (Echinocyamus pusillus,)
 is a frequent species on the shore, and is the
 smallest of the sea-eggs.       When the animal is
 living, the shell is of a bright green colour, just of
 that brilliant powdery nature which we find on
 the shelly cases which shield the gauzy wings of
  some of our brilliant beetles.     When the animal
  dies, however, this gay colour is all gone, and the
  shell is of a dingy white tint. It is very common
  among sand, and its spines are very short and
 crowded.
                            x 2

308       COMMON OBJECTS    OF THE SHORE.
   Scarcely larger than this is the Purple-tipped
 Urchin (Echinus miliaris), which is often found
with the common egg-urchin on oyster-beds or
 scallop-banks, and is sometimes mistaken for the
young of that animal, but may be known from it
by its much larger purple spines.        It is rose-
coloured, with white tubercles ; some of the
spines purple, and others yellow.      This, though
very abundant in the Irish Sea, and on the south
western shores of Scotland, is not a frequent
English species.
   There are a number of less known kinds of sea-
urchins, distinguished by names significant of their
form, or of some peculiarity in their appearance.
Thus we have Heart urchins, and Fiddle-heart
urchins, and Cake urchins; names all expressive
of the shape. And we have the Silky-spined
urchin, well named from the bright glossy lustre
of its spines; and the Rosy-heart urchin, whose
colour might vie with that of the queen of flowers.
Of the four British species of Heart-urchin, one is
very common and diffused through all the Euro
pean seas. Most persons accustomed to roam about
in those sandy bays so delightful to the marine
zoologist, have seen sea-eggs of this species thrown
upon the shore, after the angry waves have spent
their wrath upon it. The common Heart-urchin
or Mermaid's-head (Amphidotus cordatus), is also
often called Child's-head urchin, or hairy sea-egg.
It is broadly heart-shaped, much depressed in the
middle, and thickly set with fine hair-like spines.
Its colour is a yellowish white, and it is usually
about an inch and three quarters long, and very
nearly of the same breadth. These animals, and
some others of a similar nature, were found, on

          COMMON OBJECTS    OF  THE SHORE.      309
being opened by Professor Forbes, to have their in
testines filled with sand or mud, which they had
probably swallowed for the sake of the animal
matter mingled with it.
   Many who have resided for a time on some parts
of our coasts, have heard of those singular animals
termed Sea-cucumbers and Sea-gherkins.         They
are brought up by the dredge from deeper waters,
and we must not expect to find them lying about
among the common things of the beach ; for rarely
indeed do the storms bring them there.        Slimy
creatures they are, and usually by no means at
tractive; yet they deserve notice on account of
their singular nature and habits. Resembling in
the different species, more or less, the cucumber in
form, and covered with a slimy substance, which
renders them disagreeable to the touch ; they are
oblong animals, tapering at the ends, and covered,
like the star-fish, with rows of suckers; while
beautiful feathery tentacles surround the mouth.
 Some of the species seem very apathetic, but
others are lively and active animals. There is
one most remarkable fact recorded of them. We
have seen how the star-fishes, when irritated, can
break themselves up into many pieces. The sea-
 cucumbers have the still more wondrous faculty of
vomiting up the whole of their internal structure,
sometimes leaving not a trace behind of their
organs, save the empty sac.      Yet the animal ap
parently suffers nothing from its enraged action.
It can live on without these organs, and in the
course of three or four months can reproduce
them. Other species of sea-cucumber can separate
themselves down the middle ; and can, in process
 of time, become two perfect animals. Their intes

 tines are generally found full of coral or similar
 substances, sometimes in large pieces. Unpleasing
 as arc these animals to us, yet the Malays of the
 Oriental Isles search for them, in order to sell
them to the Chinese ; and fleets of the Malay
boats visit the isles at the north of Australia, and
the shores of New Holland and New Zealand,
to procure them. As Rymer Jones humorously
remarks, "They form an important addition to
the fried earthworms, swallows' nests, and other
luxuries which grace a bill of fare in the Celestial
Empire." These Holothurice are more plentiful
in the East than in our seas, though we have
fifteen species, and there are probably many yet
undiscovered.    They are sometimes found in num
bers among the tangled masses of sea-weeds near
the shore, but are more frequently procured by
diving ; and when split and dried over the smoke
of a wood fire, are termed Trepang. In the Mo
luccas, the pine-apple Holothuria is nearly two
feet long.    On the Neapolitan coast, too, the
sea-cucumbers are large and plentiful, and they
there form a common article of diet to the
poor.
    But passing on to the common animals of our
coast, we must advert to the Prickly Sea-mouse
(Aphrodita aculeata), which, during the winter
months, is not an unfrequent visitant of various
parts of the shore, where it may be found lurking
on some ridge of sea- weeds which the tide has left
to tell where it has flowed.    At Dovor this little
creature may often be picked up after a stormy
day ; but he who searches for it must not expect
to find any very marked resemblance to the mouse
of the field or dwelling. Unlike that little bright

           COMMON    OBJECTS  OF THE SHORE.        311
eyed creature, it is not sleek and plump, but it
resembles it in one circumstance, rare among the
inhabitants of the sea, in that it has silky hairs
thinly scattered about it. Stiff bristly hairs also are
placed on its upper surface, which make it a rough-
looking animal. These are often half an inch long,
and of most beautiful iridescent hues, reflecting
the red, or orange, or green, or violet, which
glitter on the neck of the drake, or gleaming forth
like gold, which ever and anon betrays some tinge
of green or purple.        The sea-mouse is oblong,
rather flat, from five to six inches in length, and
its upper surface covered with double rows of
plates, which overlap each other, and underneath
these are the little fleshy tufts, which are the aerat
ing gills of the animal. It retains its beautiful me
tallic lustre if preserved in spirits. Dr. Drummond
found, on placing a sea-mouse in fresh-water,
that it almost immediately sunk to the bottom of
the vessel, and never again exhibited the slightest
symptom of life or motion.
   This singular little mouse belongs to the Anne-
lides, a class comprehending a great number of
animals, varying in general appearance, but having
bodies of an elongated form, composed of rings at
certain distances from each other. The common
earthworm is a familiar instance of their structure ;
and any one who has watched its bending atti
tudes, as it glides in and out, may have seen the
rings which encircle its body. By far the greater
number of the annelides live in or near the sea.
The common Lug-worm too (Arenicola piscatorum) ,
that reddish worm, about a foot long, so frequent
 on our level sandy shores, is an annelid. It is
 very useful to the fishermen for bait; and if

            it,
we touch    it      stains   the hand with     a   yellow
fluid.
     Every one, in rambling about our shores, must
have seen weeds, shells, stones, and other objects,
which have long been lying under water, covered
with twisted calcareous tubes, sometimes crowded
together in masses, and most curiously intertwined
in each other.   At other times the tube     found
                                               is
occupying a single shell. Sometimes square pieces,
formed of dozens of tubes unattached to any object,
lie upon the beach or are dredged up from the
sea, but the most frequent cluster of them          on
                                                    is
some old oyster-shell, which they will cover with
their coils like so many little stony serpents;
several species often congregating together.      The
shelly tubes are made by the different kinds of
Serpula, secreted, like the shell of the mollusk, by
the worm itself but, unlike that shell, unattached
                ;
by muscles to the animal within, and unadorned
by brilliant colours. But      the shell
                              if          is less gay,
the beautiful animal within may vie with the
most richly-tinted mollusk, both in colour and
in graceful form. If placed in        avessel of salt
water, the tiny creature soon emerges from its
tube, presenting to our view     brilliant coronal of
                                  a
gorgeous scarlet or rich purple,      afan-like array
of plumes which serve        for organs of respira
                             it
tion, and which, moving up and down in the water,
awaiting such prey as they may find available,
are beautiful as the most elegant feathers.
   Among the commonest of our native species
is the Vermicular serpula (Serpula vermicularis),
whose white tapering rugged cylinders adhere to
plants and stones, or curved in all forms are
cemented to the surface of some refuse shells,

          COMMON OBJECTS    OF THE SHORE.          313
winding all over them, or occasionally lying as a
single tube upon them . This, like all the others, has
beautiful fan-shaped plumes for breathing organs.
They are, in this species,
of deep blue, and among
them is placed the mouth,
surmounted by a stalked
funnel.    Our figure re
presents another species,
the Contorted serpula
 (Serpula contortuplicata),
sometimes found on our
shores, and often placed
in cabinets. In this spe
cies the fan-like bunches
of plumes are exquisitely
delicate, and gorgeously
coloured with red, varied
with orange and violet.
    A common annelid, the I
 Spirorbis, was slightly
mentioned on an earlier
page. This little animal,
which is represented in
our engraving of the
Serrated Fucus, and of which also a magnified
figure is there given, is a small shell resembling
in shape that of some of our land snails, seldom
much larger than the head of a pin. The Nau
tilus-shaped Spirorbis (Spirorbis nautioides), found
on our sea-weeds, is a white and wrinkled shell.
It is more common on the Serrated Fucus and
Podded Halidrys than any others, but is not con
fined to them ; and is so plentiful, that we may
walk down to the rocks where the olive sea-weeds

314      COMMON OBJECTS     OF THE SHORE.
grow, on any summer day, with the certainty of
finding it.   When examined with a microscope,
the shell is seen to be shaped exactly like that of
the nautilus, and of a beautiful white silvery
nature; and when the little worm within puts
forth its delicate radiated branchial organs, like
so many exquisite feathers, we are ready to be
lieve that scarcely any object in nature can be
more lovely or graceful. The shell is flat on one
side, and when severed from the sea-weed is seen
to have the flat side composed of a thin delicate
substance, like gauze-paper ; for the sea-weed
forms a wall to the little dwelling, and, therefore,
the animal needs not to secrete a thicker material
at that part.
    Some of the marine annelides line the holes in
the sands in which they live with a calcareous
lining ; some make for themselves the most curious
and interesting little dwelling-places, composed
of broken shells firmly agglutinated together, a
curious mosaic work of little squares, and angles,
and circles, as the shape of their pieces may
chance to be.     One little worm, unable to con
struct a dwelling for itself, finds one exactly fitted
to it in the old shell of the mollusk, commonly
called Tooth-shell (Dentalium entails), that little
shell so common on our coasts, shaped like a small
horn.    This is taken possession of by the tooth-
 shell Siphunculus (Siphunmlus dentalii), which,
having entered, seals up the entrance with a strong
and fixed plug of grains of sand cemented together,
leaving on one side a small circular hole, through
which it may protrude its long proboscis in search
of prey, yet small enough to prevent the entrance
of any enemy into its home. This worm is about

           COMMON OBJECTS     OF THE SHORE.       315
 three quarters of an inch long, white and opaque,
 and when seen under a microscope is found to be
 wrinkled with little rings. And it is wonderful
 to think of that instinct with which it has been
 endowed by the Creator, to find a safe dwelling
 place, constructed for it by an animal altogether
 so different from itself.
    Not less curious are the little mosaic-work tubes
 of the Terebellae. Many species of these worms
 frequent our own shores.       Their bodies are very
 similar to that of the Serpula, and they construct
their dwellings by spreading out their tentacula
on the sand, till such pieces as they there select
 are attached to them, and then brought down to
the neck. Here the tube commences, " being ar
ranged," as Professor Jones has observed, " with
as much regularity as rows of bricks, and cemented
together by the tenacious exudation, until a tube
is formed encasing the upper part of the creature's
body." This tube is sometimes several inches
long, and the whole process may be observed by
placing the Terebella in a vessel, and putting
within its reach the different materials needed for
its singular dwelling-place.
    The Terebellae inhabit the sandy shore between
high and low-water mark, usually quite buried in
it to their upper opening, but as the action of the
water sometimes raises or depresses the spots in
which they are found, they are occasionally seen
covered with sand rising some inches above them,
and at other times are left quite uncovered.
    The animal while forming its dwelling moves its
head continually, from side to side, and it expands
its feelers to the length of two inches, when it uses
them for digging particles of sand. In summer, if

316       COMMON OBJECTS     OF   THE SHORE.
deprived of its sand tube, and placed in water with
a bed of sand and fragments of shells at the bottom,
it will in the course of four hours build a new
habitation ; but in winter, when the animal is
not in full vigour, it will require an hour or two
longer for its process.
    Many of the naked annelides are very beau
tiful, and curling about in the waters of the rocky
pool, seem like glittering snakes.     Some look like
little harmless creatures, but others seem to glance
defiance at us as they dart to the other side of the
pool, and hide themselves among the sea plants or
beneath some silvery shell.
    There is one advantage which the sea possesses
above any other of the scenes of Nature in this
portion of our globe, which       is,
                                    that its aspect  is
 always beautiful under any change of season.
 Winter strips our fields and hedgerows of their
 leaves and flowers;    our streams lose their crystal
 clearness, our meadows their robe of green     ;    and
if   we linger among the woodlands, admiring the
 various forms of the leafless boughs, the strange
 wild attitudes of some, the graceful disposition of
 others, yet are they so much less lovely than in
 the time when summer clothed them in then*
 green, or autumn in their gold, that were      it   not
 for the music of the winter woods, the strange
 wild harmonies made by the winds among them,
 their beauties would not often long detain us in
 our country walk. But the sea       always beautiful,
                                    is
  always musical, in sunniest or darkest day. Now, as
it  ripples softly onthe summer shore, the little surges
 just falling on the pebbles, and making    a  sound as
  gentle as that of an April rain on the forest leaves,
it   issoothing and calming to the mind.        Its con

          COMMON    OBJECTS      OF THE SHORE.        317
tinuous sound lulls us into that state of quietness
favourable to meditation and uninterrupted trains
of thought. And when the storm-wind sweeps
over the sea, and we listen breathlessly to the
wild harpings of the waves, the spirit seems
 awakened too, the thoughts are borne away, and
blending themselves with the sublimities of nature,
 the listener seems awhile to forget in the elevation
 of the spirit, that there is yet a portion of him
 which is of the earth and mortal. It is in moments
 like these, amid the deep yearnings of the soul for
 something beyond all that the material world can
 offer, that the poet and the philosopher are first
 awakened to a new existence.             It is at moments
 like these, and amid the longings for the infinite,
 that the Christian turns with renewed gratitude
 to that Holy Record which tells of Life and
 Immortality.
    Never, perhaps, is the sea more lovely than
 when on some summer evening, after a succession
 of stormy days, it has become calmed and is lighted
up with a glow of phosphorescent brightness ;
when as the boat glides onwards—
                                " Every track
                 Is a flash of golden fire."
    Every one who has resided for any length of
time on the shore, can remember some calm nights
of this kind, when the moon shone in silvery lines
across the water, and spread its bright gleam over
its whole surface, making it look like burnished
steel. A wake of light has seemed to follow every
boat ; and if the hand was dipped into the sea, it
brought up glittering sparks which dropped from
it. If we ask some mariner how this may be, and

318         COMMON      OBJECTS OF THE SHORE.
how in the brilliant night scenes of the tropical
seas this light shines brighter still, we may per
chance be told that the light is caused by the
sheathing of the hulk striking fire in consequence
of her rapid motion. But the naturalist has a
different tale to tell, and he can show how the
phosphorescent light is caused by the masses of
the dead inhabitants of the deep, by the gleams
given out by several crustaceous animals, by
zoophytes, by various fishes and animalcules. But
most of all is this phosphorescence attributable to
the innumerable swarms of jelly-fishes, which in
the day time delight us with tints of various hues,
and compose
                         " The luminous life
          That makes the dark nocturnal ocean bright
          With constellated clusters of rare things,
          Gronp'd or apart ; seeming in lustrous grace
          Fantastic wreaths of many-colour'd gems
          Instinct with living fire : — or here and there,
          Glittering in golden glory : — flashing forth
          Metallic white — or tremulous silver, cinqucd
          By ambient tints of sapphire, pink and blue.
           As if some opulent spirit of the sea
           Had, from his treasury of precious stones,
           Flung up his choicest treasures on the waves,
           To bathe their beauties in the meek moonshine."
    In   our seas these glowworms of the deep belong
 chiefly to the Medusae, which, of microscopic
 minuteness and in inconceivable profusion, swarm
in every drop of ocean, while the larger kinds
 may often be seen gliding near its surface, and
lying in multitudes on our shores. In some regions
 the waters are crowded with myriads of minute
 jelly-fishes ; and in the Bed Sea, according to Mr.
  Salt, they teem in such abundance as to bear a
 proportion of one third or even one half to a given

           COMMON OBJECTS OF THE SHORE.            319
 volume of the water. The animals of this genus
 have a disc more or less convex above, similar
to that of a mushroom or umbrella, sometimes
 deepening into the shape of a bell. The greater
number cannot be seen in the day time, for they
 are clear as crystal, and both by their small size
 and translucent nature often escape the observa
tion, even when aided by a microscope, till night
 brings out their sparkling beauties.        And why
 were these and the other tribes of beautiful
jelly-fishes created? Were they made merely to
gratify our sense of beauty and to give us delight
 as we gazed upon them?        The beauty of nature,
its fitness of pleasing the intellectual taste of man,
was evidently deemed by the great Creator of the
universe no mean object of his care : but these
 animals have other purposes too to fulfil. When
 God said, "Let there be light" over all the earth,
yet he sent no light from the orbs of heaven, into
the depths of the sea. Light rapidly diminishes
in its progress through the water, and far away
 down in the deeps all would be darkness but for
this provision of rendering it luminous. Yet there
is an inconceivable multitude in that world of life
beneath the waters.      The fishes, which, like the
lion of the forest, seek their prey there, and choose
for their hunting time the period when man is
sleeping, need these lamps to guide their way.
Fishes will follow any luminous object, and the
angler knows that the glitter even of a newly
tinned hook will be an attraction to the herring
amid the waves; and thus the smaller animals are
caught by means of the glitter arising from the
newly dead inhabitant of the deep, which ere it
has time to become putrescent glitters with light,

 320       COMMON   OBJECTS OF THE SHORE.
 and is carried off for food ; while the lamps which
 shine from countless Medusae help the fish to
 chase his living prey.      Nor have the tribes of
jelly-fish performed all their part in creation when
 they have lighted up the darkness, and in their
 turn served as food to other tribes of animals.
 "Possibly," says Professor Jones, "the sea itself
 is fitted by their agency to be the residence of
 beings that otherwise would perish.        Not the
 least striking circumstance in the history of the
 Rhizostoma (a genus of large jelly-fishes), is its
 prodigious power of producing, from the surface
 of its body, quantities of mucus or thick slime,
 which is of course mixed up with the surrounding
water.    Whence this material is furnished, is even
yet a question ; but so copious is the supply, that
if a specimen be placed alive in a large vessel
filled with water, in a little time the whole is
rendered thick and viscid, so that the Rhizostoma
would perish speedily from the accumulation of its
own secretions.     You change the water, but in
vain, still the abundant mucus is poured forth, nor
does it cease as long as life remains. But if a
single specimen afford such quantities of viscid
matter, we shall conceive when we reflect upon
the countless multitude of Acalephae, spread
through every sea, that their united agency must
cause important changes in the water around them,
filling it with animal substance, upon which in
numerable races may be fed, a kind of nutriment
adapted to the feeble mouths of new-hatched
spawn, or ocean's tenderest progeny."
    The whole tribe of jelly-fishes are included
under the name of Acalephte, the Greek word for
a nettle, and they are commonly called Sea-nettles,

          COMMON OBJECTS      OF THE SHORE.         321
and by the French Orties de Mer. This is a very
old name for them, for Aristotle called them so,
and it was given on account of the stinging pro
perty possessed by some of them. They have not
all, however, the power of stinging, though all are
phosphorescent.     Indeed, by far the greater num
ber of the British jelly-fishes may be touched with
safety, and Professor Forbes, in his work on the
" Naked-eyed Medusae, " mentions four species only
as being, in his opinion, gifted with this nettle-like
property.    Beautiful as are many of the creatures
of the sea, none are more lovely than the Acalephs.
Now they may be seen in the darkness of night,
moving with most graceful ease, like so many
resplendent orbs, shining singly, yet gliding from
place to place ; and now combined in vast multi
tudes, forming a broad sheet of light. The vessel
glides in amongst them, or the oar throws up the
white foam, and a shower of stars rises but to fall
in a stream of living brightness. Down below the
surface these jellies seem like balls of silver or gold ;
sometimes, as in the Girdle of Venus, of the blue
Mediterranean, appearing like a riband of flame,
of several feet long ; or, as in the yet more lumi
nous Pyrosoma, enabling the voyager to read by
their light, as he stands by the cabin-window of
the ship. Some of the larger species are described
as having the resemblance to white-hot shot, visi
ble at some depth beneath the surface.         Our own
rocky shores are sometimes studded with them as
with diamonds, and many who have trodden on the
tuft of sea-weed, have seen it shoot out, in          all
directions, rays of phosphoric light, which          re
minded them of a star of artificial firework.         So
beautiful are they, that the man of science,          in
                            Y

describing them, writes like a poet, and Professor
Forbes, speaking of one of these globular umbrella-
shaped animals (the Modeera formosa), whose
tints are white and richest crimson, says of       it,
" There    isnot a   Medusa in all the ocean which
can match for beauty with the minute creature
now before us, though its smallness   is  such, that a
split pea would overtop it. Yet small though       it
be,   ithas shape, colour, and substance so disposed,
that as yet no explorer of the sea has met with
another like it. It  is   gorgeous enough to be the
diadem of sea-fairies, and sufficiently graceful to
be the nightcap of the tiniest and prettiest of
mermaidens." Another very lovely Medusa, not
uncommon in the ocean around the Isle of Wight,
is  as clear as the water itself, and by day time can
only be seen by the rich crimson nucleus beneath
the crystal mushroom-like figure. This richly
tinted portion  is  very apparent, so that the beauti
ful Scarlet Cyanea resembles in the water a bead
 of coral, swimming beneath the calm surface of
the sea. Hugh Miller, in his " Summer Rambles,"
 gives an interesting description of some of the
 common kinds, which he saw while aboard the
 "Betsey," off the island of Eigg. At this time
the Medusae had risen from the bottom of the waters
 as the wind fell, and
                           " were mottling the green
 depths of the water below and around, as far as
 the eye could reach. Among the commoner kinds,"
                     " the kind with the four purple
 says this writer,
 rings on the area of its flat bell, which ever
 vibrates without sound, and the kind with the
 fringe of dingy brown and the long stinging tails,
 of which  I  have sometimes borne from my swim
ming excursions the nettle-like smart for hours;

          COMMON   OBJECTS   OF  THE SHORE.      323
there were at least two species of more unusual
occurrence."    One of them the writer describes as
scarcely larger than a shilling, inscribed with a
pretty orange-coloured wheel ; the other like a
small brown hazel nut. " As the evening closed,"
continues this author, " and the depths beneath
presented a dingier and yet dingier green, until at
length all had become black, the distinctive colours
of the Acalephae, the purple, the orange, and the
brown, faded and disappeared, and the creatures
hung out, instead, their pale phosphoric lights, like
the lanterns of a fleet, hoisted high to prevent col
lision in the darkness.     Now they gleamed dim
and indistinct, as they drifted undisturbed through
the upper depths, and now they flamed out bright
and green, like beacon torches, as the tide dashed
them against the vessel's sides."
    All may not have seen our beautiful Medusae to
such advantage, though most persons who have
sailed on the sea have met with masses of the
larger kind, which seemed moving along in myriads;
and all who have rambled on the shore have seen
the large gelatinous transparent discs of some,
surrounded with a fringe-like margin, dilating and
contracting as they swam just below the surface
of the water. Not a walk of any extent can be
taken along the shore, in summer time, at low tide,
but we meet with that species which is the com
monest of all the British jelly-fishes, the common
Aurelia (Amelia auritd], with a clear bluish gela
tinous disc, fringed with thread-like tentacula,
often measuring nearly a foot across, and easily de
scribed. It has four long arms with fringed edges,
coming from the centre of its umbrella-like expan
sion.    Between each pair of arms is a raised
                          y 2

 324       COMMON OBJECTS     OF THE SHORE.
 tubercle.   These are four in number, and shaped
 like horse-shoes or half-moons. They are of bright
 purple colour, and are very conspicuous when we
 see the jelly-fish swimming in the water.      These
 Medusae are extremely abundant ; sometimes, by
their numbers, impeding the course of vessels, and
 occurring all round our coast. We need not fear
to touch them, for they are stingless.
    Far different in this respect is the jelly-fish
termed the Hairy Cyanea (Cyanea capillata), a
 common animal of our seas, and one which has
 sent many a bather away with smarting sensations
 not easily forgotten.    It has a dingy brown disc,
 about a foot across, festooned at the edges, while
as it flaps along in the water it drags after it an
immense number of filaments, like tails, which
constitute the "hair," from which it derives its
name.     Woe to the bather who, regardless of the
 approach of this beautiful but terrific creature,
becomes entangled in this trailing " hair." To get
out of the tangling mass seems impossible, and
wound among its meshes, he experiences a prickly
torture, until the jelly-fish, finding its own course
hindered by the contact, uncoils its arms and leaves
the bather free to swim from its embrace.       Even
when the filaments are cut away, they retain their
power of stinging as fiercely as when around the
beautiful crystal monster which they once adorned.
The Lamarckian Cyanea (Cyanea Lamarckii), a
less common species, possesses a like power of
stinging ; and another ,species is mentioned by
Professor Forbes as stinging faintly; but these are
all the Medusae which that scientific naturalist
has ascertained as the true nettles of our British
seas.

          COMMON OBJECTS      OF THE SHORE.      325
   The largest kind of jelly-fish frequent in our
seas is the Great Sea-nettle (Rhizostoma Cuvierii),
the name of root-mouthed having been given to
the genus, because the animals composing it were,
until recently, believed to have no true mouth, but
to receive their nourishment from pores on the eight
large peduncles which hang from its centre. Like
the other Medusae, however, it is now thought to
have a true mouth.       It is sometimes two feet in
diameter, and is several pounds in weight. Yet if
this large jelly-fish is left on the shore but a few
hours only, nothing remains of the mass but
a number of small films. The jelly of the living
animal is composed entirely of large cells of fra
gile texture, arranged with exquisite regularity,
differing in form in the various species, and filled
with a fluid which seems to resemble sea-water.
In some species when this evaporates, nothing is
left but a stain on the stone where the jelly-fish
lay. This, as well as other species, has a great
sensibility to light, several of the smaller Medusae
being known to sink into deep water to avoid
a bright light. Though it seems doubtful if they
are gifted with eyes, they, like some other crea
tures low in the scale of animal life, appear to be
endowed with senses, which give them perception
in a manner of which we can form no idea. A
writer on this subject records that he once saw
a shoal of the Great Sea-nettle of our coasts,
swimming high with the tide off Seaton, during
calm weather. As these animals approached the
boat, over whose side the writer was looking, they
gradually sank in the clear glassy sea, and it re
quired some dexterity to catch, with the boat-
hook, only one or two of the great numbers which
                           Y 3

326      COMMON OBJECTS     OF THE SHORE.
passed. The slightest motion immediately alarmed
them.    Every one who, when bathing, has tried
to catch a jelly-fish, knows how difficult is the
capture, as they glide away from the approaching
hand, and were it not that the wave dashes them
against us, we should probably rarely succeed in
obtaining one. Our common species are termed
Sea-blubbers, Sea-dangers, Falling-stars, or Sea-
crosses. At Dovor they are very generally called
Starch-fishes.
   A very beautiful jelly-fish, which in some parts
of our coasts is not rare, is the Globular Beroe
(Cydippe pileus), and it is a more lovely object
under the microscope than can possibly be ima
gined by those who have not witnessed it. It is
of an oval shape, often nearly an inch long, and
having eight belts of little plates on its surface,
which serve as paddle wheels.     These plates con

sist of a number of fine hairs (cilia), which are
placed side by side, like the barbs of a feather.
By means of rapid successions of vibratory action
caused by these ciliary rows, the animal is pro
pelled through the water with great velocity, the
mouth in advance, perpetually contracting and
dilating, and communicating with a two-lobed
stomach provided with a valve. A complete whirl
pool is made around the beroe by the action of the
cilia, and the valve in the centre of the animal is
left open. This communicates, by another tube,
with the opposite pole of the globular animal. No
sooner does a small shrimp or other like creature
of the waters approach, than it is forced by the cur
rent into the mouth. Its hooked claws and fringed
arms avail it nothing.     The valve is closed upon
it, the nutritious part of the victim is dissolved,
and in due time the indigestible shell and the
eyes are thrown up again in the water.       The un
 digested eyes of the shrimp, seen in the stomach,
have been sometimes mistaken for the organs of
the beroe.      It is generally stated that the long
filaments at the side of the beroe, covered with
the tendrils, are a means of securing prey.        An
intelligent naturalist, a friend of the writer's, who
 has made microscopic observations on this animal
 taken from the shore of Dovor, is of opinion, that
 these tentacles serve only as anchors to hold the
 animal fast to any object to which it may choose to
 attach itself.   Some small shrimps were placed by
 this gentlemen in a vessel of water, with the
 beroe ; one of these became accidentally entangled,
 and was dragged, apparently without design on
 the part of the beroe, into the receptacle of the
                          Y 4

 328       COMMON OBJECTS     OF  THE SHORE.
 tentacles.   This part has no connexion with the
 digestive tube, and is evidently designed solely
 for the reception of these long arms, when the
 animal chooses to withdraw them and to remain
 a simple globe.     After some time the tentacles
 were again protruded, and the shrimp escaped,
 evidently uninjured. Its mode of catching its prey
 was by this gentleman, after much observation,
 deemed to be wholly irrespective of these long
filaments, which the beroe appeared to use as
 cables for keeping itself firm in its position, and
 by which it held fast even to the smooth surface
 of a glass vessel.
    Like all other jelly-fishes, the substance of the
 beroe seems but a few filmy cells, filled up with
 a material like sea-water, which soon dissolves,
leaving scarcely any trace of the animal behind.
The naturalist just alluded to, having confined one
of these animals in a cylindrical glass vessel,
observed, that after the lapse of about twelve
hours, it appeared to undergo a gradual dissolu
tion of its substance, commencing at the upper
pole, around the tube extending from the mouth
to the stomach.     In a few hours the whole of the
upper half of the body had dissolved, leaving the
digestive tube standing like an isolated pillar at
the centre. Notwithstanding this mutilation, the
animal appeared to be as lively as ever, gliding up
and down the glass with the same easy and rapid
motion. At length the stomach and mouth fell
off, and it underwent a gradual reduction of its
dimensions,    retaining its activity to the last.
Finally, the tentacula fell away, and the last
trace of the crystal ball of the beroe, which was

           COMMON OBJECTS         OF  THE SHORE.         329
to be seen, comprised not more than a fortieth
part of its entire substance.         To this was attached
a portion of one of the ciliary bands, by means of
which this fragment of the animal moved rapidly,
so long as any remains of it were visible in the
water.
   The enthusiasm with which observations like
these are made and described, is easily partaken by
such as have an eye for the beauties and wonders
of nature. The utilitarian smiles at such pursuits,
and valuing science but as it may contribute to
the promotion of wealth or of physical comfort,
would deem an hour idly spent in watching the
structure of an animal under a microscope.               Yet
these minute wonders were made by the God who
formed the sun and stars, and who inspired the
records of Sacred Writ; and if they fix on our
minds one fresh idea of his power and goodness,
we have not looked on them idly. There are many,
too, who receive exquisite enjoyment in such
pursuits, and some now pining in sadness, and con
sumed by the one painful idea of the past or the
present, might be cheered, could they but be once
awakened to an interest in natural history.              The
poet could appreciate and describe the feelings
belonging to the lover of nature :
    " One made acquaintanceship with plants and flowers,
     And happy grew by telling all their  names  ;

330     COMMON OBJECTS           OF   THE SHORE.
   The globular beroe is common on many parts
of our sea-coast. It has been found at Sheerness,
and is by no means unfrequent at Dovor.         The
fishermen say of it, that   it the spawn of the sea-
                                 is
egg.    Some of the species are to be found in most
seas, swimming along with great rapidity, by
means of their myriads of minute cilia.     Like the
other acalephs,it   isnot possible to preserve them
for any length of time.
   The colour of the Greenland sea, varying from
ultra-marine to olive-green, was found by Mr.
Scoresby to be caused by the innumerable jelly
fish of the tribe of medusae which swarm there.
These animals are found in the bluish-green water
in great profusion, but in the olive-green they are
innumerable. Mr. Scoresby calculated that a cubic
fathom of this water would contain 23,000,872 indi
viduals; andacubical mile, 23,888,000,000,000,000.
He adds, that allowing even that the depth to
which these animals extend be but two hundred
and fifty fathoms, the above immense number of
one species may occur in the space of two miles
square.    And in order to give a better idea of the
 amount of medusae than the mind can gather by
reading statements made in          large number of
                                      a
arithmetical figures, he says    ":Allowing that one
person could count     amillion in seven days, which
is  barely possible,   itwould have required that
 eighty thousand persons should have started at the
 creation of the world, to complete the enumeration
 at the present time."    Twenty or thirty thousand
 square miles of this sea are thus coloured by the
medusae;    how then shall the mind of finite man
conceive of the numbers of these living creatures,

          COMMON OBJECTS     OF THE SHORE.       331
formed by their great Creator, and preserved by
his constant care !
   Lowest in the scale of animal life, yet won-
drously constructed as are animals of highest organ
ization, are those singular productions, the Sponges,
springing from the marine rocks or sea caverns,
or growing down in the waters of ocean, or occa
sionally clustering in the clear rivulet.    As they
branch forth from the rocky fissure, resembling
plants in their form, ramifying, like them, accord
 ing to local circumstances, having nothing which,
 at first appearance, would indicate an animal
 nature, it is not surprising that zoologists deemed
 them of vegetable origin, or at least regarded them

332      COMMON OBJECTS     OF   THE SHORE.
as forming a   link between the animal and vegetable
kingdoms.     Since the day when that close observer,
John Ellis, a merchant of London, made accurate
observations on these productions, writers have
still varied in their opinions as to their nature, till
Dr. Grant satisfactorily proved that the marine
sponges, at least, are certainly animals.    Dr. John
ston enumerates fifty-six species of British sponge ;
but these cannot be described merely by their ex
ternal appearance, as the same species will often
assume a great variety of forms.     In order to study
the sponges, we must look at them under a micro
scope, and direct our attention to the nature of the
framework.      Taking a small portion from the
common Mediterranean sponge of our toilet tables,
and placing it under a microscope, we see that it
is composed of a number of elastic horny fibres,
crossing each other in all directions, and forming
a complete network of meshes, through which the
                          water is absorbed, andpasses
                          through every portion of the
                          sponge.     Countless pores
                          cover the surface of this
                          network, and hence a cur
                          rent of water goes towards
                          the centre whenever the
                         sponge is dipped in liquid.
                         But besides these minute
                         pores, there are large and
                         distant canals, having larger
orifices on prominent portions of the body of the
sponge, and during the life of the animal the water
is, by means of some vital force, gradually collected
into these channels, and forcibly expelled through

the openings, thus making two counter cur
rents.
    The living animal of the sponge can, of course,
only be seen in the newly-gathered specimen.         It
consists of a gelatinous, filmy substance, similar to
the white of an egg, and varying in quantity in
the different species.   If   a small portion of this
be placed under a microscope, it exhibits minute
transparent grains ; and yet this gelatinous sub
stance, spread out upon the network, the skeleton
which itself has made, separates from the sea such
substances as shall nourish        it,
                                    and serve for the
fabrication of its own peculiar structure.
    The opposing currents of water, during the
entire life of the animal, are described by Dr.
 Grant as most rapid and remarkable. Having
brought one of the larger apertures of the Spongia
coalita under the microscope, this writer describes
it  as
        " living fountain, vomiting forth from cir
          a                                     a
cular cavity an impetuous torrent of liquid matter,
 and hurling along, in rapid succession, opaque
 masses, which it   strewed everywhere around   ;" and
after having watched this orifice at short intervals
for five hours, sometimes looking at for a quarter
                                         it
 of an hour at time, the stream was seen still to roll
              a
 on with constant and equal velocity. Dr. Grant's
          a
 description of these fountains in the Spongia pani-
 cea is  no less striking.  " Two entire specimens of
this sponge were placed together in glass of sea-
                                         a
 water, with their orifices opposite to each other,
 at the distance of two inches      ;they appeared to
 the1 naked eye like two living batteries, and soon
 covered each other with the material they ejected.
I   placed one of them in  a   shallow vessel, and just
 covered its surface and highest orifice with water.

334       COMMON OBJECTS      OF THE      SHORE.
On strewing some powdered chalk on the surface
of the water, the currents were visible to a great
distance ; and on placing some pieces of cork or of
dry paper over the apertures,          I  could perceive
them moving by the force of the currents, at the
distance of ten feet from the table on which the
specimens rested."      And thus the wondrous ope
rations of nature, till lately unsuspected, have been
continually going on since man first awoke to light
and life ; the knowledge of which reminds us how
much there may be still in the world around us of
which as yet we know nothing.           Surely the philo
sopher may well be the humblest of men, since he
best knows the degree of man's ignorance and the
finite nature of his understanding.
   The young eggs or gemmules of the sponge are
attached to the inner sides of the canals, and are,
when fully formed, clothed with the minute hairs
which serve so important a part in the economy of
many small marine animals.             Here again they
are useful in forming currents in the water around
them, by means of their rapid and incessant mo
tion, and these currents carry away the young egg
of the sponge into the   sea, till it fixes itself in some
rocky crevice, or on some sea-weed or other object,
and springs up like a little tree, or forms itself into
a ball or cup, or takes any other form, according
to its species and the circumstances under which
it grows.
    Additional strength is given to the framework
 of some kinds of sponges, by calcareous or flinty
minute crystalline spicula, which, small as they
are, are capable of scratching glass. The existence
of these in our British sponges, as well as the
 smaller growth of these productions, render them

           COMMON OBJECTS   OF  THE SHORE.        335
unfit for domestic purposes. The sponges with
thorny framework belong mostly to the seas of
warmer zones, though even our common Turkey
sponge may be seen, on reducing it to ashes, to
contain a small portion of flint. The forms of the
spicula are invariable, and therefore constitute a
good characteristic of species.
    Our native sponges have not the grotesque
 shape of the larger kinds belonging to tropical
 seas, where balls, inverted cups, fans, and mosses
 seem represented by them as they hang among
 the fissures of the rock. Yet with us they fringe
 the rock or sea cave, branching out like trees, or
 grouping in rugged and irregular crusts, or clasp
ing around the various olive-green sea-plants, or
forming a soft carpet on some rocky ledge. Their
brown or sandy-coloured branches lie about on the
beach, or sometimes we find them, as in the case
of the smallest of our native sponges (Spongia
confervicola) , growing among the hair-like green
Arctic conferva on the rock, and contrasting its
brilliant white colour with the dark green tint of
that sea-weed. In some cases, as in a common
sponge (Spongia fluviatilis), the colour varies from
bright green to pale brown, according to the action
of light, inducing many naturalists to think, that
though marine sponges are undoubtedly of an
animal nature, yet the fresh-water sponges may
belong to the vegetable kingdom.       Many of our
native sponges grow within reach of the tide,
others down below in the deeper waters, where
they become of more compact structure, and are
less easily rent by wind or wave.
   Our figure will enable the reader to identify
one frequent object of our shores, the common

 branched sponge (Halichondria oculata).       It is
 usually of a pale sand-colour, though sometimes of
 a darker brown. It varies much in the disposition
of its branches, for sponges differ more than many
other marine productions in the form of the indi
viduals of a species. It is frequently to be seen
hanging from the under surfaces of the rocks, at
about the low-water mark of spring-tides.
   Aristotle told of the sponges, that they shrank

when touched.          That the Greeks used them as
•we do for domestic           purposes, is evident from
their name, which is derived from the Greek word
to squeeze.        Homer, too, relates how Vulcan
obeyed the command of Thetis :
       " First from the forge
                              dislodged, he thrust apart
         His bellows, and his tools collecting all,
         BestowM them careful in a silver chest ;
         Then all around with a wet sponge he wiped
         His visage and his arms and brawny neck."
    To those who love to stray among the wild
solitudes of nature,
         " To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell,1'
there is something very delightful in the nooks
among the crags at the base of the cliffs. Some
little plants that love the saline air, some green
patch of grass or bright flower, has found a place
on which to spring, and may form a cushion for us
on the jutting crag.          And there, far away from
the haunts of men, the tall white cliff overhanging
him and contrasting with the deep blue sky, the
wild murmuring of the sea, the strange shrill
screams of the sea birds, seem to awaken the echoes
of the heart —
           " The universe's inward voices cry
             Amen to either song of joy or woe,"
and the human heart responds alike to the wail
or mirth note of nature.                The sea-gulls come
crowding or singly,      —
            " Each on its separate track of life,
              And each a mystery."
   We have many species of these birds, and the
common gull (Larus canus) may be seen cresting
                                z

            COMMON OBJECTS    OF  THE SHORE.
the billow, fearless of storm, or covering, with
others of its tribe, the crags of the rocks in count
less numbers. The prettiest species is the laughing
gull (Larus ridibundus), which is common on our
coast during winter, but leaves the sea when spring
returns, and wings its way inland to build its nest.
It is of a beautiful pearly grey colour, changing in
the winter season to a white, and its head is of a
blackish brown hue. It skims lightly over the
water, for like the other gulls it cannot dive, but
it feeds on the fishes and other marine animals
which come near the surface, or on the insects of
the moist inland spot where it builds its nest;
 and when seen at a distance, looks so like a dove,
that we might fancy it a messenger from some ark
upon the waters.      Tempestuous weather is looked
 for when the gull flies inland, and Scottish records
 relate how when flocks of sea-gulls come in from
 the shore, a storm from the south-east is sure to
 follow, which being over, they will return to the
 sea again.     The gulls are restless, screaming crea
 tures; their song is doubtless one of joy, and
 though we might in the woodland deem it harsh
 and dissonant, yet its wild shrillness seems so
 adapted to the lonely and rugged places where it
 is heard, that it has its own music too.
     The sea-swallows are graceful creatures, too,
  and much like our land swallows.         The common
  Tern (Sterna Hirundo) skims in great numbers
  over the waves which wash our southern shores,
  and its grey wings and black-topped head are a
  familiar sight.   And when storms have been ra

so great, seems even yet to be foaming    with rage,
perchance some stormy petrel (Thalassidroma pela-
gica) may be seen darting about over the waters
close to the shore, or coming to seek refuge on the
cliff. It is common at such times around the coast
of England and Scotland, and is a bird something
like a swift, with a short compressed bill, and the
smallest of all web-footed birds.     Large flocks of
these petrels often appear far from land, and the
mariner, with the superstitious feeling common to
those who live in mountainous places, or far away
out at sea, or in other lonely regions, looks on them
as messengers of the storm, and associates them
with all the wild terrors of the tempest, the broken
mast, and the shipwrecked vessel, and the drowning
sailor. The name of storm-finch has its synonyme
in the French Petrel Tempete, and the Accello
delle Tempeste of the Italians ; and the sailors give
the bird the name of Mother Carey's chicken, from
one who was supposed, in darker times, to be a
witch, and, able to raise a storm by her machina
tions, sent out our little birds as forerunners of
evil. That their appearance forebodes a tempest,
is often true, but their instinct leads them, in the
time of coming danger, to hover in the wake of the
vessel, asif, like some other of the lower animals,
they relied on the presence of man for safety. Yet
even when skies are blue, and the waters are calm
as the silvery lake, the petrel follows the ship,
sometimes for days, gathering up for its food such
refuse as may be thrown from it.       Sleepless and
untiring, skimming lightly over the water with
unfailing wing, and only gently touching its sur
face, they seem almost to walk upon the sea, and
Mr. Yarrell says that its name of petrel was

340       COMMON OBJECTS OF THE SHORE.
given to this bird from the apostle Peter, because
of this circumstance.
   On our northern and western shores vast flocks
of those antiquated looking birds, the Puffins, con
gregate in the spring, and stay till the autumnal
winds warn them to depart for the warmer shores
of Southern Europe. Venerable birds are they,
looking down from the ledges of the lofty cliffs on
which they have perched themselves, as if they
were moralizing on the follies of mortals below;
or keeping their sharp keen eyes fixed on the
waters, till some fish appears near the surface,
when they dart down and capture their prey.
Their allies the Auks, and the Guillemots, called
Wild Willies on some of our coasts, also cover some
of the cliffs in unnumbered flocks, making such
a confused noise, as if quarrelling and screaming,
that their shrill cries seem almost to bewilder the
wanderer below.
   The dark dusky-looking Cormorants may be seen
on our southern shores, spreading out their wings
to dry their plumage, which, unlike that of many
diving birds, gets thoroughly wetted by their
plunging under water. Sometimes as we watch
this bird, we may see its head emerge from the
sea, but it pursues its prey down beneath the sur
face, and devours it with such voracity, that the
           "
proverb, as greedy as a cormorant," is a familiar
one.    It is provided by Almighty skill, for the
purpose of feeding on larger fishes than can be
swallowed by most birds, with a very large gullet
or tube, between the mouth and stomach, and it
is said even to be able to swallow a flat fish.   Its
digestion   is so rapid, that a tame bird has been
known to eat three or four pounds of fish twice in

         COMMON    OBJECTS OF THE SHOKE.         341
a day.  The cormorants can dive down on their prey
from the greatest height with almost unerring cer
tainty, and having seized a fish, will emerge from
the water with the fish across the bill, with sudden
twirl throw it up in the air, catch it head foremost,
and swallow it.
   The black cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) is a
common bird of the shores. It is to be seen in
great numbers on the cliffs of the Isle of Wight,

342        COMMON       OBJECTS    OF  THE SHORE.
making      its sea-weed nests.            The Rev. C. A.
Johns, in his       " Week at the Lizard," describes
the cormorant as an unfailing visitor on the rocks
in that district.         "One low rock in particular,
near Pen Olver," says the writer, "has generally
on it a conclave of twelve or more birds, solemnly
digesting their last meal, or expanding their wings
to the sun, while in the water a solitary head at
intervals shoots up, jerks itself from side to side,
and immediately disappears."
   The Gannet or Channel Goose (Sula alba) re
sides constantly on our coast, and has great strength
of wing, soaring over the sea, and darting into it
with inconceivable rapidity.             It is a white bird,
with black-tipped wings, the young ones resem
bling downy balls like powder-puffs. It is of great
value to the people of St. Kilda, both for its
number of eggs and soft down.
   Vast crowds of ducks and geese come to us in
the winter months from colder regions, and some
make their dwellings on the coast, while others
build their nest inland. The loud noise made by
a flock of these as they pass in some winter's day
over our heads, has a singular sound, and accus
tomed as we are, from childhood, to deem that the
rustling of their wings, tells of coming rough and
cold weather, they scarcely receive a welcome.
Many, however, can remember when, in their early
days, they had the fancies which Clare describes
as in the mind of the shepherd boy :
     " He  hears the wild geese gabbling o'er his head,
       Then, pleased with fancies in his musings bred,
       He marks the figured forms in which they fly,
       And, pausing, follows with a wondering eye,
       Likening their curious march, in curves or rows,
       To every letter which his memory knows."

    The goosander, the smew, and other birds fre
quent the shore, while grebes and divers dash
down into the waters after the fish, and the pied
oyster-catcher seats himself on the rocky crag,
not so much delighting in the oyster from which
it has its name, as in the resistless limpet and the
mussel, which have little chance against the attacks
of its strong bill. This bird is also called Sea
Woodcock and Olive. It is very common on the
low flat coasts of our
island,     its    beautiful
glossy black wings and
back contrasting with
the white plumage of its
breast and the under
portion of its expanded
wing. It lays its eggs
on the low ground or
 shingle. They are four in number, of pale olive-
 green, blotched with white.
    The loud solitary whistle of some lone curlew
 (Numenius arquatus) has an almost thrilling sound,
 as we listen to it at some distance, while the clear
 shrill tones uttered by the large flocks of curlews,
 or the notes of " courlie, courlie," which they utter
 as they sweep around the head of one who ap
 proaches their nest, heard when alone on the shore,
 far from human habitations, are among the wildest
 of the tones of nature. These birds, as well as
 the oyster-catcher, belong to the tribe of waders,
 and are adapted for wading in search of food, by
 having the greater part of their legs free from
 feathers.     In this tribe, too, we find those joyous
 little birds the sandpipers, sometimes called Sea
  Snipes.     These birds frequent all parts of our

coast.   Troops of the Dunlin (Tringa variabilis),
which Buffon called the Sea Lark, appear sometimes
like a dark cloud, while we see their backs only,
but immediately after, all in a moment, as if under
the command of some one which all the other
birds obey, every individual will turn up at once,
and almost dazzle us by a sudden display of the
white and silvery under plumage.        It is most
amusing to watch them as they run along. They
seem very types of mirth and sprightliness, moving
their tails up and down, and uttering a low gentle
note, as they seek their food among the shingle or
on the salt marshes near the sea.       The dunlin
makes a neat little nest, and its eggs, of greenish
grey, tapering at one end and spotted with brown,
are always four in number, and are disposed in the

the bird may cover them while sitting.
   The limits of this little work have allowed hut
a passing mention of a few of the many birds of
our coast, but all have seen them skimming over
the sea, or diving into                   it,
                              and have heard their
wild cries. Like all birds, they seem happy crea
tures, till the fowler comes, with the just right
which God has given him over the lower animals,
and takes some of them for food, and others for
their downy plumage or till some cruel marksman,
                                ;
who needs them not, and who has no regard for
their grace or beauty, aims at them as they are
rejoicing in God's sunshine, and leaves their dead
bodies to float on the waves, or sends them, with
crippled wing, to endure the short remains of life
in pain and misery. It would be well could all
feel with Cowper's gentle pleadings for kindness
to the lower animals, and come to the same result
as did the poet in his arguings, —                    •
                   " The sum    this

As God was free to form them at the first,
