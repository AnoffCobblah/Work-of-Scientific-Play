               lONDERS abound in            the Ocean,     It is a world in itself, and
                    is subject to its own laws.
                        "In   this great and wide sea are creeping things in
                    numerable,    both small and great."
                        Animals,   plants,     and insects  have    a  home    within its
                   waters,   far beyond the domain or even the reach of Man.
                        In the present Volume — a Companion Volume to " The
World at Home " — the Wonders of the Sea are brought under the reader's
notice.
      The fantastic forms and shining            creatures that people the recesses of
the Deep are here placed before him.
      The object aimed at has been to allure him to the study of the great
book of Nature,       rather   than to perplex him with           a    strictly scientific
arrangement.
      The various chapters are amply illustrated with Drawings                taken from
life, and on which the utmost care has been bestowed.

   THE SEA AND ITS WONDERS.
                  CURRENTS IN THE SEA.
A   modern writer has said that the waters are the greatest         travellers upon
the face of the earth.
     They   go up   by the mountains, and down by the valleys.             They are
always on the move, ever restless, and ever changing.
     They move about by currents.          A  current is like a river in the ocean,
that goes winding on, in its own proper route, starting from its own point
and reaching its own haven.
     The great wide sea is full of currents.          Some   of them are icy cold  ;
others are warm and genial.
     In  the seas of the Torrid Zone, the water is warm on the surface.         But
it is not warm below.       At   some depth the water is very cold.
     It  is cold, because   an    icy current is flowing beneath.      This current
comes from the Poles, and flows to the Equator.
     It flows beneath,    because its coldness makes     it heavy.   Heat expands
bodies, and makes them        light and buoyant.       Cold condenses and makes
them heavy.
     The water on the surface       of the sea is heated   by the rays of the sun,

14                                RAIN AND DEW.
and goes streaming along and making warm currents.            These currents flow
away from the Equator to the Poles.          The heavy current beneath goes just
in the opposite direction, from the Poles to the Equator.
     There is another kind of movement going on in the sea.
     I  mean evaporation.
     You   see this happen every day.      Particles of water fly off, in the shape
of steam, from the spout of the tea-kettle.
     The same sort of thing is going on in the sea.
     Particles keep flying off, drawn up, as it were, by the heat of the sun.
They rise into the air, and, for a time at least, are gone.
     By-and-by we shall hear a little more about them.
     As the surface water keeps flying off in evaporation, the water from
below rises to take its place.
     This also evaporates in its turn.      Thus the waters keep ascending and
descending.      And, in the great body of the ocean, a constant movement,        or
circulation, is going on.
                            RAIN AND DEW.
I  AM going to tell you about the       travels of the waters through       the vast
regiou of the air.
     The particles which have flown off from the bosom of the ocean, rise, as
we have seen, and appear for the moment to be gone.
     But their work is only just begun.             Let us follow them in their
wonderful    career.    For they will descend again in rain, in dew, in hail,
and   in snow.
     How beautiful is the dew     !
     Have you not seen it sparkling on the grass like diamonds ?
     It came from the vast storehouse in the air, and was supplied by the
particles that flew off from the bosom of the ocean.
     But how did it come upon the blades of grass ?
     In  obedience   to one of Nature's laws.

                                    RAIN AND DEW.                                   17
       Every kind of body, whether animal or plant, or stick or stone, has in
 it a certain amount of heat, or, as it is called, caloric.
       During the night, each blade of grass has been giving out a portion of
 heat into the air, but receiving none from the air again         And the earth, on
 which the grass is growing, can give but very little warmth to replace that
 which is gone.       So that the blades of grass become colder than the air.
 In this state of coldness they cannot take in the moisture that comes upon
 them from the atmosphere.          So it is deposited upon them in pearly drops,
 called dew.
       If   there are clouds in the sky, the clouds throw back the heat to the
 earth,    and prevent it from being lost in space.          Thus on cloudy nights
 there is little or no dew.
       In windy     weather, there can be no dew.      The air next to the ground
 is constantly being blown       away, before it has time to get cold enough to
 deposit dew.       Consequently there is none.
       You have seen the clouds floating about in the sky.          Sometimes   they
 are   light and fleecy ; sometimes heavy and dark.           Often the setting sun
 will paint them with gold and purple and crimson.
       What makes the clouds      ?
       Those same particles which       have flown   from the bosom of the ocean.
When a warm current of air is carried into a cold region, by the winds, the
particles condense and become visible to us.
       They become, in fact, a cloud.
       Thin wreaths of clouds are sometimes       seen floating on the tops   of the
highest mountains.
       Currents of air have carried them thus high above their ancient home
in   the waters.
       Sometimes the cloud goes on getting more and more moisture.                 It
becomes too        heavy to float in the air, and it descends in rain      ;  or else
congeals, and falls in snow or hail.
      The rain, which has been thus discharged,        waters the earth.
       " He watereth the hills from his chambers."

18                            SPRINGS AND FOUNTAINS.
                         SPRINGS AND FOUNTAINS.
I  have not yet done with the vapours that rise up from the bosom of the
ocean.
     We have seen that they form dew, and clouds, and rain.              But their
career is not ended.
     They supply the sources of springs or brooks.                    <
     When the rain falls on a light soil, it sinks in, and is absorbed      by the
earth.   It   keeps  sinking deeper and deeper, till it reaches some spot where
it can get no further. The water settles in this spot, as in a kind of basin.
     Other rains come, and sink in the same basin.         Thus the basin gets full.
     Then    the water will force its way, by degrees, to some outlet, and
become    a spring.     If  the water that feeds the spring comes down from
a mountain, or has but a       little way to sink through the ground, the spring,
when it gushes out, will be cold.          But if the water that feeds the spring
has to sink to a great depth in the earth, it becomes heated, and the
spring comes forth as a hot spring.
     For  I  must tell you that the earth gets warmer the deeper you penetrate
into it.    This is a matter of daily experience.
     The colliers who are at work in a coal-pit feel oppressed by the heat
which comes from below.           And at a very much lower depth than the coal
pit all the water would actually boil.           Nay, if we went lower still, right
through the crust of the earth, the very rocks would be melted.
     So you can well understand what          it is which   makes  the water gush
forth as a hot spring.
     And there is another kind of spring, which is of the greatest use to us.
 I mean a medicinal spring.
     In this   case the water,   in its progress, has become mixed with a variety
of mineral particles.      Some    of these particles have a medicinal property.
     When the spring gushes forth, its waters may be called healing waters.
People flock to them, to bathe their crippled limbs, or to drink the draught
 which is as good as medicine.

                      CURRENTS IN THE AIR—THE TRADE-WIND.                              19
    Thus you see how simple are the materials with which Nature works her
greatest wonders — out  of which she fashions clouds, and rain, and springs,
and fountains, for the comfort and the health of man !
              CURRENTS          IN THE AIR— THE TRADE-WIND.
Nothing     seems to us so changeable        and uncertain as the wind.
    It               " bloweth where it listeth," and is out of the reach and con
         literally
trol of man.
    But even the winds are subject to laws, in the great economy of Nature              ;
and travel, not by chance, but each in its own track.
    In the Torrid         Zone, the heated   air rises high in column-like shapes, and
flows towards the Poles.
    All     the   time,    cold currents of air are flowing       from the icy Poles
towards the Equator,          and fill up the       space from   which   the heated   air
has gone.
    Thus there is a constant movement, or circulation, as well in the regions
of the air as in the sea.
     By this means the atmosphere is kept            pure.
    If    there were no causes to hinder them, the winds or currents of air
would always flow in this way from north to south.
     But as the ocean currents are turned from their course by various
obstacles, so it is with the winds.
    Several causes help to alter their course, and incline them to the west,
instead of due north and south.
    I                of them.
         can mention one
    The daily movement of the earth on its axis.
    The earth, as you know, keeps             turning round from west to      east,   and
bringing us alternate day and night.
     Now, the winds, of which I am speaking, come rushing from the Poles
to the Equator.    As they approach   they become affected by this move
                                              it,
ment of the earth.

20                   CURRENTS IN THE AIR—THE TRADE-WIND.
     The earth travels faster than they do, so that they are left behind, and
driven out of their straight course.
     The earth is going east, and they incline to the west.
     These two currents, from the       North and South Poles, meet each other in
the Tropics, and form one great current which goes from east to west.
     This is the trade-wind.
     It  is called   the trade-wind,     because  trading vessels used to be driven
along by it.       In  those  days,   steam-ships   were not invented, and sailors
depended    wholly on the wind.
     When Columbus was sailing towards the New World, he got into the
track of the trade-wind.
     He began to be frightened.          He thought,   if the wind always blew in
one direction, how could he get back         ?
     Another     traveller sailed   round the world, blown gently along by the
trade-wind.
     He came from Portugal, and his name was Magelhaens.
     He went sailing on, over a vast ocean, that was as smooth           and placid
as could be.
     He called it the Pacific Ocean, because it was so calm.
     But the trade- wind meets with many things to oppose it.
     Great pieces of land, called continents, come in its path.
     In   the Indian Ocean it is broken up, and blows six months one way,
and six months another.
     Then it is called the monsoon.
     I  will tell you   the reason   why the trade-wind cannot always blow one
way.     It is interfered with and forced back by columns of air.
     The monsoon, or trade-wind if you like to call it so, has been blowing
six months from the north-east.
     Now the plains of Asia glow with the burning rays of the sun.              The
air gets hot, and rises, as it always does when in a heated state.
     It would leave a void, but this Nature does not permit.
     Columns of air rush from the Equator to fill up the space.
     These columns meet the trade-wind and drive it back.             They make   it

                                  THE OPEN SEA.                               21
take a different course, and blow from the south-west instead of from the
north-east.
     This change in the monsoon does not take place all at once.
     The land requires a little time to heat and to cool.
     When it is going to change, the weather becomes unsettled.            Black
clouds get up in the sky.         There are flashes of lightning and peals of
thunder, more terrific than ever we have in England.            The waves toss
about,  and   are covered   with foam.      Rain falls in torrents.    There are
great floods ;  and on the land, houses     are swept away by the    fury of the
tempest.
                            THE OPEN SEA.
People who      go out to hunt     for whales, in the Arctic Seas, have a very
useful custom.
     Each harpoon thrown       at the whale, is marked with the name      of the
ship, and the date when     it was thrown.
     Thus, when a whale escapes from one ship, and is hunted down by
another, people in the second ship can tell how long it is since the animal
was wounded.
     The harpoon with the name and date is found sticking in its body.
     Now, a suggestion    occurred  to people's minds relating to the whales.
     A  whale was killed, near Behring's Strait, with an old harpoon in its
body.
     According to the date, the ship from which the harpoon had been flung
was at that time cruising in Baffin's Bay.
     If you look at the map, you will see that Baffin's Bay is on one side
of the extreme north of America, and Behring's Strait on the other.
     How did the whale make its way ?
     The only route then known was round Cape Horn, or round the Cape
of Good Hope.
     But there had not been time for the whale to take such a journey.
And it was    sore wounded and stricken, and had not the strength.

22                                              THE OPEN SEA.
       Besides, the whale           of the north has not the same habits as the whale
of the south.          It shuns        hot seas and warm regions.                           It will   not get into
the    Gulf      Stream if it can      help.
       So it could never have gone round by Cape Horn.
       It was clear that the whale had found a shorter route, and one which
mankind as yet knew not of.                      It   had found a north-west passage from one
ocean to another.
       And another thing was also as clear                                as    daylight.      There must have
been open water for the whale to swim in.
       An    open sea round the            North Pole           !
       But no human eye had ever beheld that                                   sea.    Some people laughed at
it,   and said     it   was   a   fable.
       How could there be an open                         sea       in that dreary region of ice and
snow    ?
       Had not ships been set fast, and had not brave men died of cold and
hunger      ?
       Yes   ;   but still there were winged messengers                                which kept on saying,
again and again, that such                 a   thing must           be.
       The messengers were the birds.                      The birds flew north, instead of south,
to escape the winter.
       Where did the birds all fly to                 ?    Surely not to eternal ice and snow                  !
       There was        a   young American, whose heart was set on finding                               the open
sea.
       His      name was      Elisha Kane.            He had the title of Dr. Kane given to
him.
   He had thought of the subject, and studied    till   possessed his whole      it,    it
mind.  He resolved to set out on a voyage of discovery.
   The people of America were very much interested in the success of this
voyage.
       Two ships were presented                 to Dr. Kane, and sailors came forward, and
placed themselves             under his command.                     Even ladies worked,               with their
own hands, to raise money for the expedition.
       Three things were promised by the crew of Dr. Kane.

                                THE OPEN SEA.                             23
    Implicit obedience, abstinence from intoxicating liquors, and from pro
fane language.
    Thus supported and encouraged, Dr. Kane set out on his first expedition.
    It failed. But the American people did not despair. Neither did
Dr. Kane.
    Another expedition was set on foot.
    This time, the English sent supplies from London.       They wished for
success on two accounts.      They wished to spread the knowledge of the
Bible through the most remote regions.    And they wished to gain tidings
of Sir John Franklin, who had been lost in his attempt to find out the
North-West Passage.
    This second expedition set out under the command of Dr. Kane.
    Dr. Kane was scarcely thirty years of age ; but he had been      a great
traveller.

24                                THE OPEN SEA.
     He had influence over his men.      He was full of hope, and kept assuring
 them   of success. He was strong, and patient, and enduring.
     But the powers of the North — ice, and cold, and frost — met and battled
with him at every step. Winter overtook him speedily.           He was shut up
six months in the ice.
     The second winter found him still searching in those frightful regions.
     It  killed nearly all his men.   Only eight were left alive.  If it had not
been for the kindness of the Esquimaux, he must have perished.
     The hearts of his men began to fail them.      They wanted to turn back.
     Their captain had promised them an open      sea — a grand discovery;  and
to return crowned with glory.
     But where was the open sea to be found ?
     The third winter came.      He had scarcely a friend or follower left.  He
had to depend entirely on the Esquimaux.
     In this desperate state, success was at hand.
     His men went out, one day, on an expedition.         They pushed forward,
perhaps    with the energy of despair.     All  at once, behold, there was the
open sea    !
     The open sea, after which they had sought so long and painfully, rolled
at their feet.    There were great waves dashing on the shore.
     The air was milder and more genial.          And there were the sea-birds
skimming the surface of the deep.
     Yes ; the very birds which had gone to the north to escape the cold !
     The discovery was made ; but it was bought with life.
     Dr. Kane had scarce strength to quit this region where he had suffered
so much.
     He was successful, indeed.     He had approached nearer to the Pole than
any other man.
     But nature could do no more — he reached a milder climate, but, alas       !
it was only to die   !

THE OPEN SEA.

                                   THE GULF STREAM.                                        27
                               THE GULF STREAM.
There is     a broad stream flowing         in the midst of the ocean.          It does not
mix with the rest of the       sea.   Its colour is different.       In some parts     of its
course  it is vividly marked by       a deep blue tint.
    You may      see  the line where, on either side, it touches the surrounding
waves.     A  vessel   will sometimes be      half in the stream, and half out of it.
    The stream is so warm, that to get into it is like getting into summer.
    It happens now and then that a ship's crew, tired with battling with
the winds, and half frozen with cold, will run their vessel into it.                   Here
they find warmth and comfort, and can bathe their benumbed limbs in its
kindly waters.       Then they can start on their voyage with renewed energy
and strength.
    This mighty stream flows round the world.                  It has an influence on
the climate of many nations.           It has been an object of wonder and inte
rest in all times.        It brings warmth, and genial weather, wherever it
approaches.
     It is a benefactor of the world      !
     The name of the stream is the Gulf Stream.
     It is called so, when it emerges from the Gulf of Mexico.
     The Gulf of Mexico is full of hot currents and streams               ;  indeed,  it has
been said to be    like a caldron.
     When the Gulf Stream issues from this caldron,             it  is a rapid current of
warm water, which flows across the Atlantic Ocean.                 When     it  reaches  the
Azores, it divides.       Part of the stream is driven towards Europe.                   The
other part flows towards the western coast of Africa, and returns to the
Equator, from whence it set out.
     The stream will have performed a journey of twenty thousand miles.
     The Gulf Stream carries many productions of the Tropics                   to the shores
of colder countries.
     Tropical   fishes   are  found swimming         in its waters.       They go along
with it to colder regions — keeping in the stream, or            else  they would die.

28                            THE REGION OF CALMS.
     Before America was discovered,       it brought  seeds, and fruits, and trunks
of trees from the new and unknown world beyond the sea.
     But the warmth it brings is the most important.           You would scarcely
believe the amount of heat it spreads over the Atlantic, and carries with it
to the shores near which     it  flows.
     There are pleasant spots on the coast of France, where invalids can
enjoy a summer climate all the year round.            Figs and vines grow out of
doors, and ripen   their fruits.
     This is owing to the happy effect of the Gulf Stream.
     Further south there are places where the climate is cold and ungenial,
and where neither vines nor figs can flourish.
     This is owing to the absence of the Gulf Stream.
     England itself would be a dreary country without the Gulf Stream.
Our ships could never have sailed to every part of the world.               For our
ports and harbours would have been blocked up by ice.
     The Gulf Stream makes itself felt even at Spitzbergen, which, you know,
is a great deal further north than Iceland.
     It is thought that some such warm current has reached the Pole, and
caused the open sea, about which        I have told you.
                          THE REGION OF CALMS.
There is                                      " The
            a region called by the sailors           Region of Calms."
     It lies on either side of the Equator, and forms a belt or zone.
     Here reigns a perfect serenity of the atmosphere, a dull, dead calm, that
the sailor dreads more than anything.
     He has been sailing over a flowing ocean, rippled by the welcome breath
of the trade-wind.     Overhead,     the bright blue sky has been unstreaked by a
single cloud.
     He leaves this happy region behind.         The sky is overcast.    The waves
cease  to be tipped with silver foam.
     He comes to a belt of heavy cloud.             The winds are hushed,       and

                                  THE MOTIONLESS SEA.                                    81
thick vapour hangs undisturbed in the air.                 The surface of the sea is like
lead.
     He feels oppressed, and half choked by the atmosphere.
     The part of the ocean he is now traversing is called the cloud ring.
     A mass of accumulated vapour collects in this ring. It pours down in
torrents of rain.      The rains are almost unceasing.               Sailors can sometimes
scoop up fresh water from the surface            of the briny deep.
     Though it is the region of calms, there will often be frightful storms.
     Without any warning, furious tempests will arise, and hurricanes sweep
round in a circle.
     Happy is the sailor when he turns his back on this unpleasant region,
and his good ship once more ploughs the waves, urged onward by the cheering

                              THE MOTIONLESS SEA.
Is  there such a thing     in the world      ?
     Yes.      At  one time, winds and storms alone drove ships into its deserted
waters.       But now, people who go to the gold diggings sail across it.
      It  is like the Dead Sea.       It lies quite out of the usual tracks and roads
across the ocean.
      Birds drop off from the vessel, when she comes hither.
     There has been a flock of feathered companions flying over the deck or
settling on the mast.
     The sailor in these lonely seas, far away from sight of land, loves to see
the birds.      They cheer his solitude.

82                                            THE CYCLONE.
      The sea-gull, the petrel, the albatross keep faithful to the ship.
      Often a cloud of birds will surround it.   But when the ship gets near
to the Motionless Sea, the             gull does not like to go any further.                 The petrel
skims away, and is seen no more.                          The great albatross forsakes           the crew,
and lags behind.
      On the vessel passes, into a region of silence and of death !
      The air is still as the grave. There is no note of bird, no hoarse music
of the waves.           The very waves are dumb                 !
      Where is the Motionless Sea               ?
      In   the Southern            Ocean.     It    lies between two great currents of water
that are flowing in contrary directions.
      One is a streamof icy water from the South Pole.  It is so cold that it
drives all warmer currents before    instead of mixing with them.
                                                    it,
    This cold current makes the South Pole so terrible to visit.     Neither
man nor beast can live there.
      But from the Tropics comes another current, to meet the cold                           one.     This
is   warm and genial.
      There     is   an angle or corner        of ocean between these two currents.                   And
here lies the Motionless Sea.
      The cold current        is   called Humboldt's Current, because the great traveller
Humboldt found out where    started from.
                                        it
   You can find   in the map of "currents in the sea."

                                      THE CYCLONE.
There      is   nothing which sailors dread so much at sea as                  a   tempest.
   In      these days, there are signals, called storm-signals,                put round the coast
of Great Britain, to warn captains of ships when a storm                               coming on.
      Then, they do not start on their voyage till the storm                     is is   over.
      Out in the deep wide            sea,   away from every trace of land, there can be no
storm-signals.
      But the sailors know very well what                      is   going to happen.        They know

                                   THE CYCLONE.                                   83
there are such things as hurricanes and water-spouts.        And they have heard
of the terrible cyclone.
     What is the cyclone   ?
     A fierce tempest, or number     of tempests, that travel in a circle, sweeping
on and   bringing desolation with them.
     The circle they take is a very wide one.       Woe be to the poor ship that
comes   in their way  !
     Shall  I give you an account of a ship being caught in the cyclone       ?
     The ship was sailing along in the deep sea, when the waves began to
roll about, and toss and foam.       The wind blew very fiercely indeed, and
rose higher    and higher.      The ship had to struggle,     with all her might,
against the waves.       All  the  rigging   was  torn away, and she soon lay
without helm or sail, and the waves dashing over the deck and washing
everything away.
     What a terrible position to    be  in !
     The captain knew that he had come in the path of the cyclone, but
there was no help for it.      The ship had to struggle through as she could.
     Was the ship wrecked      ?
     No  ; she managed to outride the storm, and reached the port for which
she was sailing.
     But another and smaller vessel, that was her companion, and was mak
ing for the same port, was not so fortunate.        In the midst of the storm she
was lost sight of.
     The captain kept hoping that she might come after him.              Every day,
the sailors were on the look-out, for the chance of seeing a speck           on the
horizon, that might turn out to be the missing ship.
     Did they ever   see the ship again    ?
     I will tell you what    happened.
     One day, a sailor called out that he saw something.            He thought it
was a raft, covered with shipwrecked sailors, and towed along by boats.
     The sailors seemed to be waving signals of distress.        He felt sure they
were the crew of the very ship that was missing.

waves.      The captain declared    that he could see the men quite distinctly.
And he sent a steamer off to save them.
     The men on board the steamer fancied they heard piteous cries.           They
thought they could distinguish the drowning men, stretching out their hands,
and praying to be saved.
     Another minute, and they hoped         to rescue them.  — But it   was a mere
delusion.
     A number of trees    had been torn up by the tempest from the neighbouring
shores, and were being driven along by the current.        Nothing else was to be
seen.    The raft and men had vanished away like the mirage of the desert.
      Indeed, it was but another kind of mirage, and perhaps even more
cruel.
     The missing ship was never heard of.
               THE WIND-SPOUT AND THE WATER-SPOUT.
There is     the wind-spout, as well as the water-spout.     Both are very terrible
to meet with.
     The wind-spout draws or sucks up the water in the shape of a funnel.
A  vessel,   sometimes,   is hurried   into the very middle of it.     There is no
drawing back.       She is held  in the very grasp of the waters, and seems to
be at the bottom of a huge crater of a volcano.             There is nothing but
darkness around, and a streak of light overhead.         Sailors call this dreadful
           " the      of the storm."
position         eye
     All  kinds of noises stun the ear.    The rattling and groaning of the ship,
the roar   of the waves, and the howling of the wind are heard on every side.
     Every man on board must expect instant death.
      But when the ship has been sucked in by the wind-spout, and then
held suspended as it were in the air, it is let go.            The furious storm
passes onward     with a roar like thunder.       The masts are split and rent,
and the men are deafened and half stunned.            But the moment of danger
has passed.

     Is the water-spout like the wind-spout      ?
     It is perhaps more terrible.
     There is a dense thick cloud overhead,        the shape of a cone with the
point downwards.
     The sky grows dark and lurid.         The wind begins to whistle and to
howl.     And then the water-spout bursts. Lightning flashes and thunder

peals.    A cone  of the water rises up to meet the cone in the air.    The sea
is white with foam, and is lashed into fury.
     The ship, if it comes that way, is dragged into the midst of the water
spout, and often wrecked.
     Sometimes,   however, it is said that a vessel has escaped.
     How has it escaped ?
     By firing right through the water-spout, and so making a way.

86                         A LITTLE ABOUT THE TIDE.
     But  I fear this is a very rare occurrence      indeed.
     Happily, the water-spout itself is rarely met with, even in the Tropics.
     And a water-spout may not always be large and dense enough to
destroy a ship.
     Or if it is large and dense, it may go on its way, and not meet with        a
single ship to destroy.
                        A LITTLE ABOUT THE TIDE.
You   have, no doubt, seen the great Ocean many times.            You have watched
the waves    roll in upon the beach, and reach the spot where the tide turns.
     Then they would roll back again, as if in obedience to a law that
never changed.
     This movement is called the ebbing and flowing of the tide.
                                                             cttS^
                                   THE FLOWING TIDE.
    The old writers,     and the modern writers          as well,  have talked and
thought a great deal about the tide.            But all are agreed on one point.
The great flowing      wave,  called   the tide, is drawn forward, as it were
out of its place, by the influence of the moon.
     I will try to explain this to you.
    There is a law in Nature which is called attraction.

                                    A    LITTLE ABOUT THE TIDE.                                                        87
      You may have seen the loadstone or magnet draw a needle to it.
      The needle was attracted by the loadstone.
      If you   throw an apple up into the air, it will fall down again to the
ground.
      Why does it fall          ?
      Because the earth attracts it.                   It   is drawn to the earth, as the needle
is to the magnet.
      Those active feet of yours are kept to the earth by the law of attraction.
      If you   gave a spring up into the air, you would very soon come down.
The earth's attraction would bring you down.
      Birds, thatfly in the air, cannot get beyond the earth's power of
attraction.  Nothing can. There is a force in the great mass of earth to
keep things on its surface.  It is one of the wonderful laws of Nature.
     Now all bodies have this power of attraction, more or less.
      The great body of the moon has                     it,   and so has the sun.
      But the sun      is       further off than the moon, and                            it    cannot attract so
much.
      The moon draws up the great wave of ocean, which                                         is   called the tide.
      The solar tide, or tide caused by the sun,                          is    so small as to be          only per
ceived when the sun and moon both act on the water at once.
      The tides happen twice in twenty-four hours.                                   The earth goes round on
her axis in that time, and brings the same point of the ocean twice under
the direct influence of the
moon.

ter of the moon, and the beginning of the third.
     The word neap means scanty, and the neap-tide is small, or scanty.
     The height of the tide is affected, also, by other causes.
     When a strong wind comes in with the tide, it will drive on the waves
in a very furious manner.
     Sometimes the giant waves will rush in with such power, as to do a
great deal of mischief.            This is called a storm-tide.
     People who live on a flat coast, like that of the Netherlands, dread
these storm-tides.
    Far inland, they hear the roar of the waters, and on comes the flood,
bursting    the    dykes,      and sweeping everything                before   it.    Villages   and
towns have been swept away, and fertile lands buried under the sea.
                                      THE TIDE-RACE.
The tide rises much higher in some parts of the world than it does in
others.    In  the Tropics, the tide is so slight that                it is scarcely   seen.
     Sometimes      the tide does a great deal of mischief,                 and is very dreadful.
     I  will tell you why.
     There are some rivers which                  run into the sea with great wide mouths,



                                       THE TIDE-RAOE.                                  «
almost like the        sea   itself.    Indeed, such   a  river is called  an   arm    of
the sea.
      When the tide goes rushing up such a river as this, it meets a current
 or stream coming down to the sea.
     Then     it  seems to get       angry, and drives the current before      it with
fury.
     Sometimes the river will be full of boats, and then woe betide them             !
      A great wave      comes marching along as fast as a        railway train.    It is
like   a wall of white alabaster to look at.        It  will be four miles in length
and thirty feet high.
      It is a mass    of foaming water     !
      It  sweeps    over the boats, and strikes them on all sides.           Some are
sunk, others upset      ;  and others again are left untouched and in safety.
     Onward goes the great flood, but it gets less swift and less furious.
      In  fact,  it gradually disappears.
      Th en the scattered boats are picked up.           People recover their senses.
And women and children go about in the wet and the mud on the banks,
looking for things that have been lost in the confusion.
     Such a scene happens sometimes on the great rivers of China.                And it

     Sometimes this monster wave will suddenly appear in the most peace
ful moments, and when the heavens are calm and the sun shining.
     A knot of persons will be standing talking, on the banks of the Seine,
and not thinking of any evil.
     All in a moment a noise is heard, like the muttering of thunder. And
a long line of foam is seen in the distance.           This line of foam is the mov
ing mass of water coming with the tide.
     People look at each other in alarm.             They know what is going to
happen.
     It  is the mascaret.       Mascaret is the name of the wall of water.
      What is the tide-race      ?
     It  is quite different to the mascaret, and much more to be dreaded.              It
only happens in the Tropics.

    The wind dies quite away.          There is a dead calm, and the sea looks
like a lake of glass.
     But on the beach, without any seeming cause, great waves begin to dash,
and foam, and rush forward, as      if driven  by a hurricane.        The ships are torn
from their anchors, and houses are swept away by the fury of the waves.

     Towns and cities are destroyed,        or partly so,      if the terrible waves do
not retire.
     The city of Lisbon was nearly swept away, about a hundred years ago,
by the tide-race.
     I must tell you that the tide-race has nothing to do with the tide.               It
is one  of those strange events that nobody can account for.

                                    WHAT MAKES THE SEA SHINE?
There is            a very beautiful sight often visible at sea.
   Perhaps you have seen   when on a visit to the shore in the autumn.
                                                      it,
You may have stood on the beach at night, and watched a boat moving
backwards and forwards over the waves.
       Each blow of the oar struck a jet of light out of the water.                                          Some   jets
were feeble, others vivid, others quite resplendent.                                           The drops of water fell
off, from the oars,                   like      a   shower of pearls            and diamonds.          The boat itself
left   a    streak of flashing light behind                          it   as   it   moved along.
       Far out at              sea,   the sight        is    grander still.
       Ships appear to sail through an ocean of colour.                                           There are streaks of
red, and blue,                  When the vessel moves, there seems to be
                           and crimson.
fire issuing from her sides, and rolling along the water.
       Sometimes           a     troop of dolphins are seen playing about among the waves.
The effect of the shower of light which                                        falls from their shining scales,       is
very beautiful indeed.   Each drop of water sparkles like a gem.
    What occasions all this glorious show of light                                        ?
    The presence of a substance which    widely spread through the regionsis
of Nature.
       It           found in the sea and on the land.
       It   is is   called phosphorus.
       Phosphorus              is     a deadly poison, and when                     it   is   seen by itself, separated
from the bodies                  in which            it     lives,   it   looks like a little white stick of          a
waxy nature.                   It     is   so   apt to take fire, that              it   is   not safe to meddle with.
People who sell                 it,   keep      it   in water, to prevent accident.
       When          it   is   taken out of the water                 it       begins to smoke, and after a time
to burn.             The slightest friction makes                          it    burst out into a flame.         If the
hand gets burned with phosphorus, the wound                                          is   very painful, and not easy
to cure.
       Now, this burning, inflammable substance shines, in the dark, like fire.

     But how came it in the sea      ?
     Because    it exists in the bodies   of millions of creatures that live in the
water.
     Some   of these creatures are   so  tiny, that you could not see them except
through a microscope.        But when myriads of them are together, they have
a splendid effect.       They make streaks and bands of light.         Indeed, they
seem as   if they   had set the waves on fire.
     Besides   these   tiny beings, almost every other inhabitant of the ocean
has more or less phosphorus in its body.

every hand        ;  the shell-fishes,     such as crabs and lobsters       ;   and even the real
fishes, help     in this midnight illumination.
      These creatures have the power of giving out light,                     as the electrical eel
gives out electricity.
      Where does the light come from                ?
      In the     sea    anemone,     the light comes from the arms                or feelers, from
the zone or belt that girdles the body, and from the stomach.
      Here is found a sticky kind of liquid, which bathes the organs of the
body.
      The liquid is the seat of the phosphorescence.
      If you     were to mix some of it with water, in a basin, the water would
shine, more or less, as the sea does.
      One    of these light-giving creatures was once put into a small portion of
milk.       The milk became so brilliant, that people could see to read by it as
by   a lamp.
      There is a little
round ball of jelly
that floats         in the
sea,  and is too small
to be visible.
      Kit   is looked at
through       a      micro
scope,   it will    be seen
to    have       both     a

like minute flashes of lightning.
      These creatures       have perfect control over the light they give.

46                       MINUTE CREATURES IN THE SEA.
     The least agitation makes them give it out with great brilliancy.
     This was proved by a naturalist.        He skimmed some water from the
top of the sea, and filled a vessel     with it.   The vessel was full of those
minute creatures.     After the water had settled and was at rest, they ceased
to shine, and remained quite still.
     He then dropped a little acid into the water. The moment the acid
reached the little creatures, it threw them into an agitation, and made them
shine, and sparkle,   like stars dropped from the heavens.
     There are some small molluscs with two shells.
     They have such a quantity of phosphorus in their bodies, that when
they are eaten (which happens sometimes), the lips of the person who eats
them seem to be on fire.
     The name of the mollusc is Pholas dactylus.          You will hear more of
it by-and-by.
                    MINUTE CREATURES IN THE SEA
Countless     hosts of tiny creatures   live in the sea.    They are so tiny that
their very existence    would have remained a secret,      if it had not been for
the microscope.
     The microscope has brought a new world to our sight.          A world which
is beyond our power of vision, and hidden from us as much as if it were in
the clouds.
     But it is a world full of wonders, and where we find traces, on every
hand, of the goodness and the skill of our Creator.
     The minute creatures, of which     I  am going to tell you, are so small, that
a drop   of water contains many millions.       A drop of water is to them a
complete world.
     They are caUed Infusoria}.
     They exist everywhere ; in salt water and in fresh, in hot regions
and in cold.    The great rivers carry enormous quantities of them to the sea.
     In a single year, the river Ganges carries down to the ocean a mass of
infusorise  equal to the size  of the largest pyramid  !

                        MINUTE CREATURES IN THE SEA.                                    47
    You perceive that, though the smallest, they are the most numerous
creatures in the world.   Their bodies are transparent, and all kinds of
shapes.
    Some are like a bell, or a flower, or a thimble, or even a mere grain.
    The most tiny of all are called monads.      They are mere atoms, that
spin about in the water.       For   a long time, people thought that the infusoria
was a mere transparent cell, or bag, that was filled with nothing but water.
But this has been found out to be a mistake.        The creature, so far from
being a mere bag, has four distinct stomachs.
    Indeed, some of its neighbours have as many as four hundred.
    Four hundred stomachs       !
   You may imagine how difficult it is to study the habits and the
mechanism of beings so tiny. But it has been done, thanks to the micro
scope.
    I    might tell you the names of many clever men who devoted                  them
selves to this study.
    Professor Ehrenberg was one of them.
    I    will tell you how   he contrived to make his observations.
    He put a drop of coloured water on a piece of glass.   And beside     he      it,
put another drop that had no colour in     at all.
                                              it
    Then, with the point of a needle, he made a canal between the two drops.
This answered his purpose.    By means of the microscope, he saw the tiny
creatures pass from the coloured drop to the clear.    He could distinguish
their stomachs   full of colour, and could count them too, through their
transparent sides.    He amused himself with making the experiment first
with red, and then with blue.
     He saw, also, that the infusoria had fine hairs like antennae. These
hairs are called cilia.
    The cilia move quickly about, and make currents in the water. Tiny
atoms (you may think how tiny) are attracted to the mouth of the
creature, and drawn in, and swallowed.             For   it   has a mouth as   well as a
stomach.
    These minute beings swim merrily about like the fishes, or they creep

like serpents, or they twist            themselves   in every direction.   The little volvox
spins round and round on its own axis.
       They multiply in a variety of ways,     of which are very curious.
                                                         some
One creature will divide into two equal parts, each of the parts being the
exact image of the parent.  So that you have two infusoria? instead of one.
       Others drop tiny germs, or, in fact, eggs.                 You may fancy how tiny
such eggs must be         !
                  in time, begin to grow.
       These germs,                          Each of them becomes a perfect
creature, and whirls about in the sea, as its parent did before it.
     But — would you believe it possible ? — minute as the infusoria? are,
there are creatures           smaller still, who fasten upon them, and suck the juices
of their bodies    !
       These   creatures       are infusoria? likewise, but they are called         parasites,
because    they feed on others.             Some     of the parasites   have   bodies   shaped
like a tube, and are provided with short suckers, clothed with cilia.
     Others have round bodies, and possess suckers, but without the cilia.
       The first of these parasites swims about in the waters.                  When a suit
ablevictim happens to come near, it gives chase, and fastens itself upon it.
The other species, instead of swimming about, keeps still, until a victim
chances to pass and give           it   a touch.     Then it attaches itself to it by means
of its suckers, and off they both swim together.
     The parasite buries itself in the body of its victim, and multiplies so
fast, that one infusoria will have as many as fifty parasites living on it !
     I have not told you the most curious fact of all. The infusoria has the
power of dissolving itself into several parts, or even into nothing                 !
       Suppose   we disturb,         with a feather,       the   water in which    the   little
creatures are swimming.
       They will stop whirling about in a moment.
       Then, you will see a hollow place come in the tiny body of the infu
soria.    That    is,   of course,   if you   look through the microscope.
       The hollow place increases             little by little, and the entire creature      is
gradually dissolved.
       The feather was dipped in spirits of wine.                This was what agitated our

little friend so violently.    But add a drop of pure water before it has had
time quite to dissolve.
      Wonder of wonders     !
      The creature stops in its work of self-destruction !    What is left of its
body begins to swim about as      if nothing had happened   !

I  have not quite done with the world of atoms.
      Presently, we shall climb up higher in the scale of beings.  We shall see
the fish, and the bird, and the giant whale.
      But, at present, we must keep within range of the microscope.
      Take up a handful of sand from the beach, and examine it under the
glass.
      The naked eye will do us little service here.
      What do you    see in the sand  ?
      Why, a number of beautiful little shells.
      Nothing can be more elegant than their shape.       Nature  has bestowed
the greatest pains upon them.        She has not made them all alike   ; but she
has finished them off with the utmost skill and nicety.
      Yet  the whole  of them were too minute ever to be seen by man      !
      Indeed, for a long time, man did not know of their existence.         They
were first discovered in the Adriatic Sea during the last century.
      People fancied this was the only place where they existed.       But now
they are found almost everywhere.
      Their numbers surpass all human imagination.         Masses of them are
brought up from the depths of the sea.
      The very bed of Ocean, vast as it may be, is only part of the domain
they occupy !
      Their name is rather a long one, but you must try to remember it.
      They are called Foraminifera.

     With great patience, the naturalist has discovered           the history of these
minute bodies.
     They are the shells of marine animalcules.             These animalcules form an
entire order to themselves, and one of the most curious in the whole extent
of Ocean.
     You may    see by the picture what they are like.

     They arc as whimsical as possible in their shape.            Some are   like stars,
some like shells, some like mere globules.
     The shell is divided into a number of chambers, communicating                 with
each other.    It has also holes or pores, which open outside.
     But what is the creature itself made of?
     It is made of transparent jelly, and fills the chambers           about which     I
have just told you.
     The hole or pore lets out a number of long hairs or filaments.

     These       hairs move            quickly about.       They are at once hands                and feet.
The animal uses them to creep along, and also to seize its prey.
     A kind of            venom is supposed to exist           in these hairs.
     If the     animal touches its prey with them, it will appear as                         if   stupified,
and unable to escape.
    This is how it fishes for its food.
    Though so minute, it is fierce and cruel.                         It   stuns its prey   with poison,
and then devours it.
    In its own tiny world, how                    a creature    so armed      must be dreaded        !
    But    I    have another curious fact to tell you.
    These little atoms seem to have no end of resources.
    An individual can make itself a foot when it chances to want one                                     !
    When it is trying to climb up a glass, put there, no doubt, by a natura
list who is studying its history, it will push out a part of its body into a
kind of foot.
    The foot will help it to climb, as well as                        if it were      really part of its
body.
    But when the climbing                    business is over,         the foot      will   be put back
again.
    That       is,   it   will   be   received    back into the body, and the animal will
appear as      it    did before.
    Thus the will of so minute and feeble                      a   creature    is   enough to create         a
member    !
    But  I     have yet to tell you              of the great work which these minute shells
have done, and are doing now.
    We shall hear presently of a little creature that builds an island.
    These friendsof ours have built up the mountains                            !
    Under the sea there are vast banks and hills formed of their ruins.
The banks get so high by gradual accumulation, that they stop vessels in
their course, and make islands in the hot                      seas   of the Tropics.
    Often the shells are found in                 a   fossil state.        Then, they form chains of
hills and mountains.
    The great Pyramids of Egypt are built of nothing else.

62'                                      THE SPONGE.
      The city of Paris itself is half made up of these tiny shells.
      There is a quarry close by, out of which stone is taken for building the
houses, not only          in Paris, but in the neighbourhood.           The stone is full of
the remains   of Foraminifera.
  . They make part of the soil on which we walk, the houses that
shelter us, the buildings which remain from one generation to another.
      Each tiny animal furnished one particle of the mass.                  Race after race
left their minute shells behind them.            By   degrees       the work went on, and
the rock, or stone, or mountain, was formed.
      Other races are living now in the depths of the ocean, and silently
doing their work, for the benefit of mankind at some future period.
                                       THE SPONGE.
For   a long time, people could not make up their minds whether the sponge
was a plant or an animal.
      It   has neither sense nor motion, so that there is not much about                 it to
remind us of an animal.    Still, it has a kind of animal-life, and naturalists
have placed it in the lowest rank of the animal kingdom.
    I will tell you what a sponge is like when it lives in the sea. It has
a horny or stony network    of a body, a skeleton, if you like to call it so.
      This network is full of passages or holes, and is covered with a slimy
matter,     which is really the living sponge.
    The way of life which the sponge practises, is as simple as can be.        It
does not move.    It remains, all its days, in the place to which it is attached
under the water.    All it does, is to draw water through its pores or holes,
and let it flow out again.    This is the means of nourishing                    it,   for the
water   full of particles on which the sponge may be said to feed.
           is
      You       see   what a feeble kind of existence   it   has.
      The passages, which branch about in the horny skeleton of the sponge,
have often        little points or buds sticking to the sides.

                                      THE SPONGE.                               53
      These are the  little sponges beginning to grow.
      As they get larger, they are clothed with hairs or cilia, and at last
break away from the parent sponge.             They move about in the water for a
few days, their cilia helping them along.
      At length, the little sponge reaches a place where it can fix itself.
Then it fastens one end of its body to the rock, or stone, where it means to

live.    Its cilia keep    on moving very fast, but when the sponge has fairly
settled itself, they become quiet.         Indeed they never move again.

54                                              THE SPONGE.
       The little sponge is a mere drop of jelly at present.                                  But soon a change
begins to take place.
   Little spots are seen on its body, which grow into fibres.                                          They are
made of three materials — silex or flint, lime, and horn.
       All   these three materials exist in the sea.                           The cilia have been sucking
them up, into the body  of the sponge, to make the fibres of.
   The fibres keep on growing, and become a kind of network or skeleton.
The jelly-like body keeps on growing too.     It fills up all the holes and
passages in the framework, and surrounds                            it   as    well.
       This animal part can never               be   taken hold               of,   though many people have
tried to do so.         It                kind of oily substance, and dries up.

       The sponge grows in all manner of different shapes and colours.
       It makes part of the beautiful gardens and shrubberies under the water.
       It will be like vase, or trumpet, or a globe, or like the branch of
                            a               a
a    tree.
       There   is   a very curious sponge.                It   is   called          "Neptune's Glove."
                                         The sponge we use                    is    not very handsome to look
                                     at when alive.  It                  is   a     dull black above, and a
                                     dirty white beneath.
                                           It   grows to rocks deep in the sea, and has to
                                     be cut off      with a knife.                   Men dive down to get     it
                                     as   they dive for coral.
                                           There     is   a large         coarse sponge, which         is   much
                                     easier     to obtain.           It       grows along the coast, and
                                     can be drawn out                of the water by a kind of fork
                                     or prong.

                                           The man who              is   fishing, sticks the fork into the
sponge, and so carries          it   away.       But this kind of sponge                 is   not of much value.
       The better and finer sponges would                           be spoiled          by any such     process.
And these are by far the most valuable, and cost the most money.
   When the sponge      brought out of the water, its living jelly-like body
                                is

                             THE FAMILY OF POLYPS.                                57
                                  ANOTHER SPONGE.
    Do you wish to know where sponges are to be found           ?
    In many places. The Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean
Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and nearly all parts of the world.
    Fifty kind of sponges grow on our own British shores, but they are
not used in commerce.
                         THE FAMILY OF POLYPS.
There is    a  little animal found in the   sea,  in rivers, and  in lakes of fresh
water, and indeed almost everywhere.
    Its family name is Polyp.
    But it has another name besides.
    It is called the Hydra.

58                                       THE FAMILY OF POLYPS.
     You can scarcely fancy anything                       more   simple than the construction of
this little creature.
       Its body is          a mere sac or bag,         with an opening at one end, crowned
with six very slender threads.
       The opening is the creature's mouth.                       The threads are its arms, the
sac is its stomach.
       Though it looks so small and defenceless, it leads a very merry life.
It          itself to some leaf or plant that grows in the water. Then, when
      fastens
it is quite settled and at its ease, it stretches out its arms to find some
thing to eat.
       It   has an excellent appetite.                You would not believe what a quantity
it    can draw into its stomach at once.
       It    draws in more            than its little sac can hold.               And what is very
funny, it will use one of its arms to keep the food in its place.
    This happens when it has swallowed a tiny worm.  The worm would
soon wriggle out of its mouth, if one of the arms did not hold it in
the sac.
       Then the worm is digested,                  but the arm is untouched, and can                   be
drawn out as lively as ever.
       You      see   what curious things take place                in the different parts of the
great world of Nature.
    The poor worm is often a victim of the greedy little polyps.
       Those restless arms of theirs catch hold of it.                       If   it   happens to be a
great deal larger than they are, it is no matter.                          They will crowd round
it,   and embrace           it   with a network of arms, till        it   cannot possibly get away.
       But the polyps, of which                I      am    speaking, are not fond of society.
Each one lives by itself.                   And, when the battle           is   over,   it   unwinds   its
arms, and slips away                without the least confusion.
      I     must tell you that the polyp              is   so   extremely fond of eating, that          if
half its body           is   cut away, the part with the mouth will go on swallowing
just the same           ;    even though the food keeps dropping, through the opening
made by the cut, back into the water.
       Indeed,        the polyp     is   altogether   a    very odd creature.

                                      THE POLYP AND ITS HOUSE.                                     69
      If it   were cut in pieces it would not die.                     No indeed    !   Each piece
would grow into a complete polyp.
      And     if   only an arm were to be cut off, from that single arm would
spring a whole race of polyps.
     Nay,      I
            have another marvel to tell you.                          A polyp     has been turned
inside out, as you would turn a glove.
      Even this did not hurt it.                   What was the outer surface of the body
became the sac, and digested food.                   The sac became the outside.
      The polyp did not seem any the worse                       for this arrangement.      At the
same time,         it   made sundry efforts to turn          itself back again.
      I   must tell you how the little polyps come into existence.
    They grow, like tiny buds, on the body of the mother.     They are so
quick in growing, that a bud will hardly have become a polyp, before   in                    it,
its turn, puts out another bud.                 The bud springs up rapidly, and begins to
sprout.       So that a whole generation             is   seen   growing from one parent.
      When the polyp             is   old enough,   it   separates itself, and begins life on its
own account.
      These        little animals have been called               "imperfect," because they have
neither heart, nor lungs, nor head, nor feet.
      They have nothing but the mouth, the sac, and the feelers.
      Yet we        have seen that they are quite able              to take care of themselves,
to seize and devour their prey, and to repair injuries done to their bodies.
    The same gift of instinct      found in them, as in the higher animals.
                                              is
The same kind Providence has them in His care, and even the little polyp
isnot passed over, or neglected, in the vast region over which He reigns.
                                THE POLYP AND ITS HOUSE.
I    HAVE not yet done                 with the polyps.          Small and insignificant as they
seem, you          will   see   what important persons they really are.
     I    mean that race          of polyps which chooses to live, not solitary, but in            a
community.

60                         THE POLYP AND ITS HOUSE.
     These are the social, or coral-making polyps.
     They live in perfect      harmony, each in its cell.      The cells form one
entire house, or place of abode, which is quite full of polyps.
     Now, the coral-making polyp was once a tiny spot of clear jelly, that
dropped from its parent, and swam about in the water as the little sponge
did.
     This was the only period of its life when it was quite free to roam
hither and thither.
     But this state of things did not last long.
     The little jelly-like creature soon begins to fasten itself to a rock, or
to a piece of ready-made coral.
     Now mark what a change happens to it.
     It has been provided by Nature with cilia, which have all this time been
moving as quickly as possible.        While it is fastening itself to the rock, the
cilia keep on moving.        But when the creature is firmly settled, they do
not move any more.        The little jelly-like body begins to swell, and to raise
itself up in the shape of a tube.         Round the edge or the top of the tube
there comes a kind of rim.          This is the beginning of the cell, which is
going to be made    ; in fact, the house of the polyp.
     Very soon, another change takes place.       A tiny knot or swelling appears
in the middle of the jelly.      It is made up of several parts, and soon resolves
itself into the mouth and feelers of a polyp.          The feelers very soon set
themselves   to work.      The whole race of polyps have famous           appetites.
And the feelers begin to stretch themselves out, to catch food and carry it
to the mouth.
     What is the wall of the polyp's house made of ?
     Of chalk, and also of a small quantity of phosphorus.
     If you remember,    I  told you that the creatures    in the sea had a great
deal  of phosphorus in their bodies.
     The polyp takes in chalk and phosphorus from the food it eats.             The
chalk passes out, and helps to make the walls of its house. Thus the polyp
is always hungry and wanting to eat, to get more chalk to make up for
what it loses.

                                     THE POLYP AND ITS HOUSE.                                                            01
    Its house keeps growing, bit by bit.                 And it is a kind of living house,
not a dead, inanimate one.                     The body of the polyp is joined to it by a
number of tiny vessels, that pass from one to the other, so that the polyp
and its house are in reality one living creature.
    But as the polyp goes on building new parts of its tube, it keeps climb
ing up higher and higher.                     Then the old
part is left below, and becomes dead and
hard like stone.
    The polyps and their houses thus make
one structure.Living at the top, and dead
and hard at the bottom.   And this is the
whole history of the coral reef, or island.
     People who visit the coral islands go
to look at the reef, and watch the little
polyps at work.
    Sometimes,         the million of tiny arms ?t
are seen lying quiet on the water. They
are minute as threads, and are all kinds
of shapes and colours — as rose, pink, or

wants matter to feed its own body and the walls of its house.                                          So its     little
arms seize the morsel greedily, and bring  to the ever open mouth.

Scarce a drop of water                  is   without some atom that wants clearing away.
Well, there      is   the polyp ever ready to snap            it    up   !
    Thus the ocean            is   purified.      These ever-open            mouths act like so many
minute scavengers.

      But the little creatures, in the coral reef, have many enemies.   Even
in their stone houses they are not safe.
      Some bright-coloured fishes, with scales of blue mixed with green, and
as handsome as can be, are very fond of feeding on the top of the coral
reef.   In fact, they live close by    in the lake and among the breakers.

polyps one after the other.

       Where are the islands of coral found                   ?

lovely islands.
       They are called the South Sea Islands.                           But another name           is   given

       By far the greater number have been built by the polyps.

                                  a      It   encircled by a reef or ring of
                                                                  is
coral,      and you may see the vessels                     sailing round it.               The waves dash,
without ceasing, against the reef, and a long line of foam sparkles in the
sun.
     No rampart of the firmest rock could resist, in this manner, the action
of the waves.  It would in time be swept away and destroyed.        Yet age
after age the coral reef stands unhurt.                            It
                                                   in fact, a living barrier.

                                            CORAL ISLANDS.   03
       Thus,      the    coral - making
polyp,      small and       feeble    as   it
is,   may be said to conquer the
very waves of ocean.
       The water, between the              is
land and the reef,         is   smooth as
a lake, and        is   very convenient
for ships to harbour in.
       Here they may anchor in
safety, even though the storm
is    raging without.
       They       enter this safe and
pleasant harbour, through open
ings left in the reef by the little
polyps       themselves.          But for
these openings,         no vessel could
reach       the   island    within.        It
would       be dashed      to pieces on
the reef     of coral.
       Why have the polyps left
the openings        ?
       They have no doubt been
guided by instinct.
       If   the lake were quite shut
in, the water would be unfit
for them to live in.
     Streams of fresh water, that
keep flowing into           it   from the
island itself, would cause            it   to
lose its saltness;         and the    little
polyps could not carry on their
work,       without the          materials
they extract from the sea.

04                                 COBAL ISLANDS.
     It is a curious fact that the openings are always left exactly opposite
the mouths of the fresh-water streams.
     On either side of the opening in the reef is found a lovely islet, covered
with the feathery plumes of the cocoa-nut palm.              These  waving plumes
can be seen a long way off, and serve as a beacon to guide the mariner            to
the spot.
     The coral islands are not all alike.
     Here is a picture of one that is like a ring in the ocean, and has the
                                                     "                          You
lake in the middle.       Such islands are called      fairy rings of ocean."
can see that this also is surrounded by a coral reef.
     When the tide is out, the reef looks like a dry rock.
     Nothing is to be seen.      The polyps are shut up in their houses.
     But when the tide comes in, and the waves dash over the barrier, a
wonderful change takes place.        Millions of coral-making creatures put out
their arms, and the whole surface of the rock seems to be alive.
     For  a long time, people used to speak     of the coral reef as though it rose
from the very bottom of the sea.        They used to say, that the polyps worked
so hard, there was no      knowing how many islands they might build.
     Nay, they might fill the whole Pacific, not with islands, but with a
continent   !
     This has been found out to be a mistake.
     The polyps cannot live at any great depth.             They do not like cold
currents, and always work up to the         light.     So the foundation    of their
island is at no great depth, as far as the coral is concerned.
     How, then, is the island supported     ?
     On some rock beneath, which rises from the unknown depth of ocean.
From this rock the polyps begin to build.              The   rock was probably of
volcanic origin.
     Generations and generations of polyps pass away, and still the work
goes on.      At last, the structure they are forming rises to the surface of the
sea.
     Then it stops.      The polyp cannot live out of the sea, therefore it does
not build above the water.



                                                   THE SEA-FAN.                                                   67
       The island      is,   at first,   a   rough kind of platform, covered with fragments
of coral.
       The tide, as    it    ebbs and flows, leaves weeds and shells upon                       it,   so   that   a
soil   is   gradually formed.                It    rises higher       and higher.        The    crevices         get
filled up.
       Seeds, that are floating              in the air, drop on the newly-made ground, and
take root.
       In   process     of time,         grass      begins to grow, and              trees    and shrubs to
flourish.
       Birds and animals find their way there                     ;    and last of all comes Man, and
takes possession.
    Are there not great wonders going on in the ocean                                ?   It   was thought a
mighty deed for Man to build the Pyramids.    But here                                   is
                                                                                         a    polyp that has
built us an island           !
                                         THE SEA-FAN.
The coral-making polyp                   has   a   vast number of relations.              And these are at
work, in their own way, in the fields of ocean                          ;  I     must tell you what they
are doing.
       Do you see this lovely fan-shaped                      coral    ?     The lower end         is      fast to
some rock under the water, and the fan                         itself       is   stretched out,    as      though
some sea-nymph           were about to use it.
       The fanbut another kind of living house, or houses, where hundreds

surface covered with star-like polyps, whose bright little heads are gay with
all kinds of colours.
     Why are they called star-like                   ?
     Because the little creatures, that live in the fan, have   number of leaf           a
like rays round the mouth, like the rays of a star-fish.      So that the name
of asteroid has been given to them, from aster a star.
    When the sea-fan    alive, andiswaving about in the  is                               sea, a   thick jelly

taken    out of the water, and the jelly and the polyps are gone, only the
framework or skeleton is left.       That is what you       see in the picture.
    I   have not yet done     with the star-like polyps.
    There is a dull, yellow-looking thing, like a piece of sponge, or of sea
weed, that is often thrown on shore.               You might easily pass it by, as
though it had no beauty or interest.         But put the ugly thing into a vessel
of sea-water.    Now, what do you think of it ?
    It is alive with starry-headed polyps !
    They push       their tiny heads through numbers of holes.             In  fact, the
rough,    ugly thing    blossoms  all over with       these   minute flowers.      Each
flower is a separate animal.
     If  you touch the little heads,       the    polyps are frightened,     and   draw
them    in at once.     Then, the starry flowers vanish, and the coralline on

out to more than double its size, and becomes quite soft and almost like a
sponge.   Its name is Alcyonian ; you may see it in the plate.

70                                          THE SEA-PEN.
                                   THE SEA-PEN.
Have you ever looked carefully at the feather of a bird                   ?
     It  is very wonderful indeed.               Each separate plume of the feather clasps
its neighbour by a set of hinges.                 I think, however, the pen found in the
                              sea   is even more curious.
                                     Each separate       plume of the sea-pen is alive.        It
                              is in fact a row of cells, or houses, for the polyps to
                              live in.      It  has been called a street.
                                     In   these   rows of houses, the polyps live by hun
                              dreds, and eat away as usual.             What one polyp eats,
                              helps to nourish the rest.           Yet   each polyp    is quite
                              independent of his           neighbour,   and pushes     out    his
                              starry head, and draws it in, just as he pleases.
                                     It   was    once thought     that   the  sea-pen    floated
                              about in the water, and did not attach itself to any
                              thing.       But this is not correct.
                                     It  is now supposed to live with its stem buried
        TUB SEA-i'EN.
                              ip the mud          at  the   bottom of the      sea.   When a
sea-pen     has     been placed        in a vessel of water,       it has   always   remained
quite still.       Indeed, it did not seem to have               the power    of turning itself
                                                        *
over.
     But there is one thing it can              do.
     It   contains       a   great quantity of phosphorus,             and   can give     out   a
blue-coloured         light.     It   does this,     when an enemy comes near.             And,
people    think, the feeble sea-pen has but this one means of defending
itself.
     A   sudden flash of light, given out from its surface, might frighten away
some creature that was coming to devour it.
     This beautiful sea-pen lives on our own shores.                      The Irish fisherman
often finds it sticking in his nets, when he hauls them up.                     He calls it the
wonderful stick, which is not at all a bad name.

                                THE BRAIN STONE.                               71
                          THE BRAIN STONE.
Sometimes a ship, as she sails among the islands of the Tropics, meets with
a terrible danger ; the little workers in the sea have been doing mischief.
They have been making a great stem, or trunk, like a tree.         On the top of
the stem are a number of lumpy knobs, like the one you see in the plate,
and that is called a brain stone.       The brain stones are covered with thick
flesh-like jelly, in which the polyps live.
                                    THE lmjUN STONE.
     The polyps are called madrepore        polyps, and are only met with in the
hot seas of the Tropics.    They work so fast, and their stony houses are so
strong, that it is not at all pleasant to meet with them.
     They fill up many a space that had better be left open — I mean a space
over which a ship is going       to   sail.   On comes the ship, and before  the

captain is aware, it drives upon a rock.                     The rock has quite lately been
built up by the madrepore polyps.
       Do you see how curiously the brain stone is marked                   ?
       It    has    twisted lines,       or ridges, all over its surface.         The polyps have
their cells between these lines, and live in them as in so many valleys.
       They throw out the lime, that makes their cells, in thin plates almost
like sheets of paper.  These plates, or layers, are arranged in a ray-like form
round the middle of the cell, so that the madrepore head has a very curious
effect.  But it can only be seen when the structure has been raised to the
surfaceof the water, and the polyps and the flesh-like jelly are gone. Then,
the chalky ray-like heads are clearly visible.
    While the polyps are alive and at work, the madrepore rock or tree is
gay with little rose-coloured heads, that keep moving about, like flowers in
the breeze         of summer.
       I    must tell you, that the madrepore               polyps build all kinds of fantastic
shapes       in these warm Tropical            seas.   Besides walls, and rocks, and trees,
the structure         will       of corn, or a leaf, or a flower. There is
                             resemble a sheaf
no end to the strange devices of the little architects.   The traveller, on
board a ship, will often gaze at these whimsical forms in wonder and
admiration, as they glow, in all their beauty, beneath the waters.
       One word more, and            I   have done.    In   the coral reef, the lumps of brain
stone       lie at the bottom of the reef, and help to resist the action of the
waves.
                                         THE RED CORAL.
Where            does my coral necklace come from?
       The shining red substance, that the beads are made                       of,   came from the
sea.        It   was made by the little architects, our friends the polyps.
       In its      rough state, the substance was part of            a   little forest, all made
up of tangled stems and branches, growing among rocks under the water.
       For       a long time, this branching red        coral was taken for a plant          ;   and,
indeed,      it   looks very much like one.

                                 THE RED CORAL.                                        78
     The Greeks, who had a pretty          name    for everything,    called it "The
Daughter of the Sea."
     But a Frenchman, named Pysonnel, who was a doctor in the French
navy, found out that the coral was no plant at all.             He saw that it was
the work of a countless number of living creatures.              In fact, he became
acquainted with the polyps.
     At first, no   one seemed inclined      to believe him.      This happened,        I
must tell you, more than a century ago.
     But, just at this identical moment, another clever man was busy making
experiments.     He had been watching the polyps that live in fresh water,
and had found out all about them.          Indeed, he had written a book on the
subject.
     People now began      to suspect   that the little creatures who had been
said to live in the coral might belong to the same family, and be polyps as
well.
     Two naturalists set out at once to examine the red coral, and to                 see
whether such was the case.
     Thanks to all the pains and trouble that have been taken, we know,
now, the whole history of the coral, and its wonderful little architects.
We reap the fruits of other people's labours.
     The polyp that makes the red coral lives in the Mediterranean Sea, the
Black Sea, and many other places.
     The branches are covered with little cells of the
polyps, but their arms are not thread-like.           They re
semble rays, or stars.
      Below the bark of the stem,    if  I  may call it so, is
the red coral, as hard as marble, and that can take
such a shining polish.
     Divers go down to fetch up coral. for it is an article        folyf «* "«> coral
of trade.    A  great deal of it is sent away, in its rough state, to other
countries.
     At Leghorn, in Italy, there     are great factories and        workshops where
the coral is cut, and polished, and made      into all kinds of toys and ornaments.

71                                 THE BARNACLE.
     What gives the coral its red colour?
     The little polyp secretes a red colouring matter, which mixes with the
lime, or chalk,   of its cell, and makes it red.
     Some   of the corals are   so very red that they are called   "blood foam."
                                THE    BARNACLE.
Could you      have   thought, for a moment,       that the curious thing in the
picture is an animal    ?
     Nature    has given to some      of the creatures    that live in the sea as
whimsical a shape as possible.
                                     THE BARNACLE.
     This curious creature belongs to a family called Cirrhipedes      ; but we do
not give it this grand name every time we speak of it.
     We call it a barnacle.

                                     THE BARNACLE.                                  75
       It  is fastened, as you see, by a kind of stem to some substance, from
 which it seems to be growing.          The substance, very often, is the bottom of
 a ship or boat.      At   the end of the stem is the body of the animal, which
 looks a little like the fruit or the flower of a plant.
      It   is covered with a strong case or shell, which    is composed of valves,
and from between the valves a number of feelers are put forth.
      The feelers are called cirrhhi, and the creature does nothing but keep
drawing them in and out.
      It   has a round, soft body, not quite transparent, and         is of a brown
colour above, and the colour of flesh below.
      For    a time, naturalists were very much puzzled what         to do  with the
barnacle.       They could not tell to what order it belonged.      Now, they have
given it an order to itself, and put it between the worms and the crabs.
      It  is a very stationary being.     It never moves from its pedicle ; but the
pedicle, or stem, to speak more plainly, does contrive to keep up a little
movement of its own.          It goes up and down, and to the    right and the left;
just, in fact, as the animal pleases to make it.       The feelers, which you see
put out from between the valves of the shell, are often called arms : they
have tiny rings, like the body of a worm, and they are clothed with cilia,
which gives them a very plume-like appearance.
      Indeed, when they are at rest, they look like the young leaves of the
fern.
     There was a silly story once told about the barnacle.
      Its   oddness  so puzzled people, that they pretended to believe       it was  a
bird.
      Or rather,   I should say, that a bird came from it.
     The name of the bird was the barnacle goose.
     The fishermen pretended that they could hear the little goose making a
noise within the shell ; nay, some said they had seen it fairly come to life.
First it put out its     feet, then its body, and then its beak   ; then it dropped
into the sea, and presently feathers began to grow upon it.
      It was the barnacle goose !
      For many     years, numbers    of persons who ought to have known better

76                           WORMS THAT       LIVE IN THE SEA.
believed this story       ; and an account of the bird was printed         by a learned
society,    and circulated as a fact.
      I  need not    tell you, that very few persons are found to believe it now.
      What does the barnacle feed upon          ?
      It   devours tiny insects, and minute creatures, which swarm in the sea.
It  has no eyes — at least not       in this stage of its being ; but its feelers serve
it  instead.      It  spreads them out like a net, and catches all that pass by
that way.
      It  has a famous mouth, and      jaws too, like those of the crab or the lobster.
      When      the barnacle was newly come into the world, it had no stem.
It  floated about in the water, and had a number of little fins to swim with.
      And it had one large eye in the middle of its body.
      How very different it was from its parent !
      When it grows up, the fins and the eye both disappear. Then it begins
to have a stem, and fixes itself to some convenient place, like a true
barnacle.
      There is one of the family of cirrhipedes which has no stem at all.
      It  does not    want one.     It  fixes itself to the shell of the turtle, or to
the skin of the great whale.
      It   follows the whale about, wherever it goes       ; in fact, it lives upon the
huge body.
      A   strip of flesh, taken from the lip of the whale, is in the Museum in
Paris.      It  has forty-five  of these parasites upon it.     They are arranged in
order,   like the stones in a pavement.
                        WORMS THAT LIVE IN THE SEA.
There      are worms     in the sea, as   well as on the land.
      The worms that live in the sea, belong to a class called Annelides.
      They have very pretty names given them besides this family name.
One is called Nereis, another Eunice, and another Euphrosyne.                  They are
called so because they are so beautiful.

                           WORMS THAT   LIVE IN THE SEA.
     Their bodies shine with all the colours of the rainbow.           A writer once
said, that we need not talk of the violet as the emblem of modesty because
she hid herself in the green
leaves.      Here    are these
shining worms, as beauti
ful as can be, that hide
down deep in the tufts of
sea-weed,    and at the bot
tom of the ocean.
     Some     of the annelides
wander about, and glide
hither and thither as they
choose.    They have neither
house nor cell to cany                             AN A.NNELIDL
with them, and on that account they are said to be naked worms.
     Little tufts of hair-like bristles grow down each side of the body.
These are the breathing apparatus, by which the creature draws in air.
     You know very well the
construction of the common
worm.       Its body is made
up of a number of rings,
with soft flesh between.
     Just   so is  it with the
worms     in the    sea.   One
worm has as many as three
hundred      rings round    its
body,    and     thousands   of
muscles to help it to move
about.     For in the Tropics

     The tangled worm you see in the picture is nearly forty feet long.
     Its long smooth body is a little like a ribbon, of a violet or brown colour.

It    lives in the hollows of the rocks, or among loose stones.                               It   eats     tiny
shells for        its food, and it seems to amuse itself by tying its long ribbon
like body into knots, and untying them again.        Every now and then,
it sets out in search of food. It has no muscles like its relation, the worm
that I have just told you about ; but it glides along, by means of a num
ber    of hairs, or cilia, with which its body is covered.
       The cilia move backwards and forwards in the water, and help the
giant worm on its way.
       By-and-by, it comes to a stone like the one it has left                         ;    here    it    stops,
                      of tying knots in itself.
and begins its old game
   This great worm has only a little hole for its mouth, and a head some
what like a snake.
       Nature has not given it feet               ;   but she has done so to some of its tribe.
          of the more perfect annelides have bristly feet, and they make
       Some
good use of them.
    When any little creature comes swimming by, the annelide will dart
upon       it,   seize   it   with its jaws, and squeeze      it      to death.
       Others go wandering about, looking for their prey among the sea-weeds
and corals.              They are very quick, and arrest the poor little victim before                        it
has time to bury               itself in the sand.
    But though the worm        so voracious, and devours
                                             is                                       so    many minute

dig   it   out of the sand.

       What is its house          ?
       It   is a cell, or tube, quite distinct               from the body of the worm.                    The
worm began            to build        it,   when    it   was young, and had only just left its
egg-
       It   has gone on building              it,   all its life.   As   it     grew larger    it   enlarged
its house.
       Sometimes its house looks like stone, and sometimes like leather.

       The worm leads a very stay-at-home life, in its tube.
       It    has   a     head,    with        a   number      of feelers        growing     on     it    like   a
crown.
       When      it   puts its head out of doors, its feelers float about in the water,
and get      a   little air.
       This   is   the time when the worm seizes its prey.
       Its head, with the crown of feelers,                 is   very handsome indeed.
       It   is   blue,   or orange,         or violet, and expands like a flower.                   If    there

82                               THE SEA-ANEMONE.
     What kind of flowers are they which bloom in the gardens              of the
sea?
     They are not real flowers.      They are animals.     They have been called
plant-animals, because they are so like plants.
     Their proper name is zoophytes.        They belong to the large family of
which we have just now been speaking, the family of polyps.
     The polyps, that were makers of islands, lived each in his cell.       They
did not roam about.
     These ocean-flowers    can, and do move, though slowly.
     They grow each on its stalk, and are called sea-anemones.
                          THE SEA-ANEMONE.
I should like      you to examine the sea-anemone.
     Though it is in one of the lowest ranks of the animal world, you will
find a great deal about it that is very interesting.
     Its body has six parts,   or, if you like to call them  so, members.
     First, there is the stem, or column.
     It  rises like the stem of a plant, or the trunk of a tree.   At the top, it
is cut off, as it were, and there is a thick margin, or, as it is sometimes
called, parapet or wall.        Sometimes this wall is plain, and sometimes
notched,    or the outer row of feelers may grow to it.
     Sometimes the column is smooth, or else marked with lines or furrows,
or else wrinkled like the bark of a tree.      Or it may be fleshy, or else like
leather,   or soft as pulp.   There is no end to its varieties.
     It   may be covered     with little knots or warts.     These  warts are, in
fact, suckers,   by which it can stick fast to any substance it chooses.
     And sometimes       the  skin is full of minute holes, called     loopholes,
which are for a very curious purpose, and       I shall tell you about them b}--
and-by.
     The lowest end of the column is the base.

                                  THE SEA-ANEMONE.                                        88
                   SEA-ANEMONES. — HERMIT  ORAR CARRYING ONE ON ITS BACE.
     It is a broad plate, forming         a flat surface, by which the creature        fixes
itself.
     The upper end of the column is called the disk.               It is round, and some
times its edge has a frill, or number of frills, round it.                The feelers grow
out of the disk.
     The feelers are hollow, and are arranged          in circles, round the edge of the
disk.    Each feeler has a foot, and a tip.           We shall see, b}'-and-by,      what a
great deal of work is done by these feelers.
     The anemone      has neither     eyes nor ears       ; but it has a mouth and a
lip.
     The mouth is placed        in the    middle of the disk.         The thick lip goes
round it.
     From the mouth,         there   descends     a  hole   or cavity      like a sac, only
 gathered into folds.     It  is open at the end.        This is the stomach.       Indeed,

84                           MORE ABOUT THE SEA-ANEMONE.
the stomach takes up the whole space              within the column.         It is divided
into rude kinds of chambers or spaces.
     You see, therefore, that the structure of the sea-anemone is very simple.
It has a column, a base, a disk, a mouth, a lip, a stomach, and a number
of feelers.
     I  am going to tell you what           kind of life it    leads,  in its home in the
water.
                      MORE ABOUT THE SEA-ANEMONE.
The anemone likes to live among the rocks in some hole or crevice.
Here, it will unfold its crown of feelers, as a flower does its petals, and
wave to and fro in the water.              Its crown will not always be of the same
colour as the stem.           It will   be pale orange,      or red, or white, or pink,
or yellow.       In  fact,   the anemone     will   be variegated,    and  wear all these
colours at once.
     How beautiful it looks when fully expanded ! How brilliant are its
colours!     But touch it ever so lightly, and all its beauty is gone. It draws
in its feelers, and shrinks down to a button, or little knob of jelly.
     It is now ugly and disagreeable to look at.
     But let it alone, and its courage will begin to revive.
     It gradually rises. Its body gets filled with water.                 The column-like
stem swells out.        The frilled disk unfolds like a crown of leaves.
     It will   soon become as beautiful as ever.
     Let us watch what happens.               It is not merely going to display its
beauty, in this pleasant nook it has chosen.
     No.    It  is a hungry creature,     and is watching for its prey.
     A foolish worm        comes swimming by.          The anemone has no eyes to see
it ; but its feelers have been moving about, in the hope of meeting with
something which is likely to serve for a dinner.
     They quickly close round the worm.

 ejected from   the arms    of the polyp.      The worm is half dead with the
poison, even before   it is carried to     the mouth.   That wide, gaping mouth
 which is ready to receive it.
      Now,  if you could have taken the poor little worm from its captor, and
looked at it through a microscope, what would you have seen ?
                                     PeA-AneMONU.
      A number of    darts,  like so many minute pins, embedded        in the flesh.
Each dart is armed with poison.
      Where do the darts come from       ?
      Do you remember the minute holes which         I called loopholes, and which
were found in the skin of the animal         ?
      From out these holes, and also from its mouth, it can shoot these tiny
darts.   They are more like threads than darts.            They are curled up and
tangled together like a bundle of cotton.       When the thread is forced out from
the hole, it makes a kind of loop, but if the creature is much excited, one

end   of the loop gets free. After a time, it draws back the loop through the
same hole out of which it came.
     What a wonderful apparatus for defence and attack !
     The slightest irritation provokes an onslaught from             these  minute
weapons.
     Minute to us, but how terrible to the countless swarms of creatures
that live in the neighbourhood !
     The poison of these darts is felt even by human beings.
     Persons, bathing in the sea, often meet with the venomous threads of
the anemone, and are      painfully stung by them.
     A  naturalist, not   long since,  made    a bold   experiment.     He let the
feelers  of a sea-anemone touch his tongue.
     The creature    seized   the tongue eagerly,    and had to be pulled away
by force.     But a wound was made, that for a time was very painful.
     Where the poison is lodged, and how ejected, has not yet been discovered.
                              THE MEDUSAE.
It  is rather too bad to give the name of Medusa3 to the lovely fairy-like
creatures   I am going to describe.
     For Medusa, as I dare say you know, was one of the Gorgons.               She
was said, in the Greek mythology, to be a beautiful woman, with snakes
growing round her head instead of hair.
     And,   according   to the same old story, whoever        looked    at her was
turned into stone.
     The medusa?     I  am speaking    of, are a tribe of creatures   that have all
kinds of shapes, and wear all kinds of colours.
     They float about in the     sea, and are as transparent, sometimes, as the
water.
     Most of them,   if not  the whole of the family, have the power of shining
in the dark.

                                                                        the sea shine.
      They help as much as any other creatures to make

blubber.       The     mass
lies   melting      in   the
sun,     and is as little
like an animal as pos
sible.
       People call it "sea-
jelly," or "sea-blub
 ber," or "jelly-fish."
       And    as   the me
 dusae    have    the    dis
 agreeable art of sting
 ing very sharply, they
              called
                       " sea-

        The family name
 for the whole tribe is

         A little quantity of transparent matter, almost like

88                     A   LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE MEDUSiE.
     This is the framework           or body    of the creature.    The only kind of
skeleton   it has.
     The medusa in the picture is called " fine-haired."
     It  has,  as   you see, a disk       or top,   shaped   like a mushroom    or an
umbrella.
     From the inside of the            mushroom,    there hangs    down what might
be a stem, divided        into    parts, and   looking a little like the roots of a
plant.    The stomach,       a  very hungry one,      is placed in the centre of this
stem.
     The edge of the disk or umbrella is provided, as you see, with long
streamers of its own, that float about in the water, and are a little like
the snakes    of the Gorgon's hair.
     The opening to the stomach is the mouth, which is ready to receive
whatever comes in its way.
     But the medusa itself serves         as food to the   larger animals that live in
the sea.
     The great whale feeds upon some species of niedusre.
     For the family is very large indeed, and includes all kinds of varieties,
in size, and shape, and structure.
                 A   LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE MEDUSA.
We have not yet done with the Medusa?.
     How did people find out that the lump of jelly, fast melting away, on
the shore, was an animal        .
     I  will tell you.
     A French naturalist       squeezed some    milk into the mouth of the creature.
The milk spread itself through all the little cells and vessels, and enabled
him to see them quite clearly.
     Until that     time,   even the most     learned   men had called the medusa a
mere lump     of living jelly.
     But now, they began to take a little notice of it.             They examined it

 more    carefully, and found out that it was really an animal, with powers
 of moving about, and            of seizing its prey.
      But sea-water          made    up such a great part of its body, that when it
died,   or was thrown on shore, the body dissolved and dropped away.

the bell-shaped medusa moves
about.
      It   is    heavier       than    the
water,    and      would      sink,  if it
had not some means            of keeping
itself afloat.
      But it      uses    its umbrella
like disk to swim with.
      The      disk    contracts      and
dilates, a    little as our lungs do
in breathing.
      By striking       the     waves in
this manner, the creature man
ages to swim in smooth water.
      When the sea is rough, it
cannot resist the fury of the
waves.        Then it sinks down,                          THE BELL-SHAPED     MEDUSA.
to find a more tranquil spot, until the storm is over.
      But some of the             medusae    are   provided with very different means of
swimming.
      These are not bell-shaped.              As  I told you, the family included all kinds
of  shapes and sizes.
      They move         about by cilia.          The cilia might        be called      tiny oars or
paddles, which help the creature along.
      The beautiful ribbon-like            creature   in the plate on next page is called
the
      " Girdle of Venus."
      The edges of the ribbon are fringed with numbers                         of cilia, which are
tinted with all manner of lovely colours.

                                                              or   ribs into      eight
                                                              equal       portions.
                                                              These       lines are
                                                              covered      with     flat
                                                              cilia,   a   little  like

one above the other.
     When the creature wants to move, it sets all its cilia in motion.           These,
like  so many oars, drive the crystal-like   along.
     On it goes, gliding gracefully over the water.
     If it wants to stop, it has nothing to do but leave off rowing           ; or if it
wants to turn, it stops its oars on one side only.
     It  is a very lovely creature indeed    ;  for the lines or ribs on its body
sparkle with all the colours of the rainbow.
     Besides    its oars, it has two long streamers or tentacles that come out
of its body.       They are so elastic that they can shrink up, and be drawn
back, so as not to be seen.
     When     they are drawn back, they are hidden in two sheaths, and are
not at all in the way.
     The filaments on the tentacle roll up when the tentacle is drawn in.
If  you looked at them through the microscope, you would see that they
are covered with     tiny prickles, which no doubt are used to kill its prey.

                                  CREATURES THAT WEAR ARMOUR.                            91
                          CREATURES THAT WEAR ARMOUR.
Have you          ever        been   to   visit the collection of armour in the Tower of
London     ?
    Have you seen the helmets, and coats of mail, and steel gloves, which
people used to wear, in the old days, when they went to battle ?    Some
times, the suit of armour was very heavy indeed.     When a soldier fell
down, he could not get up again.
     Nature does her work more skilfully than man.                   And she has made a
whole     race    of creatures, who wear armour — armour that she has herself
fitted upon them.
     Here we find shields, and bucklers, and lances, and spears.
     Weapons, you perceive, as well as armour.
     It is a good thing these creatures are not very large, or else they would
be dreadful monsters, and as dangerous as dreadful.
     What are they 1
     Tbey belong to a class, in the animal world, which is called Crus
tacea;.
     The name comes from a Latin word, which means "to harden," and the
armour which they wear is                  as   hard as can be.
    They have rings round their bodies, as the annelides have.        But the
rings of these armed creatures are made of lime, and there is no soft flesh
between them.     There is either a piece of tough skin, or else the rings are
close together, and form a compact case or shell.
    You know most of these creatures as well as I do.
    But you may not have noticed the wonderful manner in which their
armour is made.
     So we will begin with one which is perhaps the most familiar of all.
     Let me introduce to you our friend the lobster.
     He has a soft body under his hard shell, for we have eaten                   it,   and
know      that   it       rather a dainty.
     But what         is is   his shell or armour made of?

92                      CREATURES THAT WEAR ARMOUR.
                                    THE LOB.STER.
      Nothing but those rings of lime, we spoke of a little ago.
      A substance a little like glue, comes from the skin of the lobster, and
mixes with the lime.
      In the tail of the lobster, you can see the rings very plainly, for they
overlap each other, and have hinges made of a thick tough membrane.
      He has a famous shield on his back, but even in this the rings may be
seen.    His legs are cased in armour, like the rest of his body, but there are
joints or hinges, so that he can move them easily.        His armour is neither

                            CREATURES THAT WEAR ARMOUR.                            93
too    heavy nor too clumsy for him.          It fits him like a glove, and allows
him to go about just as he pleases.
      Nature knew what enemies his poor soft body would meet with.               All
the creatures,      far and near, would have liked to eat it up, so she took care
to send him into the world well defended.
      Instead of falling a prey to others, you may fancy what a formidable
creature     he is.
      We have not yet done with him.          There is a great deal more to be said
of the lobster.
      Do you not see three sets of feet, near his mouth      ?
      These are called jaw-feet, and      he can   seize his  prey with  them, and
break it to pieces.
      It  is no joke for a smaller creature to come within reach of those terrible
feet,   I  assure you.
      Then he has another set of feet, a little lower down, on his chest.        He
walks on these feet. There are five pairs of them.
      And he has more feet still, on his tail, but they are called false feet,
because they are used for swimming instead of walking.
      And there is another use for these false     feet.  The mother lobster sticks
her eggs upon them, and holds them there, until the time comes for putting
them in the sand to be hatched.
      Now,     I  want you to look at the feet of the lobster.         The walking
legs, you     will   see, are divided into five pieces, and they each end with a
hook.
      But the pair of legs nearest to the mouth is larger than the others,
and ends in great claws or nippers.
      One of these nippers is made like a saw, and catches hold of the prey.
The other nipper lays hold of the stalks of sea-weeds, and prevents the
lobster from being carried away by currents in the water.
      The lobster, like a great many of his relations, has a very curious way
of breaking off his own limbs.         He can do this, to save himself from being
seriously hurt by an accident.
      If his claw is wounded, it might cause him to bleed to death         ; for the

94                             MORE ABOUT THE LOBSTER.
blood-vessels     in his body are of a very delicate structure.        But the lobster
seems to know a remedy.              He breaks off his claw at a certain point, and
the bleeding gives over, and his life is saved.
     But is he maimed all the rest of his days ?
     Oh no, nothing of the kind !           Very soon, a new claw begins to sprout
from the old one.           It goes on growing, without any shell to protect it ;
but when the animal changes            his shell (a habit about which you will hear
presently), the new claw gets a covering.            It never attains the size of the
opposite claw, which has not been damaged, but it serves almost as well,
and is quite as perfect.
     Because the flesh       of the lobster is so dainty, the poor animal is sadly
persecuted.
      Millions of lobsters       are served  up in London   every year, and the lob
ster-fishery is a very important one.
     The fisherman throws a wicker basket into the sea.                The basket con
tains some nice morsel           to tempt the lobster.    Of  course, the lobster soon
comes up.
     He creeps into the basket readily enough.            But he has got into a trap.
For    the basket is so contrived that he cannot get out again.
                            MORE ABOUT THE LOBSTER.
I  have not quite finished with the lobster's coat of mail.
      It  is possessed by the      creature soon after his birth  ;  and here, rather a
difficulty arises.
      As the lobster keeps on growing, what happens to the armour             ? Does it
grow as well      ?
      No    ; and   in process of time the body of the animal becomes too large
for its house.        It is bound, and pent in, on every side.
      In   fact, the lobster is in rather an unpleasant position.
      He leaves off eating, a sure sign that something is the matter.           And he

 thin, which is just the best thing he can do.           His body shrinks away from
 the shell, and this makes what he is going to do more easy.
      Now begins the struggle.       The creature swells itself and wriggles about,
 till the  old shell splits down the back and makes an opening.               Then the
 claws burst at their hinges,     and the lobster draws them off, as you would
 draw off a pair of boots.
      Next,   the head    throws off its covering or helmet, and then the body
creeps quite out of the shell.
      The old shell lies complete in all its parts. You might think the lobster
was yet inside it. But the poor lobster, with his armour gone, creeps into
some safe place.
      His brother lobsters would       soon   eat him up,    if they met with him in
this   defenceless state.   So he takes care to keep out        of their way.
      He is very tired and weak, and, now and then, a lobster dies during the

struggle       I   have been relating.           If    he has got through         it   safely, he lies rest
ing himself in his hole.
        Nature will soon provide him with a new suit of armour.
        His thick skin becomes covered with a kind of glue, and forms                               a   new
shell.
        All   he has to do, is to        fill his body with water, and swell it out as much
as he can.
        The skin directly begins to get hard, and the new armour forms itself
into the same shape as the old.
    The lobster recovers his appetite, and comes forth with new strength and
.\   igour.
        When       the lobster is in his native element,               he is not the same colour as
when he appears at table.
        His coat of mail is black, not red.
        He is only red when he has been boiled.
                                                THE CRAB.'
The crab           is,   as   you know, a very near relation to the lobster.                      He wears
armour on his body, and his family name                       is   Crustacea.      But he does not like
cold seas, and will not live in them.                    The nearer you get to the Tropics the
more crabs you find.
        The foreign crabs have all kinds of curious habits.
        They    live not only in the sea.     They swarm in every brook and
river.        And they even live on dry land.
        There      is    one crab that would die         if   you threw him into the water.             He
would be drowned.                   He   is   called    the land crab.           He likes to live in the
shadow of some damp, dark forest.  The forest will often be great way                         a
from the sea.  But he does not care about that. He hides himself in a.
hole, and lies            there as snug as possible.           When    it   is   getting dusk, he comes
out of his hole, and              runs about      a    little, very likely to catch something for
supper.

     Nature has provided, in a very ingenious manner, for the wants of these
land crabs.
     I  must tell you that the gills, or breathing apparatus, of the crab, lie
in the centre of the body, and look like a number of loose fringes.
     It   is  necessary to the          creature's      health    that     these   gills be kept
damp.
     But    as the crab will often        go a     journey — for crabs,        as  you will hear,
are great travellers   — how      is  it to    be done   ?

     A    number of little sacs, like water-bags,                are   placed     under the gills.
Before     the crab sets off, he takes            in water by filling his         sacs, just as an
engine might do.
     As he goes along the dusty road, drops of water keep falling, out of the
sacs, on to his gills, and keep them moist,                so   that he does not suffer either
from heat or dryness.

     But what do you think of a crab that has one claw nearly as large                        as

against the entrance, and so blocks it up.
     There is another crab, which lives on the cocoa-nut.
      What a curious thing for a crab to eat       !
     People used to say, that the crab climbed the tree to get at the nuts.
But this is not believed to be true.
     The crab eats the nuts that have fallen to the ground.
      He has a pair of strong pincers at the end of his front claws.                      When
he has found a nut to his mind, he begins to tear away the husk, fibre by
fibre.
      And he hammers on the three weak places in the shell, which are called
the eyes of the nut.      He soon hammers a hole right through them.
      He has another pair of pincers in his hinder claws.                   These are not so
strong as the others, but the crab begins to scoop out the kernel with them.
      He soon scoops out enough for his dinner.

     He lives in a deep hole, and the hole gets quite full of fibres of the
cocoa-nut which have been torn off.
     He rests on these as on a bed.
     This cocoa-nut eating crab is quite a delicacy.              He gets so fat, that
sometimes a quart of oil is yielded from his body.
     You may think how
strong the pincers of the
crab must be, to break the
hard shell of the       cocoa-
nut.
     A captain of      a ship
wanted     to bring    one    of
these   crabs   home.        He
shut the creature     up in a
tin box, and tied the lid
down with wire.             He
thought     the  crab    could
not possibly get out.
     But he was mistaken.
     The    crab   used     his

strong    pincers    to    turn
down    the   edges   of the box, and thus got away,             In doing    so, he had
even punched holes through the tin.
     I ought to tell you that crabs are very quarrelsome creatures.
     In  the plate, two crabs are having a battle.          I am afraid the poor crab
that is beaten will     be  torn in pieces, and eaten up by the victor.
                    THE CRAB THAT STEALS A HOUSE.
The body of the crab has, as        we have    seen,  a famous       armour to cover it.
His legs are cased in armour,       and furnished with claws       ;  so that he is able
to take good care of himself.

 too                      THE CRAB THAT STEALS A HOUSE.
     But there is a family of crabs that Nature seems to have neglected.
The fore part of the body is armed, and has claws.                  But the hinder part
has no covering at all.          It  ends in a soft tail.
     This poor creature cannot swim, like the rest of his tribe ; and he can
not run.      So that he is very helpless indeed.             He seems to know that
                                                              he is helpless, for he looks

whether it is empty or not.            Indeed, he wishes for food as well as shelter.
     As he prowls about, he will catch sight of a snail that has just put out
its feelers.
     It draws them back in a hurry, the moment it sees the crab, and tries
to get into its house again.          But the crab seizes it with his sharp claws,
and drags it out and eats it.
     Then he marches         into the snail's house,       and takes it for his own.
When the crab outgrows his house, he casts it aside, and sets about looking
for another.
     What is the name of the crab           ?
     He is called the hermit-crab.            I   think he had better have been called
the robber.

     He is very fierce and rapacious,      as  you perceive.      But in spite of his
fierceness, he often carries another       creature    on   his back, and cannot get
rid of it.
     The creature   is one of those curious plant-animals, which              are called
zoophytes.
                                                                         s  }

     The crab does not like to bear this burden, and makes great efforts               to
shake it off.     But the zoophyte has fixed itself firmly on the shell of the
hermit-crab, and sits there, quiet and contented          ;  so that often, in spite of
 himself,  the crab has to carry the lazy creature        on his back.

                                INSTINCT OF THE CRAB.
In    the    mountains of some of the West India Islands there live a number,
I   might say a host, of crabs.
      They are called "violet-crabs,"             and     they hide themselves          for a great
part of the year, either in holes of the rocks or in the hollows of trees.
      Scarcely anything is either seen or heard of them.
   But all at once, the rainy season sets in with great violence.                             Then a
commotion takes place among the crabs.     They are seized with                           a   wish to
go to the sea-side.           The mother-crabs want to lay their eggs on the sea
shore.
      So the vast host of crabs sets out on a journey thither.
      You may think how vast this host                  is,   whenI      tell you that the line of
crabs      will   reach for three miles.
    The roads, the woods, the gardens, on the route, are literally covered
with crabs.  The noise they make may be heard a long way off.
      The crabs travel by night, because this                    is    the safest time for them.
The strongest of the crabs go first, as                 it     were to clear the way.           Next
come the mother-crabs.   And last of all, those that are old and feeble.
      Nothing can stop the crabs on their way.      They go scrambling on
over hedges and ditches, and eating all they can find.
      If    any one meets with them, they rattle their claws and try to frighten
him away with           a   great noise.    And   if    a door    of   a   house be open, they are
very likely to march in.
      Instinct has taught them the nearest way to the                          sea,   and they turn
neither to the right nor to the left.
      Should      a   poor crab get hurt, or fall ill by the way, his cruel brethren
will halt a moment and eat him up.
    At length, the army of crabs reaches                      the sea.      And here a great deal
of business has to          be done.
      First of all, the crabs take a bath in the waves.                     Then the mother-crabs
lay their eggs on the shore.

     When this is over, all the crabs retire into holes and snug corners, to
cast off their armour.
     After the wriggling and struggling has been gone through, the crabs
come out weak and faint, and have to wait a little time before they can do
anything more.
     As soon as they have recovered strength enough, and their new armour
has begun to appear, they set off home again.
     But the journey back is not quite   so pleasant.
     The crabs are tired and feeble, and a great many of them        are caught
and killed by the way.      Indeed, but a small remnant of the host gets safe
back.
     What becomes of the little crabs ?
     After a time, they come out of the shell   ; but they are not in the least
like their parents.
     The young crab is the most absurd-looking creature in the world.
     Its head is like a helmet with a long spike sticking out of it.
     Then it has a long beak, and a pair of great eyes.    At this period of its
history, it swims merrily about in the water.
     It takes some little time before the young crab grows to be at all like
its parents.   But, by degrees, it undergoes a series of changes, and leaves
off swimming.
     It is now, in fact, a true crab, and is ready to set off to the mountains.
     Then the roads, far and near, are sprinkled over with little crabs
scrambling along as fast as they can, and led by that wonderful         guide —
Instinct.
     Dangers beset them      on every side, and birds and animals alike feast
upon them.
     But the little army still pushes bravely on, and at length a remnant of
it reaches the mountains in safety.

                                              THE SHRIMP.
There is another little creature that                   wears armour.            You know it very
well.      It    has     the    misfortune to be dainty eating,               like its relation the
lobster.        And therefore Man, its great enemy, is always trying to catch it.
     Have you not often seen men and boys go out shrimping                                 ?
     They do so when the tide is out, and the sea quite calm.                                  If   the sea
were rough,                       of getting any shrimps.

     The shrimper goes about his work in a very simple way.      He has a
                                           net, like a bag, fastened to a
                                                               pole or stick.             He wades into

                                                               him along the sand.    The net

     This is the simplest way of catching shrimps.                      Women and children are
often employed in it.
     There      is,   however, another shrimp-fishery,               that    is   carried on in boats.
Here, great strong nets are used, and the boats                        push off     a     little way from
shore.
     Perhaps there         is   some sand-bank near, or place where the shrimps                        live
in great numbers.
     The fishermen throw out their nets, having first tied heavy weights to

  them.     The nets drag at
 the bottom of the water,
 and entangle numbers of
 shrimps.
      I told you the shrimp
 was a creature      that wore
 armour.       But its coat of
 mail is feeble,     compared
 to that of the lobster.       It
 consists   of a thin shell or
 covering,     which  is trans
 parent,   and spotted with
 gray.
      Between the head and
 tail of the shrimp the ar                      HMlINu FoR SHIUMPS.
 mour is divided into six parts, each part having a joint, and working into
 its neighbour.       These joints make up the body of the shrimp, which is
 generally     doubled up, as                         5
 you perceive.
      Its tail is a kind of
 wing - shaped apparatus,
 which helps the creature
 to swim about.         It   can
 be expanded, or folded up,
just   as the shrimp      likes.
 The two outer parts of
 the tail have spines upon
 them.
      Do you see the pair
 of  feelers that grow from
 the head    ?    They are as
 long as the creature itself.
      There is also      a fan-

shaped   wing on either side of the head.         The wings have tiny feathers on
each side, and are transparent.           They help the shrimp to move about in
the water, and are of the greatest possible use.
     The shrimp has a great many legs, as you perceive.         It uses the first
pair of legs as hands.     For the tips of these two legs — in fact the feet —
are armed   with a pair of nippers, to seize its prey.
     The rest of the shrimp's legs get shorter and shorter.      And these short
legs are armed    with bristles.     Altogether, the shrimp has thirty-two legs.
     It is not a very good walker, though it has so many legs.         But it can
contract its tail, and give famous jumps through the water.
     The daily life of the shrimp, in its native waters, has not been much

studied.    No doubt it spends most of its time in seizing its prey, and
devouring it.
    In  the plate, a number     of shrimpers are waiting until the tide is down,
before they begin their work.

         of our great writers was once walking by the sea-shore, when he
       One
perceived what looked like a cloud or thick mist over the edge of the
water.
       Can you imagine what the cloud would be                        ?
       When he came to look at it more closely, he found it was a cloud of
young shrimps leaping up into the air                   !
       In          little creatures were at their gambols.

       There is one kind of shrimp which is called the opossum.
       The opossum              is,   you know,    an animal that carries its young                  in a
pouch.
       The mother shrimp does just the same thing with her young ones.
       She has         a    pouch,       in which she first carries the               eggs.   When    the
eggs     are   hatched,          and     the   young    ones grow          into little shrimps,      they
may be seen in the pouch, lying side by side, and their heads all the same
way.
       You have heard of many creatures that are food for the great whale.
       The shrimp    one of these.
                           is      And not only the whale, but the herring
is   as fond of shrimps as we are.

To breathe        is   to live.         Were the breath, that comes and goes every moment,
to stop, we know that we should die.                          The body         is   like a machine, com
plete in all its parts.                  The contrivance by which we breathe,                 is   as the
main-spring to the watch                 :   all depends upon    ii
       Have you heard the main-spring snap, when you were winding up your
watch    ?

its busy little wheels and springs ceased to act.

becomes a piece            of useless clay.
    How important is the apparatus by which we breathe !
    What do we breathe ?     What is the material, or air-food, that keeps
our bodies alive?
    This material is provided for us in the greatest abundance.        The
whole air, and earth, and sea are filled with it.                                    It    is a gas         ;    and it is
called oxygen.
       Oxygen is the most important                    agent       that exists.                It   enables the vast
family       of created         beings to live.            You cannot              see    it   ;    for though it is
heavier than the air, it has no colour, and cannot be distinguished from it.
       But you breathe oxygen every moment.   Your lungs are filled with
it,   and then emptied again. This  what keeps you alive.
                                                      is   It gives the
blood its bright red colour, and makes                                   bound healthfully through the
veins.          Till   the blood has tasted oxygen,              it it   is   dull, and dark, and used up                ;
there      is    no life or nourishment              in it.        In     the beautiful                 machine of the
lungs, blood and oxygen meet.
       Then mark the change               !     The dark, sluggish stream loses its impurities.
It    is   now   a     bright red, and courses along full of life.                        It       carries health and
vigour with it.                  in its circuit through the human frame,
                              But as   it     goes

and arteries —   begins to flag.

the time        it                      dull and dark again, and can give

no more nourishment. But its benefactor    waiting for it.    fresh supply

and life   of the blood. On    bounds, with renewed energy.

       The union of oxygen with the blood takes place every moment.                                                   This
is    what makes us live.
    But do we breathe pure oxygen                      ?
    No for then we should breathe too quickly
            ;                                                                  ;   the machine would                  wear
out with over-work.
       There    another gas in the air, which clogs the wheels of the machine,
                  is
and,   if   we may use the expression, steadies it. This gas   nitrogen.                           is

                                       A   LITTLE ABOUT OXYGEN.                                                  109
      If   you had to give a stimulant to a patient, and fancied it would                                        be
too strong for him, you would mix it with water.
      Our air-food is mixed with nitrogen.                            Nitrogen     has no air-food         in it.
If   an animal were put into pure nitrogen, it would die.                                Its lungs would
get no food, and it would be suffocated.
      There is more          oxygen             in    the   atmosphere than nitrogen              ;   the air-
food is none the worse for the mixture.                          It   is made just the right strength
for us.
      Creatures that live in the sea, need oxygen as much as we do                                      ;    and
oxygen is as busy in the sea as on the land.                                But as it had    a   partner in
the air, so      it   has a partner        in the water.          This last-named partner or asso
ciate is a gas called hydrogen.
    Water is made up, for the most part, of these two gases — oxygen and
hydrogen.   There are other materials besides, as we know ; but we need
not speak of them here.
      And    I    need not say much                  of hydrogen, except that it is the lightest
substance     known.        It    is   lighter than air.
      Now, there is not so much oxygen in the water as on the land                                      ;    and
the breathing machine of the creature in the sea does not go on so quickly.
      This breathing machine has also another name.
      You have heard of the gills of fishes.   We shall describe them in an
other place.          They are the lungs of the creature,                    — the    machine by which
it   breathes.
      Sometimes you will hear the word " branchiae."                              These are lungs as well,
and belong to a vast tribe of ocean creatures.                           They are called by this name
because     they spread       out in the water like leaves                    or branches.        The great
object to be attained            is,   for the water to freely bathe all parts of the breath
ing machine, just as the air enters the lungs of an animal on the land.
The oxygen in the water mixes with the blood, and makes       pure and                       it
healthy.
    But the whole process                  is   feeble and languid, compared             to what      it    is    in
land animals.
      Indeed, in some creatures                      the spark    of life    is   very low indeed.           The

blood is neither red              And the supply of oxygen is so scanty,
                                 nor warm.
that the creature will often come up to the surface of the water, and draw
in a little air.
      We shall        see,    presently, that there are many beautiful contrivances to
enable the         creature in the sea to breathe under all circumstances.                                 The
machine is placed in different parts of the body, as may be necessary.
      There is a fish which can go on breathing when half its body is buried
in the body of some other fish it is devouring.                                 Its machine is placed
far back, so as to be out of the way.
      I    must say one word more about breathing.
      We draw in oxygen to our lungs.   What do we expel, every other
moment, when the lungs empty themselves like a pair of bellows ?
   I will tell you.
      Not fresh, pure air like that                     which     went     in   ;   but air mixed      with
poison.
      The poison is called carbonic acid gas.
      Where does the poison come from                    ?
      You will be surprised to hear that oxygen is its parent.
      It    has another parent, called carbon.
      Carbon exists in our bodies, and is in reality nothing but charcoal.
      You know what             a burned, black-looking            substance        charcoal is.
      Carbon is pure charcoal, unmixed with anything.
      The     oxygen         meets   with    it,   unites with      it,   and there      is   formed a gas
— carbonic         acid gas.
      You will        see    how important         it   is   not to keep breathing            the   same   air
over and over again.                 In   hot,     crowded rooms people do this, and feel                   ill
and faint.
      They have been breathing poison                   !
      In    the       of the day, how much poisoned air must escape from the
                   course
lungs.       In crowded towns, this makes the air unwholesome.
      Nature has provided a simple remedy.
      All    the    trees and plants are busy sucking                     the carbonic acid gas into
their leaves.         They take from us this load of poison.                          On the under side

of the green leaves are tiny vessels, like              so   many little mouths, to suck it in.
It   is their food.
      They keep the carbon for their own use, and set the oxygen free.
      So they take in poison, and give out health.
      How wonderful are the workings of Nature                    !
      The beautiful array of plants and grasses, which clothe the earth with
green,     purify the atmosphere and render it fit for man to dwell in.
                               THE COLOUR OF THE SEA.
The    sea   is not always green, though we talk of the green sea waves.
      It   is all kinds of colours.
      When the water is clear and deep it is of a beautiful blue.
      In   the Greenland seas, the water is as blue as                in the Mediterranean.
      The Black Sea is called black from the storms                  that rage upon     it,
                                                                                       and
from the gloom of its sky.                   But, in some parts of the ocean, the waves are
really black.          And on the coast of Africa,              a ship seemed    to be sailing
through      a   sea   of milk.     The waves were white.
      What made them so             ?
      Millions of tiny white creatures were swimming in the water, and quite
changed its colour.
      The Red Sea         is   full of   a   minute red weed, which sometimes covers it.
      A                                He had put his head out of the

cabin-window to get a breath of air, when he saw the sea of a deep red
colour, as far as his eye could reach.
      The ship sailed for a long time through                    this sea of red, and then the
water became blue again.
      Sometimes a ship sails through bands, or stripes, of different colours —
yellow, green, orange, brown, red, and white.     These stripes are really
nothing but tiny creatures, or minute sea-weeds, which give their colour to
the water.

112                            A   LITTLE ADOUT THE FISH.
     1  have told you that the Greenland seas are          of a deep blue.     Now and
then this deep blue changes to a muddy green.
     Shall    I  tell you why?
     Because these same        tiny creatures give a colour to the water.
     There are more of them than           I can tell you of.
     A   mile of sea contains twenty-four thousand, not millions, but billions !
     Here the great whale comes to feed, and swims about with his huge
mouth open.
     These     tiny creatures are his favourite food.         Man has found this out,
and he goes after the whale with his harpoon, to kill him.
     When the sea is perfectly clear, as it is in some places, you have no
idea how beautiful it is.
     People can look down, and see into the very heart of the ocean world.
     There are hills, and dales, and rocks, and caverns.               The fishes swim
about.      Beautiful star-like flowers open their arms.         Soft-bodied creatures,
of all kinds and all colours, float in the water.            Some are like strings of
beads, some are like ferns, some like lilies.          Others, of all shapes and sizes,
glide about, transparent as the water in which they live.
                            A LITTLE ABOUT THE FISH.
The    home     of the fish, as  I  need not  tell you, is in the water.    He is made
for swimming.            His  smooth,   slippery   body glides about in the sea or
the river.
     A   salmon swims so fast, that he could make the tour            of the earth in a
few weeks       if he  liked.
     Every part of the fish's body helps him to swim.
     His   fins, his tail, his backbone,     that he can bend about as he likes, all
help him forward.            He can twist, or turn, or do anything        he pleases, in
the water.
     If he   has to swim across great portions        of the ocean, as some fishes do,
his fins will be very strong and large.              He will want to contend with

                                          A   LITTLE ABOUT THE FISH.                                      118
waves and currents,                  and it would not do for his fins to be feeble.                  If   he
lives in some quiet nook, and keeps at home, instead of travelling, his fins
are soft, and have not so much power.
       He has a bladder, filled with air, in his body.                           He can make himself
heavier or lighter, just as he chooses.                          If he    wants to be heavy and sink,
he presses out the                  air from the air-bladder.           He has a set of muscles given
him for the purpose.                    But    if   he wants to rise, he relaxes the muscles, and
the air-bladder fills.                 Then he rises as lightly as a feather.
       Is this not just what                   people      do, when      they go up and down in a
balloon         ?
       The air-bladder                of a fish is called the sound, and isinglass is made
from it.
       Some fishes do not need an air-bladder.                           They live in the mud, at the
bottom of the water, and never want to rise.
       Nature gives nothing                   in waste.       These kinds      of fishes have either no
air-bladder, or a very small one.
       The fish has a covering of scales on his body.                              They   lap over each
other,      like the tiles in a roof.                 Sometimes the colour of the scales is very
beautiful indeed.
       In   the seas of the Tropics,                  the fishes   are as      gaily dressed, after their
fashion,            as    the humming-birds         are.
    They are all the colours of the rainbow, and glitter and shine like gems
and precious stones.   The gayest coloured fishes live among the coral reefs.
They glide from one coral branch to another, as the brilliant fly-catcher does
from flower to flower.
     These beautiful fishes are not good to eat.
     The sailor would rather keep to his salt beef, though he is getting very
tired of    than dine on fish taken from a coral reef.
                    it,
       The reason             is,   that the water      is   too warm    ;   and the flavour   of the fish
is   spoilt.

                    FISHES THAT WALK ON DRY LAND.
I  wonder what kind of fish thai cau be       !
     Before    I tell you,  I must say a word      of the way in which   the  fish
breathes.
     The fish wants air as much as you or       I do.
     But he gets air, not from the great open space in which you and I live
and breathe.      No ; he gets air from the water.
     The lungs of the fish are not like ours, because he has to breathe in a
different way.
     And Nature has given him the sort of lungs he will want.
     The lungs of the fish are called gills.
     You have perhaps seen the gills of the fish many times.
     They are the two openings, one on each side of the head.
     The fisherman often puts a string through them to carry the fish away.
     When the fish wants to breathe, he opens his mouth and takes a gulp
of water.     The water passes from the mouth, through a little grating, into
the gills.    Here it cannot get out    ; for some bony lids, called gill-covers,
shut down, and keep it in.
     While the water is shut up, it bathes a number of feathery membranes
in the cavity of the gills.       These membranes are covered with delicate
blood-vessels,   and thus the blood gets a supply of oxygen.
     When this important      business  is over (and, like our breathing, it only
takes an instant), the gill-covers open, and let the water out again.
     At the same moment, more water comes in at the mouth, and the fish
keeps on breathing.
     When a fish is taken out of the water, it dies for want of air.          The
delicate gills fold together, and get dry.      Then the fish cannot breathe.
     In  some fishes   the opening   of the gills is very narrow, and does not
dry   so   quickly.    And there is a little cell, full of water, which opens
on to the gills, and keeps them moist.        These fishes can live much   longer
in the air.

                               THE FISHING-FROG.                             115
      There is a fish which can live some days out of the water.     It  has so
 much water in its cell, that the gills are kept damp.    And it will climb up
 a tree to look for insects, which it is very fond of.
      It may well be called a fish out of water  !
                             THE FISHING-FROG.
I  have a great deal to tell you about this frightful looking creature.
     Do you see its wide gaping mouth, a little like that of a frog ?     It be

116                                     THE FISHING-FROG.
longs to a tribe       of fishes that have their gills so contrived that they can live
a short time out of the water, and even creep on dry land.
      An old Greek author, called Aristotle, calls this fish a kind of            frog, and
tells us that it gets its living by angling.
      Indeed, Nature has provided it with a famous line and hook.
      That long tentacle which sticks up on the creature's head is the imple
ment it uses in its fishing.
      The tentacle has a joint, which            allows it to move freely about.        And
the end is tipped        with a little membrane of a shining colour.
      This little membrane, as we shall see, is the bait by which the creature
entices its prey.
      Now this great ungainly fish is not a good swimmer.                   It cannot dart
about and pursue the little fishes in its neighbourhood.                  And yet it has a
voracious appetite, and wants to eat continually.
      What, then, is it to do        ?
      It  has to use a vast deal         of cunning, and get its prey by treachery.
      First it hides itself in the mud and sand, stirring them up round itself
to make a kind of cloud. Next it sets up its bait, and lets the shining mem
brane be seen on        all sides, moving it about in every direction.
      Before long,      a little fish is sure to see the bait, and come               swim
ming up.
      It  fancies  it  sees a  worm or something equally nice moving about              And
as  it is hungry      as well as   its enemy, it begins to nibble.
      Alas for the poor fish           !    In a moment,   the bait is withdrawn and a
cavern of a mouth opened.                The fish goes headlong into the cavern, and is
swallowed.       Then the expert angler sets up the bait again, and watches for
another victim.
      I  cannot tell you how greedy this fishing-frog will be           !
      It will   devour anything           that comes in its way, no matter what the
thing may be.
      A   fishing-frog once tried to swallow a mop.
      The mop was put into the water by a sailor.               A  fishing-frog   was ply
ing its trade close by.          Perhaps it thought the mop was some kind of fish           ;



                            FISHES THAT BUILD A NEST.                             119
at any rate it was unwilling to let anything go by.            It caught the mop in
its great cavern of a mouth.         But the teeth stuck fast in the wool, and as
the fish could not pull them out in time, it was hauled into the boat and
killed.
                         FISHES THAT BUILD A NEST.
Fishes     have    not warm   blood   as we have.      They do not care about their
young ones.        They lay their eggs in the water, and leave them to hatch,
without taking any trouble.
       This is the usual habit of fishes  ; but there are a few exceptions to the
rule.
       There is a fish called the hassar.        It lives in America, in pools and
streams.      And when its pool dries up, it sets out to find another.
       It has the sac of water under its gills, so it can travel on dry land, and
bear the heat of the sun.
       It builds a nest for its young.
       In the  fine spring weather,  it begins  to make its  little house.
       Its house is like a hollow ball, flat at the top.    It  is made of the fibres
of   the rushes and the water-plants.        It has a hole, through which the fish
can get in.
       People are very cruel to the poor fish.
       They find out its nest, and come with a basket and a stick.
       They hold the basket to the hole, and begin to beat the nest with a
stick.
       The fish gets very angry at being disturbed.          It spreads out its hard
fins, with their sharp points, and gives a spring forward.
       Then it falls at once into the basket^ and is caught.
       There is an active little fish that lives on our own shores, and has fins
on his back.
       He is called the stickleback, and also the thornback.
       He takes all the trouble from his partner, for he makes the nest him
 self.    He twists bits of sea-weed and corallines together, and glues them

120                                        THE SWORD-FISH.
with a gummy matter, that Nature has given him, and that comes out like
a thread.
       The nest is in the shape of a pear, and has a way out and a way in.
It    might be said to have a front door and a back.
       The fish takes a great deal of pains with his nest, and will alter it over
and over again before he gets               it   to his mind.
    When the eggs have been laid by the mother fish, he keeps guard over
them.  And when an enemy comes near, and wants to devour them, he
darts out and pushes him over.
    Naturalists are very fond of watching                          the   stickleback     taking care of
his young.           They say it reminds them of a hen and her brood.
       If a    young fish ventures too far from home, the stickleback swims after
it,   seizes   it   in his mouth, and carries          it   back again.
                                        THE SWORD-FISH.
The life of      a   fish   is   not so easy as   it   seems.
       When you watch him gliding about in the calm waters,                               now rising to
the surface, now diving, or winding about in graceful sweeps or curves, you
think he has nothing to do but enjoy himself.
     This    not the case.
               is          The fish has to spend a great deal of his time in
fighting, or in running away from his enemies.
       Fishes prey upon each other, without mercy.                            The ocean world    is   like
a    battle-field, where the strong are always attacking the weak.
       There    is  a   fish     called the sea-wolf,       that   is    a   terrible creature to kill.
He has six rows of teeth in each jaw, and he makes                               a   pretty good use of
them.
       He grinds up the shell of            a    lobster,    or a crab, and eats both shell and
animal together.
       When he       is   caught, he bites on       all sides, and fights         so   fiercely, that the
sailors are quite in dread of him.             They kill him, as soon as they can, with
hard blows on the head.                But he has been known to get the anchor between

his teeth, and leave the marks upon it          : and as for a gun, which was pointed
at him, the sea-wolf bit it all to pieces, as        if it had been glass.
     He is a very            large
fish, which makes him           all
the more dreaded.
     He    is    six  or    seven
feet   long,     and   in     cold
countries     will    be    found
larger still.
     He may well       be called
wolf-fish.     He is    as  much
dreaded in the sea, as the
wolf is on land.
     Do you see the fish in
the picture    ?   He is armed
with a sword.
     This is why           people
                                                         THE SWORD-FISH.
call him the sword-fish          .
     The sword is a very terrible weapon indeed.               You    see    how long it is    !
     The sword-fish swims very fast, and is as bold and strong as can be.
     He is one of the deadliest enemies of the great whale.
     He attacks him with that cruel sword of his, and wounds him terribly.
     The whale has no weapon             but his huge tail.        If    he  could strike the
sword-fish, the blow would kill him           ;   but the sword-fish contrives to keep
out of the way.
     There is a very fierce battle indeed,             and   the noise is heard a long
way off.      It    does not end,     until either the whale or the sword-fish               is
killed.
     The sword-fish         will, now and then, run         his sharp       weapon   through
the bottom of a ship.              He cannot get it out again, and there the sword
sticks.
     A    naturalist     once saw a fish    trying to pull out the sword from the
bottom of the vessel.

     The fish struggled violently,   and was obliged, at last, to swim away,
and leave the sword behind.
     Of course  the  poor fish was very soon        seen  to  roll over, and   float
dead on the waves.
                             CUNNING FISHES.
There   are some fishes that have not sharp weapons given them to keep off
their enemies.    They would be badly off,     if  Nature had not endowed them
with cunning.
     There are many clever ways by which          these helpless fishes catch their
prey.
     There is one fish which    keeps    close hidden in the mud, and does not
let himself be seen.   He  is called the " sly," which is a very good name.
     He just shows the tip of his head, and that is all.

    Now this fish has a kind of beard growing on his lips.     The hairs of
the beard keep moving about in the water, and the little fishes are so silly
as to think they are worms.
    They come swimming up to catch them                ;   but instead of catching worms,
they are caught themselves            by the sly creature, that lies hidden in the
mud.
    There is another fish, that shoots his prey.
    How can he do that ?
    He makes a kind of pop-gun of his round snout.                  He shoots at flies, and
other insects.
    When he         sees a   fly settle on one of the plants that overhang the water,
he fixes his eyes upon it.
    Then he swims to the place from which he can take aim the best.                     He
keeps quite under water, and does not let himself                  be seen.   But, all in a
moment,     a drop        of water is shot with such force against the fly, that it is
brought down.             Then the fish swims up and seizes       without any more
                                                                     it,
trouble.
    This shooting-fish does not live in the            sea,   but in the rivers and lakes
of India.
    There      is   another fish, which   is   called the sucking-fish.
    He has          a   kind of plate on his head, by which he can stick fast to
any object he likes.            Nothing can pull him away, when he has chosen to
fix himself.
       The people        in the West Indies once used the sucking-fish to hunt the
turtle.
       They tied     a   strong cord to his tail. and let him down into the sea, in
the place where the turtle was asleep on the surface.
       The sucking-fish would         stick    to the turtle    with such firmness,   that
both fish and turtle were drawn up together.
    On the coast of Africa, people catch turtles in this way still.

 124                               THE FLTING-FISH.
                                 THE FLYING-FISH.
      The fish in the picture is called the flying-fish, because it can give great
jumps out of the water.
      This is the nearest approach a fish can make to flying.
      The air-bladder of the flying-fish is very large.      When it is filled with
air,  it takes up nearly   the whole    of the body.
      Its fins are, as you  see,  very large, and almost like wings.  They do not
hinder it from swimming ; when it is in the water, they are folded close to
its body, and quite out of the way.
      When the fish takes its jumps, it not only expands its fins but its
tail.    It skims along a little like a swallow. Indeed, the ancient writers
called   it hirundo, which    means a swallow.
      It   can  fly about fifty or sixty yards at a time,      then it drops into

                                 THE FLYING-FISH.                                125

the water,    and  moistens     its   gills.     After that,   it can take  another
spring.
     The fish gives these jumps to get out of the way of its enemies.
     In the Tropics, a shoal of flying-fish is often seen springing out of the
water.
     Their silvery fins, and blue bodies,         glitter in the sun, and look very
beautiful.
     But this plan of flying is not always a safe one.
     There are a number of sea-birds ready to pounce on the poor fish when
it gets out of water.
     The gull and the great albatross are always on the watch.               For, in
Tropical seas, the birds abound in far greater numbers than you have any
idea of.
     In the picture, the poor  little flying-fishes are being pursued by dolphins.
In vain they give their flying leaps out of the water.                On come the

126                                 THE HERRING.
dolphins close after them.        More than one little fish has fallen into the
mouth of its enemy.
     I   am afraid that, one by one, they     will all be devoured    in a similar
manner.
     On board     ship, people   amuse   themselves  by watching   the flying-fish.
If a  light is brought,    a shoal of them will drop on deck attracted by it.
Then they get caught.          The sailors think them a great delicacy, and say
they are as good to eat as mackerel.
     Thus, you   see,  the poor flying-fish  has no peace.  It  is hunted both in
the air and in the water.
     Now and then a flying-fish has been found near our own coasts.               It
has made its way in the Gulf Stream.
                                  THE HERRING.
The great wide ocean supplies man with an abundant store of food.
     At certain seasons shoals of fishes, miles in length, come near the coasts,
and pour into all the creeks, and bays, and coves, from the shores of
Norway to those of Ireland.
     Their number exceeds belief; they are packed so closely that a stick
would     stand upright    among   their ranks.     They pour  on,  and on, until
there seems no end of them.
     Armies of birds hover above, and keep thinning their ranks.
     The shark feasts upon them to his heart's content, and so do many
other greedy fishes that follow in their track.
     What is the name of the fish     ?
     It  is the herring.
     When the fishermen      in the seaport towns know the herrings are coming,
they are very busy indeed.
     Whole fleets of boats put off from the shore, and cast nets into the sea.
     The herrings will not go into the nets, except in the dark.        So that all
the fishing has to be done by night.



                                     THE HERRING.                                   129
      The darkest night is thought       to be the best.       Then, the sea is alive
 with torches.
      The poor fishes run headlong into the nets.        The holes in the net are just
  wide enough to let the fish get in its head.           But there it sticks — it can
 neither get backwards nor forwards.
      The herring dies directly it is taken out of the water.              The covers
 to its gills — those lids that     I told you about — are very large, and open
 very    wide.     So    the gills get dry in a minute, and the fish cannot
 breathe.
      You would scarcely believe how many herrings can be caught in a
 night !
      Great boats have had to cut their nets, lest the weight of the fish
 should sink them      !
      What brings the herring to the coast      ?
      It  comes to lay its eggs, or to spawn,     as it is called.
      When this work is over, the herrings go back again to the depths of
 the ocean.
      The herring finds plenty of food in the sea.             It  devours myriads of
 tiny creatures, and minute shell-fish.
      The fishermen tell us, that in places where the jelly-fishes        abound,  the
 herrings are most abundant.
      These well-peopled     spots in ocean are like rich pastures for the herring
 to feed upon.      But the herring is not very particular in its appetite.          It
 will  eat a young herring     without the least scruple.
      It  is also rather whimsical.
      The great shoal of herrings, of which we have been speaking, will not
always continue to visit the same place.          After it has done so for years, it
will   suddenly forsake it.
      There are some small islands on the coast of Scotland, where the her
ring-fishery was once carried on.        But the great shoal does not visit those
islands any longer.
      I  must tell you that now and then the herring shoal pours in with such
haste and tumult that half the fish are stranded on the beach.

l30                                  THE SALMON.
     This ouce happened       on the coast of Scotland.    For   miles, a deep ridge
of herrings lay along the shore.         There was not salt enough in the whole
neighbourhood to pickle half of them, and tons of wholesome fish had to
be wasted.
     There is an odd-looking fish, called the "chimrera,"      found in most of the
seas  of Europe, and also in the Pacific Ocean.         It   pursues after the poor
herrings as they are on their way, and devours as many as it can.
                                    THE SALMON.
There    is one fish, that is the most valuable    and  delicate of all the fishes.
I  mean the salmon.       It  has a relation  called the trout, that is found in
                                                        fresh-water streams.
                                                              The   salmon   lives in
                                                        fresh water     as well as in
                                                        the sea.     It is not found
                                                        so  far south as the Medi
                                                        terranean.      But from the
                                                        rivers of France, up       to
                                                        Greenland, it has its home.
                                                              At certain   seasons of
                                                        the year, the salmon come
                                                        within reach of their great

                                                              Instinct leads them to
                                                        approach some river, and
                                                        swim up it; thus getting
                                                        away from their old safe
                        tue salmos.                     haunts in the sea.
     The salmon wants to lay its eggs in the bed of the river, and nothing
can stop its progress.

                                     THE SALMON.                                    131
     It   runs up into the rivers as far as it can get.            The higher it has
reached, the less valuable it becomes in the eyes of the fishermen.                The
flesh is not so dainty as when the fish is       newly come from the     sea.
     Often, a shoal of salmon will come to a roaring waterfall ten feet in height.
     Here they stop, and swim back a few
paces, as    if they   were taking  a view    of the
danger before them.
     They have, as you see in the plate, to
leap up the wall of roaring water, and this
is the most wonderful thing in the story.
     The instinct of the fish is so strong, that
not even       this difficulty can stop it in its
course.
      It lies  still a few minutes, and then curls
its body into a bow, so that its tail seems
to touch its mouth.          Then it gives a great
spring upwards, hoping to reach the top.
      Very often it does reach the top.        Then
it swims away in a moment, and is lost
sight of.
      But now and         then it misses   its aim,
and is dashed upon the bank.          There it lies      SALMON LEAP AT EILMORACK.
a few seconds, stunned, and then struggles back into the water.
     And sometimes it will nearly reach the top, and be brought back again
by the force of the water.
     The salmon leap you see in the picture is a famous one in Scotland.
A   great many fish often miss their aim at this leap, and fall upon the bank.
     People are on the watch to catch          them.  And the owner of the place
once had a great iron pot set upon the rocks close by, and numbers of fish
dropped into it.
     The salmon is often caught at these leaps as it falls back spent and
stunned.       Women have been known to catch it in their aprons.
     There are some famous salmon leaps in Ireland, and also in Wales.

182                             STINGING FISHES.
     When the season is over, the salmon goes back again to the sea.
     The eggs are left behind, in the shallow creeks of the river.              They
have been covered with sand, by the mother fish, and lie buried till the
following spring.    Then the little salmon make their appearance, and begin
to swim to the sea.
     In course of time they too come to lay their eggs in the river.              And
they will never visit any river except the one in which they have been born.
                               STINGING FISHES.
You   have seen the   kind of weapons which the fish has for his defence.
     He is either very strong, or very swift, or very cunning, or he has a
                                                  terrible mouth, armed with
                                                  rows of sharp teeth       like the
                                                  shark.
                                                       There is a tribe of fishes
                                                  with flat    bodies,   which     are
                                                  called rays.
                                                       They    are  very    ugly to
                                                  look at.
                                                       The broad flat body has a
                                                  long, narrow tail,   with two or
                                                  three broad fins.      There is a
                                                  row of spines along its whole
                                                  length  ;  the   spines are      the
                                                  weapons   it  has to defend    itself
                                                  with.
                                                       When the fish is attacked,
                               wsam£-j6(jM        it  bends itself round,    so   that
                                                  the   tip of its     nose    almost
touches the end   of its tail,  Then it lashes its tail about, and gives wounds
with the spines.

                                          THE TORPEDO.                                            133
     The     spines      are    very   sharp   indeed,      in one species they sting
                                                             and
violently.       This species          is called the stinging ray ; it lives in South
America.
    There are many stories told about this stinging ray.
     An Indian,      was wounded by a ray, as he was crossing a river.
                      once,
     He was in such agony, that the moment he reached the bank he fell on
the ground, and           rolled about, as     if   he were scarcely able        to endure        the
torment.
     A     boy wounded          in the    same      manner,     cried and howled and bit the
ground in his anguish.
     Indeed, the sting of this ray has been known to kill a man.
     These Tropical rays are            of a monstrous size, compared with those that
live in our European seas.
     There is one called the sea-devil of the Pacific.
     It    is sometimes         as much as fifteen           feet broad, and its black-looking
body lies on the top of the water, looking like a stone.                    As a rule, however,
the flat fishes keep at the bottom.
    The inhabitantsof the Society Islands kill the stinging ray with har
poons, and then make files or rasps of its skin.
                                         THE TORPEDO.
There is      a relation       of the rays that has a mysterious and powerful weapon
of defence.
    It     lives in the Mediterranean Sea, and is called the torpedo.
    Have you heard of the electrical eel                 ?    It   can give shocks   as   powerful
as an     electrifying    machine.       The torpedo has the same power of giving a
shock, but     it is much       more feeble.
    You can        see    that the torpedo has a clumsy body,                 in shape     a    little
like a musical instrument.
    The machine Nature has given                 it,   and that produces     the shock,    is   very
curious.

134                              THE TORPEDO.
     It consists of a number of tubes, and is not unlike a piece of a honey
comb.     The tubes take up the whole length of the body, between the
upper and under surface, and a secretion of thick mucus is found in them.
    The torpedo is very much dreaded, as you may think, by its neighbours
in the sea.
     It feeds upon fishes, and whatever    it  can find, and it is thought that it
may use its machine to stun its prey.
                                                              .
                                    THE TORtEDO.
     In  the warm seas  of the Tropics very large torpedos are found.       If you
 were to touch one it would give you a curious sensation.          You would feel
as you do when you give      your elbow   a   blow against some sharp corner.
     The torpedo is a sluggish creature, and likes to bury itself in the sand.

                         THE MACKEREL AND ITS RELATIONS.                                   186
     This is just the time when it is most to be dreaded.                     If an   unlucky
person were to disturb         it by accident,  it would give him           one  of its most
angry shocks.
      In   these days a great deal    is said about electricity, and the doctors are
trying to make use of it to cure many complaints.
     But so long ago as the days of Antony and Cleopatra, the torpedo was
used as medicine too.         Its shocks were thought to cure pains in the head,
and various other maladies.          And in later times, if a man had the gout, he
was told to put his foot on the torpedo,          and to keep       it  there,  until  he felt
a sensation     of being numbed, as high up       as his knee.
                   THE MACKEREL AND ITS RELATIONS.
You may often        have   seen the smooth shining mackerel,             with its beautiful
scales.
      It  is a very greedy fish, though it is so beautiful.             And though it is a
good swimmer,        it has no air-bladder   in its body.
      It follows   the shoal  of
herrings, and preys upon
them,    without any mercy.
      It lives in the North
Atlantic Ocean, but it
pays a visit,     every year,
to the    British shores.
      A  fish called the gar
fish always comes        before
it ;  people have called      it
the mackerel guide.                                    I.IE MAI l.tl.H.
      The garfish has a round body a little like an eel, and a long mouth, full
of sharp teeth.
      The mackerel is easy to catch, because it bites greedily at any kind of
bait.

13G                        THE MACKEREL AND ITS RELATIONS.
      People make a little fish, with bright scales,         that looks as   if it were
alive, but      in reality it is only made of metal, or even of scarlet cloth.
      The mackerel thinks the fish is alive, and darts at it with great swift
ness.     It   is caught in this way, either     with a line or with a net.
      People who live at Yarmouth, on the coast of Norfolk, are very active
when the great shoal of mackerel comes.
      The boats stand        out,  and  the  beautiful   shining   fish are brought   in
by thousands.          They very soon die when they are taken out of the water,
and their beautiful colour begins to fade.
      For   a   little time, they will shine in the dark     as if they were on fire.
      The mackerel has a great many relations, living in different parts of the
se.o.
      There is a fish called the bonito, which is a kind of mackerel.
      It lives in the South Seas, and the islanders catch it by using the flying-
fish as a bait.
      They put a flying-fish        on a hook, and     draw it along the water as      if
it were flying.
      This brings up the bonito in a minute, for it is one of the worst enemies
the flying-fish has.
      But, as it happens, the bonito itself gets caught.
      The head of the mackerel family is a fish called the tunny.
      The flesh of the tunny is excellent to eat, and the tunny-fishery             is a
source of riches to the people engaged          in it.
      At  a   certain time of the year the tunnies come in vast numbers and
swim along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
      They are very timid creatures, and         if they see an enemy in the distance
they will turn and go another way.
      But a fisherman is perched on some high place to keep a sharp look
out.     When he sees the tunnies coming, he gives a signal.
      Then a great many boats          set  off in the direction pointed out by the
fisherman.
      They throw their nets into the          sea,  and keep driving the poor fishes
towards the land.



                            THE REAL SEA-SERPENT.                               139

                        THE REAL SEA-SERPENT.
The fish in the picture on next page is really the sea-serpent.         Its body is
as thick as a man's arm, and about six feet long.          It has a kind of snout,
as you perceive.   Its colours are brown on the upper part, and a silver-white
beneath.   It lives in the Mediterranean Sea.
    It does not approach, in any degree, to the fabled monster which goes
by the name of the Great Sea-Serpent.           Yet, in form, it is as much like a
snake as can be.
    Can you think of no other fish that is like a snake        ?

 110                        THE HEAL SEA-SERPENT.
                                   THE SEA-SERPENT.
     There is the eel.    The eel has a snake-like       body, and wriggles about
in the mud.     Yet it is a true fish, and has srills to breathe through.
     There is an eel in the Mediterranean Sea which the old Romans had a
great fancy for.    They used to keep        it in fish-ponds near  the sea-beach,
and prize it as we do gold and silver fish ; only that we do not eat the
gold and silver fish.      But the Romans used to eat the murey.             They
thought its flesh a great delicacy.       Julius Csesar, at one of his banquets,
had six thousand mureys given away to his friends.
     But the old Romans were guilty of cruel acts         ; and they had a shock

                                        THE MUREY.                                     Ml
ing way of punishing their poor slaves.              If a slave   offended   his master,
he would    be  thrown into a fish-pond, to the greedy and voracious mureys,
who would soon eat him up.
     A  Roman noble, named Pollio, was very fond of having a poor slave
thrown to the fishes       ;  and he would    think it famous sport to stand by and
see  the fishes    devour him.       You would hardly believe that such           a hard
hearted wretch could be found         !
     One night, the Emperor Augustus was supping              with this wicked noble.
In the middle of      supper, one    of the slaves who was waiting on the guests
broke a crystal goblet.        His cruel master ordered him, at once, to be thrown
into the fish-pond.
                                         THE Ml'REV.
    The poor slave was in a terrible fright, and begged and                  prayed    for
mercy.     He begged and prayed to the Emperor, and went down on his
knees before him.        I   dare say he had no hope from his master's mercy,          be
cause he had       none.      The  Emperor     was sorry for the      slave,  and   asked
Pollio to forgive him.         But Pollio would not, even though it was an em
peror who asked him.
     At last  the Emperor        grew angry, and pardoned       the poor slave himself.
Then he caused all Pollio's beautiful goblets to be broken, and his fish-pond
to be filled up  ;  which was a much less punishment then he deserved.

142                                 THE SHARK.
                                  THE SHARK.
All   the creatures who live     in the sea, as we have seen, prey constantly
upon each other.
     The world of waters is like a great battle-field, where the weakest go
to the wall.   But the fiercest, the most dreaded, and the most hateful of all
the monsters of the sea, is the shark.
                     WHITF. SHARE SEIZING A SAILOR, WHILE BAT1IING.
    You have heard his name a great many times.                    Happily, he does not
come to our shores.    A relation of his, called the basking shark, is often
seen ; but he is quite harmless, and nobody is afraid of him.
    The white shark is the creature that does all the mischief.
    If you could peep into his huge mouth, you would                 see how well able
he is to destroy whatever comes      in his way.

                                                  THE SHARK.                                                143
       He has six rows of teeth, which lie down when they are not used                                  ;   but
the moment a fish               approaches,       up they all start, ready for action.                  They
are very       great teeth,        nearly     two inches broad,          and of a three-cornered
shape.     The edges are like a saw, and as sharp as the sharpest knife.
       No creature, not even man, has much chance against these terrible teeth.
If a man      falls overboard from a ship, he is almost sure to be swallowed by a
shark.
       For   a shark        can swallow
a man        with   ease    ;   and he is
always following in the wake
of the ship, to       see   what he can
get.
       The female shark lays two
eggs,    instead of a great shoal
of eggs, as most fishes do.

processes,         shooting      out from
the     covering.       These     tendrils
get entangled among the sea
weeds, and so hold the egg in
one place, instead of letting it
                                                                       oF -HUM, :h EOOS.

fish is doubled up in the egg                 ;   but by-and-by        it makes its way               out, and
begins a life of cruelty and plunder, as its parents did before it.
    You need not wonder that the shark is so dreaded by the sailors.
        In   the    midst of the tempest,             when the winds are howling,                     and the
night is without moon or stars, a shining light will here and there be seen
heaving on the billows.  The sailors know full well what it    and point                   is,               it
out to each other.
        The light comes from             the scaly body        of the shark, who                 is   close at
hand.

 HI                                  THE SHARK.
     If a poor seaman  is washed overboard,            or   if the vessel should be wrecked,
then the shark has a banquet.
     The French have called him "requin."                     They say,   if a man falls into
the sea  in sight of a shark, then the "requiem" may be sung.
     I dare say you know that in Catholic countries "requiem" means the
prayers for the dead.
                              THE II AM Ml I. Ill AIM h vii vl I.,
     There are many different kinds of sharks.
     There is the blue shark, who is really very handsome.                     His back is a
bluish-green, and the under part of his body is white.                      He is only eight
feet long.   The white    shark is thirty feet in length.                But the blue shark
is very fierce, and will devour a man as readily as his dreaded relation.

                                       THE SHARK.                                     145
      But his principal food is fish, such as herrings and pilchard.
      Then there is the fox shark, with a head a little like a fox, and a tail
that can beat the water into foam for miles round.
      And there is the huge hammer-headed shark, that you                 see in the pic
ture.
      Its head is the shape of a hammer, and, as you perceive, the eyes are
placed one at each end.
      This hideous creature lives in the Indian          seas,    and also in the Medi
terranean.       It  likes also to inhabit the waters near the coral islands.          It
is as fierce as it is ugly,
                               /.*.
and though it does not
grow to the size of the
white      shark,   it is   as
much dreaded.
      I   have    not    quite
finished with the shark.
      There    is   a fish   a
little like the mackerel
that follows him about.
The sailors called it the                         THE PILOT-FISH.
pilot-fish,   because     they said that   it guided the shark        to  his prey, and
warned him of danger.             But this is a fable.     The pilot-fish only follows
the   shark in hopes of picking up some stray morsel that the monster has
dropped.
      There is still another fish related to the sharks, and that has a terrible
weapon.
      It  is called the saw-fish.
      Do you see its long saw, jagged at both edges ?
      Its body is covered on the upper surface with sharp spiny knobs, a little
like the rays.
      It  is as savage as its relation the shark, only, happily, it is not so often
met with.
      It  attacks the whale, as the sword-fish does, and will bury its weapon

the side of a ship.
     You would wonder how the edges of the saw could be forced through
either the whale or the ship.   But the fish comes to the attack with such
violence that nothing can resist the shock.

Man obtains a vast amount of food from the ocean.             It is like a mighty
storehouse which can never be exhausted.

                                        THE COD.                                         117
     I  am going to tell you about a fish        that is no doubt very familiar to
you — the     cod.   The cod and its relations are all very greedy creatures.
The cod's great mouth is
ever open.       It will    swal
low whatever comes in its
way.      The crab, with its
hard shell, is gulped down
without any difficulty; and
such is the power of diges
tion which      the cod      pos
sesses,  that the shell gives
it   no    uneasiness      what
ever.
     I  may as well say here
that fishes, as a rule, pos
sess    powers of digestion
that are almost past belief.
Their     food    is   snatched                            ™  cov-
greedily, and often        swallowed whole.     All kinds of       substances   find their
 way into     the hungry       mouth.    Yet the fish thrives and        eats,  and is as
healthy and vigorous as ever.
     The cod, in spite of its greedy disposition, is one of the most useful
fishes we    have.      It  produces  such  an amazing quantity        of eggs,   that you
would hardly believe it possible.          Three millions    of eggs have come from
one fish !     So that the supply of cod-fish is hardly likely to fail us.
     Every part of the cod is of use.        Its flesh is firm and white, and affords
excellent food for man.
      Its tongue, when salted, is thought by many persons to be a great deli
cacy.     Its gills are used by fishermen to bait their hooks with.                    You
have heard of cod-liver oil.           In these days it is a famous remedy for
weakness of the chest, and various other maladies.              The swimming-bladder
gives us isinglass    ;   and the fisherman  will boil   the head, and use      it for food
for himself and family.

148                                     THp COD.
      In Norway    the fisherman will feed his cows on cod-fish.         Cod-fish and
sea-weed mixed together are thought           to do the cows good, and make them
yield more milk.
      In Iceland, also, that dreary country, the people give the bones of the
cod to   their cattle   ; and in Kamschatka        the dogs are fed with the same
diet.    Nay, on the shores of the Icy Sea the poor people dry the bones of
the fish, and burn it instead of coal.
      Thus   you    see   how     many people    and   countries  are   benefited  by
the cod.
      The cod-fishery     is more    important    than the herring-fishery,    and  is
on a far grander scale.        It requires large boats, and abundance of stores and
implements.
      Of late  years    the   English fishing-vessels have     been   contrived  with
wells in them.      The fish can be brought to England in these wells actually
alive  !
      The great Newfoundland        Bank is a famous place for cod.      A fisherman
may there catch four hundred fish in a day.
      Each man has a space allowed him in which to fish, so that he does not
interfere with his neighbour.
      But now and then he has to call upon his neighbour to help him.
The fish will be so large and heavy that he cannot pull it up.
      He very often does not        see  his neighbour, though he can hear him
talk.
      The fog is so dense that it is like a thick cloud, and hides everything
from view.
      The men have lanterns and alarm trumpets          ; but in spite of these the
ships are in danger.
      There will come a storm, and the ships, unable to see each other in the
mist, get dashed together and broken to pieces.
      So that fishing for cod is rather dangerous      work, and makes many poor
children fatherless.
      On the coast of Norway there has been a cod-fishery for more than a
thousand years.       All   the bays and gulfs on the shore, at a certain time of

the year, swarm        with cod    ; and along the whole       of the coast fishermen     are
busy with boats, and lines, and hooks, and nets, all with one intent — that
of catching the poor cod.
      In  these days     it is the fashion to rear fishes in tanks or pools made on
purpose for them.          Here their habits can be studied.
      In the Hebrides of Scotland there are some of these tanks that com
municate with the sea.
      A fisherman      has the care   of the fish, and he goes regularly to feed them.
The fish know him quite well.             When he comes with his basket, they swim
towards him, and open their mouths to receive the food.                     They will even
take it from his hand.
       FISHES THAT PUFF THEMSELVES UP LIKE A BALL.
Some     of the fishes have,
as   you      have seen,     very
whimsical shapes.           There
is no end to their variety.
      Here is a creature that
looks like the head of a
monster fish, cut off from
the body.      It looks,  in fact,
to be all head and fins.
      Now      and    then,    the
fisherman sees this great
round      fish   lying on the
water, and floating, as if it
were dead.         He knows it
 is the sun-fish, and he will
                                                                       THE SUN-FI3H.

       This happens at Brighton, and other places on the south coast                 ; but it
 is only by accident that the sun-fish comes near our shores.

152                    FISHES THAT PUFF THEMSELVES UP LIKE A BALL.
        The sun-fish has a great many relations called globe-fishes.                           They arc
some  of them no larger than a foot-ball, and others a great deal larger.
     They are armed with spines, or prickles, like the hedgehog.    And some
of them have a regular coat of mail. They may be said to be among the
armed creatures of the Ocean.
        But the most curious part of their habits has yet to be told.
        The whole family have a means of defence such as we have not before
met with.
        When         of them is alarmed it can puff its body out like a round
                      one
ball.        Then its spines stand up, and appear to its enemies like an array of
spears.
        One of the globe-fishes           is called Pennant's globe-fish,        because     it was dis
covered   by a famous traveller of the name of Pennant.       It has a crop a
little like the crop of a fowl.   It    in fact, one of its stomachs.
                                                   is,                  When

Then     it   turns over, and floats on its back.

                                                         it   loses
and     is   drifted about at the mercy of the waves.    But its prickles all stand
up, so that           it   is   really fully armed, and dangerous to any creature that ap
proaches it.
        When     it    wants to empty the air from its crop,              it   lets off by degrees
                                                                                      it
through the mouth and gills, making, as                   it   does so,   a rushing kind of noise.
        The fish in the picture puffs its body out, as you see, and makes                               it   a
very odd shape, a little like   box with   lid to it.

to balance itself, and move from side to side,                    like a boat on the         sea.
        Do you notice the horny spines over its eyes and upon its back                              ?
        They have a touch of poison in them.                    And in many instances the flesh
of the fish will be poisonous as well.
     The natives of the countries where the globe-fishes are found, are
careful never to eat them.    And they will warn strangers of their poisonous
nature.

                                            THE PIPE-FISH.                                             168
      There is a story told of a sailor who was resolved                    to try, at all risks,
and taste what the flesh of the fish was like.
                                             THE COFFRE-FISH.
      He thought it was only the curious shape of the fish that made it
disliked.
      But he paid dear for his rashness.                        When   he had had the creature
cooked, and had eaten         it,   he was taken         ill and   died.
                                    THE PIPE-FISH.
The pipe-fish has a long slender body, and its jaws are united, and form                                 a
tube.   The entire body     covered with horny plates something like a coat
                                   is
of mail. Yet the horny plates are flexible, and the fish can twist itself
about pretty much as               likes.
                           it it
      Some people call         the needle-fish       ;   but the name by which          it   is   known
is   the pipe-fish.
      The pipe-fish swims about, often with its head downwards, and                               it   will
put itself into all kinds of curious contortions.
      It   is   looking about for tiny creatures to feed upon.                It   is   thought that

loi                              THE PIPE-FISH.
                                    Fii'E-FIanES.
the fish draws up its food through the            long tube-like mouth, as water is
drawn through a syringe.
     The fish is of no use itself as an article of food.          It has scarcely any
flesh on its dry, hard body.
     The pipe-fish is very fond of its young ones.         The father pipe, and not
the mother,   carries them in a pouch or bag.           When    the little pipe-fishes
are swimming about,     and anything frightens them, they run to their parent,
and get into the pouch.
     A fisherman one day caught a pipe-fish, and shook the young ones out
of the pouch into the water.      The poor little creatures did not swim away.
They kept close to the spot, and when the fisherman held the old fish near
them, they   all jumped into the pouch again.
     There are many different kinds of pipe-fishes, and they have curious
names.     Most of them live on our own coasts, and are often found

                                  THE PIPE-FISH.                                    155
among the sea-weeds at low- water.       There is one called the deep-nosed pipe
fish, and another the snake, and another the worm pipe-fish.
      In  the picture, you see that two  of the fishes have short, stiff toils, like
a brush.      In another part of the family the tail is long and slender, and
can   twist round anything, and hold it fast.
      The fish likes to hold fast to some support by its tail.        Indeed, if there
is nothing at hand, a good many pipe-fishes will twist their tails together,
and present the most curious appearance.
      No one would believe
that this very odd-looking
little creature was a fish
at all.     But such is the
case.
      It  is a  kind of pipe-  •
fish,   but  it is not very
common.       When it is dead
its body curls up, and its
head and neck look      like a
horse's head.
      People often put it in
their    cabinets   and   mu
seums, for a curiosity, and
call it the sea-horse.
      A  gentleman kept two
                                                   THE SEA-HOR.SR.
of these funny little fishes in a glass vase, as we do gold and silver fish,
and amused himself by watching them.
      They were not very comfortable at first, for they wanted something to
twist their tails round, and keep themselves steady.           But when, by-and-by,
some     sea-weed   was put into the    water, they    seemed      very glad indeed.
They soon fixed themselves firmly upon it.
      Do you not perceive how the sea-horse, in the picture, has its tail twisted
round the stem of a marine plant      ?
      When the fishes were at rest, and, as it were, anchored,          they began   to

166                                     THE LAMPREY.
watch for prey.        The moment a tiny worm or insect was seen out they
darted,    and caught     it in a minute.
      They would also amuse themselves             by darting at each other, and tying
their tails together,      and then pulling them asunder.
      More than one little sea-horse          has been    found coiled up in an oyster-
shell.
                                 THE LAMPREY.
Here is another kind of             eel that used    to be much prized in the olden
time — I mean, the lamprey.
      The round thing in the picture is its mouth, which it uses as a sucker.
                                   Do you see the rows of sharp teeth all round the
                              mouth   ?    By  means  of these sharp teeth, the lamprey
                              can devour almost anything.
                                   But as it cannot swim well, and is feeble and
                              helpless,  its prey might escape it.
                                   Nature provided against this, when she gave the
                              lamprey its wonderful mouth.
                                   Suppose   a fish came swimming by, and      the lam

                              prey was very hungry.           I  will tell you what it
                              would do.
      It  would contrive to fix its mouth on the surface of the fish's body.

                                        THE GLUTINOUS HAG.                                       157
The round sucker of a mouth would adhere, as the leech's does.                              Nothing
could pull it away.
      But how can it breathe while its mouth is fast to the body of a fish?
      Not in the usual way, for no water can get into its throat.
      But you will see a number of holes along the side of the neck. These
are really the gills, and the water can             flow in and out of them without
going in at the mouth.                  Thus the lamprey can breathe all the time it is
fast to the fish.
      The lamprey is a very imperfect fish.                     The bones of its skeleton are
very soft, almost like gristle, and it is one of the lowest in the order of the
Vertebrata.           It   has neither fins nor air-bladder.
      I    have not quite done with its sucker.
      It   fastens     itself to a stone or rock, and keeps steady even though the
waves are rough.
      And when the mother lamprey wants to lay her                             eggs,   the sucker is
very useful indeed.
      Like      the salmon, and many other fishes, she comes tolay her eggs in a
river.        She wants to hide them under a stone in some safe place.  But how
can she move the stone              ?
      She       fastens     her    sucker   to   it,    and pulls   it   up.    Her partner     will
come and help her, and you would                       be surprised at the great stones         they
can   lift.
      In      old times people thought the lamprey a great delicacy, and lam
prey-pie was set            on    the royal table.          Even now, the town of Gloucester
presents a lamprey-pie, every Christmas, to the reigning sovereign.
                                    THE GLUTINOUS HAG.                   .
The lowest of all, in the tribe of fishes, has rather an ugly name.
   It more like a worm than fish and Linnaeus, the famous naturalist,
           is                                a          ;
did class       it   with the worms.

158                                        THE GLUTINOUS HAG.
      Now-a-days it has been examined with great care, and is found to be a
relation of the lamprey.
       It    has really no skeleton at all.           A     of gristle runs
                                                            bare tube, or thread,
through the body, and when boiled the whole tube goes to jelly.
     It has no eyes. And you would suppose it to be the most defenceless
of its tribe.  But no such thing.                               r
       It    is a very unpleasant neighbour, and is quite able to take care of
itself.
       Blind though it          is,contrives to get inside some other fish.
                                      it                                    How                            it
can do so       is    not clearly known, but     fish has been found completely de

voured,       the    skin only remaining, and the glutinous hag within it.
       The hag has eight feelers round its mouth                      ;    they have           a very   acute
sense       of touch.
                   As the fingers of a blind man can almost do the work of
eyes, so these feelers guide the blind fish, and help   to find its food.    it
    On the palate there      a single tooth like a hook.
                                      is                   The fish hooks on
to its prey by this hook, and                is   thought      by some persons               to make a hole
for itself to get in.
       It    keeps     hold with its one hook until the two rows of teeth that are
upon the tongue can come into play.
       It  with its head buried in the fish
             eats                                 devouring, so that Nature

has made the same provision that she has in the case of the lamprey.
    The breathing holes of this disagreeable creature are placed so far back
that   it    can eat and breathe at the same time.
       Why      is   it   called the glutinous hag?
       Because        there are pores down each side of its body that give out a
glutinous matter.             When the creature           is   attacked    it   can    throw out a quan
tity of this slimy           secretion,    and hide   itself in it.
       It   has another name besides the glutinous                    hag.        It   is   called the borer,
because      it     bores or pierces into its neighbours.

The fishes are supposed to have no voice at all ; and, indeed, this is the
case with most of them.  But there are exceptions to every rule ; and so
it   is   with the fish.
          There is a fish which               utters a cry when it is seized.         There is another
which wails, like a child, when it is taken from the water.                            Another fish

   There    a little white fish, with blue spots on its back, which lives in
                   is
America, and which can actually make      sound like music.      a
          A    traveller was one day lying on the beach resting himself, when sud
denly he heard a sound                    :   it    was like music in the distance.          He got up
and looked              about him        ;    but    nothing     was to be seen.      A   boatman was
close by, and             he asked        him   if    he heard anything.
                                                                              " Yes," said the boat
man            "
               I   hear a fish singing."
          ;
                                                 " siren                         "
          The fish was called by some people the                             ;       by others       musico,
     "
or        musician."
          The traveller pushed off in a boat, to hear the music better.                          He heard
a number  of voices singing together.     It was like a concert in the water.
The sound was    little like an organ playing at some distance.
                           a
           musical fishes are said to begin to sing at sunset, and keep on
          These
singing during the night.   They are not very timid, and will continue their
music, even             if people      are standing by to listen.
                                        THE          LILY STARS.
You           have heard       of animals which are like flowers, and like bells, and like
ribbons.
          Nature has a great many other varieties of shapes, to present to you.

160                                    THE LILT STARS.
     Here is a tribe of creatures called star-fishes.
     It  is rather a grand name to give them.             For in reality they occupy       a
very low place in the animal kingdom.
     But the shape of the common star-fish resembles the form of a star.
     People were rather puzzled to know in what class to place the star
fishes and their relations.          But now all this has been settled.
     The name        of the class in which naturalists          have   placed them,       is
Echinodermata.
                            two Greek words, meaning " a hedgehog                    " the
                                                                            "
     It   comes from                                                            and
skin."
     Some creatures        in this family, you will   see, are not unlike a hedgehog.
     There is a great deal that is very curious and interesting to be said of
the   race   of star-fishes.      Should you like to know the link between them
 and the polyps      ?
     I  will tell you.
     The coral-making          polyp had, as you remember,       the power    of secreting
a stony substance,        so as  to form a case or framework outside its body.          Its
soft body was snugly hidden within the case, but distinct from it.
     The     star-fishes,   and their relations, secrete a stony substance        as well.
But they secrete it within their bodies instead of without.
     The framework or skeleton of a star-fish consists of hard pieces, almost
like stone, and joined together by a substance like gristle.
     We shall hear more of this framework presently.                 And we shall find,
also, that some     of the tribe have long bodies, not in the least like star-fishes,
but resembling worms or annelides.
     The ocean is full of star-fishes.        The floor is literally paved with them.
They are      more     abundant than any other creature.           They devour almost
everything.        Dead      and   refuse matter   is cleared   away   by them.       But
they are not restricted to one kind of food.              Numbers of living creatures
fall victims to their rapacious appetites daily.          In fact, as we  shall see, they
are much to be dreaded           by the smaller inhabitants of the sea, on account
of their voracity and the weapons with which they are armed.
     In   the primeval ocean the star-fishes swarmed in the same numbers.

     They were not like our present         star-fishes; and a more elegant    name
has been given them.                          " lily stars."

     The skeletons of the lily stars are found in a fossil state.        They were
not formed to rove about freely in the water.           They were fixed to a slender
stalk, that could bend all ways.

       Nearly the whole of this beautiful race of creatures has been swept
away, and are extinct.           Except in a fossil state, one only of the family
remains.       This is called the rosy feather star.
       Its long slender rays are a deep rose colour, and very beautiful.               It
swims freely about in the water, and is only attached to a stalk when it is
young.
       It is found all round the shores, from Norway to the Mediterranean Sea.
It   is small and insignificant,     compared   with its ancestors the lily stars.

In the north of England they are often found, and are called " St. Cuth-

                                           THE BRITTLE STAR-FISH.                                            1S3
                                    THE BRITTLE            STAR-FISH.
If  you were to take the flower of the lily star from its stalk, you would
find a creature with a small round body, from which spring a number of
long slender arms.
        The body is made up
of the same stony pieces
that compose the arms, or
rays,        as   they are called.
In    the middle         of the body
is an opening, which is the
mouth.
        The arms or rays are
not like those of the com
mon star-fish.                They are
long and           thin,      and   each
springs           from     the      body
quite separately from its
neighbour.
                                                                            MAu-ns",
        In    one species        of star                          BRITTLE
fish,     the arms divide            and    subdivide   into a great many branches.                     These
branches      like so many legs, by which the creature can crawl at the

bottom of the sea, or twine itself among the sea-weeds and ocean plants.
    As the creature swims, it stretches out all its branches. When its prey
happens to come too near, the branches hook                          it,    and draw   it,   as   in    a   net,
to the mouth.
     I    am going to tell you about the                brittle    star-fish.     You may         see   what
it   like by looking at the picture.

    Its long arms are like the tails of serpents.   These arms are so easy to
bend about in all directions, that the creature can use them as legs to
crawl, or as fins to support itself in the water.

utmost nicety.    The mouth is surrounded by furrows              or grooves, in which
are some  tiny holes.     Through these holes, minute bodies, called suckers
can be pushed.     I shall  by-and-by describe these suckers in a more particular

manner.   They can take hold of any object, and keep it in a firm grasp.
Or they can help to retain the food of the animal while it is being digested.
    These star-fishes,  with their snake-like arms, are very beautiful.
    Their bodies are all kinds of tints and hues, and it is very seldom that
two of them are alike.

                                 THE STAR-FISH.                             .      105
      But the whole race of brittle star-fishes give the naturalist     a  great deal
of trouble.
      The creature has the art of breaking itself up into pieces.       The moment
it is  touched,   or even approached,  it  begins to fling off, first one arm,    and
then another, till scarcely anything is left.
      Often,  the  fisherman will bring up a number of these creatures in his
net.     They will twist about and put themselves into such strange attitudes,
and fling their arms about them in so reckless a manner, that he will be
quite uneasy, and shovel them back into the sea.
      But the naturalist     does not want     to  throw them back into the sea.
He wants to save a specimen for his collection, and this habit the creature
has   of breaking itself up is very annoying.
      He has but one way of proceeding.           He must plunge the brittle star
fish into a vessel of cold fresh water. Tins will kill it at once, before it has
time to get rid of any part of its body.
      But even then the creature will often be too quick for him.             He will
slowly and cautiously approach, and lower his bucket of fresh water.              But
before    he has time to do more, the     brittle  star will begin to break itself
up.     First will go one arm, and then another, till the naturalist will seize
hold of such parts as he can get, and carry them away, in despair of
obtaining a more perfect specimen.
                            THE      STAR-FISH.
If  you were to pick up a common        star-fish from the shore, you would see
at once that it is very different from those of its race which          I  have been
describing.      The   rays  are  not long and thin,      and they do not spring
separately from the body.        They are joined     to it at  the  base, and are so
much larger and thicker, that some of the internal          parts of the animal are
lodged in them.
      But these rays, thus thick and joined together, cannot act          as the long
slender ones did.

 186                             THE STAR-FISH.
     And yet the star-fish seizes and holds its prey.
     We will suppose a victim, of any kind, being          so   unlucky as to come
near a hungry star-fish.
     Let us  see what happens.
     The star-fish bends its rays, so as to form a kind of cup.           Then it lays
hold of the creature it is going to devour.

                                                        The victim might struggle
                                                        hard and get away.         Then
                                                        the star-fish would go     with
                                                        out its food.      But a won

                                                        provided to meet the case.
                                                              I    told  you    of   the

                                                        has hundreds      of them.
                          RED STAR-FISH.

                                                              From the under sur
face  of the rays, they spring up in myriads.       Each sucker lays hold of the
prey ; so that, in spite of all its efforts, it cannot escape.
     It is dragged to the greedy open mouth, and devoured.
     Thus the star-fish, that looks so helpless, is one of the most                cruel
tyrants of the ocean.
     I  must tell you more about these suckers, for the history of them is as
curious as can be.
     Each ray is made up of stony pieces joined together.               On the under
side of the ray, there are minute holes left between the pieces.                  These
holes are arranged in rows, and are outlets for the suckers.              The suckers
can be pushed forth together, or separately, at the will of their owner.

                          THE SUCKERS OF THE STAR-FISH.                           Hi7
     If you were to put a star-fish into a vessel of sea-water            you could
watch the whole process.
     At  first,  it would lie huddled up      as  if it were dead.   Its rays would
shrink up, and be drawn into its body.           But, by degrees, it would recover
itself.  The rays would begin to expand.            Hundreds of tiny suckers would
push through       the  holes.   They would lay hold of the side of the vessel
and help the star-fish to pull itself up.
     Thus you see what a wonderful machinery is found in the body of one
of the humblest and simplest of Nature's works.
                    THE SUCKERS OF THE STAR-FISH.
I should     like you to know how the suckers of the star-fish are pushed up
and down through the holes.
     Each sucker is mounted on a hollow tube, and just below the tube is a
round bag, full of liquor.
     When the star-fish wants to use its suckers, it squeezes the liquor up
into the tubes.        The tubes    swell, and push the suckers out through      the
holes.   They are then ready to lay hold of its prey.
     But when the star-fish has finished its meal, and does not want its
suckers any longer, it draws the liquor back into the bag.
     Then the tubes become empty, and shrink, and disappear through the
holes.
     You may think how terrible a creature must              be,  armed   in such   a
manner.
     Even the oyster is not secure from the danger of an attack.            The star
fish will contrive to force an opening into the shell, and eat the oyster.
     It is thought to drop a liquid into the shell, and so stupify the
victim.
     One day a naturalist, who was studying the habits of the star-fishes,
saw a number of them           on the  shore rolled into a ball, and   their rays all
entangled together.

                               DIFFEP.ENT  KINDS OF STAR-FISH ES.
     In the middle of the ball was an unlucky oyster.
     The star-fish had contrived to introduce between the valves of the shell
.a round bag, filled with fluid.
     Five of such bags were arranged round the neck of each star-fish.
Some were as large as nuts, and some were smaller.
     The bags were mounted on little stems, and at the top was a round
hole, through which the      liquid dropped into the shell.
     When   the    star-fish   was      touched,    the    bags   shrank up and became
invisible.

                                        THE SEA-URCHIN.                                     169
     There were several of these               balls  of star-fish, each of them huddled
round a shell in this            manner.        Sometimes the poor oyster was nearly
devoured.         But even     if it   seemed scarcely touched,         it  had lost the power
of closing its shell, and was either stupified or dead.
      The naturalist felt certain that the liquid had the power of stunning
the oyster, and perhaps          killing  it.
                                     THE SEA-URCHIN.
He is often called hedgehog, because of his prickles, or rather his long
spines.
      He is not at all like the star-fish          ; but he belongs to the same class.
      His shell     is the most
wonderful part of him.
      It     is    not    always
covered      with spines.       In
the     picture     one shell is
 quite     smooth,      and   has
 only little knobs,        or tu
 bercles, all over it.
       Have      you    ever   ex
 amined        this    wonderful
 shell  ?
       It   is    made    up     of
 several hundred pieces,         of
 different sizes, closely      fit
 ted to each other.
                                                               SEA-URCHINS.
       The     joinings are so
 close and compact,        it is scarcely     possible  to see where they are.
       The shell is filled with sea-water.             And the internal parts, in fact the
 body of the animal, is suspended in it.
       At the top of the shell is a hole, which is the mouth.

170                                  THE SEA-URCHIN*.
      But, as the animal keeps growing bigger and bigger, what is to be done
with the shell     ?   How are all the parts to be kept together ?
      I will tell you. A thin membrane, or skin, goes over the whole shell.
It  dips down between the edges of the different pieces of the shell.               This
membrane       keeps depositing    earthy matter round the edge of every piece;
so that,     without altering its shape, the piece keeps getting larger, until it
has attained its full size.
      We cannot imagine a more simple or beautiful contrivance.
      In  the picture, there is a sea-urchin covered     with long spines.
      His spines are of use to him, when he wants to bury himself in the
sand.       He has suckers, too, like those of the star-fish, and he moves
about by means of them both.
      I  must say a few words about the spines.
      Each spine is placed on a separate tubercle or knob.
      It  fits into the knob by a kind of ball and socket joint, that enables
it  to move about      with  ease.
      It was rather a puzzling        question how the spines     grew    ;  but, as we
know, the whole race have, like the polyps, the power of secreting stony
matter.
      One of the spines was taken from the animal, and examined while                  it
was quite fresh.        It  was found to be the work of the same thin skin, or
membrane,        that had enlarged the pieces of the shell.     This membrane had,
therefore,    secreted matter for the spines and shell too.      A   piece  of the spine
was cut across and polished        :  then, by means of the microscope, the whole
process     was seen at once.        Layer upon layer had been laid on, with the
greatest exactness,     until the whole spine was completed.

      The pieces of shell round his mouth are not so firmly fixed as the rest           ;
for his mouth is always ready for prey, and            if the  prey is large, he can
stretch his mouth to receive it.
      The mouth itself is a simple opening        ; but it can boast of five sharp
strong teeth.
      These    teeth can crush up the hardest    shell with ease   ;  in fact, scarcely

any substance   can resist them.      But sharp and strong as they    are, their
points would get dull in time    ;  for they are always at work, crushing and
breaking.    As  if to provide against this danger,    they keep   on growing.
Thus they are preserved sharp and fit for use.
                              SEA-URCHINB IN THE ROOK.
    The jaws of the animal are very curious indeed.
    There are five jaws  ; for each tooth has a jaw to itself.   The five jaws
are  united  by muscles,   and form a kind of pyramid,      the  top  of which
reaches to the opening  of the mouth.

 172                               THE SEA-CUCUMBER.
      The pyramid    is called the        Lantern   of Aristotle,   because    the   ancient
 philosopher compared it to a lantern.
      The sea-urchins are found everywhere.
      Some   of them bury themselves           in a hole or cleft in the rock, just
large   enough   to contain a single animal.             The   animal fastens      itself to
the   hole  by its suckers, and holds so fast that it can scarcely be forced
away.
     In  some parts   of Ireland, numbers of these creatures              may be seen in
holes in the rock.     The holes,      I   must tell you, are made by themselves          —
in what manner is not known.
     In  some places, the sea-urchin is used for food.            On our own shores, it
is often eaten by those who are          in want of a better meal.        In  the Mediter
ranean    Sea, where  it is larger and better flavoured, it forms an article of
food  ; and the fisherman's board is seldom seen without it.

Theke is     a long,  soft-bodied creature,       a  little like a worm, and which
contracts and dilates its body as the worm does.               It  has a common name,
                                                                 by which     it is known

This second covering is made up of fibres, crossing and recrossing in every
direction.

                                    THE SEA-CUCUMBER.                                      173
     The fibres are imbedded in a gristly substance, which makes the covering
very elastic.      It can spread out or shrink up, just as its owner likes.
     There are also muscular bands           running   all over the body, both cross-
ways and lengthways.             These help the sea-cucumber           to move in every
direction.
     But though the creature has no shell, and no arms or feet, it has
suckers like those of its neighbour the star-fish.             These suckers act in the
same way, so there is no need to describe them again.
     In   some species, the suckers
are found over the       whole body,
and    push themselves       through a
myriad of holes.
     In other      species,   they   are
found only in the middle of the
under part of the body, and then the
creature crawls along like a snail.
     Besides the suckers, the crea
ture will sometimes        have hooks
or spines, which      can   be   pushed
in and out, and still further help
it along.
     It   has   a  mouth about the
width of a quill, and placed in
the middle of a ring in the upper
end   of the body.                                    SEA-CUCUMBERS  WITH SNNn.
     Round the mouth are a number of feelers, which look a little like feathers.
     These    feelers  can    change   their   shapes  in the most curious manner.
Sometimes they will stretch themselves out, and look like worms.                      Then a
feeler  will contract itself in the middle,      so as  to look like an hour-glass       ;  or
it will fill itself with   sea-water,   and swell out into a     little balloon.
     There is one sea-cucumber           which is very large indeed.          It   is a foot
long, imd can stretch       itself out two feet longer.
     When it is alarmed, it acts like its relation, the brittle            star-fish.    But

it  has no arms or legs, so         it cannot throw them       off.   Instead of this, it
ejects its stomach       through its mouth.     When it has performed          this feat, it
still continues to live.
     We can never be surprised at anything which takes place among the
creatures of the ocean.
      I shall tell you a little story of a sea-cucumber.
      It was kept in a vessel of sea-water,          and lived there safe and sound.
But one day its owner forgot to change the water                ;  and,   what was more,
the   poor creature       was left, not one day, but three, and no one attended
to it.
      It  became      very    uncomfortable,   and  began    to throw      off its feelers.
Next it ejected its internal parts, one after the other.                Each part fell to
the bottom of the vessel.
      The efforts     it  made were violent.     But still the creature lived         ; and
the    empty skin, in which        nothing   was left,   was so irritable      that at the
least touch   it twisted itself into all kinds of      shapes.
      The most curious part of the story has to be told.             Some one had       pity
on the poor creature,        and gave it a fresh supply of sea-water in its vessel.
Then the parts actually began to grow again in the empty body.
      At  the  end     of a few months the sea-cucumber           was as strong and as
lively as ever    !
                         FISHING      FOR SEA-CUCUMBERS.
I have    not done with the curious habits of the sea-cucurnbers.               The history
of the ocean world is a succession of wonders.
      A sea-cucumber remains, for a time, still and stationary.               Each end of
its body begins to swell and to flatten itself out.            At the same time the
middle part gets thinner and thinner, till it is like a thread.
      What does all this mean ?
      It  means     that the body of the animal will shortly break into two
parts.    There will be two sea-cucumbers           instead of one      ;  for, by-and-by,
each part    will become a complete animal, and the image of the other.

     The Chinese eat many things          which we would     not touch  ;  and  they
have a great fancy for the sea-cucumber.
     This kind of sea-cucumber is called trepang,         and   it is found in    the
seas  of New Holland, and in other places.
     Hundreds of little vessels, called proas, are fitted out at the right season
for the trepang fishing.
                                  FISHING FOR TREPANO.
     The fishermen come from Malacca.           They are very expert at their trade,
and dive down to fetch up the trepang.
     The trepang crawls at the bottom of the sea, and is very much               the
colour of the ground it crawls upon.
     But the Malay fisherman spies it out in a minute.          It is easily caught,
because   it crawls so  slowly.
     The people of an island near New Guinea fish for trepang, and prepare
it for the market. Then they sell it to the Chinese, who come in their
junks to trade for   it

                                   THE CUTTLE-FISH.
The molluscs, or soft-bodied animals, compose a very large class indeed.
Creatures of different shapes and sizes belong to it.
      I shall introduce you first to the fiercest, and the ugliest, and the most
dreaded   of the whole tribe.
      I mean the cuttle-fish.
      Can you imagine any creature more frightful ?
     The name of the order to which he belongs is called Cephalopoda.             The
word is taken from two Greek words meaning "head," and "feet."
      And, as you perceive, his feet grow out of his head.
     You can call them arms, if you like.          He can not only creep on them
at the bottom of the sea, but he can seize his prey with them.

       Fancy being grasped by arms such as these      !
       Yet it  has happened even to men.      Persons bathing in the sea have felt
their legs entangled    in the embrace of a cuttle-fish  !
       For, in some parts of the world, the cuttle-fish grow to a monstrous
size,   and are very terrible to behold.

       I want you to notice the deadly apparatus in the arms of the cuttle
 fish.
       There are rows of suckers down each arm, as you may see in the picture.
 These      do not  suck the blood of the victim, as is sometimes stated.     No   ;

they are so many wonderful machines to enable the arms to cling closer to
the prey : so close indeed do they cling, that no power can force them away.
     Each sucker is a kind of cup, composed of a muscular membrane, and
with a thick fleshy rim.         The creature has the power of exhausting the air
within the cup.
     When the arms have         seized   upon an object, the rims of all the numer
ous cups   at once adhere or stick to its surface.
     The cuttle-fish will rather have his arms chopped off than quit his hold.
                ONE EIND OF CUTTLE-FISH. WITH TWO ARMS NOER T1IVN THE REST.
     In  some   kinds    of cuttle-fish there are two arms longer than the rest.
From the middle of each sucker there is a sharp strong hook, which can be
plunged into the slippery surface of the prey and help to secure it.
     The prey, thus seized, is hurried          to the mouth.      If it has a shell, the
shell is soon crushed by a hard, horny beak, like that of a parrot, and with
which it comes in contact

                                  THE BONE OF THE CUTTLE-FISH.                                    179
    I    said like that of a parrot, but there is a little difference.                     The upper
part of the beak is the shortest instead of the longest, and there is no bony
socket to the jaw, as in the parrot.                    Instead of this, the inside of the jaw is
filled with gristle, which             makes it very strong indeed.                 The jaws are also
literally imbedded in muscle, and open and shut with the utmost force.
Thus a victim, once dragged to this terrible mouth, is very soon devoured.
    The tongue of the cuttle-fish has the power of tasting its food, and it is
also useful  in helping to swallow it. A number of sharp horny hooks are
placed on one part of the tongue.   These hooks bend backwards, and so when
the cuttle-fish swallows, they help to drag the pieces of food down its throat.
    The creature has two eyes, of a remarkably unpleasant expression.
    In one species the eyes are placed on little stems or stalks made of
muscle. They can thus move about, and see all ways at once.
    What a frightful monster must the cuttle-fish appear to its neighbours
in the ocean       !
                          THE BONE OF THE CUTTLE-FISH.
The cuttle-fish stands at the head of its tribe.  In its body we find some
pieces of gristly substance, which a little remind us of the skeleton of an
animal.
    Still   the cuttle-fish cannot be admitted into the rank                       of the vertebrated
animals — that           is,   animals with a bony skeleton.
    Like     the       polyps and the star-fishes,          it   secretes   a   hard substance within
its body.   But these secreted pieces are quite different from the bones of
animals.   They have no connection with the body, and do not possess, in
themselves, the means of growing, as our bones do.
    They are mere dead shells or pieces of stony substance, formed layer by
layer, and laid on from without.
    The bone of the cuttle-fish                 is,   in some species, very much the shape of      a
spear, and    is       lodged    in the back.
    People call         it     "cuttle-bone."
    It    looks large and heavy, and as                  if it   would hardly allow the creature

180                         THE BONE OF THE CUTTLE-FISH.
to swim freely about       ;   but in reality it is as light as possible.         It   is made
of a number of very thin plates, as thin and fine          as can be.      These are placed
at a little    distance one from the other, and are kept apart by millions of
tiny pillars.
     Thus, instead of being heavy, the bone is so light that it can float with
ease — indeed, it is    a help rather than a hindrance to its owner.
     One   of these bones is very beautiful indeed.             It  is the shape of a pen,
and looks like mother-of-pearl.
     The bone of the cuttle-fish is pounded and used for tooth powder.
                                                              The cuttle-fish is formed

vessel.

                         FISHING FOR THE CUTTLE-FISH.                           181
                   FISHING       FOR THE CUTTLE-FISH.
The   sea is  full of cuttle-fishes, as it is of star-fishes.    They are found
everywhere.
    There is one hideous creature called the poulpe or polypus.
    It  leads a solitary life on some    rocky coast. It lies in a hole or cleft of
the rock, its arms stretched out ready to seize a victim.
                                      THE POULPE.
    But, as a rule, the cuttle-fish likes society.    Except the poulpe, all the
other tribes wander in flocks or troops.
    They are so greedy, that they make havoc among the smaller inhabit
ants of the sea.      When they are near the shore they eat up all the fish
they can find, so that there are none left for the fishermen to catch.        And
they are cruel as well as greedy    :  like the tiger on land, they will kill for
the mere sake   of killing.

182                           FISHING FOR THE CUTTLE-FISH.
        A cuttle-fish was once left in a pool of water, by the tide.
        A number of little fishes were in the same pool.
        For the mere pleasure of destroying, it killed them all, though it did
not eat one of them.
     But the cuttle-fish, in spite of its weapons and its savage nature, falls
itself a victim to numbers of enemies.
        These enemies thin its ranks, and prevent it from getting too numerous.
        The larger kinds of fishes, and the sea-birds            as   they skim the waves,
are among its foes.
        Man destroys myriads of cuttle-fishes.
        In   some     parts of the world   he uses their flesh for food — indeed,       the
poorer classes feed much         upon them.     On the shores of the Mediterranean
Sea there are ridges of cuttle-bones some miles in length. They have been
left there by the tide.   This shows how plentiful the supply of cuttle-fish
must be      !
        The fishermen go out to hunt for cuttle-fish, to see how many they can
find.
   The men paddle about, looking into the shallow pools and clefts of rock,
where they think the creature is lying.
     They are almost sure to find it in some snug spot, its frightful arms
stretched out ana" waiting for some poor fish or crab to come that way.
Before it has time to move, much less to get out of the way, a sharp spear
has gone through its body and killed it.
        The people who live in the South Sea Islands use the cuttle-fish for food.
        They have a very ingenious way of taking it.
        They have a piece of polished board about a foot long.                 At the   end
they fasten              of shells one over the other, so as to look like one
                  a number
great round shell, the size of an egg.
    The fisherman goes out to sea in his boat, and takes the piece of board
with him.    He fastens a long line to           it,
                                            and lets     down deep into the
                                                                  it
water.
        When     it   has nearly reached the bottom,   it   is   sure   to come in contact
with a cuttle-fish.

      The cuttle-fish sees the shell, and thinks there is a nice soft mollusc in
side.    It grasps    the bait  with its great arms, and its suckers come into
play.
      When   the   fisherman   is sure that the cuttle-fish has hold, he begins to
draw up his line.       The creature will do anything rather than quit its hold,
and the line keeps going up and up,          till it     is dragged  out of the sea and
into the boat.      Then the cuttle-fish, in spite of its arms, falls an easy prey.
            SEPIA,      OR THE        INK OF THE CUTTLE-FISH.
As the cuttle-fish has so many enemies, Nature                 has given  it a means   of
defence besides its suckers and its long arms.
      There is a bag in its body full of a black fluid like ink.             If the crea

 184                    SEPIA, OR THE INK OF THE CUTTLE-FISH.
 ture is alarmed, it throws out a quantity of this ink, and makes the water
 so  black that no one can see where it is.          Under cover of the black cloud it
escapes.
      This ink is called sepia.          It is very useful to artists in painting their
pictures    ;   and when dried, it can be kept          any  length of time without
spoiling.
      The ink-bag taken from a fossil cuttle-fish had ink in it just as good as
if it  had been fresh.
      Cuttle-fishes multiply themselves         in a wonderful manner, so there is no
fear   of the race being destroyed.
      The eggs are in a great bunch, something like grapes, and are fastened
to the stem of a sea-weed.
      But     if  the cuttle-fish  lives a long way from the shore, its bunches of
eggs are       not fastened    to anything.      They float on the surface of the sea.
The warmth of the sun hatches them.                 Then out come the little cuttle
fishes, and begin at once to wander about in troops,             and to lead a life of
plunder.
      I have not much more to tell you about the cuttle-fish.
      In  some parts     of the world it grows to an enormous size.
      Happily, we have no such monsters near our shores.
      A captain of a ship once saw a huge creature rolling about in the sea.
It had arms like snakes ; each arm was seven feet long. What a frightful
creature it must have been         !
      All  kinds of stories were told about these huge cuttle-fishes.
      They were said to lay hold of vessels with their arms and try to drag
them under water.           But, as it often happens, half these wild stories are
mere exaggerations.
      The wildest story was of the Norwegian Krakin, as it was called.
      The back of this monster was said to be as big as an island, and so
covered    with tangled sea- weed that it was often taken for land.
      Every now and then the krakin was said to come up to the surface
for a little sun and air.
      Then,     if a vessel  chanced    to be near, the sailors were sure to    think it

                                                     it,          would even be so unlucky as to
light   a   fire.     But the krakin did not quite approve of such                        a   liberty.    When
the hot coals began to burn its back,                      it   would        descend to the depths from
which    it   came.          Then the poor sailors would                    have the ground taken from
under them, and be thrown into the water.
    These stories            of the krakins are, of course, mere fables                       ;   like those of
the sea-serpent,            they have never been fairly proved.
    No doubt they took their rise from the sight of some monstrous cuttle
fish which really did exist.
                                     THE ARGONAUT.
We have seen how frightful the cuttle-fish                            is.     And we can hardly expect
to find anything either elegant or beautiful in his whole family.
    But we are mistaken.
    One of this family lives in the most beautiful dwelling that was ever
formed by the hand of Nature.     A dwelling that has been the wonder of
mankind in all ages.
  I   mean the shell of the paper nautilus, or argonaut.
    Only one of the tribe of Cephalopoda     possessed of an outward shell
                                                                 is                                            ;
and, certainly,        it    makes up for the ugliness of its race.
    That       is,   as far as the shell        is   concerned.
    The creature itself            is   a mere cuttle-fish         like the rest, with long arms.
    It   sits quite loosely in its shell, and                    is  only joined to     by a pair of
                                                                                            it
muscles.
    It   had the name of argonaut given to it.                              For   it   was once thought       to
be a first-rate sailor         ;   and,   if   you remember, the Argonauts were                     a    band of
heroes, who went    in search of the Golden Fleece.
     It was even fancied that the first idea of ship was taken from the      a
shell of the nautilus as     glided over the sea, using its arms for sails.
                                    it
    A great          deal    of poetry, and of prose too, was written on the subject.
    But      it     has all turned out to be           a   mere romance.

1SS                                               THE ARGONAUT.
       The argonaut is not often seen to sail.                  It   creeps at the bottom     of the
sea,   using its arms as feet.
       If it     swims,     it is by forcing the water through its air-tube, as the cuttle
fish does-          It    is,now and then, found on the surface of the waves but the      ;

moment         it   is   alarmed,   it   hides   itself in the shell, drawing in the whole of
its body.           Then the shell loses its balance,           turns over,     and     sinks to the
bottom.
       It   is   therefore no easy matter to catch sight of the paper nautilus, much
more to get possession              of it.

                                     THE ARGONAUT.                                                189
      The two arms of the creature, which were thought to be used as sails,
end each   in a broad membrane.
      The broad membranes       do indeed       look a little like sails, but they are
never used for any such purpose.
      The creature often keeps them folded over its shell, as                 if   to protect it.
      Then the shell is quite hidden from sight.
      But what is the use of these two sail-shaped arms ?
      The arms, or vela, as they are called, of the argonaut              !        I   will tell you.
      The use of them has been found out by careful study.
      They are the organs by which the beautiful shell is made, and by which
it is kept in   repair.
       You remember the membrane which covered the shell of the sea-urchin.
I   told you how it kept depositing earthy matter round the pieces of which
the shell was made, and so gradually enlarging them.
      The vela of the      argonaut have just        the       same    faculty.           They    can
deposit earthy matter wherever it is wanted.               I   will tell you how this was
found out.
      A lady devoted herself to the study of the argonaut.
      She was determined to begin at the beginning, and she reared                               some
little argonauts from the time they came out of the               egg.        As they grew up,
she watched them very     narrowly indeed.
      She saw the process of depositing the shell, and its gradual growth.
      When the shell was fully formed, she made an experiment.
      She broke a shell, and then left    it,   to see what would happen.
      The next day, she went to look.           She found a           thin cobweb-like sub
stance spread over the edges      of the broken pieces.          This cobweb-like matter
slightly joined the edges together.         The next day she looked again.                       The
substance had thickened, and the edges were much firmer.         Day after day,
the repair went on.       The substance grew harder and thicker, until at length
the edges were firmly joined and the shell mended.
    The lady had watched the whole proceeding, and she declared that the
argonaut applied its vela to the outside of the shell. And she felt certain
that the glutinous substance which mended the shell came from the vela.

                            THE PEARLY NAUTILUS.
There is      a relation of the argonaut that makes a shell with chambers in it.
     This is a shell which no doubt you have seen many times, for it may
be met with in every collection of shells.

taken with the animal in it.
        It   was floating on the sea, and looked like a dead tortoise-shell cat.
   The captain of the ship sent off a boat for the purpose of finding                                   out
what the object really was.
        But the creature                  began   to sink so fast, that it was with the utmost
difficulty it could be caught.
        Indeed, the shell was broken by the boat-hook striking it so quickly.
        For      no         time     had    to    be    lost.   In    a minute      more,   it would   have
escaped.
        The      mollusc that lived                in     the   shell was thus,        for once, found at
home.
        It   was firmly fixed to each side of its shell,                       and had a mantle of a

        The      shell of the
pearly nautilus                is as
curious as it is beau

        It    has       a    number
of chambers in                it,   one
after the other.

wonderful membrane of its went on secreting shelly matter, until it had
formed another.
     When    all the chambers     were finished, and as it were shut up, the
nautilus had attained to its full size.     Then it lived in the last cell of all,
having crept to it through the rest.
     A  fleshy tube unites all these chambers      together,   from one end of the
shell to the other.      This tube ends in the body of the animal, and increases
with its growth.
     Ages and ages ago, when the lily stars were in their beauty, a kind of
nautilus that is now extinct lived in the sea.
     The remains of the shells are found in a fossil state, and are called
ammonites.
                   THE WINGED INSECTS OF THE SEA
You    have   seen  the moths come out, on a summer's         evening,  when it is
getting dusk.      They have lain hidden all day     ;  but no sooner is the sun
down,   than countless numbers issue forth to look for prey.
     They are called night-flying insects.
     There are some little creatures      in the sea, that are very much like
insects, and have the same habits as the moths.
     They have been called the winged insects of the sea.
     And another name has been given to them.              They are called wing-
footers, because they whirl about, as if they had wings.
     These   wings are two fin-like flaps, which      proceed    from the foremost
part of the body.
     In reality   the flaps  are only  one organ.    A   bundle of muscular fibre
passes through the neck, and spreads out at each side       like a paddle.
     These  little creatures have no foot to creep on, or arms to seize their
prey.     But they have a distinct head, as the cuttle-fish has. Sometimes
the head is hidden in a thin transparent shell.     When the animal is alarmed,
it draws its   wings, and, indeed, its whole body, into the shell.
     But though the wing-footer seems to sport about, and           be so  innocent

                                                     THE SEA-SNAIL,.                                         193
and harmless,           it   is furnished            with an array of weapons that can scarcely               be
surpassed.
      Let us take one of the tribe — the little clio, on which the whale feeds—
and look at it through a microscope.
    What are those six feelers that project from its head ? And why are
they of that red and speckled hue ?
    Look more closely, and you will see that a number of tiny points are
dotted all over them.  There may be thousands of these points.
    Each point or speck is a sucker, like that of the star-fish. And it can
be pushed         out, and can seize hold                 of its prey in the same manner.
    When the little clio does not want its weapons, it draws them in, and
they lie hidden and protected by a kind of sheath that covers them.
      Look a little further, and you will                           see a   mouth furnished with sharp
horny teeth, that have a metallic lustre, and shine in the sun.
      The tongue has hooked spines on                         it,   that curve backwards, like those
of the cuttle-fish, and help to drag the food down into the stomach.
     Could you have imagined that the merry little clio was so terribly
armed         ?
      When twilight comes, hosts of these little creatures whirl about in search
of prey. They dance merrily on the waves, sinking and rising, and seeming
to be full of gambols.
      The sea      is   alive with them.                 But their gambols do not last long.
       Before the morning dawns, they have disappeared, and no trace of them
is   to be seen.

the cuttle-fish does.             It             a   degree below the cuttle-fish      in rank.     In   fact,
it   is   a   humble snail, and nothing more.
      It      belongs to     a   class named            Gasteropoda.        This means "stomach," and
" foot."

     The sea-snail     has a head,      with two bright black eyes.              Sometimes it

elastic skin, which is wrapped round the body of the                  mollusc like a hood.
It  does not grow to the shell, when the mollusc has a shell, but is only
attached   to  it by    one small part.          You will   see,  by-and-by, what a very
important organ the mantle is.             For it can make and mend the shell, just
as the vela   of the argonaut did.
     The snails without shells are not to be despised.                 They are among the
most beautiful creatures in the oceau.              Their bodies are as clear as crystal,
and have tints of red, or blue, or yellow.
     The snails are divided         into groups, according to the different arrange
ment    of their    gills,   or breathing        apparatus.     Sometimes the         gills   are
hidden under the mantle.             Sometimes they are arranged in elegant                 tufts
or feathers, and are without any covering at all.
     There are some great snails, that have strong stone shells.                           These

creatures have also a          lid to their house, that shuts quite    close, and seems  to
defy all enemies.          But, alas   ! the poor sea-snail   is not always safe even in
its stone house.
      Some      bird     spies    it
out.       It   swoops      down
and     carries      the     stone
shell    up    into     the     air.
Then it lets it drop against
a   rock,     and     the     poor
snail's house is broken to
pieces   !
     I  have not room to tell
you the names of half the
beautiful shells which are
found in the sea.            Some
are so rare, that they are
only to be bought with
gold.      Yet   these rare and                      OASTEROPOM WITH SHELLS.
beautiful shells are but dwellings for the molluscs to live in.
      Nature      is very prodigal       of colour.   The flowers are of all tints and
hues.      The birds are dressed in the gayest apparel.              And in the deep  sea
far from the reach of man, countless             shades   of colour adorn the creatures
that play in the waters.
     No objects        are more      beautiful than the shelly homes of the molluscs.
Here and there, one or other is obtained as an ornament to our drawing-
rooms.       But myriads on myriads throng the deep places of the ocean, or
float on the high seas, each one of which would be a treasure.
      How are these lovely tints laid on ?
      I shall tell the whole history of the process in the next chapter.

196                               HOW THE SHELL IS MADE.
                           HOW THE SHELL                      IS MADE.
The mollusc comes into the world with two skins over its soft body.
   The upper skin is loose and elastic, and     as you know, a kind of
                                                                is,

      The mantle    is   the storehouse         from which comes the material that makes
the shell.

                                             HOW THE SHELL IS MADE.                                        197
        What kind of material is it                     ?
        Itis a mixture of lime and glue, and a sticky substance called albumen.
        You have seen albumen many times.
        It   is,      in fact, like white of            egg.
        These materials are drawn                       into the body of the mollusc from the food
it   lives on.              They pass into the mantle in                   a     fluid state, and become   the
material of which the shell                       is   made.
        The shelly fluid, which                   is   very sticky,       is    exuded from the mantle.
        Sometimes

at other times, only
from the edge.
    The edge, in this
case,   is   thickened, and
is   called       a    collar.
        If        a        shell       is
formed of one piece
only,        as       myriads          of
shells are,           it   is   called
univalve.              When the
shell   is   formed of two
pieces,      it       is    called     a
bivalve.
        If    you          were        to
examine the collar of
the mantle, you would
see   streaks or lines of

colouring matter which                      is   to paint the shell.
        As the mantle lays on layer after layer of cement and fibre, the colours
grow as well.                      A   person who      is   watching      the shell can guess which colour
is   coming next, so clearly are the red and blue and purple stripes seen.

198                                         THE TYBIAN PURPLE.
      Some shells have long spines on them.                        I   dare say you have seen many
such.
     How are the spines made ?
     The mollusc will, now and then, push a part of its mantle quite out, and
fold it into a little tube.
      It will        do this to draw water into its mouth.
      The shelly liquid keeps coming out of the mantle all the time, and it
tills up the end of the tube and makes it hard.  Then the tube is left like
a spine sticking              out of the shell.       If   this happens          often,   you may easily
fancy that the shell will get all over spines.
      Shells are of all sizes.                  From the smallest shell, which cannot be seen
without a microscope, to the giant in the picture.
    This monster shell               is,   as   you see, used as       a   bath, by the people      of the
Indian Islands.
      It                      that shell-fanciers would give any price for it.

      It           also used in the Catholic churches              to contain the         holy water.
      Some          of these shells were presented            to Francis         I.   by the Republic of
Venice,       and used for that purpose              in the Church of St. Sulpice in Paris.
                                       THE TYRIAN PURPLE.
All       manner of beautiful and useful things have been fetched from the bosom
of the ocean.
      A    famous dye was brought from the same mighty storehouse.
     I     mean the       Tyrian purple.
      For many            years, as far back as the days                   of King Solomon, the mon-
archs   of the earth had their robes dyed in the Tyrian purple.
      The Roman Emperors, in later times, forbade any one under the rank
of    a   prince to wear the purple.                    If   he did        so,   he was punished        with
death.
      Where did this famous dye come from                      ?
      From the shell of            a   mollusc.

     The mantle of this little creature was the storehouse of the royal purple        !
     The exact manner in which the dye was prepared,                  is not known in
these days.       The Tyrian purple is a thing of the past.
     For    modern   skill has found out so many beautiful dyes, that nothing
can surpass them.
     When Tyre was in its glory, its chief manufacture was the dyeing of
stuffs and robes intended for the temple or the court.
     The dress of the Jewish high-priest was commanded to be purple.
     Very little is known about the preparation of the dye.
     A    Roman writer tells us, that the finest colour was obtained from the
largest shells.      And that the smaller ones were ground in mills.
     The dyeing liquor was boiled for some days, to clear it from impurity.
Then a piece of cloth was dipped in, to see if the colour was good.               But
often the     liquor had to be boiled over again.
     I  can tell you a story about a purple dye.
     A   fisherman,   named    Alonzo, had often to wait a long time in his boat,
while he watched his nets.
      He used to amuse himself with marking pieces of linen with letters and
designs.
      A ring    served him as
a stamp      to mark with.
      The marks were of a
rich purple colour.        His
master      happened    to  see
them, and wanted to know
 how they were done.
     Alonzo offered to show
 him.     He dipped his ring

 shell-fish.     The mantle of the creature had been torn, and the slimy matter
 was oozing from it.
      He made marks and lines upon the linen with the seal of his ring.
 But at first nothing was to      be seen.

        Wait a  minute," said     the fisherman,                                        upon
them."
     His master waited patiently, and soon he perceived a very disagreeable
smell.    At the same time, the marks became visible. They changed into
a  bright violet colour.
     There is a group of molluscs which are called "purpura," because they
yield a purple dye.
                                   THE MUSSEL.
When a mollusc has two shells, connected           by a hinge, you remember,             it is
called a bivalve.
     You can think of many bivalves in a moment,             I  dare say.

     The shell is the bivalve's little world.       There,  it  has a safe retreat.         It
can   pull the elastic hinge that fastens the two valves together, and shut
itself up quite close and tight.
     If it wants to open its shell, it leaves    go, as it were,    of the hinge.      Then

                                       THE MUSSEL.                                                  201
the shell uncloses.           When the shell stands wide open, and is not shut at
all,   it    is a sure sign that the poor   little mollusc is dead.
    What kind of habits have these creatures, so shut up from the outer
world ? They have neither head nor arms.      They cannot hunt for prey,
and unless the prey came to them,      in many cases they would perish.
        The mussel has a very ingenious way of fixing itself to the rock.
        It does so by threads of its own making. You may see them in the
picture.
        The foot of the mussel is of no use to it in moving about                         But it is a
complete        machine for helping it to fix its threads.                The threads are of a
horny substance, and about as long as the foot itself.
        Under the foot is a deep groove, in which the horny threads are formed.
The substance which forms them comes from a gland in the foot.
        The mussel fixes the end of the thread to the rock by its foot.                        When
it     has done    this,   it draws its foot away, and          the thread is drawn           out as
long as the creature chooses.
        It   always tries the thread to see    if it   is strong enough to hold.               If one
thread is firm, it proceeds to make another.                And      so   it   goes on,   till it   has
fixed as many as a hundred and fifty threads.
        Then its anchor, or byssus, as it is called, will be finished, and it can
be     held fast to the rock, out of reach of the tempest.
        I            little story about the mussel and its threads.
             can tell you a
    The people who lived in a town where there was a bridge, with many
arches, had a great deal of trouble with it.
        The tide rushed so strongly against        it,   that   it   was always being thrown
down.
        The people grew tired of mending the bridge, and they sent for the
mussels to help them.
        Boat-loads     of mussels    were   fetched,     and     thrown        down   against the
bridge.
    This was the best thing that could be done.
    The industrious little creatures set to work, and began to fasten their
threads to the stone-work of the bridge.        There were so many of the

202                                THE RAZOR-SHELL.
 muasela,     and they stuck so fast, that the bridge gained a support.        It was
able to resist the tide, and has never been washed away since.
       There is a relation of the mussel which spins a thread as soft and deli
cate as silk.       This creature is called the pinna.
       The byssus of the pinna has even been spun into gloves and other
 little articles of clothing.
                           THE RAZOR-SHELL.
Have you never seen an empty shell, a little the shape of          a razor,  lying on
the beach      ?
       It  is called the razor-shell.
       The creature that lives in it is called the solen.
       It  has a foot,  like the mussel, but it does not use it in the same way.
It   lives in the sand, and it does not want to spin threads.
       It   has one great enemy, and when he comes         in sight the quicker it
buries itself in the sand the better.       This enemy is the fisherman.
       Many persons think it good to eat. So the fisherman goes out to catch
it.     He treads very softly, but the moment the solen hears him coming it
begins to dig with its great foot in the sand.         It digs with such swiftness
and energy,       that long before he reaches the spot it is nowhere to be seen.
       But the fisherman is not taken by surprise.          He knows what to do.
He holds in his hand an iron rod with a barbed point.            He soon finds the
hole into which the solen has gone.
       For the creature, in its fright and hurry, has thrown a jet of water out
of its body. And this tiny jet betrays its hiding-place.
       The fisherman plunges his rod down into the sand, and is almost sure
to strike the poor solen and drag it out.
       If  he misses    his mark, he never tries a second time.       He knows the
solen     will have pushed down    to a depth beyond the power   of his rod to reach.
       There is another way of catching the solen.
       The fisherman puts some salt on its hole.         The salt penetrates to the
solen    ;  it comes up to   see what is the matter, and is caught.

                                      THE COCKLE.                                   203
                                    THE COCKLE.
 There      is another active   little creature, that can hop and jump about in
a wonderful manner.
      I   mean the cockle.
      It   has a great foot, that looks more     like a tongue than a foot.      And it
is strong as well as large,      fe^^^^g.
      The cockle, when it        I
means to jump, plants the
tip of its foot against the
ground.        The muscles of
the     foot give     a  sudden
spring, and the creature is
thrown into the air.
      It  alights at some dis
tance, and then gives an
other skip.
      So that   it can get over
the ground as        quickly as
if it   were flying.
      I  have   not yet done
with the curious habits                                  uuu*tm
of the bivalves.        You see some of them can spin, and some can dig.
      But here is a mollusc that can bore through stone.
      It  is called the pholas.
      The shell is so thin that there is no protection in it.             So the pholas
digs itself a kind of grave, and buries itself there all its life.
      The cell is not much larger than its body, so it can move only a very
little.     It does not bore   with its foot.   It  uses it as  a sucker,   by which it
fixes itself to the walls of its dwelling.
      The pholas uses the sharp edges of its shell to make its cell.             And it
drops a juice which has the power of dissolving the stone.

                                                           up in stone     ?
                                                               Their food is brought
                                                           to them by currents             in
                                                           the sea.    They are not
                                                           great   eaters, like the
                     l'HOLAS IN THE BOCK.
                                                          cuttle-fish;     and the num
bers    of minute plants and animals wafted into their very mouths more
than satisfies them.
       But they have enemies, like the rest of their neighbours.
       All the birds, both of the sea and the shore, are on the watch for them.
The star-fishes     feast upon them,        without mercy, and suck out their soft
bodies from the shell.
       Man himself feeds upon them by thousands, so that there is no security
in the stone cell of the pholas, or the nimble hop of the cockle.
     In old days, the pholas was liked better than the oyster.
                                  THE OYSTER.
The oyster is called the king of the molluscs, for it is one of our greatest
dainties, and we should not like to do without it.
       The oyster is wrapped in a mantle, like the rest of his tribe           ;   but it is
left open in front, so that when you open the shell, you see the whole of
the creature's body.
     The mantle is thick at the edge, and surrounded by a fringe of ten
tacles or feelers.
       The mantle   is,   as
                           I   have told you before, the apparatus by which the
oyster forms its shell.         It   lays on a layer of fibres, and then       a   layer of
cement.      As the oyster keeps growing, layer after layer           is   laid on.      The

                                     THE OYSTER.                                  205
layers lap over each other, a little like tiles, as you may see by looking
at a shell.
      The oyster has neither head nor feet, but it has a mouth.          The mouth
has no teeth, but a fringe hangs round it.         I shall tell you directly the use
of this fringe.
      The oyster, shut up in its shell, seems to have no means of seizing its
prey   ;   but Nature      is never at a loss to provide for the wants of the
creatures      she has formed.
She      has    contrived   that
the food    of the oyster shall
be conveyed to its mouth
without         any    care   or
trouble.        To explain this,
I  must first tell you how
 the oyster breathes.
      Its gills or lungs are
in the shape of four de
licate leaves.       They float
loose    in the water, except
at one end, where they
are   joined to the body.
 If  you      looked at these
 delicate    leaves   through a
                                                       ""¦"
 microscope,      you would see a countless number of hairs or cilia.      These are
                                                                                 into,
 always on the move, and make tiny currents, which drive the food
 the mouth       of the oyster.
      I   need   hardly tell you that the food consists, for the most part, of the
 microscopic plants and animals with which the sea abounds.
      But where is the mouth of the oyster ?
      In a little hood, just at the place where the gills are joined to the body.
      The fringe of which I have spoken, belongs to the gills.           It is of the
 greatest use to the oyster.       It not only keeps up the little currents, but it
 enables the oyster to reject any particle     of food that it does not like.

206                                  YOUNG OYSTERS.
                               YOUNG OYSTERS.
All   the   summer, the oyster is busy          laying its    eggs.     It  lays an almost
incredible number.
     One oyster     will lay two millions in a single season        !
                                             It does not leave its eggs to their fate.
                                        It  keeps them,     for a time, hidden        in its
                                        mantle.    The young oysters swim about in
                                        the water.    They have a swimming appa
                                        ratus, such as you see      in the picture.
            YOUNO  OYSTERS.
                                             The apparatus is merely a band or fillet,
covered   with cilia, that keep moving, and row the little creature about.
    At first, the young oysters keep near their mother, and at the least
                                danger hide themselves        in her shell.        But,  by-
                                and-by, they fix themselves          to some solid body,
                                and   begin to make their shells.          In  three years'
                                time, they are   fully grown.
                                     The best oysters are found on the English
                                shores.    As far back     as  the time of the Romans,
                                the oysters   of Kent were thought nicer than those
                                of Italy.
                                     But the oyster, like many other things, is better
                                for being cultivated.     In   the rough     and   open sea
                                the oyster does not fatten so well as in the oyster-
                                parks, or banks,   where it is reared.
                                     Here, in calm water, the animalcules, and other
                                food for the oyster, accumulate and are          in greater

valuable oysters are brought from them.
    The rearing of this delicate mollusc might be made a more profitable
branch of industry than it is.

208                                       FISHING FOR PEARLS.
      Down in the depths of the                       ocean   the   oyster prepares       this beautiful
gem.
      Why it         does so, was once a great puzzle.
      In    these days,           it is thought that       the oyster throws out the pearly         juice
in a moment of irritation, caused by the entrance of some tiny substance
— such as even a bit of sand — into its shell. Then it sets to work to cover
over the intruder with a quantity of matter, which forms the pearl.
      The Chinese, who are very ingenious,                      can make      artificial pearls.
      They put atoms of grit or glass into the oyster's shell, and watch to
see   what the creature will do.
      They find that it pours out the pearly juice over the atom, whatever
it may      be.
      Itcannot turn out its enemy, so it does its best to conceal it.
      The oyster that produces the pearl is not the same as the one that is
eaten.
      The shell of the pearl-oyster is lined with a beautiful                         substance    called
mother-of-pearl.
      In                      of the East, the pearl itself is called a drop
            the poetical language
of solidified dew. And the best pearls are like drops of pure water.
    There was a fable once told about the formation of the pearl.
      The oyster was said to rise to the surface of the water and open its
shell.      It    did so to let the dew fall in and make the pearl.
      This was a pretty story              ;   but,    I   need not say, quite untrue.
                                       FISHING FOR PEARLS.
One of the most famous pearl-fisheries is on the coast of Ceylon.
       Ceylon         is,   as   you know, one of the most beautiful islands in the world.
But that part of the coast where the pearl-fishery                              is   carried on,   is   not
beautiful at all.
       It   is   a   flat, sandy shore, where nothing               is   to be seen but   a   few prickly
shrubs, and here and there                a    straggling village.

       One        of these shrubs         I   might just name to you, because an insect feeds
upon       it,    called the cochineal.              The cochineal   gives a beautiful         scarlet   dye,
that   is    as much          thought of as the Tyrian purple.
       Here        is   a   plate of the insects on the cactus.
       The desolate shore of which                   I   am speaking becomes, at one time            of the
year, a scene           of bustle.
       A
       number of rude huts are put together,                         as a   shelter from the sun and
rain, and people of all kinds
flock to the spot.
       There are merchants,                   and
jugglers,          and snake-charmers,
and a great crowd, as                if
                                      a       fair
were going to be held.
    It    the pearl - fishing
             is
which       is    going to take place.
       The natives of Ceylon are
not very brave,                 and do not
like to dive.
       So the divers come from
India, and are Hindus.
    But even the poor Hindu
does not like to risk his life
without saying some kind of
prayer.
    He goes through number        a
of ceremonies, in order to pre
vent any harm happening to
bim.

   I       may tell you that very
lew of these divers live to be old men. They generally lose their sight,
or are covered with sores while many of them are suffocated under water,
                                          ;
or get devoured by sharks.
       So that their business                 is   not at all a safe one.

PEARL-FISHING.

                                   THE BIRD.                                    213
                                THE BIRD.
The land birds are countless in their number.            Every wood, every field,
every garden is thronged with them.
     They are always with us or around us.         Their sweet notes are warbled
in our   ears,  and delight us.   Their swift movements fill us with wonder.
The whole wide space above us is their home.
     Man may snare and entrap them, but he cannot follow them.            They can
spread their wings and    fly out of his reach.
     What gives the bird such strength and swiftness       ?
     There is one thing which helps to do it.
     I mean our old friend oxygen.
     The breathing machine of the bird fills the entire body.      He is all lungs.
     The blood, amply supplied with air food, rushes with speed through his
whole frame.
   Besides this, the  air gains entrance     to every part   of him, even to his
bones.
     Thus he is bathed in oxygen.
     Life is going on as fast as can be.
     The animal heat of which I told you before, is raised             to   a  high
degree.    Oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon are uniting with such force, that the
body of the bird is very hot indeed.
     How restless and active he is     !   Is there any other creature to equal
him?
     How unceasing are his movements ! What hours and hours he keeps
on the wing !     Some birds rest but an hour or two in the twenty-four.
     A bird, then, has a double share of oxygen in his blood, and a double
share  of heat.
     What kind of clothing should such      a  creature have ?
     Something warm to keep in the heat, and something light that will not
be the least burden to him.
     What can    be warmer or lighter than feathers    I

214                              THE FEATHERS OF THE BIRD.
                            THE FEATHERS OF THE BIRD.
There       is a great deal to be said about the feathers.                 We cannot pass them
over in a moment.
      Do you       see    the soft down      on    the breast of the bird               ?   The little
creature had no other covering when                it came out of the ess.
      If
       you look at the down, you will perceive that it is made up of tiny
threads or filaments.
   They grow out of the skin in bunches, and do not hold together. They
hang loosely down, and form the softest and warmest under garment you
can imagine.
      The    quill feathers       are the   most    important          part of the bird's flying
machine — its wings.            You may      see   them when the bird             stretches   out its
wings.   There they are, firm, strong, and elastic.                     With these, it gives the
air a powerful blow. Then what happens ?
                                       THE POWER OF THE WINti.
      The air, which has been struck, is in the hollow of the wing.                           It   can
not escape upwards through the feathers, or forwards.                        So    it   escapes back
wards,      and gives the        body of the bird a push.                  Then     comes     another
powerful blow, and the same thing happens.                       All   this is done as rapidly as
possible,    and   is,   in fact, flying.

                          THE FEATHERS OF THE BIRD.                               215
     Some birds are more      clever at flying than others.       And some do not
use their wings at all to raise themselves      in the air.    Their bodies are too
heavy, and their wings too small, to fly with.        We shall hear more of these
birds by-and-by.     We have not yet done with the feather.
     What is it made of ?
     Not bone, or muscle, or flesh, or even horn.           It  is a substance  quite
distinct from either.
     Nor is it like any other part of the bird.
     When the bird came out of its shell it had, as we know, no feathers at
all.   It was not fledged.
     The   skin   of the   little  downy     creature  was full of tubes, or tiny
moulds, out of which the feathers were to grow.
     Let us watch the progress.
     The mould becomes lined with fibres, which are deposited by the blood.
When the fibres are dried up, we call them the pith of the quill.              At the
time we are speaking of, the pith is moist, and the fibres go shooting along
the whole length    of the mould.
     They are kept in place by rings of the same pith-like material, and
which keep forming as well.
     When all is ready, the feather begins to sprout from the mould.
     Each fibre in the feather part of the quill clings closely to its neighbour.
Yet there is nothing that you can see to hold them together.
     But if you look through the microscope, the secret will be out.
     There are a number of minute hooks on one side the fibre, and a number
of minute teeth, a little like latches, on the other.       The hook fits into the
latch, and both are made fast together.
     Should the two fibres be torn apart, they will spring back again and
reclasp.
     The bird spends     some time, every day, in dressing and polishing           its
feathers.
     Nature has given it a material on purpose.
     There is a little bag of oil placed       near the tail.     The bird turns his
head round, and squeezes out some        of the oil.
                                                                                       '

     Then he draws feather after feather through his bill, and gives     it a
polish.
     He goes on doing this, until his plumage is dressed.
     Until, in fact, he has finished his toilette.
                             BIRDS OF THE SEA.

on the waters.        The ocean is the store-house where the sea-birds find their
food.      They devour fishes, and molluscs, and sea-worms,          and whatever else
comes    in their way.
    The habits of the sea-bird are quite different from the habits of the land-
bird.     Its voice is often a harsh cry.       It does not take the same pains with
its nest.
                                       SEA-BIIUI.S.
      The sea-lark merely scoops a hole in the sand, where she lays her eggs.
But she has the same love for her young ones as her sister of the field and
the wood.
      If  she sees a dog coming near, she           will fly out of her nest, and droop
her wing as     if  she were lame.    The dog begins to run after her, and she
flies along,  still drooping her wing, until she has led him a long way from her
nest.    Then, all at once, she leaves him, and darts away as fast as she can.

    218                               BIRDS OF THE SEA.
        The sea-lark lives on the shore     ; and so do a tribe   of birds that are called
    strand-birds.     Some    of them stride about among the shallow pools                 of
    sea-water.    They have long legs, and long bills that can seize the prey
    before it has time to bury itself in the sand.
         One of these strand-birds has a bill turned up at the point.
         He is called a turn-stone, and I will tell you why.
         When a poor little worm hides itself under a stone, up he comes, and
    nothing is so easy as for him to turn the stone over with his bill.                Then
                                                           —    he   gets   a feast    upon

                                                                   There is a another of

                                                                shaped   like a wedge.
                                                                   The under part comes

                                                                very fond of shell-fish, and
                                                                is always looking about

         He waits patiently until an unlucky mollusc opens its shell.                  Then
    he pops in the wedge-like bill, and all is over with the mollusc.               It  is as
    nice a morsel to him as the oyster is to us.
         This bird is called the sea-pie.       He can skim the surface of the water
    and catch shrimps, and little fishes, and whatever comes in his way.
         But where are the real sea-birds ?
         You may find them far away on the ocean.              They love the wild dash
    ing spray and the foam of the billows.           Their cry is heard in the storm.
    Their feet scarcely ever tread the solid earth.
         Their clothing is suited to their habits.
         They live in the spray and the foam ; so Nature has given them a coat
    of extra warmth and thickness, and a large supply of oil.
         The bodies of some of the sea-birds are as full of oil as can be.                 So
    that, however the    spray may dash       over the feathers, they are always dry
    and firm and compact.

The frigate-bird         has    feet partly webbed.     He has a long bill, a forked
tail, and two strong wings             that sweep  the   air, and can bear him any
where.
     He may be said to
live on the wing.          But
he cannot rise from the
ground, as       the     little
birds do.
     He    is   obliged      to
start   from some         lofty
point.     Then he flings
himself into       the vast
open space.
     Does he fall     ?
     Oh no    !   His great
strong wings bear him
up.     He is quite at
home in the air.            He
wants no rest.
     He rests        on     the
breeze.

winds battle with each
other.     Then     the     fri

gate-bird is rejoiced.
     He skims boldly over the foaming waves.                He knows that all kinds of
shell-fish will be thrown up by the fury of the gale.
     He feeds on shell-fish, and on fishes as well.               And he knows he shall
find plenty of food — thanks to the storm !

   You would not believe how far those strong wings of his can bear him.
He might be nothing but wing ! On he goes, through the vast plains of
air, now skimming the waves, now sweeping over them, mile after mile.
      He is called    the eagle    of the ocean.          He has been said to sleep on the
storm.
                                  FRIOATE-BIRD   ATTACEING   A MULL.
      In the picture,    he is very hungry, and               has not been able to get any
food.     So he has turned robber, which,             I   am afraid, he often does.
      The poor gull had caught a fish for dinner.                      But, before it had time to
swallow
8          it,   down pounced the great strong-winged bird.

                                THE ALBATROSS.                                   221
     You  see  how fiercely he is attacking      the gull.    There is no doubt he
will carry off the fish and eat it himself.
                          THE ALBATROSS.
There is   a bird that may be called the monarch        of the sea.
     He is larger than the swan, and has a white body with black wings.
                              THE WANDEBING ALBATRO.SS.
     He is quite at home on the billows.
     He skims along without touching the water.             He rises and falls with
the wave.     He bids defiance to the storm.

 222                              THE ALBATROSS.
      For days and weeks he will follow the ship.       The sailors know him well.
      They call him the wandering albatross.
      His favourite   resort is the stormy seas about the Cape of Good Hope
 and Cape Horn.
      When    the ship is approaching      these  points,  a cloud   of albatrosses
 appear.
      The sailors know the sign, and can guess where they are.
      At certain  seasons the albatross  seeks the land.    There are some lonely
 islands where the birds live in vast numbers.
      They are    so  busy rearing their young, that a person may come close
 up to them, and even lay hold of them.
      The albatross makes a nest of dry grass and leaves, mixed with sand.
 When the mother bird is sitting on her eggs, her snow-white             head and
 neck tower above the nest, and are seen a long way off.
      If any  one approaches   to steal the eggs, she defends them bravely, and
 snaps her beak with great fury.
      In the plate, men are   driving the birds off their  eggs.
      But her greatest enemy is a fierce gull, that is always on the watch.
      He is very cunning, and hovers about until he sees the albatross leave
 her nest.    Then, down he pounces, and eats up her eggs.
      What does the albatross feed upon ?
      He has very much the habits of a vulture, and will devour all dead
 creatures that are floating on the water.
      When a whale has been killed, he scents it a long way off, and comes
 with his companions to settle on the body.
      His sharp crooked beak is more suited to feed on lifeless prey, than to
 seize the living fish as it glides quickly along.
      Do you remember the cuttle-fish, with its frightful arms ?
      The albatross will often make a meal of it.
      And the albatross is a great enemy of the flying-fish.
      He is ever to be seen, hovering about, near to a shoal of these pretty
little creatures.     When they are pursued by the dolphins, he comes and
joins in the   chase.

     The poor flying-fish gives a dart into the air to escape the dolphin, and
is pounced upon by the albatross.
     But I should tell you that the albatross seems to have an affection for
that odd-looking bird, the penguin.
                             ALBATROSS ATTACKING A 8AILOK
     In the lonely  Falkland Islands, the penguins and the albatrosses once
lived side by side.
     The great nest of the albatross towered up some two feet above the
ground.    All round it would be the nests, or rather holes, of the penguin.
       «                             15

220                                 THE PENGUIN.
     At  one time, the ground was covered            with these nests.  They looked
in the distance   like a plantation.
     Man has come and taken possession of the sea-birds' home.
     The nests are nearly all destroyed,        and the penguin and the albatross
are sone to live in more remote regions.
     I can give you an instance      of the fierce nature of the albatross.
     A  poor sailor fell overboard.        His companions    made haste to lower a
boat, to rescue him.
     He could   have   kept himself afloat until the boat reached him         ; but a
party of albatrosses    happened     to be near.      They made a swoop upon the
poor   man, and attacked      him with their wings and beaks.          He could not
contend   against them, and actually         sank under the eyes of his comrades
who were coming to save him.
                               THE PENGUIN.
What    a curious-looking    bird he is  !
     He has great webbed feet, which are placed so far back that his body
stands quite upright.        His wings have small scaly feathers upon them.
They are very little wings, and he cannot fly with them.
     He never tries to fly.
     He lives on the land and in the            sea.    He can dive like a fish, and
then he uses his funny     little wings instead of fins.
     He uses his wings for another purpose as well.         When he wants to climb
up the cliffs, his wings serve him as fore-feet.           He climbs with them, so
that he looks at a distance as if he were going on all fours.
     He is quite at home in the           sea.   And he does not swim       as  other
water-birds do.      He keeps his great body under water, and only his head
is to be seen.
     And he swims so far and       so fast   that he can keep up with the fishes.
He has been seen paddling a thousand miles away from land.
     Where does the penguin live ?

PENGUINS

                                    THE PENGUIN.                                    229
    He lives in islands where men have not taken up their abode.                There
the penguins reign in all their glory.
    There is a desolate rock in the seas near to the South Pole.
    It  is called Possession  Island.
    Nothing grows there of any kind.            But millions of penguins cover the
ground and the sharp ledges of the rock.
                                   ISLAND OF PENGUINS.
     It is an island peopled by penguins.
    A ship   once came to the island, and        the sailors wanted to land.     They
saw the strange-looking      birds all along the coast        ; but at first they did
not mind them.
    They went wading on through the midst of the penguins,                and thought
it would be easy to land.
    But the penguins had no idea of letting their island           be taken by storm.
    They flew at the sailors, and pecked at them, and made such a loud,
harsh noise that it was not to be endured.
    The captain took       possession    of the island      in the name     of Queen
Victoria.    But when he had done that, he was glad to sail away, and leave
the penguins behind.
    Should you like to hear a little more about the penguins ?
    They live in some other islands in these southern seas.                The islands
are called the   Falkland Islands.
                                                                                        /*

230                                   SAINT KILDA.
      A curious    grass grows there     called  the   tussock.    It grows in a great
round ball, high enough and big enough for men to hide in.
     The penguin likes to take his afternoon's nap in the tussock grass.
He is very greedy, and eats a great deal of fish.             He dives into the sea to
catch it.
      On fine afternoons,      when the penguins have woke up, they waddle
down to the beach, and make such a noise with their harsh voices, that
people can hear them a long way off.
      When the young ones are old enough, the whole band go away, nobody
knows where.
     The penguin gets very fat with eating so much.               The mother penguin
does not take the trouble to build a nest.            She lays her eggs in a hole, or
burrow, in the sand.
                               SAINT KILDA.
Saint Kilda        is an   island which is only six miles round.          Great rocks
shoot up all along the coast, and there is only one place where             people can
land.      Indeed,   they    cannot land    at all unless the weather happens        to
be fine.
     Where is Saint Kilda       (
     It  is one of a group of islands on the coast of Scotland, called              the
Hebrides.      There is one rock, or precipice, which is the highest in all Britain.
The view from the top is very grand indeed.
     Far below, the white foam of the ocean dashes about.             You are thirteen
hundred feet above the level of the sea.
     In this wild lonely      spot the sea-birds   love to dwell.     The bare naked
rock is covered      with them.      The air is darkened by them.          The waves
below are alive with them.
     Every narrow ledge is crowded with birds.              If  you were to roll down
a stone, a strange confusion would        happen.      Down it would go among the
thousands of birds sitting on their nests.           A cloud of birds would fly out
and darken      the   air.     But when the stone        reached   the bottom   of the

lock, and lay there  quite still, the panic would be over.            The frightened
birds would come back to their nests, and begin to sit again.
     What birds are they  ?
    There is the great auk, which, as you        see,  is a little like the penguin.
The mother auk does not sit on her eggs.              She  holds them close to her

body till they are hatched.   If  she is disturbed, she waddles away, taking
her eggs  with her.
    Her mate all the time is very busy.          He goes fishing every day, and
brings her home plenty of food.       When the young bird is hatched, both

parents          fish   for    it,   and   it   gets so fat that             it   can   hardly stir.    But the
parent birds get thin with the hard work they are doing.
       There are        a     great    many gulls at Saint               Kilda.         One of them    is   called
the kittiwake.
       If   you go near the nests of the kittiwakes, they will all fly out, and
begin to cry            "Kitti-wake        !    Kitti-wake      !"   till you      are nearly deafened.
                   THE BIRDS OF SAINT KILDA— THE FULMAR,
Should you like                to hear     a    little more about Saint Kilda               ?
       It   is   not    a   very pleasant spot to live in, as you may think.                           The wind

blows so fiercely, that people cannot build houses more than four feet high.
If they did, the house would be blown down.       They make as much room

                    THE BIRDS OF SAINT KILDA— THE FULMAR.                     238
as they     can, by   digging  into the   ground.    But it is like living in a
cellar.
     They have no windows ; but only holes in the roofs of their houses.
And there are little places round the walls, something like ovens to look at.
These are the bedrooms.
     There are not more than a hundred people living on the island.
     They are not unhappy, though the place is so dreary.            They keep a
few sheep, to eat the patches of grass which grow here and there among
the rocks.       And in one place, which is a little sheltered from the wind,
they can till the ground.
     But their great riches are on the ledges and among the crevices of the
rocks.
     Here live the birds of Saint Kilda.       I   cannot think what these poor
people would      do without the birds.    The birds give them food, and light,
and medicine,     and warm beds to lie upon in the cold winter nights.
     The lamps they bum through the long evenings are made of a bird.
      Made of a bird   ?
     Yes ; and a very useful bird, too.      The people    of Saint Kilda would
not be without it on any account.
     It  is called the fulmar.
     This is the only place in Great Britain where the fulmar lives.           It
likes to live on the little grassy shelves on the rocks.          And every such
shelf is as full of birds as it can hold.
      When the fulmar is seized,      it throws    a yellow   oil from its beak.
The oil has a very disagreeable smell.          It  taints the nest of the bird,
and even the rock on which it sits.            But still the oil is precious   as
gold.
     The islanders burn it in their lamps, and they think it cures the rheu
matism.
      It is very dangerous work to hunt for the fulmar.
     Two men go together, and take a few coils of rope with them.
     One of the men is let down the face of the cliff, by a rope fastened
under his arm.        He holds another rope in his hand.         The man who is

234                                           THE GULL.
with him lets him down.                 He has to take great care, and let him down
very slowly and carefully.              He has the rope tied round his foot, for fear it
should slip.
    When the man reaches a ledge of the rock, he stops.      Here the birds
are all sitting, and he begins to take the eggs and the young ones.
       He knocks down the old birds with a stick.He puts the eggs in a
basket, and goes creeping along on his hands and knees in the most dan
gerous places.
       Indeed, he seems to take a delight in showing off his bravery.                          If   any
one is looking, he        will give     great jumps from the rock, and spring back, as
if    he were a     tight-rope dancer.
    The dead body of the fulmar is so full of oil that it will burn like a
lamp.  The natives do not take much trouble with it.      They put a rush
through      it,   and   make   it   come out at the beak.               Then    they light the rush,
and    it   goes on burning      till all   the   oil   is   used up.
       You would often       see these      bird-lamps in the cottages at Saint Kilda.
                                            THE GULL.
Who that has visited the sea-shore but has seen the gull                          ?
  They are birds of the sea.      Their home      on the waves      is                   ;   and they
only seek the land to rear their young.
    The larger gulls are rarely seen except on the high seas.  They lead
the life of pirates. They cannot dive or plunge on account of the size of
their feathers.          So they plunder          their neighbours, and snatch the fish out
of their mouths.
       The smaller gulls are often seen near the shore.                         They wheel about, or
skim on the waters,  their silvery wings shining in the sun.    Sometimes
they seem to tread or walk on the waves, upheld by their strong pinions.
They will even ascend the rivers in search of prey.
    They are noisy, greedy, and rapacious.      They feed on all kinds of

creatures, dead or alive.           They pursue the shoals of herrings on their way
to and from the sea,          and thin their ranks.
     They plunge headlong            on the fish, and snatch       it from the waters.   It
happens,      now and
then, that the        gull
does not succeed in
carrying       off     the
prey.
    The frigate-bird,
if he chance        to be
near,   will     take    a

dart upon the gull,
and    force    him to
drop it.      Then, by

he  will  catch    it  in his   beak and devour it.
     The gulls have all the fierce nature of the sea-birds.
     It  is not safe to be at their mercy.
     Once    it  happened      that a fishing-boat was upset near to the seaport town
of Yarmouth.
     All    the    men     on   board were   drowned    except      one.     He was a good
swimmer, and tried hard to reach the shore, but the tide was against him,
and he drifted out a long way from land.
     As he floated, exhausted and almost hopeless, on the water, he heard a
flapping of wings.            It was a party of sea-gulls coming to seize him for
their prey.       He could feel their wings touch his face, and he tried to strike
at them with his arms, and drive them away.                  You may fancy how dread
ful a situation this poor man was in ! Happily, at this very moment a
ship came in sight.            He cried out with all his might, and the man at the
helm heard him.            Soon after, a boat came plashing along to rescue him.
     Thus the cruel gulls were disappointed of their victim.

286                               THE GULL.
     The family of the gulls is a very large one.     It includes all kinds of
varieties.
     There is the black gull, and the herring gull, and the Iceland   gull, and
many others.
                                    SEA-MEWS.
     And there is the green-billed gull, or the sea-mew.
     The sea-mew has a hoarse, harsh voice, between a laugh and a scream.

On some wild rocky coast, the strange                          note    of the bird mingles with the
noise     of the waves and the moaning of the wind.
         Saint Kilda      is,   as
                                 I    have told you, a favourite spot for the gulls.
         They like inaccessible rocks, and wild desolate islands.
         In   some places, the clouds             of gulls darken the air when they fly.            And
the noise they make              is   quite deafening.
         It   is
               a   trade to collect the eggs of the gull, as               it   was to take the fulmar.
         During the      season,      men are busy from morning             till night.    The eggs lie
so    thickly on the ground,            it   is   scarcely possible to help treading on them.
                           THE CLIFFS OF THE SEA-BIRDS.
There          are some small islands,             on the coast       of Iceland, that are called the
Westmannas.
         Their towering rocks are very picturesque.                     But a traveller seldom dares
to cross the stormy sea that divides them from the mainland.                              If perchance
he did cross        it   in safety, he might have months to wait before he could get
back again.
         Only one of these desolate islands               is   inhabited    by man.       The island    is
about ten miles round, and there are two little villages in which the people live.
    You may imagine how lonely the situation of these poor people must
be,   cut off from the outer world, and for                    a   great    part of the year cut off
even from Iceland itself.
         They have but few means of subsistence.
         The boats can seldom go out for fish in that tempestuous sea                      ;   and there
is   a   very scanty supply of grass for cows or sheep.
         They would at times perish of hunger, but for                     a    supply of food that     is
within their reach.
         On the naked rocks and cliffs, close by the sea, birds herd by thousands
and hundreds          of thousands.
    Here they make their nests and rear their young.    Here they whirl
about in dense clouds, darkening the air. Here their shrill, hoarse voices

ridges on it.     Its wings are like those of the penguin.

     Along the coast of Norway there are cliffs peopled almost entirely with
gulls.   And there are bird islands.

240                                    THE PUFFIN.
     A  man   will own     an island, and   it will descend to his son, and his son's
son after him.       Indeed, it may have been in the family for generations.
     Once a year, the owner comes to take the eggs.
     The old birds seem          to know    that he will leave a great many eggs
behind, and they do not make any opposition.
     But  if a  robber comes, as is sometimes the case, they are up in arms in
a moment.       In  spite  of their clamour, they cannot prevent the strange man
from taking the eggs.         And often he will not leave one behind.
     Then the birds make a great lamentation.                Clouds of them rise up into
the air, uttering     the most doleful cries.         Indeed,     if the robber comes too
often, they    will forsake their nests and seek a safer place.
                                                   There     is   a  curious-looking    bird,
                                             called the puffin, that likes to make its
                                             nest on these islands.
                                                   It is only    about the size of a pigeon  ;
                                             but it relies for defence on its great bill.
                                                   The bill is flat, of a three-cornered
                                             shape,     and    ending in a sharp point ;
                                             for the upper half of the bill bends a
                                             little downwards.
                                                   It  can bite famously     with this great
                                             sharp bill.
                  PUFFINS.
                                                   When      an enemy, perhaps       the sea
raven, comes to steal a       little puffin, the mother bird seizes him under the
throat, and holds on to him by her claws.                She   will not let   go, and she   is
carried away by the raven till they come to the sea.
     Here they both drop together, and often the raven will be drowned.
     The puffin has its legs so very far back, that when it is on land it is
constantly tumbling down.
     It does not take the trouble to make a nest               ;  but it lays its eggs in a
hole  in the rock, or on the shore.
     When the hunter comes to take it — for he wants its feathers                   — it will
behave very much as the booby gannet does.

     The hunter's dog scents the puffin, and goes to its hole.       He pulls out
the first puffin.     The next puffin is so silly as to lay hold of the tail of the
one that is being dragged out.         And the third puffin lays hold of the tail of
the second.
     And  so  they go on, until all the puffins in the hole are dragged out in
a chain of their own making.
                                  THE GANNET.
The birds of the       sea, as   I have told you, spend most  of the year on the
salt sea waves.
     They rarely,    if  ever, seek the land, except to rear their young.      Then
they choose a place as far as possible from the reach of their enemy — Man.
Some desolate island, or steep rock, is their favourite spot in which to build
their nests.     These    places   may be called bird cities.   They are crowded
with birds till the very air is filled with them.
     The Bass Rock, in the Frith of Forth, is a place densely peopled
by birds.
     The rock itself is of red-coloured stone, but at a distance you would
fancy it consisted of white         chalk.   It has this look  on account   of the
myriads of white gannets that cover it.           •
     The top of the rock is like a platform, and is covered with grass.          The
sides are steep and bare, and only at one place can a person land.
     Wild and     steep as the rock appears, man has taken possession     of it.
     The owner of the rock will not allow the old birds to be disturbed, or the
eggs to be taken.        But when the young birds are large enough, he some
times sends a number of men and boys to hunt them.
     The poor birds are knocked down with a stick, or else taken by the
hand.
     They are also often       shot from boats at the foot of the rock, and are
picked up when they fall into the sea below.
     The birds are not good for food, but are valued for their feathers.

242                                 THE GANNET.
      The gannet is really a kind of goose.           It  is often called the solan-
goose.
      Like many of the sea-birds,      it has to let itself drop down from some
steep rock before it can fly.        Its movements are very swift and graceful.
When it spies a fish swimming on the waves, it first rises up in the air,
exactly over the spot; then it drops down headlong upon its prey, and
rarely fails to seize it.
      The force with which     the gannet pounces        in this way is very great.
Many creatures would be killed by the shock           ;  but a special   provision   has
been made by Nature.
      The front of the head is covered with a horny kind of mask.               And to
help the bird to breathe more freely, it has three air-cells in its body.
      These air-cells break the force   of the fall, for they are light and buoyant,
like swimming-bladders.       And they also prevent the gannet from plunging
too deeply into the water, and help        it up again   to the surface.
      The beak of the bird is pointed and strong.            It pierces into the fish
like a spear or dart.
      Indeed, the gannet is often taken at sea by a trick.          The sailors fasten
a fish   to a board, and let it float on the water.
      In   a few moments,   down comes the gannet with a tremendous force.
It  is stunned by the shock it receives on the board, and is easily secured.
      I  must tell you that the gannet is a great devourer of the herrings.
      It  keeps close by the shoal   of fish, and takes as many as it can.
      When the fishermen on the coast see a gannet, they know the herrings
are not far off.
      They begin to prepare their boats and their nets directly.
      For    the  gannet never comes near the shore except to feast on the
herring.       It will snatch  it  even   from the very nets and boats           of the
fishermen.
      There is a relation of the gannet that is called the booby.               It is so
very stupid, that it never gets out of the way, but sits quite still while the
hunters knock it over with a stick.            It is not so stupid when it goes to
look for its prey.     Then it is quite sharp and cunning.

    It will hover over a shoal of fishes, till it spies one of them rising to
the surface of the water, then down it pounces with a shock like that of
the gannet.
                            HUNT1NO THE BOOBY OANNBT.
    In  a moment the fish is seized and swallowed.
    The frigate-bird seems to be a sad robber.        As often as not, he will
swoop on the poor booby, and force him to give up the fish.

                       THE TOWN OF THE GORFOU.
There    is a relation of the gannet which is called the gorfou.
     It is a very curious-looking    bird, as you may see.   It   has a quantity
of loose feathers about its head, which give it rather a strange appearance.
                                 TOWN  OF THE OORFOU.
     But the most interesting part of its history is the manner in which it
chooses to live.
     The gorfou, like many of the sea-birds, is sociable.   It lives surrounded
by its companions in a kind of camp or town.

                                     THE GREBE.                                  245
     A town inhabited by gorfbus      !
     They set to work, all at once, to make their town.
     Instead of choosing a wild cliff, or rock, they begin on the level ground.
     Indeed, they take pains to select the piece of ground that is most suit
able for them.
     The ground must be quite flat, and with as few stones in it as possible.
     When they have fixed on a piece of ground, they make a number of
squares, such     as you see    in the picture.    The squares   are arranged  in a
regular manner, as by line and plummet, and there are passages left between,
which we may call the streets of the city.
     When all this has been done, each gorfou chooses a square for her nest.
     In   the   picture, you see the birds sitting on their eggs,       each in her
square.
     The mother bird would not leave her eggs on any account, for I am
sorry to say that honesty is not much regarded in the bird community.
     The next door gorfou would steal them in a moment.           Indeed, as a rule,
the mother gorfous are always on the watch to steal         their neighbour's eggs.
So that, when the young birds come out of their shells, one nest can
hardly hold them.
     Half the family will not belong to         the gorfou who reared     them, but
to another bird, from whom she has stolen them.
     The Americans call these towns of the gorfous,       " rookeries."
                                 THE GREBE.
You have      seen the firm  silky plumage of the grebe.
     It  is the fashion to make it into muffs and tippets, and ladies often wear
it in their   hats.
     The grebe is a relation of the duck, but it is rather different in some
respects.
       It  has a long bill, and its short legs are placed     very far back on its

body.     When it comes on land, it has to stand upright, or it would lose its
balance and tumble over.
     It  is more fitted for swimming          than for walking.      Neither can it fly
very well, on account of the shortness            of its wings.     So that    it  seldom
leaves the water.     It lives in shallow pools and meres, and makes its nest
among the reeds and flags.
     The mother bird is very good to her young.            She feeds them on small
eels that she picks out    of the mud.        And when her little ones are tired, she
will carry them   on her back to the nest again.
     The old birds live on fish, and are constantly diving to get it.                They
are seldom seen on land,      and      they are so shy that it is not very easy to
shoot them.
     People hunt them for the soft silvery plumage of the breast.                 It  is as
firm and as glossy as satin, and this is the part used for the muffs and tippets.
                                                                  The most beautiful

     Here the grebe lays her eggs and rears her young.                She uses one of
her webbed feet as a paddle, and paddles her nest about on the pool or
stream.
     If anything alarms her, she will use her oar, and push her nest along,
to get out of the way.

                                  THE PELICAN.                              247
    A great many floating plants       get entangled round the nest, and   drift
about with it.
    So that the nest and the weeds look       like   a little island.
                                 THE PELICAN.
Do you    see the  curious pouch of the pelican    ?
     It is as elastic as can be, and stretches out like an india-rubber bag. It
will hold a great many fish.      When the pelican is fishing, nothing can be
more convenient than this great pouch.         The bird can carry away quite a

store   of food to give to its young, or to devour at leisure. When the
pouch is empty, it can be wrinkled up, and takes very little room.
     The pouch is lined with a short downy substance, as soft as satin.
     When the mother bird gets home, and wants to feed her nestlings, she
begins to empty her pouch, by pressing her upper bill against her neck and
breast.
     The upper bill is tipped with red         ; and this has given rise to the silly
story that the pelican feeds her young with her own blood.
                        PEI.ICANS ON THE BoRDERM OF THE OAHPTAN MEA.
     The pelicans are good swimmers,        but they do not venture into the open sea.
They live in flocks along the sea-coasts of both the Old World and the New.
     Sometimes    they rise into the air, as the gannet does, and pounce head
long on their prey.
     As they pounce down, they strike the wave with their wings, and make
such  a  splash that the fish is too much bewildered to escape.

     But the pelicans can catch their prey in another manner.
     They form themselves into a circle on the water, and keep driving the
fish into the middle.     By  degrees, they drive them into    such a small space
that every one is devoured.
                               PELICANS FISHINO IN A CIRrLE.
     They first fill their pouches.       Then they eat as much as they can, and
retire to digest the meal.
     The fish will keep good a long time in the pouch of the pelican.
     The Chinese, who are very ingenious, turn this to account.
     They tame the pelican, and make it catch fish for them.
     One pouch   full of fish is enough for half-a-dozen persons.

                            THE EAGLE OF THE SEA.
  There    is a fierce bird  of prey called the fish-hawk.
       His proper name is the osprey.
       He is always hovering about to       see  what fish he can get.
                                         THE 0SPREY.
       He pounces on the fish,     as the rest of the sea-birds do.
       First  he wheels    round, then he poises himself in the air, and then he
  drops,  swift  as an arrow.
       In a few seconds he appears again, the water dripping from his plumage.
      He carries a fish in his mouth, which is still alive and struggling.
      But none of these birds seem sure of their prey, even when they have
  snatched it from the waves.

                                  THE EAGLE OF THE SEA.                     261
     It    often    happens
that the great sea-eagle
is close at hand.
     The eagle loves the
lonely shore, and the
steep,  wild rocks.       He
has been        perched    on
some      tree     or  crag,
watching       to see what
the     fish-hawk        was
about.
     Now the time has
come for action.
      He stretches        his
wings, bends his white
head, and swoops         like
a thunder-bolt on the
fish-hawk.
     The fish-hawk, in
his   fright,     drops his
prey, which is snatched
 up  in a moment, and
carried       off   by    the
eagle.
      The sea-eagle lives
chiefly on fish, and has
his nest by the           sea.
He drops with           such                   THE EAOLK AND THE FISH-HAWK.
violence on his prey that the Italians compare it to the falling of a piece of
lead.     They call him the leaden eagle.
      The sea-eagle is dreaded very much by the people who live near the coast.
      He will carry off lambs from the flock, and all the smaller animals lie
 can get    ;  and he   will   even attack the cattle.

262                          PLANTS THAT LIVE IN THE SEA.
        No one who has not           seen    the    manner of attack would     believe    it
possible.
     First, the eagle dashes into the sea and wets his plumage                ;   next, he
rolls himself on the beach until he is covered with sand.
    After that, he rises up into the air and hovers over an unfortunate ox.
The ox goes on quietly feeding, until, all at once, a shower of sand comes
into its eyes.
        The eagle has flung the sand, and now he begins to clap his wings and
fling more sand, and startle and terrify the poor ox as much as he can.
        He even strikes it with blows from his great strong pinions.
        The ox is half-blinded, and so frightened that it almost loses its senses.
It    runs headlong hither and thither, until at length it either drops down
from fatigue, or rushes over the cliff.
     Now and then the eagle meets with his match.
     He comes swooping down upon the dolphin.
     The dolphin is a sea animal, a little like a whale, only not so large.              It
will be, however, the destruction of the eagle.
     The claws of the eagle are entangled in the skin of the dolphin.                    He
cannot get them free, and as the dolphin               dives to the bottom of the sea, it
carries the eagle     with   it,   and he   is   drowned.
                      PLANTS THAT LIVE IN THE SEA.
The       full of plants, that float about in the water, or else are attached to
        sea   is
some rock at the bottom of the ocean.
       These plants are called sea-weeds.
        For   a long time, nobody cared about the sea-weeds, or took the trouble
to examine them.
        But now, they are as carefully studied as the plants that grow on the
land.
        Many of the sea-weeds are very beautiful indeed.

                         PLANTS THAT LIVE IN THE SEA.                           258
     They make gardens at the bottom of the ocean.           Their colours are red,
and green, and yellow, and purple.
     All  manner of living creatures    dart about among them.         The scene is
as varied and as gay as    if it were on land.
     Indeed, it is almost like fairy-land.
     When night comes, millions of tiny creatures shine and sparkle like the
glow-worm or the fire-fly.       The depth of the ocean is full of beauty by
night and by day.
     Should you like to know something about the sea-weeds          ?
     They are quite different from land plants, though they have leaves and
a root.
     The root holds the sea-weed to its place on the rock.         But it does not
suck up the moisture as the root of the land plant does.
     There are no little cells in the leaf of the sea-weed to carry the moisture
all over it.
     It  must be plunged entirely in water,     if it is wanted to live.
     Its leaves are called fronds, and they are of a substance different from
the green leaf of the plant that grows on land.
     Sometimes they are hard and horny, and sometimes they bend about as
if they were made of india-rubber.
     The fronds of some sea-weeds have little bladders or air-vessels on them.
These help to float the plant     in the water.
     The sea-weeds belong to an order of plants called Cryplogamia.          Their
mode    of flowering is unknown.
     A number of tiny spores or globules are inclosed in a case or capsule.
They are so small that you could not see them without a microscope.
     But small as they are, they are supposed to be of two kinds, and to
answer to the pistil and anther of a flower.
     The tiny spores come out of the case or capsule in which they are shut
up, and drop into the water.
     A  number of hairs, or cilia, help them to whirl round and round.
     The whirling does not last long.
     By-and-by they give over moving, and begin to sink.

264                       THE SEA-WEED THAT IS USED FOR FOOD.
      They soon fix themselves                 to a rock or some convenient     place.   Tiny
rootlets shoot from the spore, and hold it fast.
      After that it begins to grow, and becomes a sea-weed.
                   THE SEA-WEED THAT IS USED FOR FOOD.
There is      a sea-weed        of a beautiful crimson colour, and that grows in the
shape      of a hand.
      It   is called dulse.
      If   you lived in Scotland, you would              hear it cried about in the streets,
as water-cresses        are   with   us.       People buy dulse and eat it. They say it has
a taste     of oysters.
      The Icelander has not many dainties in his barren country.                     But he is
very fond of dulse, and has a nice dish made of it.
      The duLse is washed and allowed to dry.                   Then a white powder comes
out all over it.
      The powder is packed in casks like flour, and is eaten with fish and
butter.
      Or else it is boiled in milk, and mixed with rye flour.
      Cows and sheep are very fond of dulse.                   When they are kept in pas
tures near the sea, they will go roaming in search of it.
      A    sheep   will   go so far on the         beach when the tide is out, and stay so
long hunting for dulse, that it cannot get home in time.                       The tide will
come in and wash the poor sheep away.
      The sea-weed is often called sheeps' dulse on this account.
      The peasants in Ireland make a dainty dish of a sea-weed.
      They     call it Irish moss          ;   but it grows all round the coasts of Eng
land, Scotland, and Ireland.                   Its frond is cut up into   branches   that curl
like a frill.
      People boil       it,   and then strain off the water.
      They boil the water over again, and put into                 it   milk, and sugar, and
spice.

                                 SODA FROM      THE SEA.                          255
     When it is done, they pour it into a shape            ;  and as it cools it gets
hard like blanc-mange.         It  is thought to be very strengthening for people
who are delicate.
                             SODA FROM THE SEA.
We have seen what a vast amount of matter the molluscs draw out of the
sea-water   to make their shells.
     Now we shall     see  that the sea-weed can also draw useful material from
the sea, and treasure     it up in its fronds.
     There is a substance which is used in the manufacture of glass, and also
of soap.    It is called kelp.
     Kelp is obtained from a sea-weed.
     There was a time when kelp was very valuable indeed.                  From the
coasts of Scotland twenty thousand tons            used to be gathered every year,
and each ton was worth ten or even           twenty pounds.
     In  the autumn, when the rough winds begin to blow, the sea-weeds are
thrown up by the waves, and lie in heaps upon the beach.
     Then, in the palmy days of the kelp manufacture, people              used to be
very busy indeed.
     They hurried to the beach to collect the sea-weeds which lay there.
     The farmers    used some       of the weeds to scatter on their fields for
manure.      But by far the greater part was burned in the kelp-kiln.
     The kelp-kiln is a pit dug in the sand, and a few stones put round it.
     The sea-weed is first allowed to get dry, and then it is thrown into the
pit and set on fire.
     After a time, the pit becomes full of a melted substance, which is well
raked together, so that it forms one compact mass.                 When it is cool
enough it is taken out, and is really the substance called kelp.
     It can be broken to pieces, and sent to market.
     What makes the kelp        so  valuable  ?
    The alkali, or common soda, it contains         ; and   that we use for washing
and other cleansing purposes.

   256                     MEDICINE THAT COMES FROM THE SEA.
         It  has been found out that soda can be obtained from common salt.
         This is done in manufactories in different parts of England, and in
   other countries.
         A   great many processes are gone through, by means of fire and of
   various acids.
         The salt is made to lose its saltness and become soda.
         This discovery was made in France.
         The price of soda rose so very high in the time of Napoleon, when
   England and France were at war, that it could scarcely be procured.
         The soda manufactories depended a great deal on our sea-weeds              for
   kelp.      But when soda began to be made from salt, kelp was not so much
   wanted.       Its price went down in the market.
         And the Highlander did not find his kelp harvest so profitable.
         I might just say, that the sea-weeds torn up from the deepest part of
   the sea, and thrown upon the Irish coasts, yield the most soda.
                    MEDICINE THAT COMES FROM THE SEA.
   The fresh     sea breeze  brings health to the sick and strength to the weak.
         But this is not the medicine     I mean.
         The medicine     I mean is called iodine.
         There are a great many complaints that iodine will cure.
         The worst of all is the goitre.
         When     a  person   has a goitre,  his neck will swell in a very terrible
   manner.
         In Switzerland, among      the great mountains, there    are some wretched
   villages.     Almost    every man, woman,     and  child in the village will have
   the goitre.
         In our own country,      among the hills   of Derbyshire, people suffer from
   this complaint.
         If the  iodine cannot always cure the goitre, it will do a great      deal  of
   good.

                        THE WEED THAT LOOKED LIKE A SERPENT.                                        267
         In South America little sticks, called goitre sticks, were sold in                        the
shops.         People used to chew them.
    That was a long time ago, before anything was known about iodine.
    The sticks were nothing but the stems of a sea-weed.       And the
reason they did good was because they had iodine in them.
       What is the name of the sea-weed                ?
      It   is called the tangle.
      I dare     say you have seen it.      It   has a long        ribbon-like frond slit up into
a    kind of fringe.
       It grows in deep water, but it is often cast on shore by the tide.
       When a heap of sea-weed lies on the beach, there is more tangle than
anything else.
      The Scotch people eat the young leaves and stalks when they have been
well boiled.
      So the tangle is a very useful sea-weed indeed.
      But the most valuable part of it is the store of iodine which it yields.
      Its great woody          stems   are collected         and    made     into a heap.      Then
people        set fire to them.     They are reduced              to ashes, and a blue vapour
rises from them.
      This is iodine.
      The chemist knows how to condense                    it,   and make   it   pass from a vapour
to   a   real body.      The doctors use   it    for   a   medicine.
      There     is   another use for the iodine.
      People who take likenesses          by means of the sun want the vapour of
iodine to use in the process.
     We call them, as you know, cartes des visites.
                THE WEED THAT LOOKED LIKE                              A    SERPENT.
Oxce upon a time people were very fond of talking about the great sea-
serpent.
      Now and then, the sailors would declare that they had seen                             it,   and
          W                                      17

258                    THE WEED THAT LOOKED LIKE A SERPENT.
would give wonderful           accounts     of what it was like.                They would talk of
its great head, and the mane which hung from its neck, and the wonderful
length of its body, as it lay upon the waves.
       But nobody ever came near enough                     to catch       it ; — and few      people
believe        that there is a sea-serpent at all.
       I    am going to tell you a      little story about the sea-serpent.
       One day a vessel was sailing along the ocean.                        It   was calm weather,
and the captain was looking             out on the waves.             All    at once, he felt sure
he saw the wonderful sea-serpent.
       Its vast body kept moving up and down                         on   the waves, and looked
yards on yards in length.
       Its     huge head was clearly to be seen, and the                  lion's mane, that people
had talked so much about, covered its neck.
       It    was a strange-looking creature,           to be sure, and in a few minutes all
the people on board were           looking at it.
       Yes, it must be the sea-serpent         ;   there was no doubt about it.
       The captain was resolved to make sure of the monster, and not to let
it slip      as other captains had done.
       He sent a party of his men in a boat, with a piece of rope to tie to                        it,
and some guns to shoot          it if it   should resist.
       Did the sailors catch the sea-serpent            ?
       They rowed on, and on, and at last came close up to its head.
       There was the huge monster, bobbing up and down on the waves.
       The people       in the ship were all the time watching.                      They saw the
sailors unroll the rope, and begin to fasten                it   to the creature's head.        Then
the boat set off back again, dragging the wonderful sea-serpent                        after it.
       In      the picture you see the boat returning to the ship                 with the creature
behind it.
       It    was so covered with shells        and      other marine animals, that at first
it    was no easy matter to make out what                it   was.
       But, after a time,       the   captain discovered that              it    was nothing    more
than a monstrous piece of sea-weed,                a   hundred feet long, and four feet in
width      !

      Its root was the head ; and as it moved up and down on the waves it
 looked as much like a serpent as could be.
     Did the captain bring it home to England ?
      He tried to do so ; but it had such a disagreeable            smell that he was
obliged to throw       it overboard.
     Then     it began to   look like a serpent again, and to bob up and down
just as it had done before.
     The captain of another vessel saw it          ; and he sent word home that he
 had really and      truly seen the    great sea-serpent !
                                 ANIMAL HEAT.
 People speak of animal heat, or caloric.
      If you    touch your body, you will feel how warm it is.
     Now, touch the body of a lizard or a snake, and you shudder a little.
 For the body of the creature is cold.
     It   would make the thermometer go down instead of up.
     All    the warmth the reptile has comes from without.
     How the snake and the lizard love to bask in the sun               !  No matter
how fierce his rays.         The hotter the better.
     Have you ever seen a snake in its cage at the Zoological Gardens            ?
     How sluggish, and sleepy, and dull it was !
      It can hardly live in our climate though it is wrapped up in a blanket.
 It has so little heat in its body, and there is no fierce tropical sun to supply
 the need.
                                                                          *
     Why has it so little heat       ?
      Because     its blood has so little oxygen.         There is a very feeble com
bustion going on.
      It  is the difference between a few smouldering ashes and a brisk fire.
      When we come to examine the breathing machine of the reptile, we
 shall know a little more about it.
      I  have only one more thing to tell you at present.
                                                                                       "

263                             ANIMAL HEAT.
     Nature has made up, in some degree, to the cold-blooded creature for its
want of heat.
     Life, though it smoulders, lasts a very long time.    It does not burn out
                                  quickly, as in the case of the animal and
                                  the bird.
                                      The reptile can live more years than you
                                  would believe it possible.
                                      It has even been said that a crocodile
              TOHTOisu.
                                  cannot die except by a violent death.
     And a tortoise can do without food for months and months, and yet       be
alive.

                           CREATURES CALLED REPTILES
                      CREATURES CALLED REPTILES.
There    .ire some parts    of the world in which neither birds, nor fishes, nor
animals can very well live.        Such places, for instance, as the muddy banks
of rivers, or tracts of country which are sometimes         under water, and then
parched up with drought.
     Nature does not seem willing to leave these parts of her domain with
out inhabitants.      She has formed a tribe of creatures        to live in them   —
creatures that can exist both in the water and on the land.
     We should have had little to do with this extraordinary         family  if some
of them did not live in the      sea.
     They are called reptiles.
     Now the reptile is very strangely made as regards his air food.              For
we must come again to our old friend oxygen.
     Some    of the reptiles can breathe in the water and on the land.      In   fact,
they have two breathing machines.           They have lungs for the land, and
gills for the water.
     What a quantity of oxygen they must take in !
     Oh, no ; far from it.      The blood of the reptile has very little oxygen in
it ; and that makes some of his tribe so sluggish and so slow.

2C4                      CREATURES CALLED REPTILES.
     Can anything be more sluggish than a toad      !
     Toads are reptiles.   And a toad has been found shut up in a stone, or
in the trunk of a tree.
     How long it had been there I am afraid to say.
     The lungs of a reptile are not finished off with such care   as   yours and
mine are.    They have large, coarse cells, into which the blood rushes to get
a taste  of oxygen.
     But it does not get half such a taste as in the number of delicate
cells that are found in our lungs.
     And the lungs of the reptile float loosely, like a bag, and contract and
expand in a very imperfect manner.
     I will tell you another reason  why the lungs work     so feebly.
     The fault is in the heart.
     Your heart and mine have two chambers,      so that the two kinds of blood

do not come together.       I  mean the bright red    blood that is  full of oxygen,
and the dark blood that has none.
    But the heart of the reptile has no such division.            As in a common
room, used by both, the two kinds of blood rush together, and get mixed.
    So the blood has not the same vigour ; it is only half supplied with
oxygen.     It cannot go bounding along as ours does.
    If it  does bound forward for an instant,     it soon stops to recover itself.
    The quickest pace of the reptile is a series of jerks.
    There is a creature which was a great puzzle to naturalists.
    They could not decide whether it was a fish or a reptile.           It is midway
between the two.
    It looks like a fish, for it has a long scaly body, that tapers to a point.
And it has four little feet or fins, whichever you may like to call them,
growing from its body.        Two of the fins are in front, and two behind.
    It has gills, with a covering to them, just like the fishes ; but it has
lungs as well.    As it grows up, the gills disappear.
    It lives so much on land, that Nature seems to think it can do without
them.     And as the lungs get stronger, they are left to do all the work.
    It is called the lepido-siren.     It has some other names, but they are so
hard and long that    I  am sure you would not remember         them.
    It was found in the River Amazon        ; also in the  River Gambia, in Africa.
                         THE GREAT FISH-LIZARD.
Ages and ages    ago,  the  lily stars waved   their rosy-coloured arms, and the
ammonites lived in the waters.
    Creatures that are now extinct, had their home in the ocean.
    They were very monstrous creatures indeed.
    Perhaps you may have heard of the fish-lizard.          Its skeleton, or at least
some of its bones, are often to be seen amongst the fossils in a museum.
    It is called fish-lizard, because it was like both a fish and a lizard.

            The fish-lizard lived so long ago, that we cannot know much of its

      It had a good     appetite, and used to devour the molluscs that lived in
the sea.     And it would not spare its own relations         if it was hungry.
      One fish-lizard
would     think    no

lizard as well.
      But it was a

      How can we be sure that such monsters existed            ?
      Because    their bones have been found embedded              in the crust of the
earth.
      And learned      men   have  been able to tell us, from these very bones,
a  little about their history.

208                                       THE LIZARD.
                                     THE LIZARD.
There       are some islands     in the South Seas, close under the Equator.
      I    should not care to mention them, but that a frightful-looking lizard
is   found there.
      At least it lives among the rocks               on the beach.
      It   is the descendant,    and the only one that remains,                    of the mighty fish-
lizard of olden time.
      It   is not nearly so large, as         I   hardly need tell you.                  The largest that
has been seen is not more than four feet long.
      It   can swim and dive, and is quite at home                     in the     sea.
      Indeed, a shoal       of these lizards has been seen swimming out on the
waves.
      It   twists its body about as it swims, and so forces itself along.
      Its feet all the time do not move in the least.
      It is very quick and nimble in the water. But on land it is                               dull and
slow, and seems hardly inclined to stir.
     Like all its tribe, it is very hard to kill.                     Though the life of the reptile
is feeble and sluggish, the spark, such as it                   is,   cannot easily be put out.
      A    sailor once wanted to       kill     of these ugly lizards.
                                              one                        He tied   heavy         a
weight to      it,   and sunk   it   to the bottom of the sea.    A line was fastened to
the weight, and         after a time the sailor drew                   it   up,   thinking the lizard
would be dead.
      But   it   was as   brisk and lively as ever.
      It   has strong claws to its feet, which help                   it   to crawl over the rugged
heaps      of stones and lava on the coast.
      For the islands      are volcanic       ;   that   is,   they have been pushed up from
the ocean by the action of fire.
      On the wild and rocky shore,                a   group of these hideous black lizards
may be seen, basking in the sun.
      They eat sea-weed, though one captain of                    a     ship, who saw them swim
ming in the water, declares they devour fish, and go out to catch it.

                                      THE TURTLE.                                 269
    Naturalists dispute this fact.         I  mean the fact  of eating the fish.  At
any rate, the stomach        of the creature     has been found to be filled with a
sea-weed that grows near the coast.
    And who shall decide when doctors disagree ?
    There is one very curious thing about the lizard.
    It can swim like a fish, and seems, as I told you, quite at home in the
water.
    But still it cannot always be made to go into the              sea.   And, oddly
enough, it likes the land the best.
    A  naturalist who was watching           it to find out its habits, says that he
did all he could to force it into the water.
    He drove it to a sharp point of the rock, where it could get neither
forwards nor backwards.
    He thought, of course, it would jump off into the           sea, and  swim away
in safety.
    And the lizard was very much alarmed, and in great straits.              But still
it would not seek refuge in the water. It would rather be caught.
    And the same naturalist threw it again and again into a pool left by
the tide on the shore.        It  could swim in this pool as well as possible.   But
it would not stay     there.     It crawled out as soon as it could, and began to
make its way among the rocks.
    Some people      think it is afraid of the sharks, and that it fancies the
land is the safest place.
                                THE TURTLE.
There is     a creature    whose    soft body would be the prey of almost every
inhabitant of the sea.
    It  is helpless in itself, and without any means of protection.
    Nature     has therefore given     it a thick, strong shield, which screens and
defends   it from its  enemies.
    Except, indeed, its greatest enemy, man.
                                                                                       /.

very nice indeed.

when he lands at a coast where turtles are likely to come ashore to lay
their eggs.
     For this is the only time he has any chance of catching them.
     The turtle lives in the sea.
     And it likes the warm      seas   of the Tropics, and keeps there when
it can.

      Now and then, very rough gales will drive it away from its home, and
keep chasing it on, and on, till it gets hundreds of miles away.
     A turtle was once washed on shore in our own county of Cornwall.
      It  was a monstrous creature, six feet long.
      I  must tell you a little about that great heavy shield, that the turtle
carries on its back.
     The back-bone, the ribs, and the breast-bone          of the turtle, are all com
pactly joined        together.    They make a complete    covering of bone.     A  har
ness,   if you    like to call it  so.
      A   skin goes all over the harness        ; and on the skin are great scales or
shining plates.
      In   some species       of turtle the shell or covering is used for ornamental
work.       It  is called tortoise-shell.
      Indeed, the Romans were so fond of tortoise-shell, that they used it to
inlay their doors, and to ornament their houses.
      They did not care to eat the flesh of the turtle, as we do.
      Now, what is found inside this covering or harness          ?
      The soft parts of the animal.         Its muscles and its flesh.
      Its head, and its tail, and its feet can be seen.       For it puts out its head
to look about.
      There is a land tortoise that can draw head, and feet, and tail, under its
shield, so that nothing can be seen.
      And    if  it is frightened, it will keep them hidden almost any length of
time.      At least till its enemy is tired of waiting.

How does the turtle manage to breathe under the shell             ?
      I will   tell you.
      Breathing       goes   on  very slowly in the turtle.     It  does not  need   to
breathe so often as we do.
      It  gulps down air through its mouth, and so by degrees fills its lungs.

272                            ENEMIES OF THE TURTLE.
     Its lungs, as I told you before, have large, coarse cells to them, and they
do not fill with air veiy easily.             And its blood gets mixed, if you re
member, so that the current is slow and not brisk.              And there is no heat
                                                           in its body.     So that life

     The wild dog, and even the tiger, often attack the poor turtle.
     If   it can be turned on its back, it falls an easy prey.            And the dogs
will  all  push together in order to turn it over.

     Now and then, however, a turtle escapes and gets back to the sea.
For it is soon alarmed, and the slightest sound will cause it to hurry off
as fast as    it can.
     The     men     who   are
watching never make the
least   noise.     They hide
themselves behind a rock
or stone, and wait pati
ently, till they see some
dark      objects    crawling
slowly along.
     These are the turtles.
It will    often    take four
men to turn a turtle on
its back.
     Then the poor crea
ture cannot help itself in
the least.                                       Tl'RTLE-nONTINn.
     The little turtles, when they come out of the egg, have a great           many
enemies.
     The sea-birds stoop down upon them, and the wild beasts devour them
without mercy.         And when they get into the sea, there are sharks and
other fierce fishes waiting for them.
     Happily, the turtle lays several hundreds of eggs in the course of the
summer.        Or else turtle soup would not be so easy to procure as it is.
     I   told you that the sucking-fish      was sometimes      used  to catch   the
turtle.
     The men in the boat have let it down by a rope.              It has fixed itself
on the under side       of the turtle, and the hunter is drawing them both up
together.

274                                  THE POLAR BEAR.
                                  THE POLAR BEAR.
The island of Spitzbergen          is,   in reality, a cluster of islands joined together
by the solid ice.
      This   is   the home of the Polar bear.            Here he prowls about in search of
prey.    Sometimes he will float away upon a block of ice, until he gets as
far south as Iceland or Norway.
      But this     is   about the worst thing he can do.
                                 SAILORS ATTACEED   BY   POLAR BEARS.
      People have no liking for bears as visitors.                      They no sooner hear that
one has landed, than they           hurry down to the beach with sticks, and all
sorts  of weapons, and kill him.
      He had better have kept at home, in the far north.
      The bear can live on the sea, as well as on the land.                    He can swim like
a   fish, and dive, and paddle about, and be quite at his ease.

                                             THE POLAR BEAR.                                       275
        His feet are half-webbed — that              is,   the toes are       partly joined together.
And this makes him able to swim                    so     well.
        On land, he can run very fast indeed.                         The soles of his feet have a
lining,      if
              I        may call   it  of soft fleece, so that he can tread firmly on the
                                       so,
ice,    and   is       never in danger of slipping.
        He raises himself on his hind             legs,    and runs along, looking very formid
able indeed.                                  «
        It   is   not always possible to see the bear until you are close to him.
        He has         a   soft
and         beautiful
coat    of yellowish
white fur.              It   is
very much               like
the ice, and can
hardly be distin
guished from it.
        The            bear's
coat    is   rather in
his favour when
he     wants to catch
his prey.               And
be     is    very cun

along on the ice

tends to be asleep.
        He will watch and wait for hours, till he finds a chance of springing on
his victim.
        There are several animals that serve him for food.

276                             THE BEAR AND HER CUBS.
      The pretty blue foxes come in the summer, and so do the reindeer.
      And there are seals and walruses in the water, and plenty                        of
fishes.
      So the bear gets enough to eat, for one part of the year at least.
      When a man is taken by surprise, and finds himself at the mercy of
the bear,    it is not   easy to escape.
      The man in the picture is a hunter.           You   see he has  his weapons with
him.      He is lying on the ground, as        if  he were dead.     But, in reality, he
is  trying to deceive the bear.
      The bear will take it for granted that his prey is dead, and he will
snuff about him in a very leisurely manner.
      The hunter is all the time on the watch, and presently, when he sees
the    bear   in a favourable position, he will jump up, and run his weapon
through him.
      This is the only chance the hunter has for his life.             And very likely
he   has practised the same trick before.
      The sailors call the bear the " Man in the White Cloak."
                           THE BEAR AND HER CUBS.
1  have a little more to tell you about the bear.
      He roams about all the winter on the ice.             But this kind of life would
not suit his partner, the mother bear.
      She has her little cubs to bring up, and there must be some kind of
shelter found for them.
      All round is    ice and snow.       Where, then, can she find a shelter     ?
      She makes one herself;          for Instinct,  as we have     seen  all along, is a
wonderful guide.
      She goes to some rock, and scoops out a hole           in the snow, close by the
side   of the rock  ;   here the  little cubs are born.
      It  is just large enough to hold her and the cubs.              The snow falling
from above       makes    a  kind of roof.      And   as she breathes,   the warmth of

her breath keeps a little thawed space in the snow.      A breathing hole, one
might call it.
     In this   small, cramped  space, the bear and her young    ones pass the
winter.      As the young ones grow larger,       the warmth   of their bodies
increases the hole, so that they contrive to have room enough.

      When    spring conies, their mother takes them out, and lets them have
 their liberty.
      But how does the mother bear obtain food     ?
      She does not eat in the winter, strange as it may seem.
      In  the autumn she ate enormously, and chose     the most fattening diet.
                                                                                S

278                                THE SEAL.
She became as fat as possible,   and laid in a store of food to last during the
months of seclusion in her snow cave.
     Of course, when she emerges, she is      thin and hungry enough.    And it
is not at all pleasant to meet  with her and her cubs.
                            BEAR MOURNING OVER HER Cl'BS.
     She is ready to attack anything or anybody.
     Her love for her cubs is very strong indeed.
     In the picture, you see that the poor little cubs have been shot, and
the mother is mourning over them.
                                  THE SEAL.
The seal is another animal found in the icy seas.
     The poor, half-starved inhabitants of those dreary regions regard him as
their greatest blessing.

                                       THE SEAL.                                  279
     He affords them both food and light.
     In the huts of the Esquimaux and the Greenlander there are numbers
of oil lamps.    All through the long dark winter, these lamps give light and
warmth.
     They are as simple as possible.          A few wicks floating in a vessel of
oil.   That is the lain]).

                                    THE CRESTED SEAL.
     The oil comes from       the seal.   When no seals have been caught,       the
stock of oil gets very low.       Then there is danger of a famine.     It  is as  if
the harvest were to fail     in England.
     But one happy morning there is an outcry on the beach.       The women and
children run down to see.        A  great seal is being dragged along in triumph.
                                                                                      f

 280                                       THE SEAL.
      What rejoicings there are         !   The creature is a huge size.      His large fat
 body affords abundance         of food.       The oil soon fills the lamps, and makes
 them burn merrily.
      In  fact, all is feasting and content.
      We have no great fancy for seal's flesh.            It  is not to our taste.      But
 we have beef and mutton.             The poor Greenlander and the Esquimaux have
 neither.
      Nature has given to a large number of animals the power of living in
 two worlds.
     The world of the land, and the world of the sea.
     The seal is one of these.            But he is not very swift in his movements
                                                                on land.

     It   is not very easy for the seal to waddle along on his fin-like feet.
 When he is in the water he can swim about nimbly enough.                       But he has
to get his air food from the atmosphere.                 So that he makes little holes
in the ice, and breathes through them.                 But this habit often costs him
his life.

                                 THE SEAL.                                 281
     A    man, muffled       up
in furs, has been sitting
hour after hour on the
ice,  watching       for him.
He has       a    long sharp
spear  ;    and when        the
seal has made his hole,
and has only one thin
layer of ice to break
through,      down       comes
the      spear      into     his
body.
     If     the     man     had
made      the   least   sound,
the    seal    would      have
 heard    him, and would
have gone away.
     But the man knew
better.      He knew that
the lamps at home were
going out for want of
oil ; and that his wife
had no       seal's   flesh   in
her larder.

     The poor seal has another enemy to contend with besides the hunter.
     The Polar bear is always prowling about looking for seals.         He will
 watch at their holes, as the hunter did, or else try to surprise them when
 they lie asleep on the ice.
     The seal in the picture was fast asleep, and without any fear of danger.
The bear came stealthily up ; and though the poor seal plunged at once

into the sea, he was too late to save his life.            The bear, as you see, has
seized   him by one of his paws,            and  will drag him     out,   and make    a
meal   of him.

There    was a time when many strange             stories were told of mermaids and
mermen.
     The sailors declared that they saw a creature, now and then, appearing
above the sea.      It   had a head    like a woman, and a body like a fish.
                                                                        This wonderful

few   of his family are left.      Indeed, the race is becoming extinct.
     The dugong lives in the warm Tropical seas, and is more than twenty
feet long.
     The people, on the coasts where he is found, think his flesh very good
to eat, and say that it tastes like ham.
     Indeed, travellers declare that no better meat is to be had.
     Besides    the    flesh,  you    may    think what a quantity of oil must
come from      such  a vast body.         And the oil is used both for lamps and
for cookery.
     The mother dugong carries her young one between her fore-paws.                 She
clasps  it to her  breast   ; and as her round head appears above the water, she
looks in the distance a little like a woman.
     And, no doubt, it was a dugong with her little one that the sailors saw,
and mistook for a mermaid.
     The dugong,     I   must tell you, forms a link between the seals and the
whales.

    There is a huge kind of seal, called the elephant seal, that is found in
the dreary regions            of the South Pole.
    Vessels go out to hunt these great creatures                    for the sake of the oil and
the skin.
    The elephant seal is so gentle that he will let the sailors actually knock
him down.
    The only fierceness            ever shown is when the mother seal has her                little
one taken away.
    Then she has been known to come behind a sailor, get his head into
her mouth, and bite him with her sharp teeth till she had nearly killed
him.
    The elephant seal is so fat and loaded with blubber that he can hardly
walk on land.
       He is obliged to rest every few minutes, so that he seldom ventures far
from the sea.            If   the sun is hot, he is very much distressed,         and   tries to
scoop up the sand and              throw it over his body, till he has made a kind of
covering.
       The skin has no fur upon            it,   so that   it   can only be used as leather for
harness.          But the oil    is   very excellent indeed, and burns without any dis
agreeable smell.
       The seal-skin, so much used for cloaks and jackets, comes from the South
Seas.      There are some islands, called the South Shetland Islands, where the
fur seal lives.
     He has long gray hair, that has to be all pulled out.   Under the hair,
there     thick soft fur of a fine yellow-brown, and so valuable that
         is   a                                                        costs            it

        When the hunters first went to these islands, the seals were quite tame,
                            of the way.
and never attempted to get out
   They would even look on, while their companions were being killed.
But now they have learned     little wisdom, and take care to climb
                                           a
to the top of        a   rock or steep place, where they can throw themselves                 into
the sea
        The hunters have been foolish enough to kill so many seals that the

number is thinned.    The moment the seals came in sight they were killed,
for the sake of their skins.    And the poor little    ones, being left without
their mothers, often died as well.
     The proper name of the fur seal is the otary.
                             IHfc: OTARY, OB FUR SEAL.
    The otary has an external ear, which distinguishes him from the rest of
the seals.
    The whole tribe can, however, hear perfectly well both above and under
the water.

    There is another species of seal called the sea-lion.    He has long shaggy
hair falling down his neck, a little like the mane of a lion.

    The sea-lions are met with both in the Northern         and in the Southern
Seas.
    They live in great hordes, and are formidable-looking          creatures,   but as
harmless   as the other seals.

very clumsy and awkward           in his movements.   That   is,

unwieldy body up the rocks, or up some block of ice.
    And he can fight with them against the fierce Polar bear.
     In spite of this, the bear sometimes gets the mastery, and kills the
walrus by giving him one of his bear's hugs.
    Sometimes    the dead body   of a walrus is cast ashore, and then there is
great excitement among the sea-birds      and animals.
    The sea-birds come whirling round and scream with delight.           The foxes
and the bears scent   it from afar ; but the foxes dare not approach until the
bears are satisfied.   So they stand round       barking with impatience.

       If   man were present,
he would dispute the prize.
For the walrus is a trea
sure     to   the   dwellers on
those desolate shores.        His
flesh     forms an article of
food,     and    is  keenly    re
lished.       His skin is    used
for leather, and the ivory

       In   spite   of his great

                           HOW THE WHALE BREATHES.
There       is one huge     animal in the Arctic Seas that draws numbers of ships
 thither in search of him.
       I  mean the whale.
       There are several kinds of whales, and some are found in the Southern
as   well as in the Northern Seas.         But the whale      I  am speaking   of is the
 Greenland whale, and lives up in the cold and ice of the Frozen Zone.
       His body is of value because of the quantity of oil which can be obtained
 from it.       And though the whale-fishery is a most dangerous undertaking,
 many persons are found willing to engage in it.
       The whale lives in the sea, and to all appearance             has  the habits of a
 fish.

288                      JIOW THE WHALE EUEATHES.
     Let us examine him rather more closely.
     He has warm blood, as you and I have.          The mother whale gives suck
to her young one.     And both of them breathe         air from the atmosphere.
Therefore the whale takes    a place amongst the animals.
                               THK uREENLAND WHAUE.
    Now, here is a curious fact at the very beginning.
    The whale can keep under water for an hour at a time, or even two
hours.
    But this is not his usual practice.

                                   MORE ABOUT THE WHALE.                                              289
     Every ten minutes, or quarter of an hour, he comes up to breathe.                                He
comes up, in fact, to get oxygen into his blood.
     What keeps the whale alive during the time he is under water                         ?
     I   will tell you.
     He has a reservoir of blood which has had its share of oxygen, and is
kept ready for use.
    This reservoir, if I may call it so, consists of a number of arteries, or
vessels, which contain the blood that has been mixed with oxygen.
     They spread over the inside of the chest, and also of the ribs and the
spine.  They are found even within the skull.
    When the whale is a long time under water, and cannot get any oxygen
from the atmosphere, he falls back on this store within.
      The blood can thus continue its course without becoming exhausted.
    When he does rise to the surface, which he is obliged to do at last,
then the whole of the blood receives a supply.
      Part goes its way through the body, and the rest is received                        into the
reservoir to be ready for use.
      Can any arrangement be more suited to the case                   !
                                MORE ABOUT THE WHALE.
I   have another fact to tell you about the whale's breathing.
      The tube called the windpipe               is not placed   as our windpipe              is.      It
does not open into the mouth.               It   opens at the top      of the head.
   There is a lump where it opens.    And the whale can keep his whole
body under water except just this lump.
      And there is a kind of valve or stopper to the opening of the windpipe,
which exactly fits        it,   and can keep out the water, and also resist the greatest
pressure.        Indeed, the more pressure there        is   upon   it,    the tighter   it   fits.
      The whale begins to breathe before he quite reaches the surface of the
water.         The air rushing from the windpipe, and the water together,                             are
blown up into       a   column.       Then the whale    is   said to   "spout."

      When        the whale is struck        by the harpoon,       he is   in a great     hurry and
fright. He dives down to the bottom of the sea with the utmost speed,
and even strikes the ground with his head. Indeed, it is no uncommon

thick layer of fat, which the sailors call blubber.       It is a dark motley
colour to look at, and is full of fibres, as our skin is.
    The whole skin is full of oil.      This is indeed the true riches of the
whale,      and the reason     why he is hunted.
      As far as the whale himself is concerned, the oily skin is useful for two
reasons.
      It    is very warm, and keeps up the heat of the body.                          And the oil
being lighter than the water, helps him to swim.
      I    have not finished       with the whale.
      I    must tell you of another beautiful contrivance.
      The whale, large as he          is,   does not feed on creatures        of any size.
      His throat    so narrow, that
                     is               herring could not get down it.

      He lives on jelly-fishes and minute animals.
      He opens his huge mouth and takes them in.
      But does he swallow              the mouthful        of water,       as well   as     the    crea
tures in     it?
      If    he did, his stomach would             soon be filled   with water, and have very
little food to sustain it.           There would be more water than food.

                                  THE ENEMIES OF THE WHALE.                                        2'Jl
      The whale has no teeth.               He is a very harmless creature, in spite of
his size.
    His mouth is the most curious part of him.
    From the upper jaw there are a number of plates of a horny substance.
They stand side by side, and the edges have a fringe of hair.
      The middle plate is the largest, and the plates keep getting smaller on
each side, the last being the smallest.
      The lower jaw has no plates                ;   but it is in the shape of a great spoon,
so   that the plates can go into it when the mouth is shut.
      Now, when the great mouthful    of water is taken in by the whale, it
runs out again through the plates.      But the fringes of hair keep in the
tiny living creatures which are to serve as food.
    They are, in fact, a kind of filter, for they reject the bad, and only
receive the good.
      The plates       I   have    been speaking about are the true whalebone,                     and
as   valuable in their way as the oil is in its way.
                           THE ENEMIES OF THE WHALE.
The whale       is,   as we have said,       a   very harmless creature.          If   it   were   not
so, the     mischief he might do would be great indeed.
      He has, however, enemies both in the                 sea   and on the land.
      There are some fishes that belong to the fierce and cruel family                              of
the shark.
      One    of these fishes       is   very apt to make an attack on the poor whale,
and feed upon his huge body, until its hunger has abated.
      Another shark has a long tail, nearly half                 as   long as its body.     It   seems
to take a delight in giving the whale great slaps with its tail, that sound
like the report of a gun.
      Then there      is   a   worse enemy    still — the sword-fish.
      It      with its sharp sword, and stabs the whale without mercy.
           comes
      A whale attacked by number of sword-fishes, and of sharks as well,

has been seen by the captain        of a vessel.    He declares that the water all
round was dyed with blood.
    Thus the huge size of the whale does not protect him.
    Indeed, his only resource is to dive down to the bottom of the sea,
where his enemies cannot follow him.
    But the worst foe the whale has is man.
    In spite of the dangers of the icy sea, and              the  hazard there  is in
attacking a creature    of such vast size, man is constantly warring         against
the whale.
    The supply of oil and of whalebone are a rich reward for all the risk
and trouble.
    And when    I tell you the whale-fishery will produce, in one year, seven
hundred thousand pounds, you will better understand how it is that men are
found willing to undertake it.
    The ships that go out whale-hunting            are made      very strong indeed.

                             THE ENEMIES OE THE WHALE.                                298
And they set out in the
spring, as the summer
is the only season when
there is a chance of sail
ing in those icy seas.
       When       they reach
the spot where whales
are    likely to be found,
 a   man       keeps  on  the
 watch, to spy one out.
       The       moment    he
 sees    one he calls out,
 "There she spouts!"
 Then the boats are let
 dovrn in pursuit.       This   \
 is done directly, for the
 boats are kept ready to
 start.
        The     weapon   used
  to attack the whale is
  called a harpoon.
        It   is made of iron,
  and    is a little in the
  shape     of an anchor, but
  with    a  sharp point to it.

         This is the harpoon, which has been thrown by the harpooner.
         The whale now dives into the very depths of the
                                                                  ocean.

         He carries the harpoon with him           ;   for a long line is fastened to it.
         The line is more than four thousand feet long, for there is no knowing
how deep the whale will dive.
         The line is coiled up in the boat, and runs over a pulley or windlass.
         It   runs so fast, that the friction      is apt to set the boat on fire.               And
buckets of water stand ready to be dashed over                   it,   to prevent the mischief.
         Another accident will sometimes happen.
                                        ACCIUBNT TO THE BOATS.
         If   a   sailor gets his feet entangled in the rope,      it    will   be   impossible for
him to get them free.
         His feet will      be   cut off; or he will be dragged          overboard,        and never
seen again.
    Often, too, the whale will give such  violent blow with his tail, that the
                                                       a
boat will be thrown up into the air, and the sailors tossed into the water.
    Such accidents are constantly taking place.
    After the whale has been under water for some time, he                            is   obliged   to
come up for air.

                           THE ENEMIES OF THE WHALE.                                 295
     As soon     as  he appears     the boats    are ready     with fresh harpoons and
lances.     He will dive again, but this time he cannot stay under water so
long.     He gets exhausted by repeated wounds, and after a great many
struggles he dies.      Then the men hoist a flag, and give three cheers.
     The danger is over.
     But a great deal has yet to be done.
     The vast body of the whale is brought near the vessel, and the men
get upon it.      They have iron spikes in their shoes, or else they could not
help slipping.
     They have knives and spades to cut off the thick coating of blubber.
     They cut it off in long strips, which are carried on board and cut up
into pieces.     The pieces are put into casks.
     When the whalebone has been taken out of the mouth, the huge mass
is turned adrift.      Man has no further use for it ; but the sea-birds, and the
sharks,    and the white bears have quite a feast.              Sometimes, however, the
body of the whale sinks to the bottom the moment it is turned adrift.
                         <>F7-
                                         THE RORyUAL.
     I   must tell you that there is a whale much larger than the one            I have
described.
     Its body    is sometimes    more than a hundred feet long.
      It lives in the same seas as the Greenland whale, but the whaling vessels
do not often attack it.
     It   is very swift,  and    strong,   and dangerous.        And also it has much
less blubber, and very      little whalebone.        It is called the rorqual.

 200                                THE NARWHAL.
                                 THE NARWHAL.
 There    is a very beautiful   creature  that is related to the whale, but is not
 nearly so large, or so clumsy.      Indeed, it is graceful as well as handsome.
      It is called the sea-unicorn,   or, more properly, the narwhal.
      Its skin is of a gray colour, mottled with black.      But the most curious
 thing about it is its horn.     This horn is of pure ivory, and projects from
 the head in a straight line.
                             THE NARWHAL — MALE AND FEMALE.
     It  is really nothing but a tooth.         The tooth is in a spiral form, or
twisted round and round, as you perceive.
     There is a fellow tooth within the jaw, but it does not grow out, and
lies snugly hidden.
     People have been very much puzzled to find out what use the narwhal
makes    of its horn.

                                              THE NARWHAL.                                              297
      Some        suppose that        it is useful to rake about in the mud at                  the bottom
of the     sea,   or to break through the ice, in order to breathe.
      Other people think the narwhal uses it to pierce its prey.
      At any                                 of the narwhal is of use to man.
                   rate, the long twisted horn
      It   is of hard ivory, better even than that of the elephant.
   Many years ago the horn was worth more money than it is now.
   People fancied that it was the horn of the unicorn, and believed it could
work any amount of wonders.
      The unicorn         is,   as you know,            a   fabulous creature, as much so as the
phoenix.
      In      these days the horn        is   much valued for its ivory       ;   and the sailors in     a
whaling vessel are very glad when they happen                           to meet with a narwhal.
They attack   with harpoons, as they do the whale.
                   it
   But the narwhal     not at all easy to catch.
                                 is              It swims so fast, and                                   is
so   cautious and shy, that             it    is   very seldom    a   boat can get near enough           to
do   it   any harm.
      Though       it   looks so fierce, with its long spike of           a   horn,   it   is   really very
gentle indeed.
      It   plays about in the water with its companions,                    and they amuse them
selves  with crossing their horns.
      But sometimes the horn                       is   the means     of the poor      narwhal's        de
struction,                                                                z
      When the fisherman suceeds in getting near to a shoal of these beautiful
creatures,they might perhaps escape by the rapidity of their flight. But
their horns get entangled, and so embarrass them, that some are sure
to be caught.
     Imust tell you that the narwhal keeps to the Northern Seas, and rarely
ventures out of them.
      Now and then              it   strays into the milder waters, and comes near our
coasts    ;   but this very seldom happens.

298                                   THE LIGHTHOUSE.
                                  THE LIGHTHOUSE.
There     are many unseen dangers         in the paths of the         sea.
      Besides     the   storm   and    the   tempest,   there are        other perils         to be
dreaded.
      Near the shore, often within sight of home, there will lurk rocks and
quicksands.
      If the    ship approach too near she will be lost.
      Round every coast these dangers            have to be encountered              ;    and from
earliest times      the mariner    has,   in some rude way, been warned of then
existence.
      We have heard of beacon fires which blazed                every night on some head
or promontory.   And we know that the ancient Egyptians                          had their strip
of coast studded with towers.
      The towers were landmarks by day, and served as beacons by night.
      A
      noble task has the lighthouse to perform,             as   it   stands on some lonely
rock or dangerous shore.
      When darkness hides everything else from view, its flashing light falls
upon the waves, and is seen at a great distance.
      The birds of the sea are attracted towards          it,   and come in        a     flock.
      They will even dash against the glass and break                   it,   in their eagerness
to get nearer.
      To prevent accidents of this sort,       itis   usual now to put         a   guard of wire
outside the glass.       This defends the glass, and keeps the birds at                  a   respect
ful distance.
    You will be amused to hear that at one of these lonely lighthouses the
birds are in great favour. Instead of doing harm, they act as signals.
      Numbers      of gulls perch on the lighthouse walls, and make a loud
screaming.        Their harsh voices can be heard by the sailors in some not far
distant vessel.
      When the sailors hear the gulls they know that dangers                        are at hand,
and they take care to guide the ship safely past the treacherous                         coast.

                      SEA-BIRDS ATTRACTED BY THE LIGHT FROM A LIGHTHOUSE,
     In  fact, there is no need to use the guns and the cannon as warnings.
The voices of the sea-birds answer quite as well.
     So the cannon has lain idle for years, and the guns are never loaded.
     The men in the lighthouse pet the sea-birds, and treat them with every
indulgence.      So that when off       duty the gulls walk about the little solitary
islet where the lighthouse stands, and are as tame as               if they  were pigeons.
     The most important of our English lighthouses is Eddystone.
     It is off the coast of Plymouth,         where a number of dangerous          rocks lie
hidden under water.
     When     the  tide is out they can be seen clearly.              At  other times only
the  whirling and eddying of the waves tell us where they are.
     The lighthouse is built on the highest of the rocks, and gives warning
to the vessels that go up and down the channel.
     There is a sad story connected with Eddystone.

300                                          THE LIFE-BOAT.
       A lighthouse was built upon the rock by a rich but rather whimsical
gentleman.
       His friends found fault with its construction, and warned him that it
was not safe.
    He laughed at their fears, and wished a furious gale might come and
prove how secure his lighthouse was.     Nay, he wished to sleep in the
tower himself in just such a gale.
       His presumptuous wish was                  granted.
       Soon          after    there came    a   fearful         storm,   and   all night the   waves
thundered against the lighthouse.                       It      was a niyht Ions; to be remembered
ou that part            of the coast.
    With the first streak of dawn people hurried to the beach and gazed
anxiously in the direction of the lighthouse.
       Alas      !    it was not to     be seen   !    The furious waves had overthrown             it,
and the architect had perished                  with
                                                       is it

       A       lighthouse on a safer plan                      now constructed at Eddystone, and
night after night its friendly lantern throws a radiance on the waters.
    But the fate of poor Winstanley and his ill-omened tower will not be
soon forgotten.
                                         THE LIFE-BOAT.
In    spite of the beacon fire and the friendly lighthouse, terrible disasters will
occur around the coast,
       The wintry winds will rise higher and higher, until there blows a furi
ous gale.
       If the         gale comes from the sea direct              towards the land, havoc will be
made among the shipping.
       Vessels         will   be   driven into the very dangers they have been striving to
avoid.
    They will be driven on shore, or on some treacherous bar of sand or                         ;
the bottom of the ship will grate upon some rock, and the cry of " All                              is
           "

      "They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great
waters ; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.
For    he commandeth,       and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the
waves thereof.        They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the
depths ; their soul is melted because of trouble.        They reel to and fro, and
stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end."
     The sailors on the beach view from afar the struggling             and doomed
vessel.
     Amid the tumult and noise of the waves, with the            sea running moun
tains high and the gale shrieking wildly, they hasten to succour those in
distress.
     They bring out their life-boat.
     It   is not constructed like any other craft that sails on the waters.        It
has been     built for one single purpose — to save life.
      And this is why it is called the life-boat.
     Any other boat could not live       a moment in a sea      like this.   But the
life-boat can ride over the surging billows.
      It  is so contrived that it cannot be upset.    It  is a friend in need — one
of the most successful attempts of human skill and benevolence.
      In the picture, a distressing scene is taking place.
      The poor ship is reeling and tossing in the grasp of the storm.            She
has struck upon a rock, and very soon will be broken to pieces.
      The wretched crew have been driven from one refuge to another.             The
hold of the vessel is full of water.       The waves wash over the deck and
sweep every thing away.
      The men are clinging to the masts and to the shrouds, and finding what
frail shelter they can.       Their cries of anguish pierce the skies.      They feel
as  if their   last hour were come.
      Some     of them are even struggling in the waves.
      It is a frightful picture. There is but one gleam of brightness in it.
      Do you see the life-boat gallantly ploughing its way towards the doomed
vessel   ?
      The     brave  sailors  pull  at the oars  with   all their    might.    They

encourage    each   other.     They     hold    out their      hands    to  the   struggling,
drowning crew.
     Very soon, they will have snatched              some     of them from the jaws of
death.
     The men are exhausted,        and almost dying with cold and fatigue.                But
they will be earned back to land, and placed in safety.                    Then once more
the life-boat  will make its perilous way to the             ship.
     While there is one of the crew          remaining — ere       the ship settles down in
the waters and is no      more    seen — the sailors         will ply their task of mercy.
The life-boat will go out to the rescue.
     How full of hardships and of dangers is the life of the mariner                 !
     It is well that, in our public worship, we do not forget to pray for those
at sea.
                         "0  Christ, whose voice the waters heard,
                           And hushed their raging at thy word,
                           Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
                           And calm amidst its rage didst sleep,
                           Oh, hear us when we cry to thee
                                                           "
                           For those in peril on the sea !
