    The following      pages    are reprinted from
 the   Comhill     Magazine.        The    additional
 matter    is confined     to  Notes    at  the   end
 of the chapters,    on points where criticism,
 and the advance of science, have caused me
to   qualify,   or retract,     certain   statements
 made in the text.
   It was my original       intention to have con
tinued these essays, so as to touch on Life
in the garden, the forest, and the sea.           But
circumstances having prevented           the execu
tion of that project, and the publishers con
sidering that the part already executed may
possibly not be unacceptable,        I have    agreed
to their proposal for its republication.

Come     with me, and lovingly study Nature, as she
breathes,      palpitates,     and    works        under    myriad
forms     of Life — forms         unseen,      unsuspected,      or
unheeded by the mass               of ordinary         men.    Our
course may be through            park and meadow, garden
and lane,       over    the swelling hills           and spacious
heaths,      beside      the   running        and      sequestered
streams, along the tawny coast, out on the dark
and dangerous reefs, or under dripping caves and
slippery ledges.          It matters little where we go:

 everywhere —in the air above, the earth beneath,
and waters under the earth — we are surrounded
with Life.       Avert the eyes awhile from our human
world, with its ceaseless anxieties, its noble sor
row, poignant,         yet sublime,     of conscious imper
fection aspiring to higher states, and contemplate
the   calmer      activities   of that other world          with
which we are so mysteriously               related.    It  is an
exclusive philosophy which declares —
            " The proper study of mankind is man ; "
and   if it   is going too far to say, as some enthu
siastic students seem to think, that
            "  The proper study of mankind is cells;"
I would suggest that,         if man is the noblest study,
yet under       the noblest there are other problems
which demand our care.               Man himself is imper
fectly known, because the laws of universal Life
are imperfectly known.            His Life forms but one
grand illustration of Biology — the science of Life.*
He forms but the apex of the animal world.
   * The needful    term Biology (from bios, life, and logos, dis
course) is  now   becoming   generally adopted in England, as in
Germany.     It embraces all the separate sciences of Botany,
Zoology, Comparative Anatomy, and Physiology.

    Our studies in these pages will be of Life, and
chiefly of those minuter, or obscurer forms, which
seldom attract attention.              In  the air we breathe,
in the water       we    drink, in the earth we tread on,
Life is everywhere.              Nature lives :      every pore
is bursting with Life          ; every death is only a new
birth, every grave a cradle.             And of this   we know
so   little, think so little       !    Around us, above us,
beneath us, the great mystic drama of creation
is being enacted,          and we will not even consent
to be spectators.            Unless animals       are  obviously
useful,      or obviously hurtful to us, we disregard
them.        Yet they      are not     alien,   but akin.    The
Life that        stirs    within     us,   stirs within    them.
We are all        " parts     of one transcendent       whole."
 The scales fall from our eyes when we think of
this   ;  it is  as    if  a new sense         had been   vouch
 safed     to us   ;  and we      learn     to look at Nature
with a more intimate and personal love.
    Life everywhere        !  The air is crowded with birds
—beautiful,       tender, intelligent birds, to whom life
is a song and a thrilling anxiety, the anxiety of
 love.      The air is swarming with insects —those

 little animated miracles.          The waters are peopled
 with innumerable        forms, from the animalcule, so
 small that one hundred and fifty millions of them
 would not weigh a grain, to the whale, so large
that    it   seems    an    island as it sleeps upon the
waves*       The bed of the seas is alive with polypes,
crabs,     star-fishes,    and with      myriads        of   shell-
animalcules.        The rugged face of rocks is scarred
by the silent boring of soft creatures            ;   and black
ened     with     countless      mussels,    barnacles,        and
limpets.
    Life everywhere       !   on the earth, in the earth,
crawling, creeping,          burrowing, boring,          leaping,
running.       If  the sequestered     coolness of the wood
tempt us to saunter into its chequered shade, we
are saluted by the murmurous             din of insects, the
twitter of birds, the scrambling of squirrels, the
startled     rush of unseen beasts,          all telling how
populous      is this seeming solitude.           If   we pause
before     a tree, or     shrub,     or plant,     our     cursory
and half-abstracted           glance   detects    a    colony    of
various inhabitants.           We pluck     a  flower, and in
its bosom we see many              a  charming      insect busy

at   its appointed            labour.     We pick up             a     fallen
leaf, and      if   nothing living is visible on                 it,   there
is   probably       the trace of an insect               larva hidden
in its tissue,          and      awaiting .there         development.
The drop of dew upon this leaf may possibly
contain       its animals,         visible    under        the       micro
scope.        This     same      microscope         reveals that the
blood-rain          suddenly       appearing        on     bread,         and
awakening           superstitious        terrors,   is     nothing but
a    collection      of minute           animals     (Monas prodi-
giosa)   ;   and that the vast tracts                of snow which
are reddened           in   a   single night, owe their colour
to the marvellous               rapidity in reproduction                 of   a
minute        plant (Protococcus             nivalis).       The very
mould        which covers         our cheese,        our bread, our
jam, or our ink, and disfigures                     our damp           wTalls,
is   nothing but       a    collection    of plants.       The many-
coloured fire which sparkles on the surface of                                a
summer sea at night, as the vessel ploughs                                her
way, or       which drips          from the oars in lines of
jewelled      light,    is   produced by millions            of minute
animals.
     Nor does the vast procession                    end    here.         Our

very     mother-earth      is    formed      of the debris     of
life.    Plants and animals which hare been, build
up its solid fabric*            We dig downwards, thou
sands of feet below the surface, and discover with
surprise the skeletons of strange, uncouth animals,
which roamed the fens and                   struggled   through
the    woods,     before     man     was.     Our    surprise  is
heightened       when we learn that the very quarry
itself    is mainly composed of the skeletons                  of
microscopic        animals    ;   the    flints    which    grate
beneath the carriage wheels are but the remains
of countless skeletons.            The Apennines and Cor
dilleras, the chalk cliffs so dear to homeward-
nearing eyes — these are the pyramids                 of bygone
generations       of atomies.         Ages     ago, these tiny
architects      secreted    the    tiny shells,     which   were
their palaces      ;  from    the    ruins of these      palaces
we    build our Parthenons, our                St. Peters, and
our Louvres.          So revolves the luminous orb             of
Life   !    Generations      follow generations       ; and the

Present becomes the matrix of the Future,                        as
the Past was          of the Present        : the Life     of one
epoch forming the prelude to a higher Life.
   When we have thus ranged air, earth, and water,
finding everywhere a prodigality of living forms,
visible and invisible, it might seem as            if the survey
were complete.         And yet it is not so.        Life cradles
within Life.          The bodies        of animals     are little
worlds, having their own animals                and plants.      A
well known Frenchman                  has published      a   thick
octavo     volume      devoted to the classification           and
description      of   " The     plants which grow on Men
                      " *
and      Animals    ;         and      many     Germans       have
described the immense              variety of animals       which
grow on and in men and animals ; so that science
can   now boast of a parasitic              Flora and Fauna.
In  the fluids and tissues, in the eye, in the liver,
in the stomach, in the brain, in the muscles,                   are
found parasites;          and these parasites have often
their parasites living in them            !
    We have thus taken              a  bird's-eye   view of the

field in which we may labour.                    It   is truly inex
haustible.        We may begin where                  we please, we
shall never come to an end;                     our curiosity will
never slacken.
                              " And whosoe'er in youth
           Has thro' ambition of his soul given way
           To such desires, and grasp'd at such delights,
           Shall feel congenial stirrings, late and long."
As     a   beginning,          get    a    microscope.          If    you
cannot      borrow,      boldly buy one.             Few purchases
will yield you          so much pleasure         ;    and while you
are    about      it,   do,   if    possible,   get     a    good one.
Spend      as     little money as you can on accessory
apparatus and expensive fittings, but get                       a    good

work by daylight, seldom or never                       by   lamplight   ;
and keep the unoccupied                   eye open.         With these
precautions you may work daily for hours without
serious fatigue to the eye.

    This   dead    frog,      for    example,    that       has already

 awaiting the removal of its spinal cord, will serve

 us as a text from which profitable lessons may be
 drawn.    We snip out a portion        of its digestive
 tube, which from its emptiness      seems to promise
little ; but a drop of the liquid we find in it is
placed on a glass slide, covered with a small piece
of very thin glass, and brought under the micro
scope.    Now look.   There are several things which
might occupy your attention     ;  but disregard them

largest   of the Infusoria, and is named Opalina.
When     I call this an Infusorium    I   am using the
language of text-books; but there seems to be a
growing belief among zoologists that the Opalina
is not an Infusorium,     but the infantile condition
of some worm (Distoma ?).        However, it will not
 grow into a mature worm as long as it inhabits
the frog;    it waits till some pike, or bird, has
devoured the frog, and then, in the stomach of its
new captor, it will develop into its mature form          :
then, and not till then.        This surprises       you?
And well it may; but thereby hangs         a tale,   which
to unfold — for the present, however, it must be
postponed,    because  the Opalina itself      needs    all
our notice.
    Observe how transparent     it is, and with what
easy, undulating grace     it swims about; yet this
 swimmer    has no arms, no legs, no tail, no back
 bone to serve as a fulcrum to moving muscles             :
nay, it has     no  muscles   to move with.         'Tis  a
 creature of the most absolute abnegations         :  sans
 eyes,  sans teeth, sans everything    ;
                                         — no, not    sans
 everything,   for as we    look   attentively    we    see

certain currents produced        in the liquid, and on
applying a higher magnifying power we detect
how these currents        are  produced.       All  over the
surface of the Opalina       there are delicate hairs, in
incessant   vibration  :   these are the      cilia*    They
lash the water, and the animal is propelled                by
their strokes, as a galley by its hundred oars.
This is your first sight of that          " ciliary action

of which you have so often read, and which you
will henceforth find performing some important
service in almost        every animal        you    examine.
Sometimes     the cilia act as instruments of loco
motion   ; sometimes as instruments of respiration,
by continually renewing the           current     of water   ;
sometimes as the means of drawing               in food — for
which purpose they surround the mouth, and by
their incessant action produce a small whirlpool
into which the food is sucked.              An example of
this is seen in the Vorticella (Fig. 2).
   Having studied the action of these cilia in micro
scopic animals, you will be prepared to understand

 cilia ;  which may be observed by following              the
 directions of Professor       Sharpey,   to whom science

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                    13
is indebted for      a   very exhaustive     description   of
these organs.      "  To see them in motion, a portion
of the ciliated mucous membrane may be taken
from    a  recently-killed quadruped.         The piece of
membrane is to be folded with its free, or ciliated,
surface outwards, placed on a slip of glass, with a
little water or serum of blood, and covered with
thin glass or mica.        When it is now viewed with
a power      of 200 diameters,       or upwards,      a very
obvious agitation      will  be perceived on the edge      of
the fold,     and this appearance is caused          by the
moving cilia with which the surface of the mem
brane is covered.         Being set close together, and
moving simultaneously         or in quick succession, the
cilia,   when    in brisk     action,   give   rise  to the
appearance of a bright transparent            fringe along
the    fold of the membrane,          agitated by such a
rapid and incessant motion that the single threads
which      compose     it cannot    be   perceived.      The
motion here meant is that of the cilia themselves           ;
but they also set in motion          the adjoining fluid,
driving it along the ciliated surface, as is indi
cated by the agitation        of any little particles that

14              STUDIES IN ANIMAL LITE.
may     accidentally      float   in it.    The fact of the
conveyance of fluids and other matters along the
ciliated surface, as well as the direction in which
they are impelled,         may also be made manifest by
immersing the membrane in fluid, and dropping
on it some         finely-pulverized     substance   (such as
charcoal in fine powder), which will be slowly but
steadily      carried   along    in a constant and deter
minate direction."*
    It is an interesting fact, that while the direction
in which the cilia propel fluids and particles is
generally      towards the interior of the organism,
it is   sometimes reversed ; and, instead of beating
the particles inwards,          the cilia energetically   beat
them back,       if they   attempt to enter.    Fatal results
would ensue        if this  were not so.     Our air-passages
 would no longer protect the lungs from particles
 of sand, coal-dust,         and filings, flying about the
 atmosphere ; on the contrary,             the lashing hairs
 which cover the surface of these passages would

 catch up every particle,     and drive it onwards into
the lungs.        Fortunately for us, the direction of
the   cilia is reversed, and they act as vigilant
janitors, driving back all vagrant particles with
a   stern   "  No admittance — even on                     "

In   vain    does   the whirlwind      dash a column      of
 dust in our faces — in vain does the air, darkened
with coal-dust, impetuously rush up the nostrils            :
the   air is allowed      to pass   on, but the dust is
inexorably     driven   back.     Were it not so,      how
could miners,       millers, iron-workers, and all the
modern      Tubal     Cains   contrive   to live   in their
loaded atmospheres ?        In  a week  their lungs would
be choked up.
   Perhaps you will tell me that this is the case          :
that manufacturers        of iron and steel are very
subject    to   consumption    ;   and   that   there is a
peculiar     discoloration    of the lungs      which has
often been      observed    in   coal miners,     examined
after death.
   Not being      a physician,    and   not   intending to
trouble you with medical questions,         I must   never
theless    place   before    you   three   considerations,

  16            STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
  which will show how questionable this notion is.
  First,   although    consumption      may be       frequent
  among     the  Sheffield   workmen,     the    cause     may
 perhaps be sought less in their breathing             filings,
 than in the sedentary and unwholesome                confine
  ment incidental to their occupation.          Miners and
 coal-heavers are not generally troubled with con
 sumption.        Moreover,    if  the filings     were     the
 cause,    all the artisans     would    suffer,    when     all
 breathe the same        atmosphere.      Secondly,      while
 it is true that discoloured        lungs have been ob
 served in some miners,        it has not   been    observed
 in all, or in many    ;  whereas, it has been observed
in men not miners, not exposed to any unusual
amount       of coal-dust.     Thirdly, and most con
clusively,    experiment    has   shown    that    the coal-
dust     cannot   penetrate    to   the lungs.         Claude
Bernard, the brilliant experimenter,          tied a blad
der, containing     a quantity    of powdered charcoal,
to the muzzle of a rabbit.        Whenever the animal
breathed, the powder within the bladder was seen
to be agitated.      Except during feeding time, the
bladder      was  kept    constantly   on,   so   that     the

              STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                            17
animal     breathed    only this dusty         air.       If    the
powder could have escaped            the vigilance         of the
cilia, and got into the lungs,             this was a good
occasion.      But when the rabbit           was    killed and
opened, many days         afterwards, no powder what
ever was found       in the lungs, or bronchial tubes              ;
several patches were collected about the nostrils
and throat    ;  but the cilia had acted        as a    strainer,    -
keeping all particles from the air tubes.*
    The swimming apparatus of the Opalina has led
us far away from the little animal, who has been
feeding while we have been discussing.                     At the
mention of feeding, you naturally look for the food
that is eaten,      the mouth and stomach that eat.
But   I hinted just now that this ethereal creature
dispenses     with a stomach, as too gross for its
nature   ;  and of course, by a similar refinement,
dispenses with a mouth.          Indeed, it has no organs
whatever, except the cilia just spoken                of.      The
same is true     of several of the Infusoria          ;   for you
must know that naturalists            no longer      recognize

the complex organization which Ehrenberg fancied
he had detected       in these microscopic beings.           If
it pains you to relinquish the piquant notion of              a
microscopic     animalcule    having    a   structure    equal
in complexity      to that  of the elephant, there will
be ample compensation          in the notion which re
places it — the notion of an ascending complexity
of animal organisms, rising from the structureless
amceba to the complex frame          of   a  mammal.        On
a   future  occasion     we  shall   see    that,   great   as
Ehrenberg's services have been, his interpreta
tions   of what he saw have           one     by one      been
replaced by truer notions.        His immense class of
Infusoria    has     been,  and    is   constantly      being,
diminished    ;  many of his animals turn out to be
plants   ; many of them larvae of worms           ; and some
 of them belong to the same divisions of the animal
kingdom     as the oyster     and the shrimp         : that is
to say, they range with the Molluscs and Crus
taceans.     In   these latter,    of course, there is a
 complex    organization ; but      in the Infusoria, as
 now    understood,     the  organization      is extremely
 simple.    No one now believes the clear spaces

visible   in their     substance to be         stomachs,      as
Ehrenberg believed       ;   and the idea of the Poly-
gastrica, or many-stomached           Infusoria, is aban
doned.      No one believes the coloured specs                to
be eyes ;     because,   not to mention         the difficulty
of conceiving       eyes   where   there     is no nervous
system, it has been found that even the spores
of some plants have these coloured specs                 ;  and
they are assuredly not eyes.          If,  then, we exclude
the highly-organized Rotifer a, or
                                              "  Wheel Ani
malcules," we may say that all Infusoria, whether
they be the young of worms             or not, are of very
                           *
simple organization.
    And this leads us to consider what biologists
mean by an organ : it is a particular               portion of
the body set apart for the performance                of some
particular     duty.    The whole process of develop
ment consists in this
                              " setting   apart

                                                        special
purposes.        The starting-point of Life is a single
 cell — that is to say, a microscopic sac, filled with
 liquid   and     granules,    and   having      within    it   a
 nucleus,    or smaller sac.       Paley has somewhere
 remarked,      that in the early stages,         there is no

   difference discernible between a frog and a philo
  sopher.      It is very true     ;   truer than he conceived.
  In   the earliest stage        of all, both the Batrachian
  and the Philosopher are nothing but single cells                     ;
  although the one cell will develop into an Aris
  totle   or a Newton,         and the        other  will     get   no
  higher than the cold,              damp,      croaking      animal
 which boys will           pelt,     anatomists     dissect,      and
 Frenchmen eat.             From the starting-point of                a
 single    cell,   this   is   the course taken         :   the cell
 divides itself into tw©, the two become                   four, the
 four eight,       and so on,         till  a   mass of cells is
 formed,     not    unlike      the     shape of     a mulberry.
 This mulberry-mass             then becomes         a    sac,  with
 double envelopes, or walls           :  the inner wall, turned
 towards the yelk,          or food, becomes          the assimi
 lating surface       for    the whole ;        the   outer     wall,
turned towards the surrounding medium, becomes
the     surface    which     is to bring frog and philo
sopher into contact and relation with the external
world — the Non-Ego, as the philosopher, in after
life, will call it.           Here we        perceive      the first

surface, which has little                      to do with the external
world     ;   and a sensitive,                contractile surface, which
has little to do with the preparation                             and trans
port of food.               The embryo is no longer a mass
of similar cells            ;    it is already      become        dissimilar,
different, as respects its inner and outer envelope.
But these envelopes                     are at present      uniform         ;    one
part of each               is exactly like the rest.                   Let us,
therefore, follow the history of Development, and
we      shall      find         that     the    inner      wall       gradually

has been no setting apart of any portion of the
body for special purposes, but that all parts serve
all purposes indiscriminately.
   Here is our        Opalina,      for   example,      without
mouth, or stomach, or any other organ.                  It is an
assimilating surface in every part           ;  in every part
a breathing,     sensitive surface.         Living on liquid
food, it does      not need a mouth            to seize, or a
stomach to      digest,   such     food.      The liquid,     or
gas,   passes   through the Opalina's           delicate skin,
by   a  'process     which    is    called    enclosmosis   ;  it
there serves as food ;         and the refuse passes out
again     by a    similar    process,      called   exosmosis*
This is the way in which many animals and all
plants    are  nourished.       The cell at the end of          a
rootlet, which the plant sends burrowing through
the earth, has no mouth to seize, no open pores
to admit the liquid which it needs ; nevertheless
the liquid passes into the cell, through its delicate
cell-wall, and passes from this cell to other cells,
upwards     from    the rootlet      to  the bud.      It  is in
this way, also, that the             Opalina     feeds  :  it is
all-mouth,     no-mouth    ;     all-stomach,      no-stomach.

24            STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
Every part of its body performs             the functions
which in more complex animals              are performed
by organs specially set apart.          It  feeds  without
mouth,    breathes without lungs,       and moves    with
out muscles.
   The Opalina, as     I said, is  a parasite.  It  may be
found in various animals,         and almost     always in
the frog.     You will, perhaps, ask why it         should,
be considered     a parasite;    why may it not have
been    swallowed by the frog in a gulp of water?
Certainly, nothing would have been easier.             But
to remove your doubts,         and to show that since
the Opalina is always found in one organ, we may
conclude that organ to be its natural habitat        : and
further research shows that each organ has its
 parasite.    I open  the skull of this frog, and care
 fully remove a drop of the liquid found inside,
 which, on being brought under the microscope,
 we   shall most probably find containing       some   ani
 malcules, especially those named Monads.            These
 were   not swallowed.      They live in the cerebro
 spinal fluid, as the Opalina lives in the digestive
 tube.     Thus,   if  we  extend our researches,       we

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                    25
 shall find that various organs have their various
parasites.
    Here, for instance,      is a parasitic worm from
the   frog's   bladder.     Place it under the micro -

called Polystomum — many-mouthed,             or, more pro
perly,   many-suckered.        You    are   looking at the
under    side,   and   will  observe     six large suckers
with their     starlike   clasps    (e),   and   the  horny.

instrument       (/),   with which the animal bores its
way.     At  a there is another            sucker, which serves
also as a mouth       ;  at   b  you perceive the rudiment
of a gullet, and at             cl  the   reproductive   organs.
But pay attention            to the      pretty   branchings  of
the    digestive    tube     (c),    which ramifies     through
the body like a blood-vessel.
    This arrangement of the digestive tube is found
in many animals,            and is often        mistaken   for a
 system of blood-vessels.               In   one  sense  this is
 correct ; for these branching tubes are carriers of
 nutriment, and the only circulating vessels such
 animals possess;          but the       nutriment    is chyme,
 not blood    :  these simple animals have not arrived
 at the   dignity of blood, which is a higher elabo
 ration of the food, fitted for higher organisms.
     Thus may our frog, besides its own marvels,
 afford   us many        "authentic         tidings of invisible
 things/' being itself        a  little colony of life.   Nature

the infinitely little.                 Far    as the      mightiest tele
scope       can        reach,    it    detects    worlds         in clusters,
like pebbles on the shores of Infinitude ; deep
as the microscope                 can penetrate, it detects                 Life
within Life, generation within generation                              ;   as   if
the   very Universe itself were                         not vast enough
for the energies of Life.
   That phrase, generation within generation, was
not     a   careless phrase;                 it is   exact.        Take the

will find inside           it    a    young insect nearly formed                ;
open that young insect with care, and you will
find in         it,   also, another young one, less advanced
in its development, but perfectly recognizable to
the experienced eye              ;    and beside this embryo you
will find many             eggs,      which would in time become
insects     !

development     ;  and you will also find, as lie found,
some tiny worms, which,          if  you cut them open,
will suffer three or four infusoria to           escape from
the   opening.*      In   your astonishment          you will
ask, Where is this to end ?
   The    observation    recorded by Swammerdamm,
like   so  many others      of this noble        worker,   fell
into neglect  ;   but modern investigators        have made
it the starting-point of       a   very curious       inquiry.
The worms he found within the snail are now
called Cercaria-sacs, because they contain                 the
CercaricB, once      classed as Infusoria,        and which
are now known to be the early forms              of parasitic
worms     inhabiting the digestive tube, and other
cavities of higher animals.         These Cercarice have
vigorous tails, with which they swim                  through
the water like tadpoles;        and like tadpoles, they
lose their tails in after life.          But how, think
you, did these sacs containing Cercarice get into
 the water-snails?      "By   spontaneous generation,,,

formerly said the upholders            of that hypothesis     ;
and those who condemned the hypothesis,                  were
forced to admit        they had no hetter explanation.
It   was    a mystery,     which they preferred leaving
unexplained, rather than fly to spontaneous gene
ration.      And they     were  right.    The mystery has
at length been       cleared up.*      I  will endeavour    to
bring together the scattered details,            and narrate
the curious      story.
    Under the eyelids of geese and ducks may be
constantly found a parasitic worm (of the Trema-
tode     order),   which    naturalists     have christened
Monostomum           mutabile  — Single-mouth        Change
able.       This worm brings forth living young in
the     likeness   of active     Infusoria,    which,   being
covered      with cilia, swim about in the water, as
we     saw the    Opalina swim.          Here is a portrait
of one.       (Fig. 4.)

examine this sac minutely (Fig. 5), you will ob
serve   that it has a mouth and digestive                     tube,

name imports, a mere receptacle                ;  it is   an inde

generations.        It  was    born      inside the        animal

 how is this ?          The children are by no means

                                          parent.     They are
 not    sacs,   nor in      the least resembling       sacs,  as
 you see.       (Fig. 6.)

    They have tails, and suckers, and sharp boring
 instruments, with other organs which their parent
 was without.      To look at them        you    would    as
 soon suspect a shrimp to be the progeny of an
 oyster, as these to be      the progeny       of the sac-
 animal.     And what     makes     the   paradox     more
 paradoxical   is, that not only are the Cercaria
 unlike their parent, but their parent was equally
 unlike its parent, the     embryo      of Monostomum
 (compare Fig. 4).      However,     if  we pursue     this
 family history, we shall find the genealogy rights
itself at last, and that this Cercaria mil develop
in the body of some        bird into a Monostomum
mutabile like its ancestor.       Thus the worm pro
duces an animalcule, which produces a sac-animal,
which produces        a Cercaria,    which     becomes     a
worm exactly resembling       its great-grandfather.
   One peculiarity in this history is that while the
Monostomum       produces   its young      in the    usual
way, the     two intermediate     forms     are  produced
by a process of budding,       analogous to       that ob
served   in   plants.    Plants, as      you    know,   are
reproduced in two ways, from the seed, and from

the bud.            For seed-reproduction, peculiar organs
are necessary             ;   for bud-reproduction,                      there is no
such differentiation                     needed        :       it is simply an out
growth.             The same                 is true            of many animals            :
they      also bud            like           plants,           and   produce       seeds
(eggs)      like plants.                 I    have elsewhere argued that
the two processes are essentially                                    identical ; and
that both are but special forms of growth.*                                         Not,
however, to discuss so abstruse a question here,
let us merely                 note that the Monostomum, into
which the Cercaria will develop, produces eggs,
from which young will issue                                ;    the second genera
tion is not produced from eggs, but by internal
budding       ;     the third generation is likewise budded
internally;           but          it,       on acquiring maturity, will
produce           eggs.        For this maturity,                        it   is   indis
pensable that the Cercaria                                 should     be swallowed
by     some         bird       or        animal;               only in    the      diges
tive tube can                 it    acquire        its egg-producing                con

are    many; let us witness one: —

   In   this watch-glass of water we have several
Cercarice     swimming about.             To them we add
three or four of those darting, twittering insects
which you have          seen     in every vase of pond-
water, and have learned to be the larvae, or early
forms,    of the Epliemeron.           The Cercarice cease
flapping    the   water    with      their impatient        tails,

what is called the process of encysting — that is,
of rolling themselves up into a ball, and secret

round     them    like a shell.     Thus    they      remain
snugly ensconced in the body of the insect, which

   Von Siebold's      description   of another form of
emigration      he has observed in parasites will be
read with interest.      "For    a

 "the origin of the thread worm, known           as   Filar ia
insectorwm, that lives in the cavity of the bodies
of adult and larval insects, could not be accounted
for.     Shut up within the abdominal               cavity   of
 caterpillars,   grasshoppers,   beetles, and other in
 sects, these parasites    were   supposed to originate
by spontaneous generation, under the influence of
 wet weather or from decayed         food.     Helmintho

 logists (students of parasitic worms) were obliged
 to content themselves with this explanation, since
 they were unable to find a better.            Those    who
 dissected these threadworms         and submitted them
 to a careful inspection,      could not deny the pro
 bability, since it was clear that they contained no
 trace   of  sexual    organs.    But on directing       my
attention    to these     entozoa,   I  became    aware of
the fact that they were not true Filarial at all,
but     belonged    to   a  peculiar   family of thread
worms,      embracing     the  genera of     Gordius     and
Mermis.       Furthermore,      I  convinced myself that
these     parasites   wander    away when      full-grown,
boring their way from within through any soft
place in the body          of their host, and creeping
out    through the opening.          These    parasites   do
not emigrate because they are uneasy, or because
the caterpillar    is sickly;   but from that same in
ternal necessity which constrains          the horsefly to
leave the stomach      of the horse where he has been
reared, or which        moves the gadfly to work          its
way out through the           skin of the oxen.         The
larvae   of both these insects creep forth in order

 to become chrysalises,     and thence to proceed to
 their higher and perfect condition,            I  have de
 monstrated that the perfect, full-grown, but sexless
 threadworms of insects are in like manner moved
 by their desire to wander         out of their previous
 homes, in order to enter         upon   a   new period of
their lives,    which ends in the development              of
their sex.      As they leave the bodies of their
hosts    they fall  to the ground,       and crawl      away
into the deeper and moister parts              of the soil.
 Threadworms found in the damp earth, in dig
ging up gardens and cutting ditches, have often
been brought to me, which presented no external
distinctions from      the  threadworms         of insects.
 This suggested    to me that the wandering          thread
worms of insects     might instinctively bury them
selves in damp ground, and         I therefore    instituted
a   series   of experiments     by placing the        newly-
emigrated worms in flower-pots          filled with damp
earth.      To   my   delight   I   soon    perceived    that
they    began to bore with        their heads into the
earth and by degrees        drew themselves         entirely
in.    For many months        I  kept the earth in the

38            STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
flower-pots    moderately      moist,   and     on examining
the worms      from time to time         I  found they had
gradually     attained     their    sex-development,         and
eggs    were deposited      in hundreds.         Towards     the
conclusion    of winter    I could    succeed    in detecting
the commencing         development      of the embryos in
these eggs.      By the end of spring they          were    fully
 formed,    and   many      of them      having     left   their
 shells were to be seen creeping about the earth.
 I now   conjectured that these young worms would
 be  impelled by their instincts to pursue              a  para
 sitic existence, and to seek out an animal to in
 habit and to grow to maturity in           ;  and it seemed
 not   improbable      that    the   brood     I  had     reared
 would, like their parents, thrive best in the cater
 pillar.   In  order, therefore, to induce my young
 brood to immigrate,       I procured     a   number of very
 small caterpillars which the first spring sunshine
 had just called into life.        For the purpose of my
 experiment    I filled  a watch-glass     with damp earth,
 taking it from amongst the flower-pots where the
 threadworms     had wintered.         Upon this      I   placed
 several of the young         caterpillars."       The result

                 STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                      39
 was    as lie    expected    ;  the caterpillars    were  soon
 bored     into   by the worms,        and   served    them   at
 once    as food and home.*
     Frogs and parasites, worms and infusoria — are
 these worth the attention of a serious man ?
     They have       a   less imposing appearance than
planets and asteroids,          I admit,  but they are nearer
to us, and admit of being more intimately known ;
 and because they are thus accessible, they become
more important to us.              The life that stirs within
us is also the life within them.                It  is for this
reason,      as  I   said    at the outset,    that although
man's noblest study must always be man, there
are    other    studies    less noble,     yet not therefore
ignoble,      which    must     be pursued,     even   if  only
with a view to the perfection               of the noblest.
Many men, and those not always the ignorant,
whose scorn of what they do not understand                    is
always ready, despise the labours              which do not
obviously      and directly tend to moral or political
advancement.          Others there are, who,         fascinated

by the grandeur of Astronomy and Geology,                     or
by the immediate       practical results of Physics and
Chemistry, disregard         all microscopic research as
little better than dilettante curiosity.           But    I can
not think any serious study is without its serious
value to the human          race  ; and   I   know that the
great problem      of Life can never be solved while
we    are in ignorance      of its simpler forms.           Nor
can anything be more unwise              than the attempt
to limit the sphere of human inquiry, especially
by applying      the   test of immediate         utility.    All
truths are related; and however remote from our
 daily needs some particular truth may seem, the
time will surely come when its value will be felt.
 To the majority of our countrymen                 during the
 Revolution,     when     the    conduct     of    James      II.
 seemed    of incalculable      importance,      there    would
 have seemed something ludicrously absurd in the
 assertion    that   the   newly-discovered         differential
 calculus   was   infinitely more important to Eng
 land and to Europe           than   the    fate   of all the
 dynasties  ;   and   few things      could     have     seemed
 more remote from any useful end than this pro

 duct of mathematical       genius   ;  yet it is now clear
to  every    one    that the conduct        of James       was
supremely     insignificant     in comparison      with this
discovery.      I  do not   say that     men were unwise
to  throw     themselves      body    and   soul    into    the
Eevolution    ;   I  only say they would          have been
unwise    to    condemn     the    researches    of   mathe
maticians.
   Let all who have        3,  longing to study Nature
in any of her manifold aspects,             do   so   without
regard to the sneers or objections           of men whose
tastes and faculties are directed elsewhere.            From
the illumination      of many minds on many points,
Truth must finally emerge.             Man is, in Bacon's
noble   phrase,     the  minister and       interpreter      of
Nature  ;   let him be careful lest he suffer this
ministry    to    sink  into     a  priesthood,    and    this
interpretation to degenerate into an immovable
dogma.       The suggestions        of apathy,      and    the
prejudices of ignorance, have at all times inspired
the wish to close the temple against new comers.
Let  us be vigilant against such suggestions, and
keep the door of the temple ever open.

                      Additional Note.
  ON  THE ENTRANCE OF DUST INTO THE LUNGS.
   On this important         subject of the possibility of
dust and      filings gaining entrance to the lungs,
in spite of the opposing           cilia,   I   have received
so   many      communications        from      correspondents
and    medical      friends,  that although       I   have   left
the passage        in the text, it     seems      necessary to
add an important qualification           here.     It   appears,
from     information volunteered         to   me,    that   dust
and    filings,    recognizable   under      the    microscope
and under         chemical    reactions,      have    very   fre
quently been        found in the lungs of miners             and
 Sheffield    artisans.      There    is no      resisting the
 evidence.      It    is further shown that          when     the
quantity of filings in the atmosphere                  is dimi
nished by wet-grinding, or other mechanical con
trivances,     the amount       of lung       disease    among
 the workmen is considerably lessened.
    Let these facts       be  duly considered.          But, on
 the  other     hand,    let  not  these     facts lead to a

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LITE.                         43
 denial   of the important physiological             results of
 Claude Bernard's experiments.              In Nature       there
 is no contradiction.         One positive fact is not to
 be   set   aside    by twenty       other    positive     facts;
 not to be set aside, but         if  possible to be ranged
 with them under some more general fact.
    While    I  am perfectly ready to admit the cor
 rectness of the       statements      made    by my       corre
 spondents,    and to withdraw          the   absolute denial
 formerly made,        as   to   the    possibility of dust
 entering    the   lungs;      I  can    only replace it by
the    assertion,    that    this    possibility   is    usually
counteracted      by the presence of the           cilia  ;   and
that in     normal      cases    healthy    animals      do   not
admit dust into their lungs.                "Were     there    no
such    normal     rule,   the     continued     existence      of
animals     in  a smoky,       dusty, filing-loaded       atmo
sphere     would    be   impossible,     except under        con
ditions of perpetual lung-disease.             The particles
of   coal,   sand,   and    steel    would    be   carried     by
the   bronchial vessels       into their ultimate         rami
fications,    and    there     form     deposits,     or    work
through into the parenchyma of the lungs.                  This,

 44             STUDIES       EST  ANIMAL LIFE.
 it  appears, is actually         the case in some         miners
 and    steel-grinders.         But why is it not            so   in
 all ? and even in those who are thus affected,
 why is the deposit so small ?                 Surely it is not
 so  in all,    because     the healthy       organism    is con
 structed not to allow the entrance of such par
ticles  ;  and   if in    certain    feebler organisms        there
be a    possibility of entrance, even this must be
but slight, seeing how long a period of exposure
elapses before the disease             becomes      manifest.
    The reader will be pleased to understand, that
in these remarks           I    wish to throw no sort             of
doubt      on the     fact of miners         and steel-grinders
being     liable to      lung disease in the            course    of
their avocations.            On    the   contrary,     great   em
phasis      should    be   laid upon        this liability,     and
every     means     taken     to counteract        it.  But this
is a special question.             It  is a matter of indus
trial   hygiene.        The question          originally mooted
by me was a general physiological question relat
ing    to    the   function       of    cilia   in the     animal
organism      ;  and    if   I   was misled        into a state
ment, too absolute in its terms,                 by reliance on

              STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                   45
Claude     Bernard's experiments      and   deductions  —
which statement     I   at   once  retract   in its abso
lute  form   — there    still remains      unimpeachable
evidence for the general        physiological law, that
the  cilia prevent the entrance of dust into the
lungs  ;  and those who deny this, on the strength
of the evidence furnished in exceptional            cases,
must     be imperfectly    acquainted   with the facts,
or strangely oblivious of them.

 The     clay  is bright with a late autumn sun            ; the
sky is       clear with    a  keen     autumn     wind,   which
lashes our blood into a canter as we press against
it  ;  and     the cantering     blood     sets  the thoughts
into hurrying excitement.              Wimbledon Common
is not far off; its five thousand              acres  of undu
lating heather, furze,         and     fern tempt us across
it, health       streaming in at every step as we snuff
the keen breeze.         We    are tempted also to        bring
net    and wide-mouthed         jar, to ransack the many
ponds for visible and invisible wonders.
     Ponds, indeed, are not so rich and lovely as

              STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                           47
rock-pools;     the heath is less alluring than                the
coast — the    clear-loved      coast,    with its gleaming
mystery,    the    sea,   and    its sweeps of sand, its
reefs, its dripping boulders.              I  admit   the com
parative   inferiority of ponds          ;   but   we    are not
near the coast, and the heath is close                 at   hand.
Nay,  if the case were otherwise,              I  should object
to dwarfing      comparisons.          It    argues    a   pitiful
thinness of      nature     (and    the      majority in this
respect   are    lean)    when      present      excellence      is
depreciated because some greater excellence is to
be found     elsewhere.       "We are not elsewhere;            we
must    do   the    best we      can    with what is here.
Because ours is not the Elizabethan age, shall we
express no      reverence      for    our     great  men,      but
reserve it for Shakspeare,            Bacon,      and Baleigh,
 whose traditional       renown      is to overshadow our
 contemporaries ?         Not     so.      To    each    age    its
honour.      Let us      be   thankful for all greatness,
 past or present,       and never speak slightingly of
 noble work,     or honest       endeavour, because          it is
 not,  or we      choose     to say     it is not, equal to
 something     else.     No comparisons           then,    I  beg.

48               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
If I   said ponds were finer than rock-pools, you
might demur         ; but  I  only say ponds are excellent
things   ;   let us dabble in them       ; ponds are rich in
wonders, let us enjoy them.
   And first       we  must look to our tackle.           It  is
extremely        simple.     A   landing-net,    lined     with
muslin     ;   a  wide-mouthed      glass jar,    say   a   foot
high and six inches            in diameter,    but    the size
optional, with a bit of string tied under the lip,
and forming a loop over the top, to serve                  as a
handle       which    will   let  the   jar swing without
spilling the water      ;  a camel-hair    brush ;  a  quinine
bottle, or any wide-mouthed           phial, for worms and
tiny animals which we desire to keep separated
from the dangers and confusions of the larger jar               ;
and when to these a pocket lens is added, our
equipment is complete.
   As  we emerge upon the common,              and tread its
springy heather, what a wild wind dashes the hair
into our eyes, and the blood into our cheeks                    !
and what a fine sweep of horizon lies before us                 !
The lingering splendours and the beautiful decays
of autumn vary the scene,             and touch    it with     a

                STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                     49
certain pensive charm.            The ferns mingle har
moniously their rich browns with the dark green
of the furze, now robbed of its golden summer-
glory, but still pleasant to the eye, and exquisite
to memory.          The gaunt windmill on the rising-
ground       is stretching    its stiff* starred arms into
the silent      air  :  a landmark     for the wanderer, a
landmark,       too, for the wandering       mind, since it
serves     to recall the dim early feelings, and sweet
broken associations         of childhood    when we gazed
at   it with   awe, and listened      to the  rushing of its
 mighty arms.
    Ah   !  well may the mind with the sweet insist-
 ance    of sadness linger on those scenes of the
 irrecoverable      past,   and try, by lingering        there,
 to feel that it is not wholly lost, wholly irrecover
 able,   vanished      for ever from the Life which, as
 these decays of autumn          and these changing trees
 too feelingly remind us, is gliding away,             leaving
 our cherished ambitions          still unfulfilled, and our
 deeper     affections still    but   half expressed.      The
 vanishing visions of elapsing life bring with them
 thoughts which lie too deep for tears             ; and this
                                                     4

windmill recalls such visions by the subtle laws of

with its gipsy encampment, — or abroad on the
purple Surrey hills, and the varied-tinted trees of
Combe Wood and                 Richmond Park.                There are
not many such prospects so near London.
  But, in spite of the sun, we must not linger
here   :   the     wind   is    much          too   analytical     in its

amazing       amazon.      It was at     Munich, and in the
house of a celebrated naturalist, in whose garden
 an agreeable      assemblage of poets, professors, and
their wives, sauntered in the light of a setting
 sun,    breaking     up into      groups    and tete-a-tetes,
 to   re-form    into larger     groups.      We had taken
 coffee under the branching          coolness of trees, and
 were now loitering through the brief interval                 till
 supper.       Our host had just returned               from    an
 expedition     of   some     fifty miles     to    a  particular
 pond, known to be inhabited              by the Apus.         He

 prolific,    is rare, and is not to be found in every
 spot.      For three      successive   years had he gone to
 the same pond, in quest of the male               :  hut no male
 was to he found among thousands of egg-hearing
 females, some of which he had brought away with
 him, and was showing us.                 We were amused to
 see    them swimming about, sometimes                    on their
 backs, using their long oars            ; sometimes floating,
but always incessantly             agitating    the water with
their ten pairs of breathing legs             ;  and the ladies,
gathered round the jar, were hugely elated at the
idea of        animals      getting   rid altogether        of the
sterner sex — clearly a useless incumbrance                  in the
scheme      of things    !
     The fact that no male Apus has yet been found*
is not without precedent.             Leon Dufour, the cele
brated entomologist, declares that he never found
the     male of the         gall insect      {Diplolepis       gall<z

that   if  the males exist at all, they must be exces
sively    rare, and their services can be dispensed
with   ;   a   conclusion        which    becomes      acceptable

   While on this subject,             I cannot   forbear making
a  reflection.      It   must be confessed that our sex
cuts but       a  poor    figure     in some great families.
If  the male is in some families grander, fiercer,

the    female, this     occasional      superiority is more
than     counterbalanced       by the      still greater infe
riority of the sex in other families.                The male
is often but a contemptible                partner,    puny in
size, insignificant in         powers,     stinted   even   of a
due     allowance    of    organs.     If   the   peacock and
the pheasant swagger in greater splendour, what
a  pitiful creature is the male falcon — no falconer
will look at him.          And what is the drone com
pared with the         queen      bee,   or    even   with    the
workers ?       What figure         does    the   male     spider
make beside his          large     and    irascible   female, —

which arise two cilia (hairs),         serving as oars to
row the animal through the water.                 The specs

   The dispute may perhaps excite your surprise.
You    are   perplexed        at the    idea   of   a  plant (if
plant it be) moving about, swimming with all
the vigour and dexterity of an animal, and swim
ming by means of animal organs, the cilia.                   But
this difficulty     is one of our own creation.               We
first employ the word Plant to designate a vast
group of objects which have               no powers of loco
 motion,    and then        ask, with triumph,         How can
 a  plant move ?           But   we    have   only to enlarge
 our knowledge          of plant-life      to   see   that  loco
 motion is not absolutely             excluded    from   it;   for
 many of the simpler plants — Confervas                and Algae
 — can,   and do, move          spontaneously      in the early
 stages   of their existence       :  they escape from their
 parents    as   free     swimming rovers,          and do not
 settle   into    solid     and     sober    respectability    till

     Whether         this    loss    of locomotion          is to     be
regarded as a retrogression                  on the part       of the

very simple      single   eye, and    a    mouth furnished
with   a  proboscis.    In   the second stage they have
six pairs of legs, two compound               eyes,   complex
in structure, two feelers, but no month.                In  the
third, or final stage, their legs are transformed
into prehensile      organs, and they have recovered
a mouth,      but  have    lost their feelers, and their
two complex       eyes   are   degraded to a single         and
very simple eye-spot.
   But to break up these digressions,              let us try
a sweep      with our net.       We    skirn    it along the
 surface,   and   draw up      a   quantity of duckweed,
 dead leaves, bits      of stick,   and masses of green
thread,    of great     fineness,    called     Conferva     by
botanists.      The water runs away, and we                ton
 over the     mass.      Here     is a fine water-beetle,

over the surface               of the net and dead leaves, are
little dabs           of dirty-looking jelly— some of them,
instead        of the dirty hue, are almost blood-red.
Experience makes me aware that these dirty dabs
are certainly              Polypes — the Hydra fusca. of syste
matise.              I     can't    tell how it is          I    know them,
nor how you may know them again.                                  The power
of recognition               must be acquired by familiarity                       :
and       it is       because        men       can't     begin    with fami
liarity, and can't recognize these Polypes without
it,    that     so        few persons           really    ever     see them*
But the familiarity may                         be acquired         by   a   very
simple method.                    Make    ita    rule to pop every un

if   it   be   a     Polype,       it   will expand its tentacles            ;   if
not,      you        can     identify     it    at   leisure     on reaching
home,          by   the aid of pictures and descriptions.
      See, as   I          drop one of these into the water,                     it

Polype.             And now         we   will    see     what these, blood-

  imperturbable,         even when         I  assure you it is of a

 to a little enthusiasm,               and prove that you have
 something of the naturalist in you by delighting
 in the detection of            a   new species.          " You didn't
 know that it was new?"                        That explains your
 calmness.        There must be a basis of knowledge

Polypes ;  but it is  a  mistake   to  suppose  that  he was  the original
discoverer of this genus : old     Leuwejthoek       had been before him.

charge.      But this is     a public and official attitude.
In   private,    we can despise          the distinctions esta

for our own.*
   I  remember once           showing      a bottle containing
Polypes to a philosopher            :   he beheld them with
great calmness.           They appeared to him as insig

you    take    the    trouble of studying         them.     They
can be cut      into many pieces, and each piece will
grow into a perfect Polype            ;  they may be pricked,

appears that Dr. Gray found this very species, and apparently in
the same spot, nearly thirty years ago. But the latest work of

turned inside out, and their skin will become a
stomach, their stomach a skin.         They have acute
sensibility to light (towards      which they always
move),    and :to the slightest touch;        yet not a
trace of a nervous tissue is to be found in them.
They have powers of motion and locomotion, yet
their muscles are simply a network of large con
tractile cells.   If  the water    in which they     are
kept be not very pure, they will be found infested
with parasites;    and quite recently   I have noticed
an animal, or vegetal, parasite —    I know    not which
 —forming     an elegant sort of fringe to the ten
tacles :   clusters   of skittle-shaped    bodies,   too
 entirely transparent    for any structure      whatever
 to be made     out, in active agitation,    like leaves
 fluttering on a twig.    Some day or other we may
 have occasion to treat of the Polypes in detail,
 and to narrate the amusing        story of their dis
 covery;    but  what   has   already   been    said will
 serve to sharpen your attention and awaken some
 curiosity in them.

 ing up mud, stones, sticks, with a fish, worms,
molluscs, and tritons.          The fish we must secure,
for   it   is a stickleback —:a pretty and interesting
inhabitant of an aquarium,              on  account   of its
nest-building propensities.           We   are surprised  at
a fish building a nest, and caring for its young,
like the       tendere&t    of birds (and there are two
 .other fishes, the      Goramy and the Hassar, which
have this instinct) ; but why not a fish as well
as   a     bird?    The cat-fish     swims   about in com
pany with her young, like a proud hen with her
chickens ;       and    the   sun-fish   hovers  for  weeks
over her eggs, protecting          them against danger.
    The wind is so piercing, and my fingers are
so benumbed,          I  can scarcely Jiold     the  brush.
Moreover,       continual stooping over the net makes
the muscles ache unpleasantly,           and suggests that
each cast shall be the final one.            But somehow
I have      made this resolution      and broken it twenty
times    :  either the cast has been unsuccessful, and
one is provoked          to try again,    or it is so suc
cessful that, as Vappetit vient en mangeant, one
is seduced again.          Very unintelligible this would

be   to the passers-by,       who    generally      cast   con
temptuous      glances at us, when they find we are
not fishing, but are only removing            Nothings into
a glass   jar.
    One day an Irish labourer            stopped and asked
me     if  I  were   fishing   for salmon.           I   quietly
answered,      "Yes."     He drew near.          I  continued
turning over the weed, occasionally dropping                  an
invisible thing into the water.             At  last, a large
yellow-bellied Triton was dropped in.              He begged
 to see it  ; and seeing at the same time how alive
 the water was with tiny animals, became curious,
 and asked many questions.            I   went on with my
 work; his interest      and    curiosity increased;         his
 questions multiplied     ;  he volunteered       assistance    ;
 and    remained    beside me     till    I  prepared     to go
 away, when he said seriously          :
                                           " Och  ! then, and
 it's a fine thing to be able to name all God's
 creatures."      Contempt    had given place          to  reve
 rence ;    and so it would      be    with others,       could
 they check the first rising of scorn at what they
 do not understand, and patiently learn what even
 a roadside pond has        of Nature's wonders.

                ON THE HYDRA RUBRA.
   Had   I thrown   any zoological   amour propre into
the discovery of new species, it would have been
much    disturbed     when in the following autumn
I  found these     very Polypes, kept      in a vase   by
themselves and with weed from a different pond,
gradually    losing their red colour, and becoming
indistinguishable from the Hydra fusca.           It  was
clearly something       in the food which gave them
their red tone   ; and this is why hitherto they have
only   been    found    in the ponds     of Wimbledon
common.
   The following passage from a former work may
be cited   in point   :  "Apropos of the peculiarity of
colour,   I    may remark      on the great variations
observable in the colour        of Anemones,    and the
impropriety of making colour the distinguishing
mark    of species.        Thus,  to   select a  striking
 example,     Mr. Gosse makes two distinct species
 of the orange-disked       and orange-tentacled     Ane
 mones,   naming     them Venusta     and Aurora; but,

as  if  to prove the indifference of all such charac
teristics,   I   brought      with   me from         Tenby an
orange-disked — -and         only one — which         before   it
had been       home    a   fortnight,    I   .discovered   with
great     surprise    was     changed      into    an   orange-
tentacled — disc     and tentacles        being     of a    rich
orange hue, the only traces of white being just
at the tips..     If  there had been         any other speci
men in       the   vase    I   might   have       doubted,   but
iaving only one in company with                 a  white Daisy
 and a smooth Anemone, there was no avoiding
 the conclusion.
    4(I   hare   had   an Authea with brilliant green
 tentacles turn to       a   pale gray in the course of
 two days and back again to green               ;  and a Wey
 mouth Anemone turn from pearly white to a soft
 reddish brown.        In    fact, the changes of colour,
 except    in   the    Crassicornis, which          appears    to
 retain its hues with tolerable constancy, are too
 frequent    to admit       of colour forming a specific
 character."*

itself, calling up the years during which it has
been warmed by the sun,            chilled by the night airs
and the dews, and dashed against                  by the wild
winds of March       :  all of which have made it quite
another    wall from what it was when the trowel
first settled its bricks.          The old wall has      a  past,
a  life, a story   ;   as  Wordsworth       finely says of the
mountain,    it is "familiar with forgotten years."
Not only      are    there      obvious    traces   of age      in
the    crumbling mortar           and   the   battered     brick,
but there are traces, not obvious,              except to the
inner eye, left by every ray of light, every rain
 drop,   every gust.          Nothing     perishes.     In    the
wondrous      metamorphosis           momently       going     on
everywhere in the universe, there is change, but
no loss.
    Lest you should imagine this to be poetry, and
 not science,   I    will touch on the evidence that
every beam of light, or every breath of air, which
falls upon an object, permanently               affects it.    In
 photography      we      see    the  effect   of light      very
 strikingly exhibited       ;  but perhaps you will object
 that this proves nothing more than that light acts

upon an iodized surface.                    Yet in truth light              acts
upon,      and more or less alters,                      the structure         of
every object on which it falls.                    Nor is this all.            If
a wafer be           laid on a surface of polished metal,
which is then breathed upon, and                            if,   when the
moisture         of the breath has evaporated, the wafer
be shaken off, we shall                find that the whole polished
surface    is    not as   it   was before, although our senses
can detect        no difference         ;   for   if   we breath again
upon       it,   the   surface will be              moist everywhere
except on the spot previously                        sheltered         by the
wafer,      which will            now     appear as         a     "    spectral

image           the surface.                  Again       and again          we
breath, and the moisture evaporates, but still the
spectral wafer reappears.
   This experiment              succeeds          even    after   a    lapse of

months where nothing can disturb                    it,   and then
in darkness        be   laid on    a   plate of hot metal, the
spectre of the key will again appear.                In    the case
of bodies more highly phosphorescent than paper,
the spectres of many different objects which may
have been laid on in succession will, on warming,
emerge in their proper order.*
      This   is   equally   true     of our bodies,       and our
minds.       We are involved in the universal meta
morphosis.         Nothing leaves us wholly as            it   found
us.     Every man we meet, every book we read,
every picture or landscape we see, every word or
tone we. hear, mingles with our being and modifies
it.    There are cases on record of ignorant women,
in states of insanity, uttering Greek and Hebrew
phrases, which in past years they had heard their
masters utter,          without of course comprehending
them.        These tones had long been forgotten             :   the
traces were so faint that under ordinary conditions
they were invisible         ;    but the traces were there,
and in the intense              light of cerebral excitement

they started into prominence, just as the spectral
image of the key started into sight on the appli
cation of heat.           It   is thus with all the influences
to which we are subjected.
  If a       garden wall can lead our vagabond thoughts
into such speculations as these, surely it may also
furnish us with matter for our Studies in Animal
Life    ?        Those patches of moss must be colonies.
Suppose we examine them ?                  I   pull   away a   small
bit, which is so dry that the dust crumbles at
a touch      ;    this may be wrapped in a piece of paper
— dirt       and all — and carried home.         Get the micro
scope ready, and now attend.
  I moisten          a fragment      of this moss with distilled
water.           Any water will do as well, but the use of
distilled water prevents your supposing                    that the
animals you are about to watch were brought in                   it,
and were not already in the moss.               I     now squeeze
the bit between my fingers,                and   a    drop of the
contained water — somewhat turbid with dirt — falls
on the glass slide, which we may now put on the
microscope stage.              A   rapid survey assures us that
there       is   no animal visible.      The moss     is   squeezed

again   ;  and this time little yellowisli bodies of an
irregular oval are noticeable among the particles
of dust and moss.           "Watch one    of these, and pre
sently you will observe a slow bulging at one end,
and then a bulging at the other end.                The oval
has elongated itself into a form not unlike that
of   a fat caterpillar, except that there is a tapering
at one end.          Now a forked tail is visible; this
 fixes on to the glass, while the             body sways to
 and fro.     Now the head is drawn in — as if it were
 swallowed — and,        suddenly,     in its place are un
folded two broad membranes, having each a circle
 of waving      cilia.    The lifeless     oval has become
 a  living animal      !   You   have assisted at a resusci
 tation,    not    from    death    by drowning,     but  by
 drying   :  the   animal has been drowned into life        !
 The unfolded membranes, with their cilia, have           so
 much the appearance of wheels that the name of
 "Wheel-bearer" (Rotifera) or "Wheel Animal
       " has been
 cule                  given to the animal.
     The Rotifera (also — and more correctly — called
 Rotatoria)      form    an   interesting    study.  Let  us
 glance at their organization        : —

called "wheels," because            the optical effect is very
much that of a toothed-wheel ; or crawling along
the side of the glass, fastening              to it by the head,
and then curving the body              till  the tail is brought
up to the spot, which is then fastened on by the
tail, and the head is set free.               They may also be
seen     fastened to a weed,            or the glass, by the
tail, the body waving              to and      fro,  or thrusting
itself     straight    out,    and    setting     the wheels        in
active motion.         In this    attitude the aspect of the
jaws is very striking,              Leuwenhoek mistook it
 for the pulsation          of a heart, which its incessant
 rhythm much resembles.               The tail, and the upper
 part of the body, have           a  singular power of being
 drawn out, or          drawn      in, like the        tube      of   a
 telescope.       There is sometimes a shell,               or cara
 pace, but often the body is covered only with a
 smooth       firm     skin,     which,      however,       presents
 decided indications of being segmented.

 animals were got from the gutter of a house-top.
 Since then, they have been minutely studied, and
have been showed to be, not Infusoria, as Ehren-
berg imagined, but Crustacea.*              Your attention is
 requested      to   the   one    point which        has    most
 contributed     to   the celebrity     of these       creatures
— their      power     of resuscitation.         Leuwenhoek
 described — what you have just witnessed, namely
— the     slow    resuscitation    of the animal          (which
 seemed     as   dry as dust,      and    might have been
blown about like any particle of dust,) directly a
little   moisture     was    brought    to   it.   Spallanzani
startled    the world with the         announcement          that
this process of drying and moistening — of killing
and reviving     — could    be repeated fifteen        times in
succession ;      so  that   the   Eotifer,    whose natural
term of life is about eighteen days, might, it was
said, be     dried    and   kept   for   years, and at any
time revived by moisture.           That which seems now
no    better   than    a  grain    of dust will suddenly

 awaken to the energetic life of a complex organism,
 and may again be made as dust by evaporation of
 the water.
    This is very marvellous      :   so marvellous     that a
 mind, trained in the cultivated caution of science,
 will demand the evidence on which it is based.
 Two months       ago  I  should       have  dismissed     the
 doubt with the assurance that the evidence               was
ample     and rigorous,   and the fact indisputable.
For not only had the fact          been confirmed by the
united experience of several investigators          :  it had
stood the test of very severe experiment.               Thus
in 1842, M. Doyere published experiments which
seemed     to place it beyond         scepticism.     Under
the   air-pump    he  set  some      moss, together with
vessels   containing   sculphuric acid, which would
absorb every trace of moisure.           After leaving the
moss thus for a week, he removed it into an oven,
the   temperature     of which      was    raised  to 300°
Fahrenheit.      Yet   even    this treatment       did   not
prevent     the  animals    from      resuscitating     when
water was added.
   In  presence of testimony like this, doubt will

                STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                             85
seem     next to impossible.            Nevertheless,       my own
experiments         leave   me     no    choice but       to   doubt.
Not having          witnessed      M. Doy&re's experiment,
I   am not prepared to say wherein its fallacy lies                   ;
but that there is a fallacy, seems to me probable.
In M.     Pouchet's recent work*             I first read a distinct
denial     of     the    pretended        resuscitation       of the
Eotifers    ;  this denial was the more startling to
me, because          I  had     myself often witnessed             the
reawakening          of these       dried       animals.       Never
theless, whenever           a   doubt       is fairly started, we
have not done          justice to it until we have brought
it  to the test      of experiment        ;   accordingly    I tested
this, and quickly came upon what seemed to me
the source        of the general misconception.                  Day
after day experiments            wTere    repeated, varied, and
controlled,       and with results             so   unvarying     that
hesitation vanished ; and as some of these experi
ments are of extreme simplicity, you may verify
what     I  say    with little trouble.            Squeeze a drop
of water from the moss, taking care that there is

scarcely any dirt, in it        ;  and, having        ascertained
that it contains Rotifers, or Tardigrades,* alive and
moving, place the glass-slide             under a bell-glass,
to shield it from currents of air, and there allow
the water to        evaporate      slowly,     but completely,
by means         of chloride      of calcium,       or sulphuric
acid,    placed    under     the    bell-glass ;     or   what    is
still simpler, place a slide with the live animals
on the mantelpiece when a fire is burning in the
grate.     If    on the day following you examine this
perfectly    dry    glass, you will see          the contracted
bodies of the Rotifers, presenting                 the aspect of
yellowish oval bodies; but attempt to resuscitate
them by the addition of a little fresh water, and
you wTill find that they do              not    revive, as they
revived when dried in the moss              :   they sometimes
swell a little, and elongate themselves* and you
imagine this, is a commencement of resuscitation ;
   * The Tardigrade, or microscopic Sloth, belongs      to the order
of Arachnida, and is occasionally found in    moss, stagnant ponds,
&c.    I have only met with four specimens      in all my investiga
tions, and they were all found in moss.    Spallanzani described
and figured it (very badly), and M. Doyere        has given a fuller
description in the Annates des Sciences, 2nd series, vols, xiv.,
xvii. and xviii.

but continue watching for two or three days, and
you will find          it      goes no    further.    Never do these
oval bodies become active crawling Eotifers ; never
do they expand             their wheels, and set the oesophagus
at work.        No     :    the Eotifer once dried is dead, and
dead   for ever.
  But     if,   like       a   cautious experimenter,            you vary
and control the experiment, and beside the glass-
slide place     a     watch-glass         containing Eotifers with
dirt, or moss, you will find that                    the.   addition of
water to the contents of the watch-glass will often
(not always) revive the animals.                  What you cannot
effect on   a    glass-slide without dirt, or with very
little, you easily effect in              a   watch-glass with dirt,
or moss   ;     and    if      you give due attention you will
find that in each case the result depends upon
the    quantity       of the dirt.            And this leads to             a
clear understanding               of the whole mystery; this
reconciles the conflicting statements..                     The reason
why Eotifers ever                revive    is, because       they have
not been        dried— they have not lost                   by   evapora
tion that small                quantity    of water which forms
an integral, constituent,            of    their tissues    ;    and   it   is

88            STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
the presence of dirt,          or moss, which prevents
this complete evaporation.            No one,      I  suppose,
believes   that    the   Rotifer     actually   revives    after
once being dead.         If  it has    a  power of remain
ing in a state of suspended animation,               like that
of a frozen frog, it can do so only on the condition
that its organism is not destroyed           ; and destroyed
it would    be, if   the water were removed from its
tissues ; for, strange as it may seem, water is not
an   accessory, but a contsituent element             of every
tissue  ; and this cannot be replaced mechanically
 —it   can    only    be   replaced     by vital processes.
 Every one who has made microscopic                    prepara
 tions must be aware that when once                a  tissue is
 desiccated, it is spoiled       :  it will not    recover    its
 form and properties on the application              of water   ;
 because   the water was not originally worked into
 the web    by a mere process            of imbibition — like
 water in a sponge       — but     by a molecular       process
 of assimilation, like albumen in         a muscle.
    Therefore,   I  say, that desiccation       is necessarily
 death  ; and the Rotifer which revives cannot have
 been   desiccated.      This being granted,          we   have

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LITE.                        89
  only to ask, What         prevents     tlie   Botifer    from
  becoming     completely    dried ?    Experiment        shows
  that it is the presence of dirt, or moss, which
   does  this.    The whole      marvel     of the Rotifer's
  resuscitation,    therefore,   amounts      to this   : — that
  if  the water in which it lives be evaporated, the
  animal passes into a state of suspended animation,
  and remains so, as long as its own ivater is pro-
• tected from evaporation.
      I am aware that this is not easily to be re
  conciled with M. Doyere's experiments,             since the
  application of a temperature so high as 300° Fahr.
  (nearly a hundred degrees          above     boiling water)
  must, one would imagine,        have completely         desic
  cated   the   animals,   in spite of any amount             of
  protecting    dirt.   It  is possible that M. Doyere
  may have mistaken that previously-noted            swelling-
  up of the bodies, on the application          of water, for
  a  return to vital activity.     If  not,   I am at a loss
  to explain the contradiction      ;  for certainly in my
  experience a much        more moderate desiccation —
  namely, that obtained by simple evaporation over
  a mantelpiece, or under a Targe bell-glass         — always

destroyed, the animals,                 if   little or no dirt, were
present..
     The subject has recently been brought before
the Erench Academy of Sciences by M. Davaine,
whose     experiments*             lead him to the conclusion
that those Rotifers which habitually live in ponds
will not revive after desiccation.:, whereas those
which live in moss always                     do. ao.     I    believe the
explanation to be this             :   the Rotifers living in ponds                    •
are dried without any protecting                        dirt, or moss,
and that is the reason they do not revive.
     After having satisfied myself on this point,                              I
did what         perhaps         would have saved me some
trouble if thought of before.                  I took    down Spallan-
zani, and read his account, of. his celebrated ex
periments.         To my surprise and satisfaction,, it
appeared that he had accurately observed the same
facts, but curiously missed, their real significance.

clay   I   had two wheel-animals                    traversing          a drop
of water about to evaporate, which contained very
little sand.          Three quarters of an hour after evapo
ration they were dry and motionless.                              I moistened
them       with water to revive them                         ;   but in vain,
notwithstanding that they were immersed in water
many hours.                Their members swelled to thrice
the original size, but they remained motionless.

     It   is not a little remarkable that observations so
precise as these should have for many years passed
unregarded, and not led to the true explanation of
the mystery.           Perhaps        an    inherent love of the
marvellous          made men greedily accept the idea of
resuscitation,       and indisposed          them to attempt an
explanation         of it.      Sj)allanzani's     own attempt         is
certainly      not    felicitous.        He supposes that the
dust prevents the lacerating influence                       of the air
from irritating         and injuring            the animals.       And
this explanation is accepted by his Translator.

M. Gavarret has published (Annates                       des Sciences

he found that after subjecting the moss to a desic

in my experiments         the animals,          not  the moss,
were subjected to        desiccation.          Nevertheless,    I
confess that my confidence was shaken by experi
ments     so  precise, and       performed       by so   distin
guished an investigator, and          I   once more resumed
the experiments, feeling persuaded that the detec
tion of the fallacy, wherever it might be, would be
wrell worth the trouble.         The results of these con
trolling experiments       are    all   I   can find room for
here   :
         — Whenever     the     animals       were  completely
separated from the dirt, they perished ;                in two
cases there was a very       little dirt — a mere film, so
to speak — in the watch-glass,            and glass-cell,   and
this, slight   as it was,    sufficed      to protect two out
of eight,    and three out         of ten Kotifers, which
revived on the second           clay  ;  the others did not
revive even on the third day after their immersion.
In  one instance, a thin covering-glass was placed
over the water on the slide, and the evaporation of the
water seemed complete, yet this glass-cover sufficed
to protect a   Eotifer, which revived in three hours.
   If we   compare these results with those obtained
by M. Davaine, we can scarcely avoid the conclu

sion that it is only when the desiccation of the
 Kotifers is prevented by the presence of a small
quantity of moss, or of dirt — between the particles
of which they find shelter — that they revive on the
application    of water.       And    even      in the    severe
experiments of M. Doykre and M. Gavarret, some
of the animals must have been thus protected;                 and
I call particular attention to the fact that, although
some     animals     revived,    others    always     perished.
But if the organization         of the Eotifer, or Tardi
grade, is such that it can withstand desiccation — if
it only   needs the fresh applications         of moisture to
restore its activity — all, or almost all, the animals
experimented on ought to revive          ;  and the fact that
only some revive leads us to suspect that these
have not been        desiccated  —a    suspicion      which    is
warranted by direct experiments.             I   believe, then,
that the discrepancy amounts to this           :  investigators
who have desiccated the moss containing animals,
find some of the animals revive on the application
of moisture; but those who desiccate the animals
themselves, will find no instances of revival.]*

   The time spent on these Eotifers 'will not have
been     misspent       if it   has taught us the necessity of
cautionin all experimental inquiries. Although
Experiment is valuable — -nay, indispensable — as a
means          of interrogating Nature, it is constantly
liable    to mislead        us into the idea that we have
rightly        interrogated,     and rightly interpreted             the
replies    ;    and this        danger arises from              the com
plexity of the cases with which we are dealing, and
our      proneness       to overlook,        or        disregard,   some
seemingly         trifling condition— a trifle which may
turn out of the utmost                  importance.             The one
reason why the study of Science is valuable as a
means of culture, over and above its own immediate
objects, is that in it the mind learns to submit to
realities,      instead of thrusting its figments in the
place of realities        — endeavours            to    ascertain   accu
rately what the order of Nature                   is,   and not what   it
ought to be, or might be.               The one reason why, of
all sciences, Biology           is   pre-eminent as         a   means of
culture        is, that owing to the great complexity of
all the cases      it   investigates,   it   familiarizes the mind
with the necessity of attending to all the conditions,

96             STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
and it thus keeps the mind alert.              It cultivates
caution, which, considering the tendency there is in
men to
           " anticipate Nature," is    a mental tonic of
inestimable     worth.   I  am far from asserting that
biologists are more accurate reasoners than other
men   ; indeed, the mass of crude hypothesis which
passes unchallenged       by them, is against such an
idea.     But whether      its advantages      be  used    or
neglected, the truth     nevertheless    is, that Biology,

necessity of incessant verification          of its details,

will  have attached but vague ideas        ;  and although
I  wanted to explain these, and convey a distinct
conception of the general facts         of Classification,
it would     have   then  been   too great an interrup

finish the chapter with an indication of the five
 Types,   or plans of structure, under one of which

every animal is classed.     Without being versed in
science, you discern at once whether the hook before
you is mathematical, physical, chemical, botanical,
or physiological.   In like    manner, without  being
versed  in Natural History, you ought to know whe
ther the animal before you belongs to the Verte-
brata, Mollusca, Articulata, Radiata, or Protozoa.
   A  glance at the contents   of our glass vases will
yield us samples of each of these five divisions of
the animal kingdom.       We begin with this Triton.

It is a representative of the       Vertebrate division,
or sub-kingdom.       You    have merely to remember
that it possesses     a  backbone        and    an    internal
skeleton,   and   you   will at      once     recognize    the
cardinal character which makes this Triton range
under the same general head as men, elephants,
whales,   birds,  reptiles,     or fishes.     All   these, in
spite   of their    manifold differences,          have   this
one   character   in common             they are     all back
boned  ;   they   have    all     an   internal     skeleton  ;
they   are   all formed     according      to   one    general
type.
   In  all vertebrate animals the skeleton is found
to be identical in plan.         Every bone in the body
of a triton has its corresponding bone in the body
of a man, or of a mouse       ;  and every bone preserves
the same connection with, other, bones, no matter
how unlike may be the various limbs in which
we detect its presence.          Thus, widely as the arm
 of a man differs from the fin of a whale, or the
 wing of a bird, or the wing of a bat, or the leg
 of a horse, the same number of bones,                and the
 same connections   of the bones, are found in each.

             STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                 99
A fin is   one modified   form of the typical    limb;
an arm is another   ; a wing another.
   That which is true of the limbs, is also true
of all the organs; and it is on this ground that
we    speak of the vertebrate type.    From fish to
man one common plan of structure prevails        ;  and
the presence of a backbone is the index by which
to recognize this plan.
   The Triton has been wriggling grotesquely in
our grasp while we have made him our text, and,
now he is restored to his vase,      plunges   to the
bottom with great satisfaction at his escape.      This
water-snail,  crawling   slowly  up the  side of the
vase,   and cleaning   it of the green growth of
microscopic   plants,  which   he devours,   shall be
our representative of the second great division —
the Molltjsca.
   I  cannot suggest any obvious character so dis
tinctive as a backbone, by which the word Mollusc
may at once call up an idea of the type which
prevails in the group.    It won't do to say  " shell
fish," because many molluscs have no shells, and
many animals which have shells are not molluscs.

 The name was originally bestowed on account of
the softness of the animals.            But they     are  not
softer than worms, and much less soft than jelly
fish.   You may know that snails and slugs, oysters
and cuttlefish, are molluscs ; but       if you   want some
one character by which the type may be remem
bered, you must fix on the imperfect              symmetry
of the mollusc's organs.
   I   say   imperfect   symmetry,      because    it is an
error,    though    a common      one,   to speak     of the
mollusc's      body not    being    bilateral — that is to
say, of its not being composed of two symme
trical halves.      A vertebrate animal may be divided
lengthwise,      and each half will closely resemble
the other     ;  the backbone forms,       as  it  were,   an
axis, on either side of which the organs are dis
posed   ;  but the mollusc is said to have no such
axis, no such symmetry.          I   admit the absence of
an axis, but     I deny the total   absence   of symmetry.
Many of its organs are as symmetrical              as   those
of a vertebrate animal — i.      e.  the eyes, the feelers,
the jaws — and the gills in Cuttlefish,         Eolids, and
Pteropods;        while, on the other        hand,    several

                  STUDIES IN ASIMAL LIFE.                            101
 organs       in the vertebrate animal             are   as   asym
 metrical       as any    of those in the           mollusc — such
 organs are the liver, spleen,               pancreas, stomach,
 and intestines.*
     As regards bilateral          structure,      therefore, it is
 only a question of degree.              The vertebrate animal
is not entirely symmetrical,                nor is the mollusc
 entirely unsymmetrical.              But there is         a charac
teristic disposition of the nervous system peculiar
to molluscs        : it neither forms an axis for the body
— as it       does   in the Vertebrata         and Articulata —
nor a centre — as it does in the Eadiata                    — but is
altogether        irregular     and    unsymmetrical.             This
will     be    intelligible   from    the following          diagram
of the nervous systems of a Mollusc and an Insect
(Fig. 18), with which that of                a Star-fish may be
compared (Fig. 19).              Here you perceive how the

It  was in allusion to a case of this kind, then occupying the
attention of Paris, that Moliere made his Medecin malgre Lui

the mistake being noticed,      he replies    " Oui,             ; mais

beetles, water-spiders,      insect-lame, entomostraca,
and worms.       There is a very obvious character
by which these may be recognized                   : they   have
all bodies composed of numerous segments,                     and
their limbs are jointed, and they have mostly an
external    skeleton   from       which      their limbs       are
developed.      Sometimes         the   segments       of   their
bodies are numerous, as in the centipede, lobster,
&c. ; sometimes several segments                are   fused    to
gether,   as  in the crab       ;   and    sometimes,      as   in
worms, they are indicated            by slight markings         or
depressions    of the skin, which give the appear
ance of little rings, and hence the worms have
been named     Annelida, or Annulata, or Annulosa.
In  these last-named       cases the segmental            nature
of the type is detected in the fact that the worms
grow,   segment by segment ; and also in the fact
that in most of them each segment has its own
nerves, heart, stomach, &c. — each segment is, in
fact, a zooid.*

presence of a backhone             and internal skeleton, we
recognize       an    articulate      animal    by    its jointed
body and external skeleton.              In  both, the nervous
system forms the axis of the body.                 The Mollusc,
on the contrary, has no skeleton,                internal or ex
ternal ; * and its nervous             system does not form
an axis.       As a rule, both vertebrates and articu
lates have limbs — although              there are exceptions
in serpents, fishes, and worms. The Molluscs
have no limbs. Backboned, — jointed, — and non-
jointed, — therefore, are the three leading character
istics of the three types.

 of the organs round          a  centre, wrhich is the mouth.

would have been the first to recognize the chaotic
condition in which he left this last division, and
would have acquiesced in the separation of the
Protozoa, which has since                been      made.       This
fifth division includes many of the                  microscopic
animals known as Infusoria;                 and     receives     its
name from the          idea that these simplest              of all
animals represent, as it were, the beginnings                     of
life.*
    But Cuvier's arrangement is open to                   a    more
serious objection.        The state of science in his day
excused the imperfection          of classing the Infusoria
and    parasites    under     the     Eadiata    ;  but     it  was
owing,    I  conceive, to an unphilosophical view of
morphology,       that he placed the molluscs next to
the Vertebrata,       instead of placing         the Articulata
in that position.        He was secretly determined by
the desire to show that there are four very distinct
types, or plans of structure, which cannot by any
transitions be brought under one law of develop
 ment.     Lamarck and Geoffrey St. Hilaire main
 tained    the   doctrine      of    unity     of    composition
        * Protozoa, from
                         proton, first, and zcon, animal.

                                       — in  other words,
that all the varieties    of animal forms were pro
duced by successive modifications       : and several of
the  German naturalists    maintained that the verte-
brata in their embryonic       stages   passed    through
forms which were permanent in the lower animals.
This idea Cuvier always opposed*           He held that
the four types were altogether         distinct;   and by
his arrangement     of them, their distinctness        cer
tainly appears much greater than would be the
case on another arrangement.
   But without discussing this question here, it
is enough to point out the fact of the enormous
superiority   in intelligence,    in sociality,    and in
complexity of animal functions, exhibited by insects
and spiders, when compared with the highest              of
the molluscs, to justify the removal of the mollusca,
and the elevation of the articulata to the second
place in the animal hierarchy.
   Nor is this all.   If  we divide animals      into four
groups,   these four    naturally dispose themselves
into two larger groups: the first of these, com
prising Vertebrata and Articulata, is characterized

108           STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
by a nervous axis and a skeleton; the second,
comprising      Mollusca      and     Eadiata,    is  charac
terized by the absence         of both nervous axis and
skeleton.     It  is obvious that a bee much             more
closely   resembles a bird, than          any    mollusc   re
sembles any vertebrate.            If there are many and
important differences between the vertebrate and
articulate   types, there are also many and impor
 tant resemblances    ;   if  the nervous axis is above
the   viscera,   and forms        the  dorsal   line   of  the
 vertebrate, whereas it is underneath            the viscera,
 and forms     the ventral      line in the articulate,      it
 is, nevertheless, in both, the axis of the body, and
 in both it sends off nerves to supply symmetrical
 limbs  ;  in both it has similar functions.              And
 while the articulata       thus approach       in structure
 the   vertebrate type, the mollusca           are   not  only
 removed from that type by many diversities,               but
 a number     of them have such affinities with the
 Radiate   type, that   it is only in quite recent days
 that the whole class of Polyzoa (or Bryozoa,                as
 they are also called) has been removed from the
  Eadiata, and ranged under the Mollusca.

              STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                       109
   To quit this topic, and recur once more to tlie
five divisions, we have only the broad outlines of
the picture     in Vertebrata,     Mollusca, Articulata,
Badiata, and Protozoa; but this is a good begin
ning, and we can now proceed to the further
sub-divisions.
   Each of these five sub-kingdoms is divided into
Classes  ;   these   again    into  Orders ; these          into
Families   ;  these into    Genera  ; these in Species           ;
and these finally into Varieties.
   Thus suppose a dwarf-terrier           is presented to
us with a request that          we   should indicate          its
various titles in the scheme of classification            :   we
begin by calling it a vertebrate        ;   we proceed to
assign its Class as the mammalian            ;  its Order is
obviously that of the carnivora ; its Family is that
of the fox, wolf, jackal, &c, named Caniclce ; its
Genus    is, of course, that of Canis ; its Species,
terrier ; its Variety, dwarf- terrier.
   Inasmuch as all these denominations                are    the
expressions of scientific research, and not at all
arbitrary    or   fanciful,  they imply        an   immense
amount of labour and sagacity in their establish

raent; and when        we   remember that     naturalists
have thus classed upwards of half a million of
distinct species, it becomes an interesting inquiry,
— What     has been     the guiding principle of this
successful labour ? on what        basis is so large a
superstructure    raised ?    This question     we  shall
answer in the next chapter.
                  Additional Note.
       ON  THE RESUSCITATION OF ANIMALS.
    This subject, which      was  being  hotly debated
 before the French Academy at the time       I wrote, has
 been kept up on both sides with      spirit ; but I am
 forced to confess that the decision must be given
 against the view     I  have advocated.    The Societe
 de  Biologie appointed   a commission to examine this
 question; the commission, composed of Balbiani,
 Berthelot, Broca, Brown Sequard, Camille Dareste,
 Guillemin, and Charles Bobin, justified its labours
 by the masterly Report, drawn -up by Paul Broca,
 and published    in the Memoires of the Society for
  I860, torn. II. pp. 33-139.

   It would, of course, occupy far too much space
here to repeat the experimental evidence on which
this commission      bases  its conclusion, but the con
clusion   itself may be given in the following trans
lation : —
   " The   resistance of Tardigrades     and Eotifers to
elevated    temperatures appears to increase in pro
portion to their previous         desiccation.     Rotifers
will revive after remaining eighty-two         days in dry
vacuo, and subsequently placed in a temperature
of 212° Fahr. during thirty minutes.        Consequently,
animals     which have been desiccated successively
in  vacuo,    and in a temperature of 212° Fahr. —
that is to say,        reduced   to the   most    complete
desiccation     possible   to be realized    under those
conditions     and in the present state of science       —
can still preserve the property of reviving on the
                     '
contact of water.'
    This conclusion       must,  I think, be adopted by
 almost    every one who attentively       considers    the
experimental evidence — I, for one, give way.         But,
in doing     so, I  wish very distinctly to state, that
one position on which my argument rested, so far

112          STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
from being shaken by M. Broca's Eeport, is con
firmed by the assent of all physiologists.                The
                                " desiccation is neces
position alluded to is, that
sarily death."     It was   impugned       by one      of my
correspondents    in the following passage,            which
contains an interesting     fact  : — " In  Chap.     III.   of
your Studies, there is a discussion        on the subject
of the revival of desiccated         animals,    which       is
                                                     '
summed up at p. 288 by the axiom, that,                desic
cation is necessarily death.'       From very numerous
experiments,    conducted     with    great   care,     I   am
convinced    that   this is entirely      incorrect.        To
avoid the errors mentioned       in the paper,     I experi
mented    upon creatures of much larger size than
the Kotifera — such as the fresh-water crustaceans,
the Daphne, &c. — creatures where the circulation
 and respiration   can be observed      with ease by the
 microscope.    I have dried     these   animals so per
fectly that they would      splinter into dust at the
 touch  of a  needle  ; I  have observed      the gradual
 and entire cessation     of every     function  ;   I    have
 taken care that neither moss nor dirt nor moisture
 remained.    In this   state  I    have   kept them for

              STUDIES IN AKLMAL LIFE.                   113
variable and indefinite      periods ;  and have found
that in almost every instance, the moistening             of
the tissues was attended by a renewal of the action
of the heart and branchiae — in short,       a renewal of
life.    I believe the same result is attainable,      with
ordinary    care,  by any experimentalist,      who may
 doubt its authenticity•,,
    If my  correspondent will take the trouble of con
 sulting M. Broca's Report, he will see in detail
 what M. Broca summarily declares, namely, that
 all   the   physiologists   who   have   written    for or
 against the resuscitation of animals have, in spite
 of their differences, admitted with one accord, as an
 incontestable axiom of biology, "that complete de
 siccation is the certain index of complete death."
     And this unanimity only gives      a deeper   interest
 to   the   question   under   discussion.     Because     if
 absolute desiccation is death, the        sole difficulty
 remains in determining whether it is possible for
 an animal      so  desiccated to become       once    more
 permeated with water, and thus actually revive —
 regain its lost life ?

I was     one day     talking with Professor Owen in the
Hunterian Museum, when a gentleman approached
with a request to be informed respecting the nature
of a curious fossil, which had been dug up by one
of his workmen.              As he drew the fossil            from
a   small bag and was about to hand it for examina
tion, Owen quietly remarked : — " That is the third
molar of the under-jaw              of an extinct species of
rhinoceros."          The astonishment of the gentleman
 at this precise and confident description                  of the
 fossil, before even it had quitted his hands, was
 doubtless       very great.      I   know      that  mine    was    ;

until the reflection occurred that if        some one,  little
acquainted with editions, had drawn a volume from
his pocket, declaring he had found it in an old
chest, any bibliophile would have been able to say
at a glance  :
                "  That is an Elzevir     ;
                                             " or,  " That is
one   of the Tauchnitz         classics,     stereotyped     at
Leipzig."      Owen    is as familiar with the aspect
of the teeth of animals, living and extinct, as               a
student is with the aspect of editions.           Yet  before
that knowledge       could have been acquired, before
he   could    say   thus    confidently     that   the  tooth
belonged to an extinct species          of rhinoceros, the
united labours of thousands of diligent inquirers
must    have   been   directed to the classification         of
animals.     How could he know that the rhinoceros
was  of that particular species rather than another ?
and   what is meant by species?                To trace the
history of this confidence v/ould be to tell the long
story of zoological investigation       :   a story too long
for narration here, though we may pause awhile to
consider its difficulties.
   To make     a  classified catalogue of the books in
the British Museum would be a gigantic task             ;  but
                                                 8-2

  imagine what that task would be           if  all the title-
  pages   and other    external    indications      were   de
  stroyed  !   The first attempts would necessarily         be
  of a rough approximative kind, merely endeavouring
  to make a sort of provisional order amid the chaos,
  after which    succeeding labours       might introduce
  better and better arrangements.         The books might
  first be grouped according to size          ;  but having
  got them together, it would soon be discovered
 that   size was   no indication of their contents              :
 quarto    poems and       duodecimo     histories,    octavo
 grammars      and  folio   dictionaries,    would    imme
 diately give warning     that some other arrangement
 was needed.      Nor would it be better to separate
 the books according to the languages              in which
they were written.         The presence      or absence     of
 " illustrations "  would    furnish no better guide          ;
while the bindings would soon be found to follow
no rule.      Indeed,   one   by one    all the external
characters would      prove    unsatisfactory,      and   the
labourers would finally have to decide upon some
internal characters.      Having read enough of each
book to ascertain whether it was poetry or prose             :

                STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                   117
and    if    poetry,  whether  dramatic,     epic, lyric, or
satiric   ;  and  if prose, whether history, philosophy,
theology,      philology, science, fiction,     or essay:    a
rough classification could be made           but even then
there would        be many difficulties.:   such as where
to place a work on the philosophy of history— or
the    history of science, — or. theology         under   the
guise       of science — or   essays,  on    very   different
subjects     ; while  some works      would    defy classifi
cation.
    Gigantic as this labour would be, it would be
trifling compared with the labour             of classifying
all the animals now living (not to mention extinct
species), so that the place of any one might be
securely and rapidly determined; yet the persis
tent zeal and sagacity of zoologists          have done for
the animal kingdom what has not yet been done
for the library of the Museum, although the titles
of the books are not absent.            It  has been done
by patient reading of the contents
                                           — by anatomical
investigation      of the internal structure of animals.
Except on a basis of comparative anatomy, there
could have been no better classification of animals

 118         STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
than a classification       of books according to size,
language, binding, &c.
   An    unscientific     Pliny     could     group    animals
according to their habitat      ;  but when it was known
that   whales,    though      living     in the water       and
swimming like fish, were             in reality constructed
like air-breathing quadrupeds — when it was known
that  animals    differing     so widely      as bees,   birds,
bats, and flying squirrels,       or as otters, seals,      and
cuttle-fish, lived together in the same element, it
became    obvious that such a principle of arrange
ment could lead to no practical result.
   Nor would it      suffice  to class animals according
to  their modes of feeding          ;  since    in all classes
there are samples of each mode.              Equally unsatis
factory would be external form — the seal and the
whale resembling      fishes, the worm resembling           the
eel, and the eel the serpent.
   Two    things    were     necessary:       first, that   the
structure   of various animals should             be minutely
studied   and described      —    which    is equivalent     to
reading the books to be classified         ;
                                             — and   secondly,
that some    artificial   method should be devised            of

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                 119
 so arranging     the immense mass of details        as to
 enable them to be remembered, and also to enable
 fresh discoveries readily       to find a place in the
 system.      We may be perfectly familiar with the
 contents of a book, yet wholly at a loss where to
 place  it.   If we have to catalogue      Hegel's Philo-
 sophy of History, for example, it becomes         a diffi
 cult question whether to place it under the rubric
 of  philosophy,      or   under   that  of history.    To
 decide    this point, we must have some system of
 classification.
    In  the attempts to construct a system, naturalists
 are commonly said to have followed         two methods    :
 the   artificial and     the  natural.    The   artificial
 method seizes     some    one  prominent characteristic,
 and groups      all the    individuals   together  which
agree    in this   one respect.     In  Botany the artifi
cial method classes plants according to the organs
of reproduction     ;  but this has been found so very
imperfect     that it has been       abandoned,  and the
natural method has been substituted, according to
which the whole structure of the plant determines
its place.     If  flying were taken as the artificial

120            STUDIES IN AjSTMAL          life.
basis for the grouping of some animals, we should
find insects and birds, bats and flying squirrels,
grouped together     ;   but the natural method, taking
into consideration not one character, but all essen
tial characters, finds that insects, birds, and                   bats,
differ profoundly in their organization            :       the insect
has wings, but its wings are not formed like those
of the bird, nor are those of the bird formed like
those of the bat.          The insect does not breathe
by lungs, like the bird and the bat                    :   it   has no
internal skeleton, like the bird and the bat; and
the bird, although it has many points in common
with the bat, does not, like         it,   suckle its young          ;
and thus we may run over the characters of each
organism, and find that the three animals belong
to widely different groups.
   It   is   to Linnseus   that we are indebted for the
most ingenious       and comprehensive of the many
schemes invented for the cataloguing                       of animal
forms   ;    and modern attempts at classification are
only improvements          on the plan       he laid down.
First   we may notice        his admirable invention                 of
the double names.           It   had been Tthe custom to

              STUDIES IN AMMAL LIFE.                    121
designate plants       and animals, according to some
name common          to a large, group,      to  which was
added a description          more   or less characteristic.
An. idea may be          formed    of the necessity of a
reform,    by conceiving      what, a laborious    and un
certain process it would be.         if  our friends spoke
to us of having         seen  a dog    in the garden, and
on our asking what kind of dog, instead of their
saying
         "  a terrier, a   bull-terrier, or a skye-terrier,"
they were      to attempt a description         of the dog.
Something      of this kind was the labour of under
standing the nature of an animal from the vague
description     of it given by naturalists.        Linnaeus
rebaptized the whole animal kingdom upon                one
intelligible principle*      He continued     to employ the
name common to each group, such as that of Felis
for the cats, which became the generic, name          ; and
in lieu of the description           which was given       of
each different    kind, to indicate that it was a lion,
a tiger,   a leopard,      or a domestic cat, he affixed
a specific    name    :   thus the animal       bearing  the
description of a Hon became Felis leo ; the tiger,
Felis tigris ; the leopard, Felis leopardus ; and

 122        STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
our domestic friend,       Felis catus.    These    double
names,   as  Vogt remarks, are like the Christian-"
and sur-names by which we distinguish the various
members of one family        ;  and instead of speaking
of Tomkinson with the flabby face, and Tomkinson
with the square forehead, we simply say John
and "William Tomkinson.
   Linnaeus   did more than this.         He not only
fixed definite conceptions of Species and Genera,
but introduced those of Orders and Classes. Cuvier
added Families      to    Genera,    and  Sub-kingdoms
(embranchements)      to    Classes.    Thus    a  scheme
was elaborated by which the whole animal king
dom    was  arranged     in subordinate     groups   :  the
sub-kingdoms    were divided into classes, the classes
into orders, the orders into families,       the families
into genera, the      genera     into  species,   and the
species into varieties.
   The guiding principle of anatomical resemblance
determined each of these divisions.         Those largest
groups, which resemble each other only in having
what is called the typical       character in common,
are brought   together under the first head.          Thus

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                        123
 all the groups which agree in possessing               a   back
bone and internal skeleton, although              they differ
widely in form, structure, and habitat, do neverthe
less resemble each other more than they resemble
the groups which have no backbone.
    This great division having     been formed,      it is   seen
to arrange itself in very obvious minor divisions,
or Classes     —  the   mammalia,     birds, reptiles,        and
fishes.     All  mammals resemble each other more
than     they resemble birds ;      all reptiles resemble
each other more than they resemble fishes             (in spite
of the superficial       resemblance between          serpents
and eels or lampreys).
    Each Class again falls into the minor groups of
Orders    ; and on the same principles      :  the monkeys
being     obviously   distinguished    from rodents, and
the carnivora from the ruminating animals                 ;  and
so   of the rest.
    In  each Order there are generally        Families, and
the Families fail into Genera, which differ from
each    other   only in fewer       and   less     important
characters.
    The Genera include         groups    which have          still

124             STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
fewer    differences,    and    are   called   Species ;    and
these again include groups 'which have only minute
and unimportant differences of colour,               size, and
the like, and are called Sub-species, or Varieties.
    Whoever looks at the immensity of the animal
kingdom, and observes how intelligibly and syste
matically it is arranged in these various divisions,
will admit that, however imperfect, the scheme is
 a magnificent       product     of human     ingenuity and
 labour.     It  is not an arbitrary arrangement,           like
 the grouping of the          stars in     constellations   ;   it
 expresses,     though     obscurely,     the  real   order     of
 Nature.       All   true   Classifications    should    be    to
forms     what     laws   are   to  phenomena:        the    one
 reducing      varieties   to    systematic   order,    as    the
 other   reduces      phenomena,       to their relation of
  sequence.
     Now if it be true that the classification expresses
 the real order of nature, and not simply the order
 which we        may find      convenient,    there will       be
  something more than mere resemblance indicated
 in the various groups         ;   or,  rather,  let me say,
  this resemblance itself is the consequence of some

community in the things compared, and will there
fore be the mark      of some deeper cause.               What
is this cause?      Mr. Darwin holds that "pro
pinquity of descent— the only known cause of the
similarity of organic beings — is the bond, hidden
as it is by various    degrees     of modification, which
                                                              " *
is partially revealed to us by our         classifications
— " that   the characters which naturalists            consider
as showing    true affinity between         any two or more
species  are those which      have been        inherited from
a common parent, and        in  so far    all true classifica
tion is genealogical    ;  that community           of descent
is the hidden bond which naturalists                have been
unconsciously     seeking,    and not        some unknown
plan   of creation,   or the enunciation            of general
propositions,    and the mere putting together and
 separating objects more or less alike."          f
   Before    proceeding    to   open the philosophical
discussion    which inevitably rises on the mention
of Mr. Darwin's book,        I  will here       set down      the
chief groups, according to Cuvier's classification,
for the benefit of the tyro in natural history, who
     * Daktos: Origin of  Species , p, 414.   f Ibid, p. 420.

126          STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
will easily remember theni,      and will find      tlie
knowledge constantly invoked.
   There are four Sub-kingdoms,       or Branches   : —
1. Vertebrata.    2. Mollusca.     3. Articulata.     4.
Radiata.
   The Vertebrata       consist  of four    classes : —
Mammalia, Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes.
   The Mollusca consist of six classes : — Cepha
lopoda (cuttlefish), Pteropoda, Gasteropoda (snails,
&c), Acephala     (oysters, &c),   Brachiopoda,     and
Cirrhopoda (barnacles). — N.B. This last class of
barnacles is now removed from the Molluscs and
placed among the Crustaceans.
    The Articulata are composed of four classes : —
Annelids (worms), Crustacea (lobsters, crabs, &c),
Arachnida (spiders), and Insecta.
    The Radiata embrace all the remaining forms         ;
but this group has been so altered since Cuvier's
time,   that  I will not burden your memory just
now with an enumeration of the details.
    The reader is now in   a  condition  to appreciate
 the general line of argument adopted in the dis
cussion of Mr. Darwin's book, which is at present

                STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                 127
exciting    very great attention,      and which   will, at
any rate,      aid in general     culture   by opening    to
many minds new tracts of thought.               The benefit
in this direction is, however, considerably lessened
by the      extreme     vagueness which       is commonly
attached to the word
                            "  species," as well as by the
great     want     of philosophic     culture   which   im
poverishes the majority of our naturalists.         I have
heard,     or read,     few arguments      on this subject
which have not impressed me with the sense that
the disputants really attached no distinct ideas to
many of the phrases they were uttering.             Yet it
is obvious that we must first settle what are the
 facts  grouped together and indicated by the word
"  species,
             "
                 before we can carry on any discussion
as to the    origin of species.      To be battling about
the fixity or variability of species, without       having
 rigorously settled what species is, can lead to no
 edifying result.
    It is notorious that     if you ask even a zoologist,
 What is      a   species ? you   will almost always find
 that he has only a very vague            answer to give;
 and   if  his answer be precise, it will be the pre

128            STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
cision of error, and will vanish into contradictions
directly it is examined.         The consequence of this
is, that even the ablest zoologists are constantly
at variance      as  to  specific    characters, and often
cannot     agree   whether     an   animal    shall be con
sidered     of   a  new    species,    or  only a variety.
There could be no such disagreements if specific
characters were definite       : if  we knew what species
meant, once and for all.            Ask a chemist, What
is a salt    ? What an acid ? and his reply will be
definite, and uniformly the same           :  what he says,
all chemists will repeat.           Not so the zoologist.
 Sometimes       he   will   class    two    animals   as   of
 different species,    when they only differ in colour,
 in size, or in the numbers of tentacles, &c.             ; at
 other   times he will class animals            as belonging
 to the same species,       although they differ in size,
 colour,    shape,  instincts, habits,     &c.     The dog,
 for example, is said to be one species with many
 varieties, or races.      But contrast the pug-dog with
 the greyhound,       the spaniel with the mastiff, the
 bulldog with the Newfoundland,             the setter   with
 the terrier,   the sheepdog with the pointer          : note

                STUDIES         IN ANIMAL LIFE.                     129
the    striking differences in their                 structure      and
their instincts         :  and      you     will find that they
differ   as    widely      as    some      genera, and as most
species.       If    these      varieties     inhabited       different
countries — if the pug were peculiar to Australia,
and the mastiff to Spain — there is not a naturalist
but would class them as of different species.                       The
 same remark applies to pigeons and ducks, oxen
and sheep.
     The reason of this uncertainty is that the thing
 Species does         not exist      :   the term      expresses       an
 abstraction,       like Virtue,          or Whiteness ;          not   a
 definite concrete          reality, which can be separated
 from other things, and always be found the same.
 Nature     produces         individuals     ;   these individuals
 resemble each other in varying degrees                   ;  according
 to their resemblances we group them together as
 classes,    orders,      genera, and          species  ;   but    these
 terms only express the relations                  of resemblance,
 they do not indicate the existence of such things
 as classes, orders, genera, or species.*
    * Cuvier    says,  in so many words, that classes, orders,        and
 genera, are abstractions,    et rien de pared n'existe dans la nature ;
 but that species is not an abstraction! — SezLettres a Pfaff, p. 179.

    There is  a  reality indicated by each term— that is
to say, a real relation ; but there is no objective
existence of which we could say, This is variable >
This is immutable.           Pecisely   as there is a real
relation indicated by the term Goodness, but there
is no Goodness apart, from the virtuous actions
and feelings which we. group          together under this
term.      It   is true that     metaphysicians      in past
ages    angrily debated     respecting the Immutability
of Virtue, and had no more suspicion                 of their
absurdity, than moderns have who debate respect
ing the Fixity of Species.          Yet no sooner do       we
 understand       that   Species   means     a   relation   of
 resemblance between animals, than the question of
 the   Fixity, or Variability,       of    Species   resolves
 itself into this     : Can there be any variation          in
 the resemblances of closely          allied   animals ?     A
 question which would never be asked.
     No one has thought of raising the question of
 the fixity of varieties, yet it is as legitimate as that
  of the fixity of species     ; and we might also argue
  for the fixity of genera, orders, classes       ; the fixity
  of all these being implied in the very terms         ; since

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                          131
no sooner       does       any departure         from    the   type
present     itself,     than    by that    it is excluded from
the    category ;        no   sooner     does     a  white    object
become      gray, or yellow, than it is excluded from
the class of white objects.               Here, therefore, is a
sense in which the phrase
                                        " fixity of species " is
indisputable;          but in     this sense the phrase has
never      been     disputed.         When       zoologists    have
maintained       that      species    are    variable, they have
meant that animal forms are variable ; and these
variations,     gradually       accumulating,       result   at last
in such differences         as are called specific.      Although
some      zoologists,       and speculators        who were      not
zoologists,     have       believed that the possibility of
variation is so great that one species may actually
be transmuted           into another, i.e., that an ass may
be developed into             a   horse, —yet most         thinkers
are    now    agreed       that    such violent      changes     are
impossible ;       and that every            new form      becomes
established      only      through     the long and gradual
accumulation        of minute        differences     in divergent
 directions.         -                     -
    It  is clear, from what has just been said, that

132           STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
the many angry discussions           respecting the fixity
of species, which, since the days of Lamarck, have
disturbed the amity of zoologists          and speculative
philosophers,      would    have   been   considerably   ab
breviated,    had      men    distinctly appreciated     the
equivoque which rendered their arguments hazy.
I am   far from implying that the battle was purely
a   verbal   one.     I  believe there was a real        and
important distinction in the doctrines of the two
camps    ;  but   it   seems   to me    that   had a clear
understanding        of the fact that Species was         an
abstract term,       been    uniformly present to their
minds, they would have sooner come to an agree
ment.      Instead of the confusing         disputes   as to
whether one       Species could ever become         another
 Species, the question would have been, Are animal
 forms changeable?        Can the descendants of animals
become so     unlike their ancestors, in certain pecu
liarities of structure or instinct, as to be classed by
naturalists as a different species ?
    No sooner is the question thus disengaged from
equivoque, than its discussion          becomes   narrowed
within well-marked         limits.   That animal      forms

                  STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                                          133
 are variable,      is disputed                 by no     zoologist.           The
 only    question      which remains                is this       :   To ichat
 extent are animal forms variable ?                          The answers
given have been two                  :    one    school    declaring           that
the extent of variability is limited to those trifling
characteristics        which mark the different varieties
of each      species    ;       the other school declaring                     that
the variability is indefinite,                    and that all animal
forms       may    have          arisen     from    successive              modifi
cations of a very few types, or even of one type.
     Now,    I would            call your attention          to one point
in this discussion, which ought to be remembered
when antagonists                 are growing         angry and bitter
over    the subject         :    it is, that both         these opinions
are necessarily hypothetical                — there       can be       nothing
like positive proof adduced on either side.                                   The
utmost that either hypothesis                      can claim          is,   that   it
is    more    consistent          with general            analogies,           and
better serves      to bring our knowledge                         of various
points into harmony.                     Neither of them can claim
to be   a   truth which warrants dogmatic decision.
     Of these two hypotheses, the                         first       has      the
weight      and majority            of authoritative              adherents.

 It declares that all the different kinds of Cats, for
 example, were distinct and independent             creations,
each species being originally what we see it to be
now, and what it will continue to be as long as it
 exists  :  lions,   panthers,   pumas,    leopards,   tigers,
jaguars, ocelots, and domestic cats, being so many
original stocks, and not so many divergent forms of
 one  original stock.     The second hypothesis declares
 that all these kinds of cats represent divergencies
 of the original stock, precisely       as  the Varieties of
 each kind represent the divergencies of each Species.
    It  is true that each speeies, when once formed,
 only admits        of limited     variations ;    any . cause
 which should push the variation              beyond certain
 limits    would     destroy   the   species,  — because     by
 species   is meant the group of animals contained
within those limits.          Let us suppose the original
 stock from       which all these kinds of cats have
 sprung,      to   have   become     modified    into    lions,
 leopards,      and tigers- — in   other   wrords,   that   the
 gradual accumulation         of divergencies has resulted
in the whole family of cats existing under these
three    forms.       The   lions -will    form    a  distinct'

species ;   this species     varies, and      in the course
of long variation      a  new species, the puma, rises
by the side of it.         The leopards also vary, and
let us suppose their variation          at length   assumes
so marked a form, — in the ocelot, — that we class
it  as a new species.          There   is nothing in this
hypothesis     but   what     is strictly consonant       with
analogies ;    it is only extending to Species what
we know to be the fact          with respect to Varieties     ;
and these Varieties wThich we know to have been
produced from one and the same Species are often
more widely separated from each              other than the
lion is from the puma, or the leopard from the
 ocelot.   Mr. Darwin remarks            that   "at   least a
 score of pigeons might be chosen, which,           if  shown
 to an ornithologist,       and he were told that         they
 were   wild    birds,   would     certainly,   I  think,   bo
 ranked by him as well-defined species.            Moreover,
 I  do   not  believe     that any ornithologist would
 place the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler,

 same    genus  !  more especially as in each of these
 breeds several truly-inherited sub-breeds or species,

     The development         of numerous      specific forms,
  widely distinguished from each other, out of one
  common        stock, is not a whit more improbable
  than the development          of numerous     distinct lan
  guages out of a common parent language, which
  modern philologists have proved to be indubitably
  the   case.      Indeed, there is      a very remarkable
  analogy     between philology       and  zoology    in this
  respect  :  just as the comparative anatomist traces
 the    existence      of  similar    organs,   and    similar
 connections        of   these   organs,   throughout      the
 various     animals    classed under one type, so does
 the    comparative       philologist   detect   the   family
 likeness     in the various languages scattered from
 China to the Basque provinces,            and from Cape
 Comorin across the Caucasus to Lapland — a like
ness which assures him that the Teutonic, Celtic,
Windic,      Italic,   Hellenic,  Iranic,  and Indie     lan
guages are of common origin, and separated from
the Arabian,        Aramean, and Hebrew           languages,
which have another origin.          Let us bring together

are   offshoots from the Latin, which was once a
living language, but which is now, so to speak, a
fossil.    The various species of cats do not differ
more than these six languages differ          : and yet the
resemblances      point in each      case    to  a   common
origin.     Max Muller,      in his brilliant      essay    on

was   silent as to the former existence of         a  Roman
empire,     a mere   comparison      of the six Roman
dialects would enable us to say, that at some time
there must have been a language from which all

impossible           to account for the facts exhibited                  by

It   is clear, even                  from a short consideration           of
these forms, first, that all are but varieties of one
common            type     ;   secondly, that it is impossible           to
consider         any one            of these     six paradigms      as the
original from which the others had been borrowed.
To this       wre       may add, thirdly, that in none of the
languages to which these verbal forms belong, do
we    find the elements of which they could have
been composed.                     If   we  find such forms as         fai

to the radical means which French has still at its
command,             and the same               may be        said even        of
compounds like                  j' aimer ai9    i.e. je-aimer-ai%      I have
to love,     I shall          love.     But      a change from        je snis
to tic     es    is inexplicable             by the light of French
grammar.              These         forms     could not have           grown,
so;    to speak, on French soil, but must have been
handed down as relics from a former period — must
have existed            in some language antecedent to any
of the Roman dialects.                      Now, fortunately, in this
case, we are          not left to a mere inference, but as we
possess the Latin verb, we                          can    prove how,         by
phonetic         corruption,          and by mistaken             analogies,
every one of the six paradigms is but a national
metamorphosis of the Latin original.

    "  From     a  careful consideration            of these forms,
we    ought to draw exactly the same conclusion                         ;
firstly, that all are but varieties of one common
type; secondly, that it is impossible to consider
any of them as the original from which the others
have been borrowed ; and                 thirdly, that here again,
 none of the languages in which these verbal forms
 occur possess          the    elements       of which they are
 composed."
    All    these languages            resemble       each    other    so
 closely    that    they      point to       some       more ancient
 language which was to them what Latin was to
 the six Eomance             languages ; and in the               same
 way we are justified              in supposing          that   all the
 classes     of    the vertebrate animals               point to the
  existence of some           elder type, now extinct,             from
  which they were all developed.

  I have tlius     stated what are the two hypotheses
on this question*         There is only one more pre
liminary which it is needful to notice here, and
that is, to caution the reader against the tendency,
unhappily too          common,         of supposing          that an
adversary holds        opinions which are transparently
absurd.      When we hear an hypothesis which is
either novel, or unacceptable to us, we are apt to
draw some very ridiculous conclusion                   from    it,   and
to assume that      this conclusion           is   seriously held      by
its upholders.         Thus the zoologists who maintain
the variability of species, are sometimes asked                       if
they believe       a   goose was developed out                 of     an
oyster, or   a   rhinoceros       from   a    mouse    ?   the ques
tioner apparently having no misgiving as to the
candour of his ridicule.
   There are three modes of combating                    a   doctrine.
The first     is   to point out its strongest positions,
and then      show them to be erroneous or incom
plete   ;   but this plan     is       generally       difficult, and
sometimes impossible          ;   it   is   not, therefore, much
in vogue.        The second        is   to render the doctrine
ridiculous, by pretending              that   it    includes   certain

142          STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
extravagant    propositions,   of which it is entirely
innocent,     The third is to render       the   doctrine
odious, by forcing on it certain conclusions, which
it would   repudiate, but which are declared to be
   the inevitable consequences
                                  " of such   a doctrine.
Now it is undoubtedly        true that men frequently
maintain very absurd opinions       ;  but it is neither
candid, nor wise, to assume that men who other
wise are    certainly   not fools, hold opinions      the
absurdity of which is transparent.
    Let us not, therefore,      tax   the  followers    of
Lamarck,     Geoffroy    St. Hilaire,   or Mr.    Darwin
with absurdities      they  have  not   advocated  ;  but
rather endeavour to see what solid argument they
have for the basis of their hypothesis.

A witty friend of             mine     expressed her sense        of
the remoteness of the ancient Egyptians, and her
difficulty in sympathizing            with them, by declaring
that      " they    talked   in    beetles,   you    hioiv"      She
 referred, of course, to the hieroglyphics                in which
 that curious people now speak to us from ancient
 tombs.        Whether       in their beetle-speech those
 swarthy sages were eloquent and wise, or obscure
 and otherwise, it is certain that entomologists                   of
 our     day recognize their beetles             as belonging      to
 the      same     species    that    are    now     gathered into

collections.     Such as the Egyptians knew them,
such we know them now.             Nay, the sacred cats
found    in those ancient      tombs,    are  cats  of the
same    kind as our own familiar mousers            ;   they
purred     before   Pharaoh     as   they   purr   on    our
hearthrugs    ;  and   the   descendants     of the     very
dogs which      irreligiously worried     those cats,     are
to  this day worrying the descendants             of those
sacred cats.       The   grains    of wheat, which       the
savans found in the Egyptian tombs, were planted
in the soil of France, and grew into waving corn,
in no respect distinguishable from the corn grown
from the grain of the previous year.
   Have these familiar facts any important            signi
ficance ?    Are we entitled to draw any conclusion
from the testimony       of paintings and sculptures,
at least four thousand years old, which show that
several   of our well-known         Species   of animals,
and   several of the well-marked          Eaces   of men,
existed then, and have not changed since then ?
Nimrod      hunted    with   dogs    and   horses,   which
would be claimed as ancestors by the dogs and
horses   at  Melton Mowbray.           The Negroes who

attended     Semiramis     and   Rharnses         are  in every
respect similar to tlie Negroes now toiling amid
the   sugar-canes      of Alabama.           If, during        four
thousand      years    Species    and      Eaces      have      not
changed, why should we suppose that they ever
will change    ?   Why should      we not take our stand
on that testimony,         and   assert     that Species are
unchangeable.
    Such   has been      the argument           of Cuyier and
his followers; an argument on which they have
laid great stress, and which             they have        further
 strengthened     by a     challenge      to    adversaries       to
 produce   one    single   case where a          transmutation
 of  species    has taken     place  : — " Here        we    show
 you   evidence     that   Species     have      persisted       un
 altered   during     four   thousand        years,    and      you
 cannot show us a single case of Species having
 changed — you       cannot   sh^w      us     one    case    of    a
 wolf becoming a dog, an ass becoming a horse,
 a  hare becoming a rabbit.         Yet you must admit
 that   if  there     were   any   inherent tendency to
 change,    four   thousand     years is a long           enough
 period for that tendency to display itself in              ,*   and

we ought to see a very marked difference between
the    Species which lived               under     Semiramis,           and
those which are living under                     Victoria.        Instead
of this,    we see that     there has been no change                       :
the dog has remained             a       dog, the horse has re
mained     a horse   ;   every    Species retains its well-
marked characters."
     No one will say that            I    have    not done justice
to    this argument.       I     have       stated    it     as   clearly
and forcibly as possible,            not with any design to
captivate your assent, but                 to make the answer
complete*      This argument is the cheval de bataille
of the Cuvier school        ;    but like many other argu
mentative war-horses, it proves, on close inspection,
to be spavined and brokenwinded.
     The first criticism we must pass on it                       is,   that
it    implies the existence of Species as                     a    thing,
which can be spoken               of as fixed or variable                 ;
whereas, as we saw in the, last chapter, Species
is    an abstraction,     like Whiteness or Strength.
No    one supposes that there exists any whiteness
apart from white things,                 or strength       apart from
strong     things
                ;    yet the naturalists             who maintain

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                       147
the fixity of Species, constantly talk as            if  Species
existed independently           of the individual animals.
Instead of saying that by the word                   Species is
indicated     a   certain group of characters, and that
whenever we meet with this group we say, here
is an animal of the same Species              ; they explicitly
declare, or tacitly       imply, that although          an indi
vidual dog may vary, there is something                    above
all   individuals. — the       Species — and      that    cannot
vary.
    As it is possible          some, readers may protest
 that   no respectable authority in modern                 times
 ever held the opinion          here imputed to a school,
 I will   quote    the very explicit language of one of
 Cuvier's    disciples — the last        editor   of Bnffon —
 who,    no    later    than    1856,     could   declare    that
 " Species      are   the    primitive     forms    of Nature.
 Individuals are nothing but the representatives —
 the copies, of these forms           : Les   especes    soni les

vagant      statement, an individual dog is nothing
but     a   copy       of the primitive form — the typical
clog — the        idea       of    a    dog,         as    Plato would         say    ;
and of course,               if   this be true, it matters little
how widely individual                         dogs may vary, the type,
or     species,        of which               it    is the       representative,
remains unaltered.
      Indeed it is on this ground that many physio
logists explain the fact of hereditary transmission                                  :
the individual may vary, it is said, but the species
is preserved       ;    and       if   a    dog, without its fore paws,
has offspring,           every         one         of which possesses           the

    I  have too much respect        for the reader to drag
 him through a refutation           of such philosophy       as
 this; the statement of the opinion is enough.
 And    yet, unless      some     such   opinion be main
 tained,   the   doctrine     of Fixity      of   Species    is
 without a basis    ;  for  if it  be said that the group
 of characters which constitute the dog are incap
 able   of change, and in this sense            Species     are
fixed,   we   have   to ask what       evidence    there   can
be   for such an assertion ? since it is notorious
that individual dogs do show a change in some
of the     characters     of the group.       We shall be
referred    to  the    Egyptian      tombs    for    evidence.
M. Flourens assures us that not only                are  these
tombs     evidence that      Species    have   not    changed
in four thousand        years, but that no species         has
changed — aucune         espece    n'a   change — which      is
surely stepping a long way beyond the precincts
of the tombs ?
    It  may be paradoxical,         but it is strictly true,
that the fact of particular species having remained

unaltered         during four thousand                      years,        does       not

ception      is formed,     it  can gain no fresh strength
from any particular instance.               If  we believe that
crows     are     black,   we     do   not   hold that       belief
more firmly when we are shown that crows were
black four thousand           years ago.       In like   manner,
if it  is an admitted          fact that individuals always
reproduce        individuals      closely   resembling      them
selves, it is not a whit more surprising that the
dogs    of Victoria        should     resemble     the dogs    :  of
Semiramis,        than that they should resemble their
parents    :    the .chain     of four thousand         years     is
made      up      of many       links,    each   link being        a
repetition       of the other.          So long as a        single
pair of dogs, resembling               each   other,   unite,,   -so
long will there be specimens                 of that species;
simply because         the children inherit the charac
teristics      of the    parents.        So long as Negroes
marry     with Negroes,           and Jews      with   Jews,      so
long must there be            a   perpetuation     of the Negro
and Jewish types         ;  but the tenth generation adds
nothing to the evidence of the first, nor the ten*
thousandth to the tenth,
   I   believe that this fallacy, which             destroys the

  152         STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
 whole value of the Cuvierian argument,            has not
 before been pointed out      ; and even now, you may,
 perhaps, ask   if the fixity of Species is not proved
 by the fact that like produces like ?      Not so.    Nay
 it is only by the aid of such   a fact in organic nature
 that we can imagine new species          to have arisen   :
 in other words, those who believe in the variability
 of Species, and the introduction of new forms by
 means of modification from the old, always invoke
 the law of hereditary      transmission    as the means
 of establishing accidental variations.
    Thus, let us suppose the Egyptian king to have
had one hundred dogs, all of them staghounds, and
no other form of dog to have existed at that time
in that country    ; the dog species would be repre
sented by the staghound.        These staghounds would
transmit to their offspring all their specific charac
ters.    But, as every one   knows, however much dogs
may resemble       each   other,   they   always   present
individual    differences    in size, colour,    strength,
intelligence,   &c.   Now, if any one of these         dif
ferences should happen to become marked, and to
increase by the intermarriage of two dogs similarly

                STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                    153
  distinguished by the marked peculiarity, this pecu
  liarity   would   in   time    become      established     by
  hereditary transmission,     and would form the start*
 ing-point of    a new race of dogs — say the greyhound
 -— unless it    were obliterated    by intermarriage with
 dogs of the old       type.    In    the former     case, we
 should have two races of dogs among the descend
 ants of those figured on the Egyptian tombs             ;  but
 as   one   of these   races   would     still  preserve    the
 original staghound type, Cuvier would refer to it
 as a    proof that species    had not varied.        We, on
 the other hand, should         point to the greyhound
 as  proof that animal forms are variable, and that
 a   new form had arisen from modification             of the
 old.
     An objection will  at once be raised to       this illus
tration, to the effect that all zoologists         admit the
possibility     of new     Varieties,    or    Races,   being
formed    ;  but they deny that new Species can be
formed.      It  is here that the equivoque of the
word     Species prevents a clear understanding              of
each other's argument.         Whiteness may justly be
said to be unalterable     ; but white things may vary

154:           STUDIES IN AJSIMAL LIFE.
—they      may   become    gray,   or  yellow.     In  like
manner Species must be invariable, because Species
is  a word  indicating a particular group of characters    ;
.but  animals    may vary in these characters;        they
may present some of the characters less, or more,
developed    ;  and they may even want some of them.
Now     as  there   is no absolute standard of what
constitutes     Species, what    Sub-species,    and what
Varieties, it becomes impossible to say whether any
individual variation in an animal form shall consti
tute a new Variety, or . a new Species.       With regard
to dogs the differences between the various races
 are so numerous,      and so marked, as would suffice
to constitute     species  and even      genera,  in other
 groups of animals.
    We must reliquish the idea of proving anything
by the paintings       and sculptures     of the ancients.

 o.wn;   but this     does  not  disprove    the fact that
 steani-ploughs, and ploughs of various construction,
 have been since invented,      all of them being modi

fications of the original type.      Formerly, and for
many    years,   the   stage-coach   was   our  approved
mode of conveyance — and it is still kept up in
some districts; nevertheless, modifications of .coach-
road   into tramroad,      and tramroad    into railroad,
have gradually resulted in a mode of conveyance
utterly unlike the stage-coach.      It is the same with
animals.     Let us never forget that Species     have no
existence.     Only individuals exist, and these all
vary more or less from each other.             When the
variations   are  slight, they have no name       ;  when
they are more marked, and are transmitted from
one generation to another, they constitute        particu.-.
lar Eaces, or Varieties     ; when the differences are
still more marked they constitute Sub-species; but,
as  Mr. Darwin      says,
                           " Certainly  no clear line of
demarcation     has yet been drawn between         Species
and Sub-species     ; that is, the forms which in the
opinion of some naturalists come very near to, but
do. not quite arrive at the   rank of Species; or again,
between Sub-species       and well-marked Varieties, or
between lesser Varieties and individual differences.
These    differences   blend   into each    other   in an

156            STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
insensible series   ;  and a series impresses the mind
with the idea of an actual passage."
    But the    same process    of divergence which esta
blishes Varieties out of individual differences, and
Species out of Varieties,        also serves to establish
 Genera out of Species, Orders out of Genera, and
 Classes out of Orders,
    It   is, doubtless,  difficult to conceive by what
process of modification,        two   animals  of distinct
 Genera, say a dog and a cat, were produced from a
common stock      ; but organic analogies in abundance
render it easy of belief.        If  we knew as much of
zoology as we do of embryology, in respect of the
 affinities  of divergent forms, it would be far less
 surprising that two different Genera should arise
 from a common stock, than that all the various
 parts of the skeleton should arise from a common
 osseous     element.    We    know    that the jaws    are
 identical with arms and legs — both being divergent
 modifications of a common osseous structure.          We
 know that the arm of a man is identical with the fin
 of a whale, or the wing of a bird.        The differences
 here in form, size, and function are much greater

             STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                    157
 than the differences which establish          orders and
 classes in the animal series.
    Unless animal forms were modifications of some
common type, it would be difficult to explain their
remarkable affinities.      As Mr. Darwin says, "      It is
a  truly wonderful fact — the wonder of which we are
apt to overlook from familiarity — that all animals
and all plants throughout all time and space should
be related to each other       in group, subordinate to
group, in the manner which we everywhere behold,
namely, varieties of the same species most closely
related together, species      of the same genus less
closely   and unequally      related  together,    forming
sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera
much less closely related, and genera related in
different  degrees,   forming sub-families,       families,
orders, sub-classes, and classes.       The several sub
ordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked in a
single file, but seem rather to be clustered round
points, and these round other points, and so on in
almost    endless  circles.    On   the view that each
species has been independently        created,  I  can see
no explanation of this great fact in the classification

153          STUDIES IN ANIMAL LITE.
of all organic beings   ;  but to the best of my judg
ment it is explained through inheritance, and the
complex action of natural        selection, entailing      ex
tinction and divergence of character.        The affinities
of all the beings of the same class have sometimes
been represented by a great tree.          I   believe    this
simile largely speaks     the truth.     The green and
budding twigs may represent existing species           ;  and
those produced during each former year may repre
 sent the long     succession of extinct      species.      At
 each period of growth      all the growing twigs have
 tried to branch out on all sides,, and to overtop and
 kill  the surrounding twigs       and branches, in the
 same manner as species and groups         of species have
 tried to overmaster other species          in the       great
 struggle   for life.  The limbs divided into great
 branches,    and these into lesser branches, were
 themselves once, when the tree was small, budding
 twigs;    and this connection       of the former and
 present    buds   by ramifying branches,          may wTell
  represent the classification of all extinct and living
  species in groups subordinate to groups.            Of the
  rnany twigs whicn flourished when the tree was a

mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great
branches,     yet   survive    and    bear    all the other
branches.      So with the species which lived during
long-past    geological   periods,    very few now have
living and modified descendants.            ...      As buds
give rise by growth        to fresh buds, and these,         if
vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many
a  feebler branch  :  so by generation,      I believe, it has
been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with
its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth,
 and covers the surface with its ever-branching            and
 beautiful ramifications."*
    It will  not be expected      that in these brief and
 desultory remarks     I  should touch on all, or nearly
 all, the important       points in the discussion          re
 specting the Fixity of Species.        Mr. Darwin's book
 is in everybody's hands, and my object has been to
 facilitate, if  possible,   the comprehension          of his
 book, and the adoption         of a more philosophical
 hypothesis,    by pointing out the weakness of the
 chief argument on the other side.             There is one
 more argument which may be noticed — the more

so as   it is constantly adduced       with,   triumph by the
one school,        and admitted      as a     difficulty by the
 other.     Its force is  so great that      it prevents many
from accepting the development hypothesis.                  It is
the argument founded on the alleged impossibility
of Hybrids continuing the race.                 More than two
or three generations         of Hybrids, it is said, can
never be maintained; after            that,     the new form
perishes     :  thus clearly showing      how Nature repu
diates such amalgamations, and keeps her species
jealously distinct and invariable.              This argument
is held to be the touchstone              of the doctrine of
species.       I wish  it were  so ;  because,      in that case,
the question would no longer be one of hypothesis,
since we have now the indubitable proof that some
Hybrids are fertile unto the thirteenth generation
and onwards.
    A   history of the various attempts which have
been made to prove and disprove the fertility of
Hybrids,       would lead us beyond our limits; the
curious reader is referred to the works cited below.*

One decisive ease alone shall be given here, and
no one   will dispute that it is decisive.
   The    hare   (lepus    timidus)      is  assuredly of   a
distinct species from the rabbit (lepus cunicidus).
So distinct are these species, that any classification
which    should   range them as one, would violate
every accepted    principle.     The hare is solitary, the
rabbit gregarious    ; the hare lives on the surface of
the earth, the rabbit      burrows      under the surface    ;
the hare makes her home among the bushes, the
rabbit makes a sort of nest for her young in her
burrow — keeping them there till they are weaned             ;
the hare has reddish-brown          flesh, the rabbit white
flesh ;  while the odour exhaled by each, and the
flavour of each, are unmistakeably different.            The
hare has many anatomical characters differing from
those of the rabbit      :   such as greater length and
strength   of the hind        legs,   larger   body, shorter
intestine,   thicker skin, firmer hair, and different
colour.    The hare breeds only twice or thrice
a  year, and at each litter has only two or four       ;  the
rabbit will breed eight times a year, and each time
has four, six, seven, and even eight young ones.

 Finally, the two        are  violent  foes :  the rabbits
 always destroy the hares, and all sportsmen are
 aware that    if the  rabbits be suffered to multiply on
 an estate, there will be small chance of hares.
   Nevertheless between species so distinct as these,
 a new hybrid race has been reared by         M. Eouy, of
 Angouleme,       who each year sends to market up
wards of a thousand of his Leporicles, as he calls
them.      His object    was  primarily commercial, not
scientific.     His experiments, extending from 1847
to the present time, have not only been of great
commercial value — introducing a new and valuable
breed — but have excited the attention of scientific
men, who are now availing themselves of his skill
and experience to help them in the solution of
minor problems.         It is enough to note here, that
these hybrids of the hare and the rabbit are fertile,
not only with either hares or rabbits, but with each
oilier.     Thirteen generations      have already been
enumerated, and the last remains so vigorous that
no cessation whatever is to be anticipated.
   In   presence of   this case (and others, though less
striking, might be named) there is but one alter

native; either we must declare that rabbits and
hares form one and the same species — which is
absurd — or we must admit           that new types      may
be formed by the union of two existing types ; and
consequently     that   species   are valuable.      If  the
docrine   of Fixity of Species         acknowledges      the
touchstone    of hybridity,     the fate of the doctrine
is settled for ever.
   Although    I  conceive    the doctrine     of Fixity of
Species to be altogether wrong,         I cannot say that
the arguments      adduced in favour of the develop
ment    hypothesis    rise higher than a high degree
of probability, still very far from demonstration ;
they will leave      even   the    most   willing disciple
beset  with difficulties and doubts.         "When    stated
in general terms, that hypothesis has         a fascinating
symmetry     and simplicity, but no        sooner    do we
apply it to particular      cases, than a     thick veil of
 mystery   descends,     and our pathway        becomes    a
mere blind groping towards the light.             There i&

 fications of one original form          ;  but there are many
 things perfectly conceivable, which have neverthe
 less no      existence;     there   are    many explanations
perfectly probable, which are not true               ;   and when
we come to seek for the evidence                of the develop
ment hypothesis,         that evidence       fails us.      It  may
be true, but we cannot say that                it is true.       Ten
years ago,      I espoused the      hypothesis, and believed
that it was the truth            ; but ten years of study,
instead of deepening,           have   loosened that convic
tion   :  they have      strengthened        my   opposition       to
the hypothesis        of fixity of species, but they have
given greater force to the difficulties             which beset
the development hypothesis,                and have made me
feel that       at  present    the    requisite     evidence       is
wanting.        I  conclude with reminding the reader
that the       question    of the origin of species            is at
present      incapable     of a positive       answer     ; of the
two hypotheses,         that of development            seems     the
more harmonious           with our knowledge           ;  but it is
no more than an hypothesis,                 and will probably
for     ever    remain      one*     Now,      an    hypothesis,
although      indispensable       as a provisional        mode of

grouping     together   facts,  and giving them        some
sort of explanation,      is after all only   a guess,   and
it may   be absurdly wide      of the truth.    In Natural
History, as in all other departments of specula
tive ingenuity, there have been a goodly number
of outrageously     extravagant       hypotheses,   gravely
propounded, and credulously accepted.          Men prefer
an absurd guess to a blank; they would                rather
have   a  false opinion than       no opinion;    and one
of the last developments of philosophic culture,
is the power of abstaining from forming an opinion,
where the necessary data are absent.
   If  you wish to see how easily hypotheses             are
formed and      accepted,    you   need only turn       over
the history of any science.         If  you want a laugh
at  credulity,   read a chapter of Pliny's Natural
History.     Pliny is     a  classic,   and was   for cen
turies an authority     ;  but looked at with impartial
eyes,   he appears    the veriest
                                      " old woman
                                                     " that
ever wrote    in  a beautiful    style.   He  was a mere
bookworm, without a particle of scientific insight.
His   was not an age when men had much               regard
to evidence   ; but to him the suspicion never seems

 168          STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE,
 to have occurred that Gossip    Eeport could be given
to romancing,    or that travellers could  " see  strange
things."     No fable is too monstrous      for his cre
dulity.
    One of the pretty fables Pliny repeats, is, that
pearls   are  formed by drops of dew falling into
the gaping valves of the oyster.      It never occurred
to him to ask whether oysters were ever exposed
to the dew ? whether the drops could fall into their
valves? whether oysters kept their valves open,
except when under water ? or, finally,          whether,
if  the dew did fall in, it would remain a rounded
 drop ?   The drop of dew had      a certain superficial
resemblance to the pearl, and that was enough.
iElian's    hypothesis   was    somewhat     better  : he
 supposed that the pearls were produced by light
ning flashing into the open shells.
    Turning from these ancient      sages, you   will ask
how pearls are formed ?        And almost any inge
nious modern, not a zoologist, will tell you (and
tell you falsely), that the pearl is  a disease    of the
oyster.    One is somewhat fatigued with the merci
less frequency    with which     this notion has been

              STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                      167
dragged in, as an illustration             of genius issuing
out   of sorrow and adversity          ;  and it is time to
stop that
              " damnable iteration"          by   discrediting
the notion.      Know then, that if
                            " most wretched men
       Are cradled into poetry by- wrong i
       They learn in suffering what they teach in song
                                                       "—
it is not true that oysters secrete in suffering what
women wear as necklaces.              Disease would be the
very worst cradle for pearls.           The idea of disease
originated in a fanciful supposition of pearls being
to the    oyster and mussel what             gall-stones   and
urinary calculi are to higher and more suffering
animals.     Eeaumur,       to whom we        owe    so many
good observations and suggestive ideas, came near
the truth when,         in 1717, he showed that the
structure of pearls was identical with .the structure
of the shells in which they grow.              He attributed
their formation to the morbid effusion of coagula
ting shell-material.
   I presume     you know that shells are formed by
a secretion from the mantle         ?    The mantle is that
delicate   semi-transparent        membrane       which    you

168         STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
observe,  on opening, a mussel        or oyster, lining
the whole interior of the shells, and having at its
free margins    a  sort of fringe of delicate tentacles,
which are sensitive and retractile.       A microscopic
examination    of these fringes     shows them     to be
glandular in structure — that is, they are secreting
organs.    The whole mantle, indeed, is      a secreting
organ, and its secretion is the shell material      : the
fringes secrete the colouring matters of the shell,
and   enlarge its circumference;        the rest of the
mantle secretes the nacre, or mother-of-pearl,        and
increases the thickness of the shell.         Now it is
obvious that the formation       of pearl nacre, and of
pearls,  depends on the healthy condition         of the
mantle,   not   on its diseases.     If  the mantle be
injured the nacre is not secreted at all, or in less
quantities.   *
   But although pearls depend upon the healthy, not
the diseased, activity of the mantle, it is clear that
there must be some unusual condition         present for
their formation   ;  since the secretion of nacre does
not   spontaneously     assume    the form    of pearls.
What is   the unusual     condition ?    Naturalists are

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                       169
at present divided         into two camps, fighting vigor
ously for victory.        The one side maintains that the
origin of a pearl is this — an egg of the oyster has
escaped and strayed under the mantle            ;  or the egg
of a parasite has been deposited there             ;  this egg
forms the nucleus, round which the nacre forms,
and thus we have the pearl.
    The other side maintains with great positiveness
that anything will form a nucleus, a grain of sand,
 no less than the egg of a parasite.            'Tis   a  pretty
 quarrel, which we may leave them to settle.               Some
 aver that grains of sand are more numerous                 than
anything     else  ;  but Mobius says that of forty-four
 sea pearls, and fifteen fresh-water pearls, examined
by him, not one contained             a grain  of sand    ;  and
Filippi, who has extensively investigated this sub
ject, denies that a grain of sand ever forms the
nucleus of a true pearl.          Both Filippi and Kiichen-
meister* declare that a parasite              gets   into the
mussel or oyster, and its presence there stimulates
an active secretion of nacre.
    There are pearls, according           to  Mobius, which
    * See their interesting essays in Muller's Archiv,  1856.

 170            STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
consist of three different systems of layers, like the
shells in which they are forrned         ;  with this differ
ence, that these layers are reversed          : in the shell
the    nacre forms       the    innermost     layer,  in   the
pearl it forms the outermost.              Hence the quali
ties of the pearl depend on the shell, and on the
different    proportions      of nacre and carbonate of
lime.
    Since we know how pearls are made, may it not
be expected      that we should learn to make them ?
Ever since the      days  of Linna&us the hope has been
entertained, and it is now becoming every day more
likely to   be~ realized.    Imperfect pearls have been
made     in    abundance.        The Chinese      have   long
practised the art.        They simply remove the large
fresh-water mussel from the water, insert a foreign
 substance under the mantle, and in two or three
 years (if  I remember     rightly) they take the mussels
 up again, and find the pearls formed.           In  this way
they make little mother-of-pearl          Josses, which are
 sold for  a  penny each     ;  and  I remember seeing a
 couple of large shells in the Anatomical Museum at
 Munich, the whole length of which was occupied by

rows of little squab Josses, very comical to behold. .
I was informed that a copper chain of these deities
had been inserted under the mollusc's   mantle, and
this was the result.

That    an animal Organism           is made up of several
distinct organs, and these the more numerous in
proportion to the rank of the animal in the scale
of beings, is one those familiar facts which have
their significance concealed from us by familiarity.
But it is only necessary to express this                   fact  in
language      slightly altered,        and     to   say  that    an
animal Organism           is made up of several distinct
individuals , and our attention is at once arrested.
Doubtless, it has a paradoxical              air to say so   ;  but
Natural History is full of paradoxes              ;  and you are
aware that a paradox is far from being necessarily

               STUDIES        IX ANIMAL LIFE.                   173
an absurdity,       as  some      inaccurate      writers    would
lead us to suppose          :   the word     meaning       simply,
 "contrary to what is thought/' — a meaning by no
means                     to
                                "  contrary    to    what    is the
           equivalant
fact."     It is    paradoxical       to call     an   animal an
aggregate     of individuals       ; but it is so because our
thoughts      are   not very precise on the subject of
individuality — one of the many abstractions which
remain     extremely vague.           To justify this applica
 tion of the word individual to every distinct organ,
 would     be   difficult     in ordinary       speech,     but   in
 philosophy there is ample warrant for it.
    An organ, in the physiological                  sense,    is an
 instrument whereby certain functions are performed.
 In  the morphological         sense,  it arises in     a differen
 tiation, or setting apart, of a particular portion of
 the body for the performance of particular functions
 — a group of     cells, instead of being an exact repeti
 tion of all the other cells, takes on          a  difference, and
 becomes     distinguished from the rest as an organ.*
     Combining these two meanings,                  we    have   the
  third, or philosophical sense of the word, which
       * See on this point what was said in our first Chapter.

 indicates that every organ          is an individual exis
 tence, dependent more or less upon other organs
 for its maintenance and activity, yet biologically
 distinct.   I   do not mean that the heart           will live
 independent       of the body,     at least, not for long,
 although   it   does    continue    to live    and manifest
 its vital activity for some time after the animal's
 death   ; and, in the cold-blooded            animals,    even
 after removal from the body.           Nor do    I mean that
 the legs of an animal will manifest vivacity after
 amputation    :    although   even    the   legs of a man
 are  not dead for some time after amputation            ;  and
the parts of some of the lower animals are often
vigorously independent.            Thus     I  have had the
long tentacles        of  a Terebella     (a   marine   worm)
living and wriggling for        a whole week after ampu
tation.*
    In  speaking of the independence            of an organ,
I   must be understood to mean             a  very dependent
independence      :  because,  strictly speaking, absolute
independence        is nowhere to      be   found  ;  and, in

the case of an organ, it is of course dependent
on other organs for the securing, preparing, and dis
tributing of its necessary nutriment.                       The tentacles
of my Terebella could find no nutriment, and they
perished      from        the want of           it,   as   the   Terebella
itself   would          have      perished       under      like circum
stances.        The frog's heart now beating                          on our
table with such regular systole and diastole, as                            if
it   were pumping the                  blood     through the living
animal, gradually uses up all its force                      ;   and since
this force      is      not replaced, the beatings gradually
cease.      A     current        of electricity         will awaken its
activity,     for    a    time   ;   but, at last, every stimulus
will fail    to     elicit   a   response.        The heart will then
be dead, and decomposition                    will begin.
     Dependent,          therefore, every organ must                  be on
some other organs.                   Let us       see      how   it   is   also
independent         ;    and for this purpose we glance, as
usual, at the simpler forms of Life to make the
lesson      easier.       Here       is   a   branch of coral, which
you know to be in its living state                           a   colony of
polypes.        Each of these multitudinous polypes                          is
an    individual,         and        each     exactly      resembles       the

 other.    But the whole colony has          one    nutritive
 fluid_in common.      They are all actively engaged
                         Fig.  20.

in securing food, and the labours of each enrich
all.   It is animal Socialism      of the purest      kind-
there are no rich and no poor, neither are there
any idlers.
   Formerly, the coral-branch was regarded as one

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                  177
 animal — an individual;     and a tree was, and is,
commonly regarded as one plant — an individual.
But no zoologist now is unaware of the fact that
each polype on the branch is a        distinct individual,
in spite of its connections with the rest            ;  and
 philosophic botanists are agreed that the tree is a
colony of individual plants — not one plant.
   Let us pass from the coral  to the stem   of some other
polype, say a Campanularia.       Here is (Fig. 20.) the
representation of such a stem, of the natural size,
 and beside it a tiny twig much magnified.             You
 observe   the ordinary polype issuing from one of
the capsules, and expanding its coronal of tentacles
in the water.      The food it secures will pass along
the digestive tract to each of the other capsules.
Under the microscope, you may watch this oscilla
tion of the food.     But your     eye detects    a notice
able difference between     this polype in its capsule,
and the six semi-transparent      masses    in the second
capsule  :  although  the two capsules are obviously
identical, they are not the same      : a  differentiation
has   taken    place.   Perhaps    you think      that  six
polypes    are   here  crowding     into   one    capsule?

178               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
Error!       If   you watch with patience, or           if   you are
impatient yet tolerably dexterous, you may press
these six masses           out, and then will observe them
swim       away, so many      tiny jelly-fish.     Not polypes
at all, but jelly-fish, are in this capsule         :   and these
in    due time     will produce polypes, like that               one
now waving its tentacles.
     Having made this observation, it will naturally
occur to you that the polype stem which bore such
different capsules as are represented by these two,
may perhaps be called a colony, but it is a colony of
different individuals.        While they   have   all one skele
ton in common, nutrition in common, and respira
tion in common, they have at least one differentiation,
or setting apart for a particular purpose, and that is,
the reproductive capsule.          This is an individual,          as
much as any of the others, but it is an individual
that does nothing for the general good                  ;    it takes
upon itself the care of the race, and becomes an
"organ"         for the community; the others feed                it,
and   it   is   absolved    from the labour       of nutrition,
as much as the arm or the brain of          a     man are.
 -   From this case, let us pass to the group of

jelly-fish called Siphonophora (siphonbearers)                  by
 naturalists,    and we shall see this union of very
different individualities into one inseparable colony
 still more strikingly exhibited         :   there are distinct
 individuals to feed the colony, individuals to float
 it through     the water, individuals to act as feelers,
 and to keep certain parts distended with fluid, and
 finally reproductive       individuals.          All   these are
 identical    in origin, and        differ     only     by  slight
 differentiations.*      Here we         have      obviously     an
 approach to the more complex organism in which
 various distinct organs perform              the several func

 phora are so manifestly analogous to organs, that
 their individuality may, perhaps, be disputed, the
  more so as they do not live separately.                  But the
  gradations of separation are very fine.              You would
  never hesitate to call a bee, or an ant, an indivi
  dual, yet no bee or ant could exist                if  separated

  from its colony.          So great is       " the physiological
  division of labour/' which has taken place among
 these insects, that one cannot get food, another
 cannot feed itself, but it will fight for the com
 munity;      another cannot work,             but it will breed
 for the community           ; another       cannot    breed,    but
 it will work.       Each of these is little more than
separated organs of the great insect- Organism                 ;  as
the heart, stomach, and brain are united organs of
the    human-Organism.              Kernove        one   of these
insects   from      the   community,          and it will     soon
perish, for its life is bound up with the whole.
    And   so    it is    everywhere     ;    the dependence       is
universal   :

We    are dependent on the air, the earth, the sun
light, the flowers, the plants, the animals, and all
created   things, directly or indirectly.             Nor is the
moral    dependence        less than       the physical.       "We
cannot    isolate      ourselves      if     we    would.     The

needs of others, —these two             make up       our life  ;
without these we should quickly perish.
   It  was   a   dream of the youth           Cuvier,    that  a
History of Nature might be written which would
systematically      display this universal         dependence.
I  know few parts of biography             so   interesting as
those which show us             great men in their early
aspirings,    when      dreams     of achievements        vaster
than    the world       has   seen,   fill their souls with
energy to achieve the something                they do after
wards achieve.        It is, unhappily, too often but the
ambition     of youth we have to contemplate               ; and
yet   the knowledge        that   in after-life     there came
less of hope, less of devotion, and less of generous
self-sacrifice,    renders     these     early    days    doubly
interesting.      Let the abatement of high hopes
 come when      it may, the existence of          an aspiration
is itself important.         I  have    been    lately reading
over again the letters of Cuvier when an obscure
youth, and they have given me quite a new feeling
with regard to him.
    There is a good reason why novels always end
 with the marriage of the hero and heroine                 :  our

 interest     is always more excited by the struggles,
 than by the results              of victory.     So long as the
lovers      are    unhappy,       or apart, and        are   eager    to
vanquish        obstacles,       our sympathy       is active    ;  but
jiq sooner        are they happy, than we begin to                 look
 elsewhere, for other stragglers on whom to bestow
our     interest.         It   is the same        with biography.
We follow the hero through the early years of
struggle with intense interest, and as long as he
remains unsuccessful,              baffled by rivals or neglected
by the world, we stand by liim and want him to
succeed;        but the clay after he is recognized                   by
the world our sympathy begins to slacken.
     It is this which gives Cuvier's Letters to Pfaff*
their charm.            I confess that,      M. le Baron Cuvier,
administrator,           politician,     academician,      professor,
dictator, has always had but a very tepid interest
for me.    ;  probably because           his career early became
a continuous          success,    and Europe heaped           rewards
upon       him     ;    whereas.,     his     unsuccessful       rival,

close.     If,   however, M. le Baron is a somewhat
dim    figure in      my biographical      gallery,   it is far
otherwise with the youth Cuvier,             as seen    in his
letters  ;  and, as at this present moment there is
nothing under our Microscope              which can seduce
us from the pleasant volume, suppose we let our

      Genius/'      says

are many young gentlemen           devoutly persuaded of
their own genius, and yet candidly avowing their
imperfect      capacity   for taking trouble,        who will
vehemently protest against this doctrine.                With
out discussing       it here, let us    say that genius, or
no genius,        success   of any value is only to be
purchased       by immense      labour;     and in science,
assuredly, no one will expect success without first
paying this price.         In Cuvier's      history    may be
seen    what      " capacity for   taking      trouble

this gives these Lettres a Pfaff         a  moral as well as
an interest.
   It  was      in   the  Eittersaal     of   the   Academia

184          STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
Carolina of Stuttgardt,       and in 1787, that Pfaff,
the once famous supporter          of Volta, first became
personally acquainted with him, his fellow- student
Cuvier.     Although     they    had been      three   years
together at the same university, the classification
of students     there   adopted     had    prevented     any
personal   acquaintance.      Pupils were admitted at
the age of nine, and commenced their studies with
the classic languages.      Thence they passed to the
philosophical    class, and from that they went to
one  of the four faculties     :  Law, Medicine, Admi
nistration, and Military Science.           Each faculty,
of course, was kept distinct         : and as     Pfaff was
studying    philosophy     at    the   time    Cuvier    was
occupied   with the administrative          sciences,   they
never met   ;  the more so as the dormitories            and
hours of recreation were different.          The academy
was   organized    on military principle.         The three
hundred students were         divided into      six classes,
two of which comprised the nobles, and the other
four the bourgeoisie.      Each of these classes had
its own dormitory,       and was       placed    under   the
charge of a captain, a lieutenant, and two inferior

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.                   185
 officers.   These six classes iu which the students
 were entered according to their age, size, and time
 of admission, were kept separate in their recrea
 tions, as in their studies.           But those of the
 students who particularly distinguished         themselves
 in the public examinations were raised to the rank
 of knights, and had a dormitory           to themselves,
 besides dining at the same table with the young
 princes who were then studying         at the university.
 Pfaff and Cuvier were raised to this dignity at the
 same time, and here commenced          their friendship.
    What    a  charm there is in school friendships,
when youth is not less eager to communicate its
plans and hopes, than to believe in the plans and
hopes of others      ;   when   studies   are   pursued   in
common,      opinions    frankly interchanged,      and the
superiority of     a   friend is gladly     acknowledged,
 even becoming a source of pride, instead          of being,
as   in after years, a thorn in the side of friend
ship   !   This charm     was felt by Cuvier      and Pfaff,
and a small circle of fellow-students            who parti
cularly devoted themselves to           Natural History.
They formed themselves into          a  society,   of which

 186          STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
Cuvier drew up the statutes            and    became     the
president.      They read memoirs,         and    discussed
discoveries with all the gravity of older societies,
and even published,       among themselves, a sort of
Comptes Rendus.         They made botanical, entomo
logical, and      geological    excursions  ;   and,    still
further to stimulate their zeal, Cuvier instituted
an Order of Merit, painting the medallion himself            :
it represented    a star, with the portrait of Linnaeus
in   the    centre,  and    between    the    rays various
treasures of the animal and vegetable world.            And
do you     think these boys were not proud when
their president awarded them this medal for some
happy observation of a new species, or some well-
considered essay on a scientific question ?
   At this   period, Cuvier's outward appearance         was
as  unlike M. le Baron, as the grub is unlike the
butterfly.    Absorbed    in his multifarious studies,
he was careless about         disguising    the    want    of
elegance in his aspect.        His  face was pale, very
thin, and long, covered with freckles, and encircled
by a shock of red hair.          His  physiognomy       was
severe and melancholy,         He never played       at any

               STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.               187
 of the boys' games, and seemed as insensible of all
 that was going on around him as a somnambulist.
 His   eye   seemed  turned inwards     ;  his thoughts
 moved amid problems and abstractions.          Nothing
 could exceed the insatiable ardour of his intellect.
 Besides   his special administrative   studies, he gave
 himself to Botany, Zoology,       Philosophy, Mathe
 matics,   and the history of literature.      No work
 was too voluminous,      or too heavy for him.       He
 was reading all day long, and a great part of the
 night.
           " I remember   well," says Pfaff, " how he
 used to sit by my bedside going regularly through
 Bayle's Dictionary.     Falling  asleep   over my own
book,   I  used to awake, after an hour or two, and
 find him motionless as    a statue, bent over Bayle."
 It  was during these years that he laid the basis
 of that extensive erudition which distinguished his
works in. after life, and which is truly remarkable
when we reflect that Cuvier was not in the least
a   bookworm,     but was one     of the most      active
workers,    drawing his knowledge       of details from
direct inspection whenever it was possible, and not
from the reports of others.      It was here also that

he preluded to his success as a professor, astonish
ing his friends and colleagues by the clearness of
his    exposition,    which     he   rendered      still    more
striking by his wonderful mastery with the pencil.
One      may safely say that        there  are    few     talents
which are not available           in Natural History;           a
talent for drawing        is pre-eminently useful, since
it not only enables      a  man to preserve observations
of fugitive appearances, but sharpens his faculty
 of observation by the exercise it gives.              Cuvier's
 facile   pencil   was   always    employed     :   if   he   had
 nothing to draw for his own memoirs,                  or those
 of his colleagues, he amused himself with drawing
 insects    as   presents   to the young       ladies      of his
 acquaintance — an entomologist's          gallantry, which
 never became more sentimental.
    In   1788, that is in his nineteenth          year, Cuvier
 quitted Stuttgardt,       and became     tutor in     a   noble
  man's    family in Normandy, where he remained
 till   1795, when he was discovered by the Abbe
  Tessier, who wrote to Parmentier,            "I     have    just
                                                                  "

gave Delambre to the academy             ;  in another depart
ment     this also will be a Delambre."                  Geoffroy
St. Hilaire,       already professor at the Jardin des
Plantes,     though younger than Cuvier, was shown
some      of Cuvier's manuscripts,           which   filled him
with such enthusiasm               that  he    wrote    to  him,
" Come       and     fill the place of Linnaeus            here ;
come and be another           legislator of natural history.'*
Cuvier came, and Geoffroy stood aside to let his
great   rival be seen.
   Goethe,       as   I   have    elsewhere remarked,         has
noticed the curious coincidence of the three great
zoologists successively opening to their rivals the
path to distinction       :  Buffon called Daubenton to aid
him   :   Daubenton         called   Geoffroy,   and    Geoffroy
called Cuvier.         Goethe     further notices that there
was the same radical opposition              in the tendencies
of Buffon and Daubenton               as in those of Geoffroy
and Cuvier — the opposition of the synthetical and
the analytical mind.            Yet this opposition did not
prevent mutual esteem and lasting regard.               Geoffroy
and Cuvier were both young, and had in common
ambition,      love of science,        and the freshness        of

  190         STUDIES     EST  ANIMAL LIFE.
 unformed convictions.        For, alas  !  it is unhappily
 too true, that just as the free communicativeness
 of youth    gives place to the jealous reserve            of
 manhood,    and the youth who would only be too
pleased to tell all his thoughts           and all his dis
coveries to a companion, would in after years let
his dearest friend first see     a discovery in an official
publication   ;   so, likewise,    in the early days of
immature      speculation,     before   convictions     have
crystallized    enough to present their sharp angles
of opposition, friends may discuss and interchange
ideas without temper.         Geoffroy and Cuvier knew
no jealousy then.      In   after years it was otherwise.
    Geoffroy had a position — he shared it with his
friend; he had books and collections — they were
open to his rival; he had a lodging in the museum
—it   was shared between them.          Daubenton,     older
and more worldlywise,          warned   Geoffroy     against
this zeal in fostering     a  formidable    rival ; and one
day placed before him a copy of Lafontaine open at
the fable of The Bitch and her Neighbour.               But
Geoffroy was not to be daunted, and probably felt
himself strong enough to hold his own.               And  so

 the two happy, active youths pursued their studies
together,   wrote    memoirs      conjointly,   discussed,
dissected,    speculated   together,   and    " never   sat
 down to breakfast without having          made a fresh
            '
discovery/     as Cuvier said, truly enough, for to
them every step taken was a discovery.
   Cuvier became      almost    immediately    famous on
his arrival at Paris, and his career henceforward
was one    uninterrupted success.       Those who wish
to gain some insight into the causes of this success
should read the letters to Pfaff, which indicate the
passionate patience of his studies during the years
1788-1795, passed in obscurity on the Norman coast.
Every animal he can lay hands on is dissected
with the greatest care, and drawings are made of
every detail of interest.      Every work that is pub
lished of any note in his way is read, analyzed,
and commentecl on.         Lavoisier's new system of
chemistry finds in him an ardent disciple.           Kiel-
meyer's lectures     open new vistas to       him.    The
marvels   of marine     life,  in those days so little
thought of, he studies with persevering minuteness,
and   with admirable       success.    He    dissects  the

 cuttlefish,   and makes his drawings          of it with its
 own ink.       He notes minute characters with the
 patience of a species-monger, whose sole ambition
 is to affix his name to some trifling variation of
 a common form        ; yet with this minuteness of detail
 he unites the largeness of view necessary to a com
parative anatomist.
    " Your     reflections    on  the  differences   between
animals      and    plants," he writes, in the passage
    which    I                          " will be the more

think we ought carefully to seek out the relation
of all existences with the rest of nature, and above
all, to show their part in the economy of the
great  All.     In this   work   I  should   desire that the
investigator     should start from the simplest things,
such as air and water, and after having spoken
of their influence on the whole, he should              pass
gradually to the compound minerals,             from these
to plants, and so on        ;  and that at each stage he
should ascertain the exact degree of composition,

properties, and their usefulness in creation.           Such
a work    is yet to be executed.         The two works of
Aristotle,     De     Historia    Animalium,        and    De
Partibus Animalium, which           I  admire more each
time that     I  read them, contain a part of what           I
desire,   namely,     the comparison       of species, and
many    of the general results.         It   is, indeed, the
first scientific essay at a natural history.         For this
reason it is necessarily incomplete, contains           many
inaccuracies, and is too far removed from a know
ledge   of physical       laws."    He     passes   on   from
Aristotle     to    Pliny,   Theophrastus,        Discorides,
Aldovrandus, Gesner,         Gaspar    Bauhin, and Kay,

these attempts at a nomenclature which neglected
real  science    : —"  These    are  the    dictionaries    of

rank among the men of science in France; and
Pfaff, on arriving in Paris six years afterwards,
found    his    old   fellow- student     had     become
                                                             "  a
personage."       The change in Cuvier's appearance
was very   striking.        He  was then at     his maturity,
and might pass for a handsome man.                   His shock
of red hair was now cut and trimmed in Parisian
style ;  his countenance beamed             with health and
satisfaction  ;    his      expression    was      lively    and
engaging    ;   and     although     the    slight     tinge   of
melancholy      which      was   natural   to   him had not
wholly disappeared, yet the fire and vivacity of his
genius   overcame       it.   His dress     was   that of the
fashion   of the day, not without a little affectation.
Yet his life was simple, and wholly devoted                    to
science.    He had a lodging in the Jardin                   des
Plantes, and was waited on by an old housekeeper,
like any other simple professor.
   On Pfaff's subsequent visit, things were changed.
Instead of the old housekeeper,                the    door was
opened by a lackey in grand livery.                 Instead of
asking    for
                " Citizen Cuvier,"         he inquired        for
Monsieur Cuvier       ;   whereupon,     the lackey politely

asked, whether       he wished     to   see  M. le Baron
Cuvier, or M. Frederic, his brother ?               "I   soon
found where      I  was,"    continues    Pfaff.    "It   was
the baron, separated from          me by that immense
interval of thirty years, and by those high dignities
which an empire offers to the ambition of men."
He found the baron almost exclusively interested
in politics, and       scarcely   giving    a    thought    to
                   "                 " and
science.   The        preparations            "injections"
which Pfaff had brought with him from Germany,
as a present to       Cuvier, were scarcely looked at,
and were     set   aside with an indifferent          "that's
good," and
              "  very fine  ;
                              " much to Pfaff s distress,
who doubtless thought the fate of the Martignac
ministry an extremely         small    subject    of interest
compared with these injections of the lymphatics.
   But it is not my purpose to paint Cuvier in his
later years.    It  is to the studies of his youth that
I  would call your attention,         to read there, once
again, the important lesson         that nothing of any
solid value can be achieved without entire devo
tion.   Nothing      is earned without sweat           of the
brow.    Even      the artist must labour          intensely.

What is called "inspiration " will                         create no works,
but only irradiate works with felicitous                                   flashes;
and even inspiration mostly comes in moments of
exaltation produced by intense work of the mind.
In    science, incessant          and      enlightened                labour      is
necessary, even to the smallest success.                                   Labour
is not all   ;   but without      it,   genius           is   nothing.
