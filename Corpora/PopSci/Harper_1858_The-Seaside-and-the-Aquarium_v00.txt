    "I  have seen the cultivated man, craving for
travel and for success     in life, pent up in the
drudgery of London work, and yet keeping his
spirit calm, and perhaps his morals all the more
righteous, by spending over his microscope even-
ings which would probably have gradually been
wasted at the theatre.       I have seen the young
London     beauty,   amid all the excitement      and
temptation of luxury and flattery, with her heart
pure and her mind occupied          in  a boudoir full
 of shells and fossils, flowers and sea-weeds, and
 keeping herself unspotted       from the world     by
 considering the lilies of the field how they grow
                      I hail with thankfulness

 cate them            Books of natural history are
 finding their way more and more into drawing-
 rooms    and school-rooms,    and exciting greater

 ago, was considered    superfluous    for all but the
 professional student."     KEY. C. KINGSLEY.

                    PEEFACE.
IN making        another   contribution to the rapidly
accumulating literature of Marine Zoology, the
author's     object has been to present a Manual of
the Science at once simple, comprehensive,             and
cheap.      It  may not, perhaps, be considered        out
of place in him to observe, that among the many
admirable works with which he is acquainted, he
has not met with any that seems to combine these
advantages.        Passing over such works       as, from
their purely scientific character, are         obviously
exceptional,      the majority    of treatises intended
for general readers are either too expensive, or,
if low   priced, mere compilations.
   To his Edinburgh readers, the author believes
it will   be a recommendation        of his little work,
the fact of his having been the first to illustrate,
in a popular manner,          Marine   Zoology on the
prolific shores of the Frith of Forth.

IT  was towards the close of a warm day, a few sum-
mers ago, and under circumstances somewhat ludi-
crous, that   I  formed my first acquaintance with the
class of marine animals which        I am now going to in-
troduce to the reader.       Having had the good fortune
to discover at Joppa (a well-known village in the
vicinity of Edinburgh), a district richly deserving
exploration,  I had been for     several hours    " collecting,"
to use a technical phrase of zoologists, with the en-

thusiasm so natural to beginners.             Nor   was my zeal
unrewarded.        In   spite of numerous slips ankle-deep
in water, a fall that broke the bottle containing
several Gobies         a mishap of which these little fish
immediately availed themselves to regain their liberty
    coming away from a pool and forgetting my chisel
                                               as you will find
(a common occurrence, good reader,
by experience),      I  managed to procure, among other
prizes, several    beautiful specimens        of Anemones, or
" quilled Dahlias,"       as a  certain author aptly names
them.     Partly from the good humour resulting from
such success, and partly from the tempting appear-
ance of the water,       I determined to cool myself by a
bath, before moving off townwards.
       " Above   me was the sky, beneath the sea,
         I stood  upon a point of shatter'd stone :
                               The ocean spray
         Quiver'd beneath my feet, the broad heaven shone
         Around, and in my hair the winds did play,
         Lingering, as they pursued their unimpeded way."
    Being almost as ignorant of swimming               as of that
 department of natural history in which               I had just
been taking one of my earliest lessons,             I determined
 to take advantage        of the neighbourhood of a boat
 riding at anchor, a little distance from shore, for a
 practical lesson in natation.          I  had often heard it
 recommended as an excellent exercise for a novice in
 swimming to climb out of the water on a boat's sides.
 Accordingly     I had no sooner undressed than I waded
 to the skiff,  which I found in about a depth of four

time obliged to acknowledge that         what I had looked
upon as easy was very much the reverse.               It is true
that   I more    than once succeeded in raising my elbows
and chest on the gunwale, but immediately the boat, as
if resisting   my intrusion, gave a lurch, and, in dread
                                  I
of her capsizing above me, had to abandon my hold.
In   short, after a considerable expenditure of time and
strength,    I was obliged to give in, and make for the
rocky cleft on which         I  had undressed.     I  had pro-
ceeded, however, only a little distance on my way
back,    when, no less to my surprise than dismay,             I
observed certain articles floating on the water, which
I   had no difficulty in recognising as my clothes          !  I
had awkwardly omitted to notice the rapid advance
of the tide; and now, half laughing, half angry,               I
had to seize my errant garments, and, more hastily
than before, make for land.           There I found    that the
rocks, which      I  had easily walked over half an hour
before, had become intensely slippery, and seemed, to
my imagination, as        if mounted with   knife-blades, cut
into thousands of little pieces; nay, as         I   cautiously
advanced,      I felt as  if  each piece had been carefully

 at last succeeding      in gaining a secure and sheltered
 spot,   I  immediately set about wringing my wet
 clothes, and then exposing them to the sun.              While

                                 must confess),    was        I
greatly startled at observing some hitherto undetected
peculiarity of my person.             It     was strangely tattoed
with zebra-like stripes in many places                a phenome-
non    Imay briefly explain to have resulted from my
wrestling against the tarry sides of the boat.    But
although the effect of that contact involved an un-
pleasant amount of friction, it was greatly less annoy-
ing than the painful condition of my feet and toes.
My soles were profusely bleeding, and presented an
appearance      extremely        similar to the      cross-hatched
backgrounds of one of Mr Gilbert's wood engravings.

being daily made.
     I introduce   this little narrative in order to caution
my young friends at the sea- side against Barnacles.
Barnacles ? you inquire. Yes ; the knife blades that
so   unmercifully      cut into my soles were the Acorn-
Barnacles.
     There are very few marine animals of which spe-
cimens are more easily obtained than the members of
this family.       Indeed, so profusely are they studded
over rocks around our shores, that one would suppose
a house       painter had been with a white-wash brush,
and splashed it vigorously over every boulder.                     Dip
your hand in a pool, and seize upon a Crab                   (if   you
dare),   a   Limpet   (if    you can), Mussel, or Buckie, and
                                     a              a
the probability       is,   that whichever you lay hold of, has
one or more Barnacles immoveably fixed to its back.

    Let me suppose you are looking at my Aquarium.
Here    I  shew you a piece of stone, covered over, you
perceive,     with white     conical  spots.   The   animals
which     I  inform you are represented      by the spots do
not strike you as in any way remarkable, certainly
not for beauty.      But have patience for a moment.        I
have dropped the stone into the water.           Let us look
at it after a few minutes have elapsed with a hand-
lens.     Is not that   a marvellous change    ?  Were you
prepared for such a beautiful sight?          Each shell has
opened, and from each

constantly thrust, grasping at some coveted object,
and then closed and withdrawn."
    But the object of this curious apparatus, however
beautiful in itself, is of a decidedly utilitarian cha-
racter.     It is for the express purpose of ensnaring
 such minute animalcules as may be within reach, to
 " drag them down in the vicinity of the mouth, where,
being seized by the jaws, they are crushed and pre-
pared for digestion.        No sense but that of touch is
required for the success of this singular           mode    of
fishing, and the delicacy with which the tentacles
perceive the slightest contact of a foreign substance,
 shews that they are eminently sensible        of tactile im-

    The following engraving represents four Barnacles
 attached to the shell of a Limpet.         Two of them are
 " fishing," while the other two      are in a passive state.

               COMMON LIMPET (P. Vulgata.), with   Barnacles*   attached.
    An extraordinary fact in connexion with the little
Barnacles remains to be mentioned.                                This is the
transformation            they undergo.            In    describing          it,   we
may avail ourselves                of the elegant account of Mr
Gosse    :
    "   It "
         (the Barnacle)
                                       "
                          begins life in    form exactly    a
like that of   young Entomostraceous Crustacean (or
                     a
Water-flea), with    broad carapace,
                            a            single eye, twoa
pairs of antennae, three pairs of jointed,                            branched,
and well-bristled legs, and                a   forked tail.
    " It     casts off its skin twice, undergoing, especially
at the second moult,               a   considerable change of figure                ;
at the third moult            it   has assumed almost the form of
a   Cypris,        or Cy there,        being enclosed           in    a     bivalve
shell, in which the front of the head, with the anten-
nae,    is     greatly developed,          equalling in bulk all the

                       ACOEN-BAENACLES.                    7
  rest of the body; the single eye has become          two,
  which are very large, and attached to the outer arms
 of the bent processes, like the letters U Lh which are
 seen   within the thorax.
     " In this   stage, the little animal searches about for
 some suitable spot for permanent residence ; a ship's
 bottom, a piece of floating timber, the back of a whale
 or turtle, or the solid rock. When its selection is made,
 the two antennae which project from the shell pour
 out a gelatinous gum or cement, which hardens, and
 firmly attaches them.         Henceforth the animal is a
fixture, glued by the front of its head to its support !
 Another moult now takes place; the bivalve shell is
 thrown     off,  with the great eyes and their LHike
 processes, and the little cirriped is seen in its true
 form.
     "It  is now in effect a Stomapod Crustacean, at-
 tached by its antennae, the head greatly lengthened
 (in Lepas, &c.), the carapace composed of several
 pieces, the legs modified into cirri, and made to exe-
 cute their grasping movements backwards, instead of
 forwards, and the whole abdomen obliterated, or re-
 duced to an inconspicuous rudiment."
     But Barnacles, notwithstanding their beauty, and
 their many curious peculiarities of structure, are un-
 fortunately not very well suited for an Aquarium.       So
 long as they are alive, they are harmless       ; but after
 death they become dangerous to the surviving occu-
 pants of the tank.        Therefore,  if you determine to
 introduce them, do not forget to keep a sharp look

 out upon their state of health.     So long as the "fairy
 hand" referred to continues to fan the water, all is
 safe ; but whenever that movement ceases for any
 length of time, take your syringe and pour a stream
 of water over the whole colony of Barnacles. Should
the commotion so excited fail in bringing them boldly
to their doors, or     if  they venture only in a timid
manner, lose no time in removing the piece of stone,
 or whatever else they may be fixed to.        Unless this
care be taken the tank       will soon be tainted, and its
more    delicate inmates perish, from their incapacity
of inhaling the noxious gas, caused by the decaying
Barnacles.
    The little Barnacles, of which we have been hitherto
speaking, possess rather famous relations        the Ship-
Barnacles     (Pentalasmis anatifera), of whom many
strange stories have been told, stories so strange that
it may not     be considered quite out of place here to
refer to them.     These will, at all events, possess some
interest for younger readers.
    The members of this family, instead of growing
flat, like the Acorn-shells, upon rocks, &c., live upon
stalks, as the case may be, pieces of driftwood, or
the keels of ships.       In the latter case, it has been
noticed that their growth is so rapid, that in the
course of a few months the planks of a -vessel      will be
so closely studded with them as to impede its pro-
gress.    "When ships thus covered arrive in our ports,
the Barnacles are eagerly scraped off by men, who
take them for sale as marine curiosities, or who make

kinds of fancy shell-work.        The Barnacles themselves
are eaten on some coasts of Africa, where they are
very abundant.      The shell of this animal is at the
end of a long fleshy stalk, generally of a purplish red,
sometimes of a bright orange colour, and is of the form
called multivalve,   being composed             of five pieces or

clear and brittle, of a white colour, tinged with pale
blue."*
    In our previous cursory reference to the wonderful
transformations undergone by the Barnacle tribe, the
reader would understand that these assertions              rest
upon the evidence of modern naturalists.t              Now, al-
though many of these have devoted much study and
patient labour to the subject, who can be so bold as to
declare that, in a few years, others may not bring for-
ward explanatory hypotheses of quite an opposite cha-
racter? For seeing is not always believing, in matters
connected with natural history, at least according to
some statements we read of among old authors. Were
it so, we should now believe that these same Barnacles
were    the young of the Solan Goose ! a bird that
haunts in vast numbers the Bass Rock, and other
localities.    Nay more, a common belief in different
parts of Scotland, and over the West of England, was,
that the shells grew upon certain trees, and, in pro-
gress of time, opened       of themselves.      Whereupon      a
certain animated substance contained within the shell
dropped down, and according to the place where it
fell it perished or fructified.     By falling into water it
grew to be a fowl, but by falling upon land the vital
 principle became extinct.        The fowls which resulted
from the more fortunate contingency, were called Bar-
 nacle Geese in Scotland, and Brant or Tree Geese in
 England.      The error which this imagined transfor-

mation was long ago proved to have been, appears to
have arisen from the fact of Barnacles having been
found in great abundance on the trunks and even
branches of trees long submerged in the sea. It is
not incurious, however, to hear what Hector Boece, in
his "History of Scotland,"               says regarding the old
belief, the correctness          of which, according to his ac-
count,
  " Was most notablie proued in the year of                  grace
1490, in sight of many people, beside the Castell of
Pesligo, whither the bodie of a great tree was brought
by the working of the sea.            This tree being taken, it
was carried to the lord of the soile, who soone after
caused  it to be slit in sunder with a saw; which
being done, it is incredible to see what a multitude of
worms came out of their holes.      Of these also some
appeared as    if they      had beene but new shapen, diuers
had head, foot, and wings, but no feathers, the rest
were formed into perfect foules"           (ty
  After giving three other instances of           a   similar cha-
racter, our author continues         :

doo turne into these foules,           I    will disprooue his      asser-
tion by one notable example shewed before mine eyes.
Maister Alexander Galloway, parson of Kinkell, was
with vs in these lies, and giving his mind with atten-
tiue dilligence to search out a full resolution with vs,
of these obscure and hidden matters, it happened on
a time that he took up a branch of alga, called in
Scottish,       Seatangle,     which        hanged full of muskle
shells, from the root euen to the verie top.                        Being
also desirous to see what was in them, he grew to be
more astonished than before             ;   for when         he opened one
or two of them, he saw no fsh, but a foule perfectlie
shapen, fully answering to the capacitie of the shell                   (!)
     " Finally, knowing that         I      was very inquisitiue        of
these and like rare novelties, he came hastilie with
the said hearbe and shewed                  it   vnto me, who found
no lesse by experience              than
                                       I         have before reported.
By    these     and many other reasons                  and examples
cannot believe that these Claiks (or Barnacles, as                     I I
call them) are producted either by the qualities of
the trees, or the roots thereof, but onelie by the nature
of the   sea,    which   is   the verie cause and productrix of
so   manie wonderful creatures.                  Furthermore, bicause
the rude and ignorant                people       saw       oftentimes the

 fruits that fell from tres which stood neuer in the
 sea, conuerted within short time into geese, they
 beleeued   that these geese grew vpon trees, hanging
 by their nebs as apples and other fruit doe by their
 stalks, but their opinion is utterlie to be rejected.
 For  so soone   as these   apples, or fruits, fall from the
tree into the sea, they grow first to be worm-eaten,
and in process of time to be converted into geese."*
    Nearly 200 years       after the above      strange   nar-
rative was written,      we    gather from the pages of
Gerarde, how firmly it was believed even among the
best   informed    of his day.      This writer not only
gravely confirms the old historian's opinion, but is
at great pains in giving various engravings, intended
to represent the Barnacle Geese in the different stages
of their development, from the shelly mollusc to the
full-grown fowl.      The latter are exhibited swimming
about under the boughs of the trees from which they
had fallen. " What our eies have seen, and our hands
have touched, we shall declare," is the authoritative
deliverance of the learned Gerarde.        He describes the
process    of transformation      with   minute     accuracy,
adding that
              " as the shells
                                gape, the legs hang out,"
and " that the birde     growing bigger and bigger, the
shells open more and more, till at length it all comes
forth, and hangeth by the bill."     Thereafter it speedily
attains maturity, and " falleth into the sea, where it
gathereth feathers and groweth to a foule"(!)

this story, by giving out that the Barnacle Geese were
not produced from flesh of any kind, and, therefore,
they might be eaten as fish on all fast-days.                  Such
an absurd belief, we might readily suppose, would not
fail to afford no small amusement to philosophers and
poets living in less credulous ages.                  It does not
escape   the keen      eye  of the author of " Hudibras."
Du Bartas       also alludes to the popular             notion, and
even   introduces an additional           theory, to the effect
that the Barnacle sprung from a fungus              :

    So was the sea-side to me.             But my indifference
was soon exchanged           for positive delight, upon dis-
covering all of a sudden, that the rocks were profusely
studded     with a kind of shell-fish to which most
Londoners,     during early life at least, are extremely
partial.    Thousands of Periwinkles lay before my
astonished eyes.        Immediately fashioning my hand-
kerchief into a bag,        I  set about filling it with the
dainty mollusc, and having done             so, set off rejoicing
on my way homewards.
    On arriving at my lodgings,          I forthwith displayed
my Periwinkles to my kind-hearted landlady, with a
request that she should cook some of them for tea              :
"Pen      Penniwinkles," said she, smiling, "Is that what
ye ca' them ?     We Scotch folk aye ca' them Buckies !
But," she gravely continued, " ye're shurely nae ga'en
                         "
to ate thae Snails     ?
    "Yes, indeed     I   am,'*   I  replied.    Whereupon     my
landlady observed          in a quaintly humorous style
shaking her head, and holding up her hand, as she
moved to the door with the despised Buckies              " Weel,
weel   ! ye English folk wud        just  eat onything ava !"
    The good woman's expression of disgust not a
little amused me, conveyed as it was in the broadest
of Scotch.     I found, upon       inquiry, that her antipathy

 to Periwinkles was very general           over the country.
 I may be pardoned for observing that it seems to me
 rather an absurd prejudice.          Everybody knows that
 hundreds of boat-loads of the L. littorea are sold
during the year at Billingsgate, and that thousands
of people make an honest livelihood by retailing them
through the streets of the metropolis.           To London
children the cry of    "Wink      ! wink !  Pennywink' !" is
especially musical   ;  and whenever the welcome sound
is heard, a rush is made to mamma for pins and a
penny, to make a purchase.
   The taste for these little univalves is by no means
of modern date, nor was it at all times confined to
the poor.     Pliny has left on record the name of a
certain epicurean, Lupinus Fulvius, who formed pre-
serves for his Periwinkles ; and even went the length,
with the view of making them larger and more
tender, of inventing a special diet for them.           This
was a mixture of boiled wine, spelt meal, and other
rich substances.    It   is further said, that so important
did these animals become in a gastronomic point of
view, and such was the care bestowed upon their
breeding, that the shell of a single individual would
contain a as much as eighty quadrantes," or about
eighteen   quarts, imperial     measurement,    according to
classical commentators.        How greatly   has the modern
species degenerated    !    This falling off need not, how-
ever, be a cause of regret,     if the same unhappy effects
were to attend the consumption of these animals in
our time as was visible among the Romans.                The

at once the soft parts of the animal, we find it is shut

sides of the tank, rendering                it to      a certain degree
opaque.        This is   a   healthy symptom of the vitality of
its occupants,       but, as it has              the disadvantage of
seriously obscuring your view of the interior, you
will be desirous to remove it. That can easily be
done by rubbing the surface of the tank with a bit of
rag, twisted round the forefinger, or, better still, tied
to a rod.  There is a yet easier way of attaining the
desired result, and that              is,

astonishing.        It   is   indeed an interesting                sight     to

I   have classed the Limpet (Patella vulgatd) with
the Periwinkle, as being equally useful as    tank                   a
scavenger.      He      is    not inferior in interest as an object
of study, while             as an   ornament, no comparison can
be instituted          between      the two.     Indeed, few occup-
ants of the Aquarium are more pleasant to look at
than   a   Limpet, as he glides along, with               a    whole forest
of weeds and frondlets growing on his back.
   Our familiarity with this mollusc      one of the     it   is
commonest       on          the sea-shore      is   apt to make us
imagine there          is   nothing wonderful or peculiar in his
structure.     A       little acquaintance with zoology will,
however,     soon undeceive             us.    Indeed, almost every
part of the construction of this animal                       is   calculated
to excite     our wonder.  Who, for example, would
suppose that the tongue of the Limpet was so ingeni-
ously framed, that   was    ribbon-shaped organ fully
                              it     a
three inches in length, that its teeth were spinous,
and that there were three rows of these that further,    ;
the teeth of the middle row were cut into four points,
and those of the external rows, (which are not exactly
opposite to or continuous with those of the middle
series, but alternate with them,) were cut into two

 for rasping down the food   ; and in proportion as the
 anterior prickles are worn away in this operation and
 absorbed, another portion    of the tongue is brought
 forward to supply its place ; but that there may be
 no deficiency in its length, we find the apex soft and
 muscular, where in fact a continual growth and ad-
 dition are going on.
    " When a Phytophagous Gasteropod is about to eat,
it thrusts forward, and to  a certain extent evolves, the
 spinous tongue, protruding at the same time the lip
 on each side, by which the tongue is compressed and
forced into the form of the bowl of a spoon.         The
food is now taken hold on by the lips, drawn forwards
and retained by the prickly tongue, and simultaneously
pressed against the upper horny jaw, by which means
a portion is bitten off, sometimes with a very audible
noise.   The detached morsel is then passed along the
tongue, torn and rasped down by its sharp prickles,
and, forced on by the peristaltic motion of the organ,
and by the retropulsive action of the adjacent muscles,
the mass is made to enter the gullet.    At the entrance
of this canal, there is an uvular caruncle, which is
probably the seat of the animal's taste; and on its
side a pair of lobulated salivary glands, or sometimes
two pairs, which have each a single excretory duct,
to convey their peculiar secretion into its upper part,
to lubricate and soften the mass.       The gullet is a
muscular canal, lined interiorly with a mucous coat,
presenting, indeed,   the same structure as the whole

tudinal direction." *
  Any      one who has clambered over rocks by the sea-
side must have been struck with the peculiar appear-
ance they frequently          present     of having been bored
into a number of holes, to a depth frequently exceeding
half an inch. Now, it is a curious circumstance that
these excavations in the solid stone are formed by
the Limpet.        The animal lies in these           sleeps all day
long, and awakens at night to go abroad in search of
food.
  This singular fact was first made known by Mr
Lukis, of Guernsey ; a gentleman whose studies have
done much towards             enlightening       us upon        several
hitherto    obscure     portions of Natural History.                He

found exactly to correspond with the surface of the
rock to which it is attached.                Here it will rest and
sleep, and only relax its strong adhesion to the rock,
when the muscular fibre becomes exhausted by long
contraction, in which state a sudden blow, horizon-
tally, will easily displace it.          A   fact, known to fisher-
men, and poor who use them for food,                    is,   that they

the day.      May not this be the period of roaming for
food, as     well as when covered with the tide ?
     " The march of the Limpet is slow and formal; and
whenever the cupping process is renewed, the poste-
rior end of the shell is brought into contact with the
rock, which is of a soft nature, and will receive the
impressions of its denticulations.              The track of an
individual placed under surveillance was thus made
visible over a space of several yards, possessing the
same       regularity     and disposition,     and was further
remarkable for the constant revolutions on its left.
     "   The tracks of the Limpet on granite and other
hard rocks, present, at first sight, the same appear-
ances ; but, on a closer examination, they are found
to differ.     When first observed in 1829, a large por-
tion of a fine-grained sienitic rock was traced over
by these shells: the remainder was plain, and ap-
peared varnished with a thin coating of some kind of
fucus, without any markings upon its surface.    As
no Patellae were at first discovered,           and the isolated
situation of the rock prevented any from reaching              it,
I  was at    loss to explain these appearances; but,
              a
after some search,         a   fissure   was found at the north
end, where five or six Limpets had affixed themselves,
each having        a    direct road leading to their pasturage
ground.       By   the help of    a   glass, the markings visible
on the rock were discovered to be the remains of the
above fucus, which had been eaten through or trodden
down by these animals in their excursions, and which
retained the indentures of their shells.            The edge of

 the vegetable surface was then examined,           and found
to be nibbled in a circular manner, resembling the
anterior margin of the shells."       *
    By this mole-like burrowing in       the rock, the Limpet
is enabled to resist the violence of the waves, and also
to prevent birds of prey, as gulls and others, from
destroying him.        This they are apt to do by forcing
their bills under his shell, when he, not anticipating
danger, looses his muscular hold, and allows his tes-
taceous canopy to be raised above the surface of the
stone.
    If suddenly  disturbed, the Limpet has the power of
ejecting a cement, by means of which it glues itself
to the rock so firmly, that, according to Keaumur, a
pressure of twenty-eight to thirty Ibs. is required to
overcome    this adhesive     force.    Whenever the young
zoologist wishes to capture a specimen,             he should
endeavour    to fix upon one asleep.           Let him then
softly insinuate the blade of his knife under its shell,
and tilt the animal suddenly over.            Should the sur-
prise have been ineffectual, it is useless to make for
the present another attack upon the same animal, for
he would permit his shell to be chipped into a thou-
sand bits before he would abandon his hold.
    Wedged among rocks and loose stones, we fre-
quently    meet   with large shells of the Buccinum
undatum^      a species of Whelk.           These are made
pretty often to serve as dwelling-places to adult and

corpulent Soldier- Crabs.     The length of a specimen
now before me measures four and a-half inches.             It
is completely covered on the outside with Barnacles
and small Mussels, while the interior is lined with a
very delicate zoophytic crust, forming a kind of reti-

Serpulse.
   Closely resembling this shell in general formation,
though of considerably smaller size, is the common
Dog- winkle (Purpura lapillus). The colour of this
mollusc varies greatly.     In some, the prevailing tint
is white, in others, yellow or deep orange.               Not

interest is attached to this little creature, from the
belief that it supplied the purple dye for which Tyre
was famous over the world.        But here, as elsewhere,
we may avail ourselves of the labours of our prede-
cessors.   A late writer says :
   "The most beautiful dye-stuff of antiquity was
the Tyrian purple, so called from the place of its dis-
covery and chief manufacture.          I   should rather have
said, perhaps,   place of its reputed discovery, for its

                 PERIWINKLES       WHELKS.               27
 records are not reliable.    The Greeks were by far too
 vain a race to admit that any great discovery did not
 originate with themselves.       They attribute the dis-
 covery of the Tyrian purple to Hercules        (500 B.C.),
 or rather to a little dog belonging to Hercules.        As
 the story goes, this little dog, happening to wander
 along the Tyrian sea-shore, came back with his mouth
 all purple, and the nymphs of Tyras, a favourite of
 Hercules, were so delighted with the colour, that she
bade him see her no more until he brought her a
robe dyed purple, like the colour of his little dog's
mouth.     What would      an  enamoured   man have done
when thus conjured     ]   How much     more a demi-god    ?
 Hercules   promised to oblige her if he could; so
tracking the little dog's footsteps to see where they
led, and what he would set about, he followed him
to the sea-shore, where the animal began to eat shell-
fish of two peculiar sorts       the Eucdnum and Pur-
pura.    Hercules is reported to have thereupon col-
lected some of these shell-fish, and extracted from a
receptacle in the throat the celebrated    Tyrian purple,
In   this way the Tyrian dye-stuff continued to be
obtained by careful dyers; some however,          less con-
scientious than Hercules, pounded the shell-fish in a
mortar, and incorporated the fine dye-stuff with other
animal juice."
    The same writer also states, that, " in order to im-
part the last shade of beauty, the juice of both shell-
fish (Eucdnum and Purpura) is necessary." But this is
an error, the latter only being requisite for the purpose.

directions of a naturalist who flourished two centuries
ago.  This was William Cole, who appears to have
been the first, in modern times, to discover that the
common Dog-winkle yielded the famous dye of the
ancients       :
     " Having supplied yourself with                       a few of these
animals, break the shells with a smart stroke with a
hammer, and then throw them into some fresh water,
in which they quickly die; care, however, must be
taken so as not to crush the body of the fish within
the shell.           The broken pieces being picked off," says
Mr     Cole,       " there will          appear a white vein, lying trans-
versely, in a little furrow or cleft next to the head of
the fish, which must be digged out with the stiff
point of a horse-hair pencil, being made short and
tapering.The letters, figures, or what else shall be
made on the linen (and perhaps silk too), will pre-
sently appear of a pleasant light-green                           colour, and,
if   placed in the sun, will change into the following
colours    :       that       is,   if   in winter, about noon        ;   if   in
summer,     hour or two after sunrising, and so
                   an
much before setting, for in the heat of the day in
                                                              '
summer the colour will come on so fast that the
succession of colours will scarcely be distinguished.
That to the first light-green, will appear of deep-
                                                 it                   a

                          a                 sea-green             a            ;
after which, in           a     few minutes more,        it   will alter into

a watchet-blue ; from that, in a little time more,         it
will be of a purplish red; after which, lying an hour
or two (supposing the sun still shining), it will be of
a very deep purple red, beyond which the sun can
do no more.       But then the last and more beautiful
colour, after washing in scalding water and soap, will
(the matter being again put into the sun or wind
to dry) be of a fair bright crimson, or near to the
prince's colour, which        afterwards,   notwithstanding
there is no use of any styptic to bind the colour, will
continue the same,      if  well ordered, as   I have  found
in handkerchiefs that have been washed more than
forty times, only it will be somewhat allayed from
what it was after the first washing.         While the cloth
so writ lies in the sun,        it will yield  a strong and
fetid smell,   as  if  garlic and assafcetida were mixed
together."
   Mr  Gosse, after detailing      some entertaining   expe-
riments    with   the Purpura,        makes the following
remarks  :
   " I have  seen   it stated, that  if the cloth be washed
in scalding water and soap, it comes out from the
lather changed from the reddish purple hue to a fair
bright crimson.      With   me, however, the soap and the
hot water had no appreciable influence in brighten-
ing the colour.      My experiments were performed in
winter, and   I  will not affirm that the intensity of a
summer's    sun would not in some degree have modi-
fied the result.     There appears to me one objection
to this material ever having been used to dye large

surfaces of uniform      colour; for, from the admixture
of mucous with the colouring matter, when any
quantity of the latter is collected, the hue is found
to imbue the cloth in a mottled or blotched manner,
some parts being much darker than others.             What
method the ancients had of avoiding this appearance,
I  do not know."
    But we must not conclude this chapter without
noticing a curious property possessed by this mollusc.
This is its extraordinary voracity, a property noticed
by old writers like Pliny, and confirmed by Cuvier,
and other modern writers.          Mr Sowerby thus      de-
scribes its mode of piercing    :
    "Gliding stealthily among the sea-weeds and stones,
it" (fhePurpura) "seeks its prey, and woe to the small
Winkle, Limpet, or Trocluit, that comes within reach
of its terrible proboscis. It will bring the aperture of
its own shell opposite to that of its victim, and then,
introducing his apparatus, never leaves it until all the
soft parts are transferred to his capacious stomach.
But even where no aperture or door leaves the smaller
mollusc open to the attack of his enemy in that way,
he is by no means       deterred by this little difficulty  ;
for  if the object of his attack be a Limpet, firmly at-
tached to a stone, or a Bivalve tenaciously holding its
shell closed, he will manage to perforate the shell,
and through the hole draw the quivering substance.
Mr                                                 '
      Spence Bates related to the authors of the British
 Mollusca,'  that by way of experiment he placed a
 P'tirpura in  a vessel  of sea water,  in company with    a

Mussel, and observed the result.       In a short time the
Purpura, finding the Mussel was not at all open to
his advances, and that the valves of the shell were so
firmly drawn together as to leave no chance of effect-
ing an entry between their edges, began to think of
attacking them from without.         Seeking a portion of
the outer surface free from epidermis, he commenced
boring.      His human observer repudiating the policy
     '
of     non-interference,' removed   him, and turned     the
Mussel     over,   placing that valve uppermost which
was     most covered with the horny protection; the
creature    soon managed to turn over the huge body
and shell of the Mussel, and resumed his operations
at the point where he left off when disturbed; and he
did this repeatedly after similar interruptions.         At
last, quite satisfied that the breach would in time be
effected in that way,      Mr Bates resolved to wait     no
longer for the process, but at once give the voracious
shell-fish an opportunity    of satisfying his appetite, at
a smaller demand of exertion from itself and of
patience from its observer.      To this end he cut the
muscles     of the Bivalve, so as to deprive it of the
power of keeping its valves closed. Its fate was thus
accelerated; it was now at the mercy of its enemy.
The latter no sooner perceived the valves open, than,
leaving his former work of boring, he seized his ad-
vantage     by inserting his trunk between the valves,
not in this instance acting upon the general rule, that
 the enjoyment of an acquisition is increased in pro-
 portion to the difficulty and trouble of obtaining it."

32            THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUAKIUM.
   Now, any person reading the above graphic sketch
by Mr Bates, would naturally be inclined to look
upon the Purpura        as an  animal possessing       rather
more than an ordinary share of intelligence or in-
stinct.    This feeling, however, will be considerably
modified after perusing the following incident, which
lately came under my own observation.
   In   order to give my Blennies a treat by change of
diet, I  cut open a large-sized Mussel, and let it drop
to the bottom of the tank.          The fish soon caught
sight of this object, and tore away with great eager-
ness the quivering flesh of their late companion, and
eventually left the empty shell overturned among the
pebbles.    A Purpura shortly thereafter gliding       along,
took up his position in one of the valves.            He re-
mained firmly fixed there for several days, and suc-
ceeded in boring through the shell, doubtless expecting
to get a fine bonne louche.      In  this, of course, he was
mistaken, his labours being entirely unrewarded, ex-
cept by receiving my sympathy for his disappointed
hopes.
    Such a remarkable instance of instinct at fault         I
had never witnessed hitherto.          It  rivals the stories
told of the hen sitting upon a piece of chalk, thinking
it was     an egg    "the flesh-fly, that      deposits their
 eggs upon the blossom of the carrion plant, where the
young must inevitably perish from hunger, instead of
 real flesh"    or the poor bee, that settled upon an
 anemone, thinking     it was a flower of the garden, and
 so perished.

MY    first acquaintance         scientific,  at least     with this
class   of animals commenced              at  North Berwick;        a
place dear to every naturalist, from having been the
residence     and scene of study of Dr Johnston, the
accomplished historian of
                                   " British   Molluscs."      Find-
ing, on a certain occasion, that           I should have     to wait
three hours for a train to         Edinburgh, I made         for the
shore,   full of that relish for observation and             zeal for
discovery which my devotion to marine objects had
by this time inspired.           Luckily, the tide was favour-
able to permit my getting out a considerable distance
on those long standing ledges of rocks that occur in
this, as in so many other parts of the east coast of
Scotland.       I   saw vast numbers of large and gor-

geously-tinted    Actinice, flowering at the base of many
a pool.     I saw,  besides, scores of Star-fishes,  such as
the common Cross-fish (Uraster rubens), the purple
Sun-star (Solaster^ endecd), and many others, lying
apparently dead; so listless did they seem, among the
dense masses of Bladder-wrack          that here grows so
profusely.     There were many other sea-wonders then
new to me       some wedged in secret crevices       of rock,
and others lying in little pools.        But what, most of
all, attracted my attention on this afternoon, was a
little object that    I  discovered on suddenly turning
over a piece of sandstone.        I  thought, at the time,
that it must be some species of marine spider, which
had, by some accident, been squeezed into a flattened
shape.     On attempting to take it up with my fingers,
one of its legs snapped, and the animal dropped
down.      I searched for another specimen, and having
found    one, was, I imagined, handling it very tenderly,
when a similar fate befell it.      Eesolved, after finding
a third, to exercise greater caution than ever,    I thought
the most ingenious method would be to slide the blade
 of my knife slowly under his body, which was about
the size of a pea. This contrivance,        I was happy to
 find, proved perfectly successful, and raising the little
 creature,   quite ininjured,  I  laid him gently upon a
 clear frond of silky Ulva, to examine my prize through
 a pocket-lens.    I was greatly interested in the stranger,
 and carried     him carefully home.      I placed him, of
 course, in my Aquarium;        but, although he crawled
 about for a while apparently at home, he grew sud-

                       STAE-FTSHES.                       35
denly indisposed, and, to my regret, died in little
more than three hours after his admission.
   The animal proved to be, not a Sea-spider, as            I
had imagined, but        a  curious    species  of Star-fish
(Ophiocoma rosula), the common Brittle-star.             The
fragility exhibited by the first specimens       I caught at
North Berwick, and which I, at the time, attributed
to my rough handling, was due to what some writers
have not hesitated to term a suicidal tendency; the
animal    apparently   preferring to break into       pieces,
before  it would submit to   be captured.     Never, indeed,
was a more timid little creature seen on land or sea.
   The    indifference it exhibits      in throwing off its
limbs is almost as great as that of the hydroid Polype.
Beside the somewhat        questionable recommendation
conveyed in such a quality, it directly commands our
admiration, from      being   one of the most beautiful
Star-fishes found upon our shores.           The variety of

its colours make it a most delightful ornament to the
Aquarium.
    Professor   Forbes    gives,   in one of his works, so
humorous an account of his early experience              of an
individual of this family (Luidia fragillissima), that
I  am assured     my readers will be obliged to *me for
transferring   it to  these pages.       I am the more in-
duced to do this, from the fact, that the work from
which the extract is taken is not very accessible            to
the general reader, especially when at the sea-shore.
The Professor observes      :
    " It is the wonderful        power which the Luidia
possesses, not merely of casting away arms entire, but
of breaking them voluntarily into little pieces, with
great rapidity, which approximates it to the Ophiurae.
This faculty renders the preservation of a perfect
specimen    a very difficult     matter.    The first time    I
ever took one of these creatures,      I succeeded  in getting
it into the boat  entire.     Never having seen one before,
and quite unconscious of its suicidal powers,         I spread
it out on   a rowing-bench, the better to admire its
form and colours.       On attempting to remove it for
preservation,    to my horror        and disappointment       I
found only an assemblage of rejected members.              My
conservative endeavours         were all neutralised by its
destructive exertions ; and it is now badly represented
in my cabinet by an armless disk and a diskless arm.
Next time    I went to dredge on the same spot, deter-
mined not to be cheated of a specimen in such a way
a second time,     I brought with me a bucket of cold

                       STAR-FISHES.                      37
fresh water, to which article Star-fishes have a great
antipathy.    As  I expected,  a  Luidia  came up in the
dredge,   a most gorgeous     specimen.    As it does not
generally break up before it is raised above the surface
of the sea, cautiously and anxiously          I  sunk my
bucket to a level with the dredge's mouth, and pro-
ceeded, in a most gentle manner, to introduce Luidia
to the purer element.      Whether the cold air was too
much for him, or the sight of the bucket too terrific,
I  know not, but, in a moment, he proceeded to dis-
solve his corporation, and at every mesh of the dredge
his fragments were       seen  escaping.    In  despair,  I
grasped at the largest, and brought up the extremity
of an arm with its terminating eye, the spinous eyelid
of which opened and closed with something exceed-
ingly like a wink of derision."
    I  may add that Joppa and its neighbourhood is
not only extremely rich in varieties of Brittle Star-
fishes, but in good specimens     of the true Star-fishes,
as the    Common     Sun-star   (Solasier papposa), the
Purple Sun-star (Solaster endeca), the Rosy Cribella
(Cribella rosea), and the Common Cross-fish (Uras-
ter rubens).
    If the reader has perused the prefatory motto to
this chapter,   he  will  be reminded     of the popular
belief entertained regarding the power of the Star-
fish to prey upon the Oyster.       The poet, in this, as
in so many other cases, has not invented a story, but
availed himself of a belief that has been transmitted
from very distant periods.        Indeed   the Admiralty

 38           THE SEA-SIDE AND AQTJAKIUM.
 Court of England, in days of old, threatened a severe
penalty upon those " that do not tread under their
feet, or throw upon the shore, a fish which they call
a  Five-finger,   resembling a spur-rowel, because that
the fish gets into the Oyster when they gape open,
and suck them out."
    The question as to whether        it preys upon the
Oyster or not, has given occasion to no small discus-
sion even amongst scientific men.          Some deny the
alleged fact altogether, while less sceptical observers
are unable to understand the mode in which the Star-
fish could injure an animal apparently so capable of
self-defence    as the   Oyster.   According to certain
authors, the Star-fish encircles the Oyster with its
" five
       fingers," and by some clever process of suction
destroys the unfortunate       mollusc.      Others, again,
maintain that the first step of the attack is the injec-
tion of some marine chloroform between the shells of
the Oyster, and that, during the insensibility that
follows, the Star-fish effects an entrance.
    Such are the opinions of learned authorities upon
the matter ; but the young zoologist may be reminded,
that he will occasionally      obtain    some trustworthy
hints from a class who make no pretence to scientific
accuracy     namely, fishermen.     Some of these, with
whom     I have   conversed, are of the same opinion as
Bishop Spratt, and believe that when the Oyster is
gaping the Star-fish insinuates     a  finger,  and hastily
scrapes out the delicious bonne bouche;        nay, further,
maintain that the Star-fish is far from being at all

                             STAR-FISHES.                                39
    times successful.       Very often, especially when there
-   has only been one ray inserted, the frightened Oyster
    grasps   it with all his might, and obliges his discom-
    fited opponent to retire minus a limb.
         If the   writer might venture to suggest an opinion,
    he would express his belief that the following is the
    correct account of the state of matters.                He believes,
    with the fishermen,           that   frequently    the Star-fish
    begins his attack by merely inserting one arm                   ;   but
    he does not believe that the Oyster ever, under such
    circumstances,     escapes with life.       Let us suppose the
    Star-fish to have succeeded in insidiously introducing
    a ray within the shell of the apathetic Oyster, and
    that the Oyster immediately resented              such intrusion
    by closing his shell with all the force he can exert.
    The opposite argument at this stage               is,   that the in-
    truder   is   obliged from pain to abandon his hold, and
    even to pay for his audacity by the forfeit of              a   limb.
    But against this we advance the notorious fact, that
    the Star-fish, like so many marine creatures of                      a
    similar organisation,    is   remarkably indifferent to pain.
    In   short,
              I     believe the true explanation to be, that
    the Oyster cannot sustain such continued muscular
    exertion for nearly so long          a   period as the Star-fish
    can tolerate pain, and that, consequently,              the latter   is
    in the long run successful.
         Before concluding     this      chapter,I     must observe
    that dried specimens of the Star-fish are very inter-
    esting objects to look at, especially when held before
    the light of     window or
                     a             moderator lamp.

beauty of the intricate net-work they possess will be
very apparent even under the moderate magnifying
power of the ordinary hand-lens.
      Mr Wood mentions    a very ingenious   method of
procuring a perfect    skeleton of the Star-fish.       This
is, by taking an individual and placing          near an
ant's nest.  In the course of few days,
                                 a           it it   will   be
found that the ants have nibbled the soft parts com-
pletely away, leaving the skeleton as clean as         if   it
were an osseous one, carefully dissected,     and after-
wards incarcerated in spirits.
      Thought already to have observed,   that wherever
Star-fishes are introduced    into the Aquarium they
ought to be very young specimens, unless the tank           is
of considerable size.

life or not, that are altogether strangers         to the charm
of leaning idly in a clear summer's day over a boat's
sides, and of looking down upon the bright sands
below.      The cloudlessness of the sky, and the sultri-
ness of the atmosphere,         are in unison with the calm
mood of the hour.           As you dip your hand into the

thrilling through you, you can hardly imagine the
sea  to be a distinct element from your own.             I must

as gently as if it were a breeze of west wind blowing
over a clump of heather          :   nay, the stones, save for
their shelly crusts, looked like the pebbles on the
beach.
     Although it   is,   of course, impossible to realise such
a    fancy, we are not altogether          incapacitated from
forming     some tolerably      accurate    conception of the
floor of that untrodden sea vault, at        a   depth far below
what the quickest eye can pierce, even on the calmest
day.      Sea-speculators in the olden time, were obliged
to draw upon their imagination,             or to trust to the
doubtful evidences of the lead or anchor.                In   our
day, the rapid advances         of geological knowledge has
enabled   a   good, though     as    yet an unrealised view to
be taken of that terra incognita.          We have not space
nor inclination,       on this bright      day, to pursue the
latter track     to travel over mountains           higher than
the Dhawilghiry, to descend into valleys wider and
deeper     than the Mississippi,        or to encounter those
marvellous rivers that float through the heart of the
sea.     In limiting     ourselves to what has been actually
visited     in discoursing only of such curiosities      as have
been brought home by actual travellers, we must not
in this place omit to notice the high position occupied
among such hardy explorers by one of the most
eminent of living zoologists.           We refer to M. Milne-

                        ACALEPH.E.                         43
Edwards.     Unlike many who can write and converse
pleasantly in snug laboratories and easy studies, or
who, like myself, run no inconvenience, far less any
danger, in their humble researches         at the beach, this
famous Savan has shewn more ardour than the most
zealous   pearl-fisher, in pursuing       his investigations
into  marine wonders.          Protected    by an ordinary
diving-bell, he has descended into the depths of the
sea, and returned laden with specimens the like of
which had never been seen before.
   But, pursuing the idea with which we opened this
chapter, let us endeavour to form some conception of
the character of that ocean life that lies in the dozen
miles intervening between         us and the Lomonds        of
Fifeshire.   We    are, of course, still in the boat, and
within a few yards of the beach; nevertheless, we
can imagine ourselves armed with even a freer pass-
port than the diving-bell of Milne-Edwards.
   Behold  ! we are down, and upon the sands.            What
a variety of life meets us   !  is our first reflection.   On
every side, wherever we turn, our eyes are dazzled
with objects, the appearance of which in their native
element is so unlike what we had imagined them to
be; nay, the greater number of objects we meet is
perfectly new to us. There float by genuses of ani-
mals, not a species of which       any zoologist ever saw.
Gorgeous sea-weeds bloom with a richness and fla-
vour which we believed it only possible for sun-bred
flowers to exhibit.     We must add, for the credit of
mother Earth, however, that sights less pleasant are

equally abundant.          Dark, ugly forms dart past us,
with bright, cold eyes and glancing teeth, that we
never wish to look upon any more.   Then there are
gnarled trunks of what were once noble forest trees,
still clinging with strong roots to their native soil,*
that has been for ages submerged under water.     The
sun once shone on those leafless branches; birds sung
and nestled among them.               In   place     of such occu-
pants, a sea-plant now waves               or a mollusc creeps      ;
or frightened bands of small fish fly for shelter, as
sparrow and thrush from hawk or heron did before                     :
for, in the sea as elsewhere, authority is still main-
tained by
                              " the   simple plan,
        That they should take who have the power,
          And they should keep who can."
   But now we stumble across something that recalls
other associations. That anchor             is,
                                  perhaps, the sole
existing fragment of what was once            a    noble ship ;   and
our sea journey assumes         a     sadness that     it   had not
when we set out.           We are reminded of what the
poet says   :
                 " Shipwrecks   and their spoils,
     The wealth of merchants, the artillery
     Of war, the chains of captives, and the gems
     That gleam'd upon the brow of beauty; crowns
     Of monarchs, swords of heroes, anchors lost
     That never had let go their hold in storms;
     Helms, sunk in ports, that steer'd adventurous barks
     Round the wide world."      ....

      A  hidden golgotha where they had fall'n
      Unseen, unsepulchred, but not unwept
      By lover, friend, relation far away,
      Long waiting their return to home and country,
      And going down into their fathers' graves,
      With their gray hairs or youthful locks, in sorrow,
      To meet no more till seas give up their dead ;

   But we must halt here, and return from an ima-
ginary expedition, to the upper air. We are on, and
not in, the water. The sun is still high ; but a gentle
breeze has sprung up, and we call to remembrance
our having left home with some intention of work.
   Well,   I  commence       my labours      by producing     a
small ring net, which        I  pass several times through
the water.     See  ! in  a   short time   I  have succeeded
                                   I
in capturing the very thing want a fine little spe-
cimen of the Medusa, or, as it is more familiarly
known, a Sea-blubber, or Nettle-fish.*          It  is the com-
monest species of the great family of Acalephse to be
found on the British shores, and, like many other
animals, is more curious in its construction than our
familiarity with it would lead us to suppose.
   The most accurate idea of the form of a Medusa is
presented by a miniature umbrella.            The comparison
extends further than as regards mere shape, for when-
ever the    Medusan wishes to ascend,            it  executes a
series of movements         exactly like the brisk closing

and opening of an umbrella.            When again about to
descend,   it turns gently over and sinks down, stick
uppermost.
   The Acalephae possess one curious property, which
made them alternately objects of superstition and ad-
miration; this is their luminosity.              Many a wild
theory was advanced in days of yore, to explain this
curious oceanic phenomenon, of which the following
lines give no exaggerated picture        :
                                 " The luminous life
         That makes the dark nocturnal ocean bright
         With constellated clusters of rare things,
         Group'd or apart ; seeming in lustrous grace
         Fantastic wreaths of many coloured gems,
         Instinct with living fire; or here and there,
         Glittering in golden glory; flashing forth
         Metallic white, or tremulous silver, cinqued
         By ambient tints of sapphire, pink, and blue.
         As if some opulent spirit of the sea
         Had, from his treasury of precious stones,
         Flung up his choicest treasures on the waves,
         To bathe their beauties in the meek moonshine."
   The Mamaria scintillans is the species by which
this phosphorescent property is most remarkably ex-
hibited.     Our readers may perhaps be obliged to us
for a  prose description of the appearance these animals
present, from the pleasant pages of Miss Pratt:
    " Beautiful   as are  many of the creatures of the sea,
none are more lovely than the Acalephs.               Now they
may be seen in the darkness of night moving with
most graceful ease, like so many resplendent orbs,
shining singly, yet gliding from place to place ; and

                        ACALEPim                       47
now combined in vast multitudes, forming a broad
sheet of light.     The vessel glides in amongst    them,
or the oar throws up the white foam, and a shower of
stars rises but to fall a stream    of living brightness.
Down below the surface these jellies seem like balls
of silver or gold : sometimes, as in the Girdle of Venus,
of the blue Mediterranean, appearing like a riband
of flame of several feet long    ; or as in the yet more
luminous Pryosoma, enabling the voyager to read by
their light as he stands by the cabin- window of the
ship. Some of the larger species are described as hav-
ing the resemblance to white-hot shot, visible at some
depth beneath the surface ; our own rocky shores are
sometimes studded with them as with diamonds, and
many who have trodden on the tuft of sea-weed have
seen   it shoot out in all directions rays of phosphoric
light, which reminded them of a star of artificial fire-
work."
    We have yet to mention another property of the
Acalephse.      This is the unpleasant one of stinging,
whence comes the popular name of Nettle-fish.           It
was at one time supposed       that this was natural to
all, but the late Professor Forbes ascertained     that it
was    confined to comparatively     a small number of
species.    The stinging apparatus is formed of several
hollow and (what we should not expect from the
gelatinous character of the animal) muscular fibres.
This apparatus, however, has been observed in species
that have no urticating power.
    In   Scotland, where they are known as Scoudres,

the Medusae attain a very large size.           They are not
unfrequently encountered by bathers, and under such
circumstances, an embrace from one is neither safe
nor pleasant.       The following is the experience of an
unhappy swimmer in the Frith of Forth            :
   " In   a  moment it" (the Medusa) "enwrapped me, so
that every part of my body was stung, and              I could
only disengage myself by tearing the animal piece-
meal from me, at the peril of my hands, which be-
came just as      if I  had poured vitriol on them.      With
great difficulty     I swam      back toward the shore   \ but
when     I   reached     the machine,    I  had not strength
enough to dress, and was afterward led home by two
persons.       A medical friend ordered an application of
oil and vinegar. Intense agony, as if stung by thou-
sands of wasps, continued for about eight hours ; and
if it had not then terminated,         I  must have sunk be-
neath the torture.          I  felt an internal soreness, and
was unable to eat for two days.             The inflammation
of the throat continued for a fortnight."
   This would,        I   imagine, have been the common
Scoudre, which is very abundant              on the Scottish
coast.      I  have    seen   it very nearly the   size above
stated, and     Dr Landsborough mentions that not only
does   it sting when in a perfect state, but that " the
threads retain their virulence after they have been sepa-
rated from the animal by the force of the waves" In
confirmation of this statement he narrates the follow-
ing anecdote :
               I
   " When was in a boat one day, near Ardrossan,

                            ACALEPH^l.                        49
 I grasped, as     it was carried past by the tide, what       I
thought was a rare and beautiful algae, but              I very
speedily let go my prize.            Major Martin, who was
alongside of me, next grasped it as it passed him, but
in a moment dashed it back into the sea. We looked
at each other, and, notwithstanding the smarting of
our fingers, laughed on finding that we had both
           '                       "
greedily     caught a Tartar.'
   It  is only after a great storm, when thousands of
these creatures are left stranded on the shore, that we
are able to form some estimate of the vast numbers
of them that inhabit the         sea.   It is then that we are
led to ask what purpose they serve in             the^ economy
of nature.    -  The humblest student of natural history
is soon taught to discard the vulgar idea that for
great ends great agents must be used.             Accordingly,
he does not find any objection to the Medusse being
concerned       in the maintenance of important laws,
                                                                 '
from their delicacy and fragility.          Some of their uses
are now well known.           In  the first place, they serve,
like many other animals, as food for beings larger
than themselves.          They form, for instance, favourite
articles of food to the Greenland and other species of
Whale.       They     also  exude     a slimy   mucus,    which
serves as suitable nourishment to the .young             of less
formidable       prey.     But the most curious function
they discharge is their acting as protectors to various
small species of fish.          This observation was first
made by      Mr   Peach.     Formerly it was believed, from
the number of little fish found in the stomachs of the

50            THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUAKIUM.
Acalephae, that these had been devoured by them as
regular prey.     Mr Peach,    as  will  be seen from the
following extract, which we copy from Mr Gosse's
" Tenby," delivers the Medusae from the charge of
voracity so long ascribed to them      :
    " Mr Peach's observations     were made at Peterhead
in the beginning of August; at which time Cyanea
(aurelia) aurita and Cyanea capillata were so abun-
dant in the harbour       and bay, as occasionally very
much to inconvenience the fishermen, and render it
difficult to lift the oars, especially of small boats,
from amongst them.          Round these Medusae very
small fishes were observed playing        sometimes sport-
ing round C. aurita, and quitting it on a sudden for
C. inscripta.   When an enemy came near occasionally
two or three might be seen attending one of the
Cyaneae, and when attacked or alarmed, rushing under
its umbrella,    and among the tentacula,        so  as to
shelter themselves in the large folds connected with
the ova, where they remained until the danger had
passed,   and then emerged       again to sport and play
around    their  sheltering  friend.     When under    the
umbrella seeking shelter, they lay so close as to allow
themselves to be taken         into   a bucket   with  the
Medusae     from beneath which, after a short time,
they would come out and gambol, as while in the sea.
In this way Mr Peach     captured many young Whitings,
measuring from less than an inch to two and a-half
inches in length.     It was evident that they resorted
 to the Medusae for protection      and not, as sometimes

                        ACALEPH.E.                     51
stated, that they are preyed upon by the glass-like
creatures; and it is probably with a view to greater
security that they prefer the stinging species, with its
eight branches    of long tentacula, and large fringed
ovaries,  to   Cyanea aurita, with its single and
frequently short row of delicate appendages.       What
then, Mr Peach asks, becomes of the paralysing
influence of the tentacula of this Medusa on fishes ?
This, he thinks, opens a new field for observation. He
believes, too, that the facts which he has observed,    if
not conclusive against,     at least throw considerable
doubt on the fish-eating propensities ascribed to the
Medusae ; for he is convinced that in these instances
the fishes resorted    to the Medusae as to protectors,
and not enemies.      In  no instance did he observe a
fish in the stomach of the Medusae, but all were free
to depart when they pleased.
    " In an instance subsequently recorded        in his
journal, Mr Peach states that a small Whiting, which
 was gliding round a small weak Cyanea aurita, was
 attacked by a young Pollack, or Baddock, whose
 movements it easily evaded by dodging round the
 Medusae;   a second   Baddock, however, soon joined in
 the pursuit    but both were for some time baffled,
 until an unlucky move drove the Whiting from its
 poor shelter,   and then a severe chase took       place.
 The pursuers were joined by others, who followed
 like a pack of hounds, until the Whiting became
 exhausted,   and was left by its enemies     who were
 unable to swallow it       to all appearance dead.     In

52                 THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
this state the tide gently drifted it along with the
Cyanea, until after a time it recovered, swam slowly
to its protector, and took refuge as before.                   The pack
soon     observed       it,   drove    it   again into open       water,
and this time succeeded in really killing it. During
their attack Mr Peach repeatedly threw stones among
them, to induce them to desist, but so intent were
they on the pursuit, that they dashed on unheedingly,
although at any other time the smallest stone would
have alarmed and driven them aside."
     There    is   a   current story regarding              the Medusae
which    is   too amusing to be passed over             :
                                                             " Professor
E. Forbes had,         a   few years ago, been delivering some
zoological lectures at            a   sea-port   town in Scotland, in
the course of which he adverted to some of the most
remarkable points in the economy of the Acalephas.
After the lecture,   farmer who had been present
                              a
came forward and inquired                if   he had understood him
correctly as having stated that the Medusae contained
so little of solid material, that they might be regarded
as little better than          a      mass of animated sea- water?
On being assured in the affirmative, he remarked,
that  would have saved him many pound had he
       it                                           a
known that sooner          ;   for he had been in the habit of
employing       his men and horses carting . away large
quantities of jelly-fish from the shore, and using them
as manure on his farm, and he now believed that
they could have been of little more real use than an
equal weight of sea-water.                  Assuming that so much
as one   ton weight of Medusae recently thrown on the

found that the entire quantity of solid material would
only be about four pounds avoirdupois weight             an
amount of solid material which,        if compressed,   the
farmer might   with  ease    have   carried home in his

which   I  would strongly recommend to be adopted in
other tanks; for not only is the variety and beauty
of the whole thereby materially improved, but a sort
              I
of bank, if may so speak, is afforded to such of the
occupants as occasionally like to leave the water and
bask in the open air.        There are few animals that
exhibit a greater readiness to avail themselves of this
privilege than the Blenny          a curious little fish, that
soon contrives to make itself a genuine favourite with
his master.      The Blenny is indeed, both from viva-
city and intelligence, deserving of more consideration
than it would appear, judging from the scanty space
devoted to it in professedly zoological works, to have
hitherto received.
   The Blenny, or, as it is variously termed, Shanny,
or Tansy, occurs in great numbers in the rocky pools
on our shores.      It is the Sticklebat,    or Tittlebat, of
the fresh-water pond       the little fish that boys capture
in scores, by means of a worm and pin attached to a
bit of thread.     The Blenny varies from two to three
inches in length.      The back is ornamented with ex-
quisite markings, but the most characteristic feature
is the brilliant crimson dot both on and immediately
beneath either eye.
   It  is a very timid creature,      and although, as will
presently appear, able to overcome this nervousness
when tamed, great caution is required in its capture.
When desirous to procure a specimen, it is best to
choose    as  small a pool as you can for your hunt.

 56            THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
Drop your net in at one end, and as the Blenny pre-
cipitately retreats to the other, give him chase.
Having arrived at the extremity of his domain, he
will endeavour to hide among the overhanging                       weeds ;
but   if   you hold your net across the pool with one
hand, and with the other lift up a stone or beat the
bushes,     the little fellow will become alarmed, and,
darting out, of course unwittingly falls into the snare
prepared for him.
   Having gained your prize do not handle                          it,   but,
placingyour finger under the net, tilt      over the       it                   .
mouth of the bottle, and allow the wee Blenny to fall
as gently as possible into the water.                   You     need be
under no uneasiness,         after introducing him to the
Aquarium, about the nature of his diet. He       far                 is
from being epicurean in his tastes.    supply mine     I
with whatever   at hand
                    is    fowl, roast beef, mutton-
chops, and the like.
  The only caution       I   adopt in giving animal food to
the Blenny,    is   to remove     all traces of fat.           I    mince

                    SMOOTH   BLENNY, ETC.                 57
  upon a hair-pencil.     This attention to their comforts
  the Blennies will soon learn to appreciate, and will,
  after a while, display at meal-times the sagacity of
  larger animals.
     It  is extremely interesting and curious to watch
 the movements of these creatures.            There is one
 peculiarity which    I am  not aware other writers have
 observed, namely, the length of time during which they
 remain entirely out of water.    I have   seen some  of the
 specimens     in my Aquarium lie for several successive
 hours on the little ledge of rock quite motionless, as
 if  sound asleep.     All at once, of a sudden giving a
 peculiar twist of the tail, they spring into the lake,
 and roam through       its shallow depths as     if with   a
 fresher zest for their native element.        After a time
 they again come above water, there to rest as before.
 Even    if not on the alert for their arrival,     I easily
learn when it takes place, from a peculiar cracking
noise they emit, not inaptly represented by that occa-
sioned by snapping two finger nails together.
    It is possible, in the case of my Blennies, that their
partiality to land over water may be in a great mea-
sure due to selfish motives ; in other words, may arise
from my attention to their diet.       I  should in justice,
however, to higher motives add, that          I have, from
the day of admission, endeavoured        to gain their con-
fidence by other delights than those of the palate.
The most sagacious of these schemes appears to be
stroking their head and glossy sides with a camel-
hair    brush.    Whenever     I approach     the  tank,  if

58           THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
swimming, they immediately throw themselves           upon
the rocky bank, expecting a gentle touch; or wriggle
their bodies upon the ledge situated near the upper
portion of the bank, and there solicit the same favour.
The prudence of choosing the latter locality is some-
what    questionable;   for, the   little creatures being
generally half in and half out of the water, with
breast reclining on the smooth surface of the glass,
the slightest stroke of affection often causes them to
glide down upon the ever-expanded tentacles of a
Daisy-anemone,     and, in releasing      themselves   from
such unpleasant neighbours, they run no small risk of
being seized by the illuminated tenter-hooks of the
Great Crassicornis.     Such a misfortune actually befel
a new-comer on one occasion,          and literally caused
him to turn pale with terror.      It  was, indeed, curious
to see that, after releasing himself from the Actinia,
instead of being nearly black as usual, he was trans-
parent as a Shrimp.
    Although   I made sure the unlucky Blenny would
not long survive this fright,    I  determined to try the
effects  of change of air.      So, having placed him,
almost breathless, on the palm of my hand,          I  care-
fully smoothed his coat, and thereafter deposited him
                                                  I
in a tumbler of clean water. In a few hours had the
satisfaction to find his natural hue "return, and in no
long time the little fellow swam about as lively, as ever.
    I was once master of a Blenny whose insuperable
 shyness occasioned me a great deal of care.        He was
 so timid, or modest, that whenever      I -approached him

                  SMOOTH      BLENNY, ETC.                59
 with food lie withdrew in great alarm, generally seek-
 ing shelter under a frond of dulse.        Happening one
 day to observe the presence of a hole in the dulse, it
struck me that it might be no bad plan to drop a
morsel through      it.     The Blenny forthwith appre-
ciated my consideration, and devoured mouthful after
mouthful, as fast as it could be transmitted, until his
hunger was completely appeased.           Having once suc-
ceeded in inspiring a relish for a different diet to the
ordinary one of the Aquarium,         I was hopeful of ulti-
mately getting his mauvaise honte removed,            and of
seeing him comport himself at eating hours with the
gravity of his better bred companions.            My  expec-
tations were more        than fully realised; for, having
once disposed   of his superfluous modesty, the little
fellow became a perfect nuisance in the republican
community of which he was a member.                All of a
sudden he seemed inspired with the genius of mis-
chief; and though to me, as an onlooker, it was rather
amusing to watch his rough fun, its objects were far
from well pleased.        His ingenuity in annoying his
brother and sister Blennies was untiring.             Not a
moment appeared         to pass in which their harmless
gambols were not interrupted by smarter slaps than
were agreeable     to    such   docile play-fellows.   More
than once the little rascal attempted to crop off some
feathers  of my pretty Sabella          a malicious   design
always intercepted by the keen vision of the assailed.
My charming Daisy-anemones            were kept in   a state
of continual irritation by the continuous flappings of

 his tail across their cheeks.   Patient and long-suffering
 as they were, such insults proved more than they could
bear.     Very eagerly did they strive to be revenged on
their finny tormentor, but always without effect.
    When my Pholas (of whom more anon) was quietly
erecting his tubular bridge       an operation in which I
took great delight       the Blenny did all in his power
to interrupt the progress of the works.
    I became    at length convinced that such continued
misconduct      deserved   punishment;    so,   catching the
offender on a certain occasion      with my nippers, just
as the Giant-killer caught Little Jack,       I  held him in
unpleasant proximity to my Crassicornis.            The pec-
cant Blenny immediately exhibited an extreme degree
of alarm, which I, disposed to leniency, accepted as
symptoms of sincere penitence, and immediately set
him at liberty.
    I grieve, however, to have to add,   that after no long
interval he again relapsed into his evil courses.
    Thinking that perhaps a more liberal feeding would
tend to make him less riotous,      I placed him upon an
unlimited diet, but with no beneficial result.
    His hostility    appeared   to be especially directed
against the youngest of the Blenny family, whom              I
took under my especial care, and christened Little
Jock. It may sound somewhat doubtful, but              I posi-
tively assert, that this little Blenny learned in a very
short time to answer to his name. Upon calling to him,
he would instantly make his appearance, and struggle
to get his body on the ledge of the tank.            When   I

                     SMOOTH      BLENNY, ETC.                   61
  placed him on the palm of my hand, and titillated his
   little back with my soft pencil, he exhibited evident
   signs of pleasure.
       I mentioned     this most remarkable instance            of
  tameness and docility to many of my friends.            They all
  conceived that    I exaggerated      the fact, until they had
  ocular demonstration for themselves.             Yet after all
  it  can only take place among those         " little  romances
  in which      natural    history abounds        one   of those
  narrations which, while believing, we almost doubt,
  and yet while doubting must believe." *
      It will be found   in a future chapter that my Blennies
 became very destructive.          I determined I should       let
 them exercise this newly developed propensity upon
                                         I
 another of their companions ; so slid a Limpet off the
 rock to which it had affixed itself, and dropped the
 devoted mollusc on the bottom of the tank, shell down-
 wards, leaving the fleshy parts exposed.              There was
 immediately a rush to the spot,             and after sundry
bickerings with each other, one gave a grip at the
 "mantle" and made a slight rent in it another and
another did the same, the poor Patella always endea-
vouring to grasp at something to turn himself over.
Had he been able to accomplish this, not all the fish
in Christendom would have had the slightest chance
of getting a bite at him; perhaps they would not
be sorry for that,     if   I may judge from the Blennies,
for, although they pulled and tugged and shook their
victim, they did not make a hearty meal.                    As  I

 watched them at their operations,        I  could not resist
 a smile, as the anecdote which       Hugh Miller narrates
 in his " Schools and Schoolmasters
                                          "
                                              passed through
 my mind, wherein he tells his readers, that some wags
 of Cromarty having become possessed of an eagle,
 stripped it of its feathers, and presented it to an old
 woman as " a great goose, the gift of a gentleman."
 Poor Dribble Drone (the old woman's name) accepted
 the gift with great     delight, and when asked some
time after how she had relished the bird, she replied
 that it was " unco siveet ! but, oh, teuch ! teuch ! "
 And this   seemed to be the opinion of the fishes, for
although     they   exerted    themselves      laboriously   to
masticate their prize, they did not succeed in making
much impression upon it; it being, as              I  thought,
"unco sweet, but, oh, teuch        ! teuch !"
    The Goby (Gobius unipunctatus), or, as it is popu-
larly termed, One-spotted Goby, is a frequent occupant
of the same pool with the Blenny.           Its most    charac-
teristic distinction is the peculiar spot which appears
upon its dorsal fin.     When full grown it is much of
the same length with the Blenny.
    The   Goby    possesses   the remarkable         power   of
affixing itself to objects by means of a sucker, formed
from the junction of its ventral fins.             Unless the
young zoologist      keep   this peculiarity     in mind, he
will frequently     experience    the chagrin consequent
upon an unsuccessful hunt after any coveted object
for the Aquarium.      The tedious search that the Goby
frequently    demands     is   not   only   trying to one's

patience, but causes a great loss of time that might
otherwise be usefully employed.          For marine    studies,
it must      be remembered,     cannot be satisfactorily pro-
secuted, even      if the student had ample leisure, without
a due regard to the state of the sea.            It  is proper
therefore, as regards       the Goby, to give those simple
directions       that will generally lead to      its capture
without great loss of time.
   Suppose, after arriving at the shore, you have fixed
upon a pool likely to contain a specimen, and suppose
further you actually see one         and of course introduce
your net         your exultation   is suddenly    damped by
noticing him disappear in the sand, below a stone.
You immediately overturn the            stone,  and as soon
as  the disturbed water has settled,         peer cautiously
around.         But the Goby has vanished ; at least you
can see    no evidence of any motion in the water.         You
again survey the pool round, and round, again explore
the sand      ; but all to no purpose.   You   are not a little
amazed in conjecturing          where the little wretch can
have gone to.         Why, he has been before you all the
time   !    Do you see that mass of amber-coloured jelly
sticking      to the stone you dislodged?         That is the
Goby     ;  and, incredulous    as you seem, you have only
to introduce him to your bottle, where he will soon
throw away all disguise, and swim happily enough
in its narrow limits.
   Being the owner of such a prize, you will scarce
resist,    as you walk along, holding        up your bottle
frequently in the light in order to have a peep at him.

                             do not be surprised, for such
 an alteration     is of frequent     occurrence   with this
 interesting little creature, as my experience proves.
     I beg  most particularly to impress upon the young
 reader,  if he wishes to capture either the Goby or
 Blenny, or others of like kind, to stand at a reason-
 able distance from the pool, and to watch earnestly
 for a glance of their       forms   darting   about, before
 commencing operations.         Should he have the good
fortune to secure a specimen, let him not be content,
but continue his search, and he will most likely
capture others.       Many   a locality that to the inexpe-
rienced student seems barren, yields to the practised
zoologist an ample harvest.
    Of another     species of Goby, the Lepidogaster      U-
naculus, or Two-spotted Goby           a common occupant
of rock pools of the Frith of Forth           we may quote
the interesting account given by Dr Landsborough.
The reverend gentleman is describing a dredge haul,
and states   :
    "There was one thing which we all admired, though
at first, when    I  saw it in the boat,   I could not con-
ceive what    it was ; nor was  it until it had appeared in
all its phases that    I discovered what it was in reality.
On opening a Scallop,       I  observed   one of the valves
lined with what seemed Cellephora pumicosa, a zoo-
phyte, but it was gelatinous;       so that  I  concluded it
might be some kind of spawn.           On opening another

                     SMOOTH BLENNY, ETC.                      65
  Scallop,   I  found that the white dots or cells had
 become blackish blue.          On opening  a  third,  I  found
 that the generality of the dots, instead of adhering to
 the shell, were disengaged, and were swimming in a
 little water in the concave valve, like a number of
 sparkling     diamonds.       On applying    a magnifying-
 glass,  I found   that  I had got a shoal of little  fish, and
 that their sparkling       eyes were the diamonds       I saw;
 moreover, that round the edge of the patch many of
the dots were still adhering ; and that round the head
and eyes, which were prominent in the centre, the
body of the little fish was wrapped, pretty much in
the manner in which the cook sends up Whitings to
table, with their tail in their mouth,      very much,     I am
sure, against the     will of the Whitings, if they had any-
thing to say in the matter, but a most easy and elegant
position for those nascent gelatinous fish.         It was in
the disengaged       state,  however, that they chiefly ex-
cited our admiration.          By the aid of  a lens we saw
that the two eyes were the sparkling diamonds; that
the body, which consisted of transparent gelatine,
filled with grey granules, dwindled away towards the
tail  : so  that each little fairy fish of half-an-inch       in
length resembled a tiny pair of scissors.        Prosecuting
our investigations,      I  found them half grown, and at
last full grown; so that          I had the satisfaction of
ascertaining, that the little beauties we had so much
admired were the fry of Lepidogaster binaculatus
the little two-spotted Sucker-fish.       How wonderfully

vide for their own safety and that of their offspring      !
It  is not an old weather-beaten Scallop that it takes
possession of, but one that is fresh without and
smooth and pure within.         After it   has entered,  it
certainly has some way of glueing the valves together,
for it is not without difficulty that they can be torn
asunder; neither is it imprisoned, though the apart-
ment is thus shut against intruders       : for, closely as
the valves adhere,      there are some little    apertures
about the ears of the shell, through which it can make
its exit with its numerous family, or by which such
little creatures as they feed on may in their simplicity
enter."
    I shall conclude this chapter, by stating that the
pool containing     a  Blenny and Goby may very pro-
bably be at the same time occupied by two other
animals well deserving notice.       These are the Gun-
nel-fish, remarkable for its graceful motions, its
beautifully spotted and riband-like figure, but, un-
fortunately, not adapted for the Aquarium; and the
Five-beard Rockling.        The latter is of more robust
constitution    than the Gunnel-fish, and thrives admir-
ably in the tank, where its docility will soon render
it  a favourite.

No Aquarium, in my opinion, can ever be considered
complete, that does not possess one or more specimens
of the Pholas.        For myself,    I am so enthusiastic an
admirer of this animal, that        I regard the privilege of
watching his mysterious movements as amply repay-
ing all the trouble the most unmanageable             Aquarium
can ever cost.
   With   respect    to other marine animals, we may be
contented with watching the grace of their motions,
the adaptation of slender limbs to various kinds of
difficult  movements,       their elegance of form, or their
surprising docility.        But the Pholas has, in addition
to these qualities, the recommendation that arises
from something puzzling and undetermined.                  Much

ingenious speculation has been employed upon the
manner in which an animal so constituted manages
to perforate the rock which it inhabits.
    "Probably upon few subjects in natural history
does so much discrepancy of opinion still exist; and
when the abundance of subjects every coast presents
for our investigation is considered, it looks something
like an opprobrium to the science of Zoology, that the
question remains now just where it was forty or fifty
years ago."*
   The Pholas is not, however, according to my ex-
perience, abundant at the present day on the shores
of the Frith of Forth.       I have   seen many thousands
of holes in different parts of the coast filled with
empty shells, but the only places in which      I have had
the good fortune       to find living specimens     was at
Wardie, situated between Trinity and Granton,           and
also in a seam of sandstone         that runs towards the
sea,  at a little distance from the Salt-pans of Joppa.
The attention of a visitor in search of specimens
will be directed to a number of circular orifices in the
solid rock, many of which are to all appearance com-
pletely filled.     Should the act of placing      a finger
upon an orifice be followed by the emission of a little
water, and at the same time a sudden feeling              of
hollowness be communicated to the touch, it is pro-
bable that the home of a live Pholas has been dis-
 covered.    In   order to carry away the prize intact, a
 careful exercise of both chisel and hammer are re-

quired.   When come        upon, the animal,      naturally
connecting the fate of his house with that of its
occupant, will be found       to have     shrunk into the
smallest possible size.     The manner of his removal
to the Aquarium should depend upon the manner of
his extraction from the rock. If connected with any
portion of his stony domicile, a cozy crib may be
extemporised for him in some soft sea- weed; but          if
entirely detached, he had better be carried in a bottle.
It  may not be out of place here to remind the young
zoologist of never omitting to carry a specimen
bottle to the sea-side.    After introducing the Pholas
into the Aquarium it is advisable to place him as
near as convenient to the edge, in order to have a
better opportunity of watching his movements.
   The first Pholas which      I succeeded in capturing
was quite detached, and lived for a fortnight in the
tank, apparently in perfect health       being, as far as  I
could judge, perfectly contented.       At  the end of the
second week of its confinement       it came to a sudden
and deplorable end.       As   an illustration   of life in
the Aquarium,     I   may relate   how the catastrophe
occurred.
   One morning,     I noticed that a little Fiddler-crab
(Velvet Fiddler      Portunus puber) was missing from
the impatient group that at that hour were daily
waiting breakfast.     Afraid he might be indisposed,      I
searched   after the little fellow, but on discovering
him he retreated in great precipitation to the opposite
side of the tank, and there wriggling himself under

 the sand,     almost completely     disappeared.    Curious
 to ascertain what behaviour so unusual could signify,
 and not able to reconcile it to my first hypothesis of
 sickness,   I  lay down upon an adjoining         sofa, that
 commanded a full view of the Aquarium.               In  the
 course   of a very few minutes         I observed   a little
 elevation of the Crab's head, attended with        a succes-
sion of rapid inquisitive glances all round.           Appa-
rently satisfied with the result of these observa-
tions, he suddenly threw aside his arenaceous covering,
and deliberately advanced towards my gentle Pholas.
In a  moment he fell upon him with desperate violence.
I   looked on very eagerly; and assuredly, had              I
anticipated     the tragical nature of the encounter,       I
should     have    speedily  interfered.   But the Pholas
looked so formidable, being fully four times the size
of its assailant, that it was only when the sharp
nippers of the latter, had, in a space of time incredibly
short, eaten away a considerable part of the soft,
dainty cheeks, that     I  became thoroughly alive to the
character of the attack and its probable termination.
Grasping my Aquarium ferule, a slim stick of gutta
percha,   I struck the Crab so forcibly, that he made a
hasty retreat.       Great was my surprise and annoy-
ance, however, to find that the injuries inflicted on
the poor Pholas were so grave as to prove fatal.
    I may add,    that the rascally Crab, as    if conscious
how severely he deserved punishment, and uncertain
how long my vengeance might be imminent, entirely
withdrew from observation. Indeed, several week

elapsed before he emerged from Ms hiding-place and
presented himself at meal hours.
   It might be supposed that, after so unfortunate an
attempt at introducing     the " Happy Family" style
into my tank,  I should never   have repeated the expe-
riment.    But  I began soon     afterwards to imagine,
and ultimately to believe, that the late disaster was
not so much due to the depravity of Crab-nature in
general,  as to some    extraordinary moral perversion
exhibited by an individual.       I accordingly resolved
to introduce some fresh specimens of the Pholas ; and
after having done so,    I  had the satisfaction of ob-
serving that they and their suspicious        neighbours
lived upon good terms.      This pleasant state of mat-
ters continued for several days.         But, alas ! the
sanguine expectations     I  had begun to indulge in
were speedily destroyed; for, on accidentally looking
one day into the Aquarium,        I  saw a Crab quietly
scooping out my prettiest Pholas.        My displeasure
was instantly exhibited by a thrust of the nippers,
so forcible as to prove fatal to a Crab many times
larger, had not the little rascal succeeded in skilfully
evading the blow, and hastily withdrew for shelter to
a dense thicket of grass.    Being determined to punish
him,  I  poked and poked about in all directions to
discover his hiding-place, but  I was ultimately obliged
to abandon my search.         Only one effectual means
was then left me, to which      I  was obliged, much to
my annoyance, to have recourse.        As  soon as I  had
collected a sufficient number of dishes    and really the

  72         THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
 demand for basins, jugs, tumblers, saucers, and all
 sorts of ware, rendered the operation rather formi-
 dable    I began  to empty the Aquarium.       Having
 removed fish, molluscs, weeds, and the like,   I  com-
 pletely  withdrew all the water by the syphon (a
 simple tube of gutta percha), and at length came
 upon the object of my search, who did not submit
 to be caught without his best attempt at revenging
 himself, by nipping my fingers with his claws.
    I now resolved to try the effects of solitary con-
 finement, and  I made up a cell for him in a tumbler,
 at the bottom of which    I  placed a few spoonfuls of
 sand and some Ulva latissima.      I at the same time
 subjected him to a course of corporeal punishment,
and had persevered    in this for a few days, when, on
looking down to my tank, now filled as before with
its old occupants,  I  was astonished to see that one
Pholas had entirely disappeared (with the exception
of his beautiful articulated shell), and that another

was nearly empty.     It was clear the poor Pholades
had other enemies besides     the Fiddler.   In conse-

                 PHOLAS     MUSSEL      COCKLE.             73
quence,    I kept  a sharp look-out to discover who these
might    be.    In  a short time      I  was furnished with
ample evidence that the offenders were my shy, do-
cile friends, the Blennies! foremost of which in the
nefarious attack was the little rascal whose misde-
meanours had, as stated in last chapter, occasioned
such disturbance.       But, indeed, they all displayed a
remarkable voracity,       and evidently     looked upon a
Pholas     as a delicacy hitherto       unsurpassed in their
pretty full experience     of a variety of diet.      To that
I  must ascribe the great contention that prevailed
among them.        They strove for a mouthful with a
greed that reminded me of the vultures        in the Regent's
Park at feeding-time.        It   being now of no use, as
regarded the recovery of the victims, to suspend their
                I
proceedings, permitted the Blennies to eat and fight
as they pleased.      In the general excitement, more  I
than once noticed a Blenny dive its head into the
Pholas' shell, shake      it to and fro with wonderful
quickness, and ultimately roll head over heels.           An-
other would more playfully seize upon a Pholas, and
shake   it  as a dog does a rat.     One of these offenders
met with an unexpected retribution.              It  was  my
pretty Blenny,      "Little Jock."       I saw him busy at
night, when giving my last look at the Aquarium,
scraping the shell of one of the largest Pholades in
my possession       the remains of an unfortunate victim
in the late disturbances. Next morning            I remarked
the absence of his familiar face, and searched for him
in every corner.      In this   I  was unsuccessful,   until I

accidentally overturned the big Pholas' shell, and there
lay the little Blenny quite dead, after the fashion of
the hapless Genevra.            Whether his own weight,
when inside, had toppled over the shell, or whether
it resulted from      a chance    collision   against a larger
Blenny, or some other animal,          I cannot    tell.    Suffice
it that Little Jock     was defunct.
    "We  must now return to the consideration of those
points    regarding the Pholas        that impart        to it its
peculiar and mysterious character; namely, the mode
in which it perforates the rock which serves alike as
                " Its dwelling and its sepulchre."
    Mr   Sowerby, in his pleasant
                                         " Manual of British
 Conchology," devotes an entire chapter to this sub-
ject, from which       I take the liberty of making             the
following quotation, which will serve to bring the
matter vividly before the mind's eye of the uninitiated
 reader:
    " Professor Forbes thus ably        sums up the various
theories which have been promulgated                on this very
                                          '
interesting and difficult point       :     They may all be
classed under five conclusions:          1st, That the boring
mollusca perforate by means of the rotation                 of the
valves of their shells, which serve as augers; 2d,
That the holes are made by rasping, 'effected by
silicious particles studding the substance of certain
parts of the animals      ;  3d, That currents of water, set
in action by the motions of vibratile cilia,               are the
agents; 4th, That the animal secretes a chemical sol-

                 PHOLAS     MUSSEL     COCKLE.           75
  vent    an  acid    which   dissolves the substance  into
  which it bores; 5th, That the combined action of a
 secreted solvent and rasping by the valves effects the
 perforations.'
     "The most plausible reason"     (says Mr Sowerby) "in
 favour of the first of these theories, is that given by
 Mr Osier, who describes the young animal first fixing
 itself by its foot, raising itself almost perpendicularly,
 and pressing the prickly part of the shell against the
 stone in a half-rotary motion, and thus adapting its
 motions to its advancing age, the size of the opening,
and the progress of the work.           Mr Osier goes on to
       '
say,     The particles rubbed off, and which in a short
time completely clog the shell, are removed in a very
simple way.' When the projected syphon is distended
with water, the Pholas closes the orifices of the tubes,
and retracts them suddenly.          The water which they
contained is thus ejected forcibly from the opening in
the mantle; and the jet is prolonged by the gradual
closure    of the valves, to expel the water contained
within the shells.       The chamber occupied by the
animal is thus completely cleansed; but as many of
the particles washed out of it will be deposited before
they reach the mouth of the hole, the passage along
which the Pholas projects its syphon is found con-
stantly lined with soft mud.
    " In further
                   apparent support of this idea of the
holes being made by the mechanical action of the
valves, it has been noticed, that some of them are
marked by rough grooves, such as might be produced

 76            THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
in that manner.        On the other hand, however, it may
be observed,     that the ' rasping' points on the surface
of the valves      are never worn    down, which must be
the case    if they were constantly employed on hard
substances, as suggested; that in some of the species
the shells are externally quite smooth       ; and that the
holes, instead of being quite cylindrical, are fitted to
the shells in such a manner as, at least when adult, to
deprive them of the power of lateral action.
    " The second theory, namely, that which endeavours
to account for the wearing away of the rock by the
rubbing of flinty atoms in the foot of the animal, has
this important difficulty to encounter j namely, that
after the most anxious microscopic researches, no such
silicious  particles    have  been  found   in the Pholas,
although they do exist in some other families of boring
molluscs.
    "The third      theory may be good as far as it goes,
but it is inadequate in itself to account for the whole
result.    No doubt, currents of sea water between the
shell and the walls of its habitation      most materially
aid, not only in clearing away the particles          when
dislodged, but also to some extent in dislodging them.
    " As to the fourth, and perhaps       on the whole the
most popular notion, that of a chemical solvent secreted
by the animal, it would probably puzzle the acutest
chemist to find a solvent which would act equally on
wood, clay, sandstone, chalk, and wax.
     " The fifth  theory, or that of the combined action of
 rasping and solution, combines the difficulty of both.

    " Now it may       seem presumption on my part, after
so   many learned opinions have been cited, and the
question    left still undecided   in  the latest and most
careful treatises, to venture anything like a judgment
of my own.         '
                      Who shall decide when doctors dis-
        1
agree ?' but     I   must confess that it does not seem
difficult to imagine the Pholas making its way into
its stony bed, by the simple process of licking a hole.
Reaumur observed, that when he removed the living
animal from its place,         and put it in soft clay, it
quickly before his very eyes buried itself in that
substance.      Although the stones in which some of
the species burrow are certainly harder than the clay,
yet it must be remembered that the clays in cabinet
specimens      are much harder than when under water ;
and that this sucking and licking, and rubbing with
the foot, which is certainly of stouter material than
the rest of the animal, would be powerfully aided by
the action of the salt water. We see in the caves
below cliffs, how water can excavate hard rocks when
acting in circular currents, and we can easily imagine
how it would act in enlarging a cavity already begun.
In   fact, we see, in the case of deserted holes of boring
bivalves, instances of the enlarging power of small
 currents.     If    Reaumur's  specimens   could so easily
 perforate the soft clay during the progress of a mere
 experiment, how shall it be difficult       to understand
 perforation, by the same simple means, of a harder
 substance    during the gradual growth of the animal      ?
 While thinking on this matter, it occurred to me to

78            THE SEA-SIDE AND AQCTAKIUM.
try a very simple experiment, by procuring from the
kitchen a piece of hearthstone        which the servant,
by the way, observed was a very hard piece.          With
some salt water to assist me,       I rubbed the surface
with my finger, of course keeping to the same spot,
and in a very few minutes' time,      I  had made a very
sensible impression in the stone.      I had not patience
to carry the experiment any further ; but as far as it
went, it left no doubt on my mind that with the foot
alone, without silicious particles, without a chemical
solvent, and without using the rasping powers of the
shell, our little animal could easily execute his self-
pronounced sentence of solitary confinement for life."
   With   due    deference  to such an authority,   I feel
confident in my own mind that           Mr  Sowerby, and
other writers who have also advocated this theory,
are totally mistaken, and that Mr Osier's theory is
nearer the truth, though it is not altogether correct.
I  have had excellent opportunities        of watching   a
Pholas at work under singularly favourable circum-
stances, and    I  am enabled therefore to speak pretty
positively upon the question.
   In the general massacre of my Pholades by Blennies
and Crabs,   I  was left with only a solitary specimen,
seated, however, in a loose piece of rock ; the syphon
and upper portion of the shell being distinctly visible.
   To ascertain whether the Pholas moved in the
cavity, I used    to place a pencil cross on the wooden
base of the Aquarium,         and a corresponding mark
upon the white marbled baize beneath.           To guard

                PHOLAS    MUSSEL    COCKLE.              79
against    a possibility  of either being      accidentally
shifted,   I  at the same time sketched on the latter
the true position of the Pholas in the hole.        By this
check,   I could tell at a glance  if  there had been the
slightest deviation.
   For two whole months, not        a day passed that      I
did not look several times at the Pholas; and         I can
positively declare, that during that entire period the
creature    never moved, nor even oscillated its body,
more than the eighth part of an inch, either right or
left.   At    the end of eight weeks,       however, upon
peering into the tank,      I  saw   that   a  change   had
occurred.      The crosses exactly corresponded, but the
position     of the animal had varied     !  nay more, the
valves, which in general were clean, now exhibited a
furry or dusty appearance, shewing that they had
been at work for several hours. Even while I stood, to
my great delight, the boring operation was resumed.
    Now, to see a Pholas loose in the tank, or quietly
 seated in the rock, extending and retracting his
 syphons, would fail to give one the slightest idea of
 his extraordinary appearance when enlarging his
 dwelling.     He is quite a different animal, appearing
 to have suddenly acquired a most marvellous degree
 of energy and perseverance, forming so striking a
 contrast to his usual quiet, passive habits.
    In the first place, he retracts his tube to, and even
 under the level of his shell     just as a man about to
 urge onward some heavy mass with his shoulders,
 would depress his head to increase and concentrate

  80          THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUAEIUM.
 Ms muscular power.         Then follows an expansion of
 the neck, or upper part of the ventral border, from
 whence the syphons protrude.         This movement closes
 the posterior portion of the valves below the hinge,
 and brings their serrated points together.       The next
 act on the part of the animal, is to place his foot
 firmly at the base of the hole.         When leaning for-
 ward,   he makes     a sweeping movement        fully half
 round   the cavity,    and pressing      firmly upon the
 umboes, which nature has strengthened for the pur-
pose by two curved teeth, fixed on the inside of the
valves.    At this stage, he again reclines on his breast,
and tilting up the shell as much as possible, he
makes another motion round to his former position,
leaning upon his back.          By these intricate move-
ments, which the Pholas appears to accomplish by
a contraction    almost painfully strong, it opens the
rasping points of the valves.        These execute a very
peculiar scooping movement at the base of the cavity;
and the animal having got so far, refreshes         himself
for further exertion by     a short rest.
    The   foregoing   observations    were a great point
gained in my investigation       of the terebrating habits
of this creature.    It  had begun to bore, there could
be no doubt of that.         The next question was, How
long it would continue to do so, and would it bore
through the rock    ?   These questions were in no long
time satisfactorily elucidated.
    Just three   days   after the Pholas had begun its
operations,   I saw that the water in the tank had.

                 PHOLAS      MUSSEL        COCKLE.             81
  from    some   unaccountable        cause,   become   opaque.
  Failing in my endeavour to clarify it by means of the
  syringe,  I grew  apprehensive that it might do injury
  to the creature in whose labours        I  was so greatly inte-
  rested, and so lifted out the piece of rock in which he
  resided.    In  doing so,   I   raised it so as to command
 a view     of the under     side.     Great was my surprise
 then, upon finding the hole bored through !              I now
 placed the stone in a tumbler of water, at an angle
                   I
 of 45, so that could take in any change, not only
 in the base, but also in the upper portion of the
 animal, at the same glance.
     During more hours than           I  care to mention, such
 was my eagerness, did       I  sit with the glass poised on
 the thumb and fingers of my left hand, my elbow
 resting on the arm of the chair, and a small lens in
my right hand.         Never was        I   so heedless  of the
fatigue that one position long maintained invariably
induces, or so indifferent         to the bad effect of too
powerful a strain upon the eyes.
    My Pholas continued to bore the whole period.
The next day it was quiet, evidently reposing from
its labours, and so it remained for a week.             During
the next six weeks it became restless, boring slightly
every day, although       at certain times its foot would
suddenly slip through the aperture, to its annoyance
and discomfort,    I  believe.
    For  several  months past, it has been in the same
position that it is at the present moment (March
1858) with the lower portion of its shell, and its
                                F

82              THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUAEIUM.
delicate, fleshy foot, entirely protruding through the
rock, as  I have represented in the Frontispiece.
  During the period in which the Pholas was actually
engaged in boring, it continually threw out from its
smallest (anal) syphon fine threads of apparently pul-
verised rock.      These produced a very strange             effect.
Had my favourite         been totally imbedded,         I   should
naturally have supposed, as Mr Osier does, that in
order to free itself from the soft particles that occlude
its orifice, it would contract its syphon, then sud-
denly extend      it,   at same    blowing away the
                                     time
debris, and thus clearing the cavity.  But such could
not possibly be the case in this specimen, for the
rock was shaped so that, as have before stated, the
                                  I
whole of the syphons, and part of the valves, were
always    exposed,      and   never at any time             entirely
covered, even with the softened particles produced by
the boring operation.
     This phenomenon, therefore,            evidently   admits of
no other explanation, than that there must be some
pedal opening through which the creature draws in
whatever collects at the base of the cavity, and expels
it   as above   mentioned, and this without any filtra-
tion whatever.
I     candidly confess that     I    have never been able to
                        but upon no other supposi-
discover any pedal orifice    ;
tion can  I apprehend how        that these threads
                                     it   is
lie about by hundreds in all directions, the animal
ejecting them at least once in every quarter of an
hour during the time       it   is   at work;    yet, when in     a

passive     state, or when its foot is through the aper-
ture, no such threads are ever to be seen.
    I am    better able to state, from my own observa-
tion, that there can be no doubt it is with the shell,
and not with any acid or flinty particles, that the
creature bores the rock.
    Professor Forbes held that          if  this were the case,
the rasping points on the surface of the valves would
soon be worn clown            an appearance      which, he says,
never is seen.       With due respect to such a name, am     I
convinced he was in error.            Not only    are the edges
worn, but the rough surface is worn nearly smooth,
appearing in certain parts of a shelly white colour,
instead of a light drab, as my specimen proves.
     But the reader may ask,          If   certain parts of the
valves are worn nearly smooth, and the animal worked
so vigorously, how is       it they were not rasped through       ?
This is      a  very natural question, and one that          I put
to myself repeatedly.
     I  have     made   frequent    and careful observations
with a powerful lens, while the animal was actually
 at work, in order to satisfy myself upon this point,
 and have always perceived that the particles of soft-
 ened rock fell from and on each side of the ligament
 that binds the hinge, and extends to the- lowest
 points of the valves.*          Moreover, that this leathery
    * The reader must keep in mind, that since     I  was watching
 the movements of my Pholas from beneath, my eye was as it
 were at the base of the cavity   for the hole was bored through,
 and allowed the foot, and a portion of the shell of the animal, to
 be  distinctly seen.

  84          THE SEA -SIDE AND AQUAKIUM.
 substance always seemed scraped on the surface.             I
 cannot, therefore, but believe that the ligament        aids
 very materially   in rubbing off the rock, or, at all
 events, in graduating the pressure of the valves dur-
 ing the same process, and that this curious formation,
 instead of being worn away, may, like the callosity
 upon a workman's hand, increase in toughness the
 more labour it is called upon to perform.            Still  I
 feel  pretty confident, that     although     the ligament
 may greatly assist, the shell, as     I  have said before,
 forms the principal agent       in boring     the animal's
 dwelling.
     The conclusion  I    arrive at from these facts, may
 be thus summed up      :   That as the Pholas only bores
 the rock in sufficient degree to admit of its increased
bulk of body, it only requires to bore occasionally;
that there may be often an interval of many months,
during which time nature will have renewed the
serrated edges and rough surface of the valves, and
thus    enabled  the creature to renew its wondrous
operations.
    The probability of the correctness       of this idea is
further confirmed by the fact, that the Pholades are
generally found not very far beneath the surface of
the rock in which they live.        My   specimen, too, did
not attempt to bore for a period of two months.
How long it had been passive hitherto, is known only
to Him who watches lovingly alike over this poor
bivalve, as over the most exalted of His creatures.
    There is a most singular circumstance, which            I

Pholades.            This is their phosphorescence.                     " This
property has long been known.                        It   is even mentioned
by Pliny.            The creature              is said to secrete a certain
luminiferous fluid, which causes everything on which
it falls to shine with a pale phosphorescence. M. De
Blainville says, that the Pholades are the most lumi-
nous of all molluscous animals; and he even relates,
that those           who      eat     the animal          raw, in the dark
appear, in a most awe-inspiring fashion, to be breath-

powerful      the fresher the animal                      is,   disappearing   if
dried, and reviving,             it       is   said, by the addition of        a
little salt water. The cheering beams of the solar
ray cannot light this patient miner to its work, nor
penetrate to the confines of its cell                ;    but the Creator has

of man in some respects" (boring into the foundations
of wooden piers, &c.) " we may, in conclusion, advert

to a different and more agreeable relation in which
they stand towards him.          At the tables of some
epicures,  these   creatures are considered as a great
delicacy.    The Romans, who, as Dr Adam tells us,
were particularly fond of shell- fish, bringing them all
the way from Britain to the luxurious city, appear
to have set an edible value upon the Pholades.          M,
Desmarest, to the great annoyance of the geologists,
has attempted to prove that the celebrated perforations
in the temple of Serapis by the Pholades, took place,
not in consequence of the subsidence of the land, but
of the conversion of the temple and its vicinity into
a fish-pond ! And M. De Blainville aggravates them
still more, by putting the question ' whether the
Pholades were not put there purposely for the supply
                 '
of the table   ?   At  the present day they are largely
used as an article of food in France and Italy, and on
the coasts of the Mediterranean, where they abound.
 In  the neighbourhood of Dieppe, Mr Stark tells us
 that bands of women and children, each armed with
 a pickaxe, make a formidable       array against the un-
 happy Pholades, who tremble in their rock-citadels
 as these besiegers approach.      By  means of the sharp
 point of this implement they are able to detach con-
 siderable fragments of the rock, and a rich harvest of
 the molluscs ensues.    They are then sent to market, or,
 deprived of their shells, are used as bait for other fish.

creation can teach lessons of wisdom to man, few, we
think, will be disposed to deny, that a fragment of
perforated rock is more forcibly eloquent upon the
subject of perseverance under difficulties, than the
most nervous appeals to the mind from the pen or
lips of any human philosopher."
   The    Common       Mussel     (Mytilus edulis) should
always have a place in the Aquarium.                   It is a very
hardy creature, and although familiar to every one, is
by no means an uninteresting object of contemplation.
It  especially commands our admiration, whenever, by
means of its byssus (formed by a number of silk-like
threads), it anchors itself to the sides of the tank,
becoming so fixed that it would take pretty consider-
able force to dislodge it.

 of the foot, at the bottom          of which thin, horny
 filaments are formed by an exudation of a peculiar
 substance,   that soon hardens and assumes the requi-
 site   tenacity and firmness.        While still soft, the
 Mussel by means of its foot applies the extremity
 of the filament, which is dilated into a kind of little
sucker, to the foreign substance whereunto it wishes
to adhere, and fastens it securely;          Having accom-
plished this, the foot is retracted, and the thread, of
course, being drawn out of the furrow where           it was
secreted, is added to the bundle of byssus previously
existing, all of which owed its origin to a similar
process."
            *
     There is another bivalve to be found on our coasts,
named Pinna.         It has something of the appearance of
a monster Mussel.
     This animal also spins a byssus, the threads of
which are so numerous, soft, and delicate, that they
are not unfrequently spun like silk, and manufactured
into various small articles of wearing apparel.
     Mr Gosse, speaking of the Pinna, says that, " in the
British Museum, together with some fine specimens
of the shells of this mollusc, there is a pair of gloves
made of its byssus ; but articles made of this material
are very costly, and cannot be considered in any other
light than that of curiosities.       Pope Benedict XV., in
1754, had a pair of stockings presented to him, which
were woven from the silk of the Pinna.           These were
the subject of general admiration, from the extreme

delicacy of their texture, well shewn by the minute-
ness of the box in which they were enclosed."
   When collecting Mussels, you need not be at the
trouble either to put them in your bottle, or make
for them a sea-grass mattress whereon they may rest,
until you return home.        They can make themselves
equally comfortable lying loose in the basket, or
confined in the pocket of your coat.
   Being lately at the rocks, with no apparatus for
preserving delicate marine specimens,    I brought  away,
for hatching purposes, a cluster of the eggs of Buc-
cinum undatum         those wThite bladdery masses that
are so commonly seen attached to the under sides of
rocks, &c.     and also a companion cluster of the eggs
of the Purpura, which are also extremely common.
These look like a series of white miniature vases, or
urns, of elegant form, fixed by their base to the lower
surface of large boulders, or even loose stones.    These
objects I  put in my coat pocket, along with a small
Mussel, to which was attached a large frond of the
Saw-leaved Fucus (Fucus serratus).
   The egg clusters    I duly placed in a small tank, and
amused myself by cutting off portions and examining
them under the microscope.        Being absorbed in this
procedure,   I   forgot to release the Mussel from his
prison in the pocket of my paletot.      Four days after
I discovered my omission, and naturally expected that
the poor bivalve would be defunct.          Such was not
the case.      His shell was tightly    closed, but soon
opened again when placed in sea water.

90           THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
    Many readers are probably unacquainted with the
great consumption of the Mussel as bait. The follow-
ing extract may be        interesting:    "In   Newhaven
alone there are four large deep-sea fishing-boats, which
generally go out three times a week, and fish for
about thirty weeks in the year, excluding Sundays
and bad weather.      Each of these large boats carries
eight men, with eight lines of 800 yards in length,
which, at a low calculation, take 1200 mussels to bait
each time that they are so used;        so that each large
boat will use 28,800 mussels         per week, equal to
864,000 per annum.         But there are about sixteen
other smaller boats, which go out daily, or rather at
twelve o'clock every night, for about the same number
of weeks in the year.       Each carries four men, with
four lines 800 yards long ; their consumption of mus-
sels will come to 3,456,000.       The total consumption
for bait annually, in Newhaven alone, may be reckoned
at 4,320,000.     As there   are nearly as many used at
Musselburgh and Fisherrow, Buckhaven, Elie, An-
struther, Pittenweem, Crail, and other places on the
Frith of Forth, we may calculate that thirty or forty
millions of mussels are used for bait alone by the fisher-
men of this district each year.      As an article of food,
there cannot be used fewer than ten bushels per week
 in Edinburgh and Leith, say forty weeks in the year ;
 in all 400 bushels annually.      Each bushel of mussels,
 when shelled and freed from all refuse, will probably
 contain from three to four pints of the animals, or
 about 900 or 1000, according to size.         Taking the

                 PHOLAS    MUSSEL     COCKLE.             91
latter number, there will be consumed in Edinburgh
                                          *
and Leith about 400,000 mussels."
   These interesting statistics will be new,      I am sure,
to many of my readers.
   As regards the consumption of the Mytilw edulis
in Edinburgh and Leith,       I believe the number     above
stated is far over the mark.       In fact, since the magis-
trates of Leith, some years ago, prohibited the use of
the Mussel as food, in consequence of several persons
becoming     ill  from eating some which were collected
at the docks, there has been a decided prejudice
entertained against them.
   I may mention,     in confirmation of this statement,
that at Joppa and Wardie, myriads of Mussels are to
be seen, in many places so thickly clustered together
that a knife-blade     cannot be passed between them;
yet there is hardly ever a person seen gathering any
for use.    Such being the case, it does not seem pro-
bable that the poor (who, of course, are the only class
that are likely to eat this fish) would buy that article
of food, which, if they thought proper, they could
gather at no cost.
   There is another bivalve which         I would strongly
recommend to my readers as deserving attention, viz.,
the Common Cockle (Cardium edule).            I  need hardly
say that   it is to be found in equal numbers on our
shores   as the Mytilus edulis.         The distinguishing
feature of this animal is its surprising agility; and,
however improbable this character may seem upon

inspection, it is not the less correct.     Some writers,
however, resting upon hearsay evidence,       greatly ex-
aggerate this quality, and state that    "the Cockle  has
been known to leap over the gunwale of a boat," by
means of a singular-looking fleshy foot which     it pro-
trudes from its shell.
   This assertion appears, to my mind, like the story
of the Lobster that " has been known to spring to a
distance of thirty feet"      a feat that comes up in
every new book wherein Crustacea are mentioned, as
                    "
regularly as the marvellous hairy-gooseberry" anec-
dote,  that meets our eye once a-year in the news-
papers.
   If  Sir John Falstaff,   of veracious memory, had
heard these stories, he might well have ejaculated
with a gulp, " Lord, Lord ! how this world is given
             "
to lying   !     We may not uncharitably believe that
the sailor man had had a " drappie in his e'e," to
assist  his natural   power of vision, when he saw the
Lobster perform       his unparalleled   " spring;"   and
hence   we     must excuse his (the sailor's) jump to a
wrong conclusion.       Or, supposing that he was not
" half-seas over," he might have entered three feet, and
some wag getting hold of the log-book, slyly added a
cypher to the right side of the numeral, and made it
wrong.
   There can be no doubt, however, that the Cardium
does leap, although in a very small way ; for although
the jolly tar might tell a " fib," Mr Gosse's veracity
may surely be relied upon.       I  will therefore enrich

  which that gentleman gives relative to this mat-
  ter:
     " Many   persons are aware that the Common Cockle
 can perform       gymnastic feats of no mean celebrity;
 but the evolutions of Signer Tuberculato are worth
 seeing.    Some of the troupe       I  had put into a pan of
 sea water, others     I  had turned out into a dish dry, as
 knowing that an occasional exposure to the air is a
 contingency that they are not unused to.          By and by,
 as we were quietly reading, our attention was attracted
 to the table where the dish was placed, by a rattling
 uproar, as  if flint stones were rolling one over the other
                                                     '

 exclamation;      and they were indeed displaying their
 agility, and their beauty, too, in a fine style.          The
 valves of the largest were gaping to the extent of
three quarters of an inch       ; but the intermediate space
was filled up by the spongy -looking fleshy mantle, of
a semi-pellucid      orange    hue.    At one end protruded
the syphons, two thick short tubes, soldered,             as it
were, into one, and enveloped on all sides in a shaggy
fringe of cirri, or tentacles.       The circular orifices of
these   tubes      small   holes perfectly    round,   with a
white    border       had   a   curious   appearance,   as  we
looked at the heart-shaped end of the valves; the
discharging orifice, however, was but rarely visible,
being usually closed, while the other remained con-
stantly open.       But these things were what we after-
wards saw; for some time we could look at nothing

but the magnificent foot, and the curious manner in
which it was used.
   " The two lips of the mantle suddenly
                                             separate, and
gaping widely all along the front, recede nearly to
the valves ; while, at the same moment, a huge organ
is thrust out, somewhat like a tongue, nearly cylin-
drical, but a little flattened, and tapering to a point.
Its  surface   is smooth and brilliantly glossy, and its
colour   a fine   scarlet approaching to orange,     but a
better idea of it than can be conveyed by any descrip-
tion, will be obtained, by supposing it to be made of
polished carnelian.
   " This beautiful and versatile foot is suddenly thrust
out sideways, to the distance of four inches from the
shell.   Then its point being curved backwards, the
animal pushes it strongly against any opposing object,
by the resistance      of which, the whole animal, shell
and all, makes a considerable step forward.          If the
 Cockle were on its native sands, the leaps thus made
would, doubtless, be more precise       in their direction,
and much more effective ; but, cooped up with its
fellows in a deep dish, all their herculean efforts
availed only to knock the massive shells against the
sides, or roll them irregularly over each other."

little surprised to find that, instead of having the
usual hard, horny envelopes, their backs are soft and
flabby, by no means pleasant to look upon.                 It will
then become evident that the above remains (exuviae)
had lately belonged, not to dead, but quick Crustacea.

 96            THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUAKIUM.
    The fact of Crabs and such, like animals casting
 their skins, is one of the most remarkable, but at
 same time least understood wonders in the whole
 range    of natural   history.    And     as not   one   in a
hundred writers has ever seen the marvellous opera-
tion,   I am  sure my readers      will  be pleased   to read
the following quotation        from a celebrated        author,
who has devoted        much     time    and labour     to this
subject, and who, moreover, has            been   enabled to
write from personal observation.          Professor Jones, in
his  <r
        Outlines of the Animal Kingdom," says         :
    " From     the   extreme hardness        and   unyielding
character of the tegumentary skeleton in Crustaceans,
a person     unacquainted    with the history of these
animals, would be at a loss to conceive          the manner
in which their growth could be effected.            In insects
all increase of size prior to the attainment of the
perfect condition, and expansion, is provided for by
the moult or changes of skin, which take place during
the development       of the larva    ;  but the Crustacea,
having acquired its mature form, still continues to
grow, and that until it acquires in many instances
a size far larger than that which any insect is per-
mitted to arrive at.
    " The plan adopted in the       case before  us whereby
the growth is permitted, is attended with many extra-
ordinary phenomena.        At certain intervals the entire
shell is cast off, leaving the body for the time un-
fettered, indeed, as regards the capability of expansion,
but comparatively helpless and impotent, until such

ing assumes the form and efficiency of its predecessor.
     " We    are indebted to Reaumur, who watched the
process in the Cray-fish (Astacus flaviatilis), for what
little is known concerning the mode in which the
change      of shell is effected.            In   the animal      above
mentioned, towards the commencement                       of autumn,
the approaching moult is indicated by the retirement
of the Cray-fish into some secluded position, where it
remains some time without eating.      While in this
condition, the old shell becomes gradually detached
from the surface of the body, and a new soft cuticle
is formed underneath              it,   accurately representing, of
course, all the parts           of the covering which        is   to be
removed;        but    as    yet little calcareous    matter   is   de-
posited in the newly-formed integument.                The creature
now             violently agitated, and, by various
          becomes
contortions of its body, seems to be employed in
loosening thoroughly every part of its worn-out
covering from all connexion with the recently secreted
investment     this being accomplished,

extricate itself from its imprisonment                 an operation
of some difficulty           and when the nature of the armour
to be removed          is    considered,    we may well conceive
that no little exertion            will    be required    before    its
completion.         As      soon as the old case of the cephalo
thorax has become quite detached from the cutis, by
the interposition        of the new-formed epidermic layer,
it   is   thrown      off in one piece, after great violent
exertion    ;   the legs are then       withdrawn from their cases.

after much struggling, and, to complete the process, the
tail is ultimately,  l>y
                      long-continued efforts, extricated
from its calcareous covering,         and the entire coat                of
mail, which previously defended the body,               is   discarded
and left on the sand.
     "The phenomena which attend this renovation of
the external skeleton are so unimaginable, that                     it   is
really extraordinary       how little      is   accurately known
concerning the nature of the operation.                         The first
question which presents itself          is,    How    are the limbs
liberated from their confinement           1   for, wonderful as         it
may appear, the joints even of the massive chelae of
the Lobster do not separate from each other but, not-       ;
withstanding the great size      of   some      of   the segments        of
the claw,   and the slender dimensions           of   the   joints that
connect the different pieces, the cast-off skeleton                of   the
limb presents exactly the same appearance as                     if   still
encased   in  living member.

   " The only way of explaining the circumstance                         is
to suppose that the individual pieces of the skeleton,
as well as the soft articulations connecting them, split
in   longitudinal direction, and that, after the abstrac-
     a
tion of the limb, the fissured parts close again with so
much accuracy, that even the traces of the division
are imperceptible.         But this   is   not the only part of
the process which    calculated to excite our astonish-
                     is
ment.   The internal calcareous septa, from which the
muscles derive their origin, and the tendons whereby
they are inserted in the moveable portions of the outer
shell, are likewise stated to be found attached to the

in the stomach, is cast off and reformed; and yet,
                              1
how is all this accomplished ? how do such parts
become detached?          how are they renewed?    We appre-
hend that more puzzling            questions than these can
scarcely be propounded to the physiologist ; nor could
more interesting subjects of inquiry be pointed out to
those whose opportunities enable them to prosecute
researches connected with their elucidation."
  Another curious fact in connexion with these ani-
mals must not be omitted.  This relates to the power
they possess of rejecting an injured limb. Upon the
occurrence of such an accident, a new limb is gradu-
ally developed,         and remains folded up in the old
shell, ready to start forth sound and whole at the
next moulting-time         !
   To quote the words of Mr Spence Bates* "When
a limb is injured, all Crustacea have the power of re-
jecting      except the wound be below the last joint.

against some foreign body.           The amputation     is   the
work of        a    few seconds, except when they have but
recently cast the exuviae, when, during the first few
days (before the new skeleton   hardened), they have

sometimes remain for perhaps half an hour or longer
before   it is    rejected.
  " The   new limb is formed within the old shell, and
lies folded up until the exuviae are shed, when it ap-
pears as a part of the new skeleton, the sac-like mem-
brane which protected it being cast with the annual
moult, and is larger or smaller in accordance with the
length of time which may exist between the period
of the amputation of the limb and the shedding of
the skin.         The condition    in which the limb is then
remains,     as        of the animal, stationary in
                   the rest
growth, until the next period of shedding the exuviae,
when the whole creature again advances in size, but
the new limb more rapidly than the remainder of the
animal, until it equals it in relative proportion.
  "It      is,   therefore,   dependent upon the length        of
time which occurs between the accident and the next
succeeding moult, to allow the new limb             to'   develop
itself, that the variety of size depends,           which    has
given rise to the prevailing          idea of the limb itself
continuing to enlarge constantly."
  Verily, to contemplate such mysteries as these,
       " Imagination wastes its strength in vain,
             And fancy tires and turns within itself,
             Struck with the amazing depths of Deity."
When remarking, at the commencement      of this chap-
ter, that the skinned Crabs were
                                 " unpleasant to look

the reader has previously made, possess the power of

the tips of their toes.   Their hindmost legs appear as

are obliged to mix with common Oysters, houseless

   There is yet another class of Crabs which we must
not forget to mention, for they play a most impor-
tant part in the economy of the tank.                 A   member
of this family, who may be called a crustaceous

    " Why our so-called Hermits               are gifted with this
singular instinct,     is not easy to conjecture.                   Many
other creatures make use of houses they had no hand
in erecting, as the bees, the cuckoo, and sometimes
the bear, &c.; but       I  do not recollect any that, as it
were, clothe themselves with the cast-off garments of
other animals.       Providence, besides               the defence      of
their   otherwise    unprotected           bodies,      has    no doubt
some object of importance                in view in giving them
this instinct.     Perhaps they may accelerate the de-
composition      of the shells they inhabit, and cause
them sooner to give way to the action of the atmo-
sphere   ; and as all exuviae may be termed nuisances
and deformities, giving to these deserted                       mansions
an appearance       of renewed life and locomotion,                    re-

moves          them in        some    sort from the catalogue                 of
blemishes.           By this physical hypocrisy of assuming
the aspect of a different animal, which is known as
not having powerful means of destruction, these crea-
tures may deceive the unwary, and make them their
prey, which,           if   they wore the livery of their own
                                                                          *
tribe, would be on their guard and escape them."
   "It is a question of some interest, whether the
Hermit-crab always chooses for its habitation a shell
already         empty,       or whether     it actually         kills     and
devours the inhabitant                of one that suits its size,
and then takes possession of its violated home.                          The
latter     I    believe to be true, in many,             if   not in most
cases; not certainly, however, in all, as we often find
the Hermit           occupying       an   old and long-abandoned
shell.         But   so     much more generally is it found in
fresh shells, that it can scarcely be doubted, even on
this ground alone, that it often obtains its habitation
by violence. The fishermen on the coast are fully
persuaded of this; and an intelligent person of this
class at Bognor, assured              me that the aggressor seizes
its victim           the Whelk,        for instance           immediately
behind the head, and thus kills or disables                        it,   then
eats     it,   and finally creeps into and appropriates its
vacant shell."       t
  This statement may be correct, but, so far as                          I
know,     it    never has been confirmed by the experience
of any other author.                 Whether   it   is   that my own

 specimens    have   been    more than usually meek and
 quiet,  I cannot say;    but certainly they never shewed
 any signs of being at all likely to commit such a
 serious offence as that above laid to their charge.           It
 may be, perhaps, because        I  always fed them well,
 and therefore left them no inducement to exhibit any
 cannibal propensities towards their companions.
    It  is not incurious     to speculate   upon the age at
which the juvenile Hermit-crab becomes aware that
he must shift for himself, and hunt about for a shield
to protect him from danger.            Do his parents give
him his first lessons     1 or is it instinct   ?    Supposing
that no shells were to be found, what would be the
result  ?  would nature come to his aid           ?  and what,
again, is the largest size to which such creatures grow I
   While the Hermit is in good health, he keeps a
firm grip of his mansion with his hooky tail ; but no
sooner    does he feel squeamish and poorly, than he
loosens his hold and crawls outside the entrance door,
there to die.      This is invariably the      case,   and one
can hardly conceive       a more   pitiable   object than he
presents    when    in  this melancholy       condition        so
tame,    so crest-fallen,   so totally the reverse        of the
usual sharp, snappish, impudent          style in which he
conducts himself when at home and in good health.
   Be careful to nip him out of the tank as speedily
as possible after he has given up the               shell, as his
company, at no times over pleasing to his companions,
soon becomes a perfect nuisance.          His  carcase breeds
miasma and death to all around.

106           THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
   During life, he is only comfortable when creeping
over a flat surface, yet his restless disposition causes
him to be ever roving about, making vain endeavours
to mount inaccessible crags, or climb to the tops of
slender trees, or rocks, or bushy tufts of Chondus-
chrispus, or any other weed       that will sustain his
weight.      Bumps and falls he does not seem to heed.
I have   seen one hauling, slipping, and tugging to get
to the top of some fronds   ; and no sooner had he suc-
ceeded, than, losing his equilibrium, he toppled down,
and rolled      over and  over without    sustaining     the
slightest injury, or feeling at all alarmed.        Indeed,
no sooner was his tub steady, than he popped his
arms over the smooth edge, and looked up so quaintly,
as much as to say, What do you think of that      1   wasn't
it clever  ?
   I  watched an individual     of this class, that for
several days, from what reason     I cannot tell-, had set
his mind upon reaching a cluster of Mussels, that
were attached and branching out, self-supporting, from
the centre piece of rockwork in my Aquarium.            The
Crab inhabited an old worn-out Trochus shell that
had only the last whorl left entire.      Altogether his
appearance     was vulgar and slovenly in the extreme.
He had     several times tried to climb up the face       of
the rock, but his shell, like the chain attached to a
convict's leg, proved an insuperable      barrier to his
success.     He did, however, eventually      succeed     in
reaching the desired haven, after the following curious
way.

     There was a large Periwinkle in the tank, who;
having taken it into his head to promenade about,
came at last sailing under the byssiferous molluscs
suspended         from the rock, with his horns full set.
No sooner did the artful Pagurus observe this, than
he immediately popped out from his observatory, and
gave, or attempted to give, the aforementioned horns
a nip.         Whether   he really expected        to take a piece
off them,        or whether he knew that the movement
would cause the Buckie to make a dead stop, or not,
I cannot say ; but certain it the latter did actually
                                       is,
stop, and just in the very position desired by the
cunning Hermit, who quickly mounted on his back,
and from thence succeeded in gaining                a   seat on the
Mussel-bed.         But as     it   happens that artful people
are frequently caught in their own traps, so             it   proved
to be the case in the present instance.              The cunning
Crab      had     forgotten,   that    in    all
                                               probability the
Periwinkle, after        a   decent    pause, would peep out,
and, should he find the road clear, would certainly
start oft again upon his circumambulations.

                                                              In   the
present        instance this was exactly the case        ;    leaving
his companion to find out the loss of his footstool
when he attempted to descend, and at the same time
to discover how he had been tricked by his own want
of foresight.        When the discovery did take place,
Mr    Crab's      movements         were indeed     extraordinary.
It   was impossible to resist         a   smile at witnessing his
despair. He continually ran to and fro coming
very much out of his shell, to take peep over what
                                               a

must have seemed to him a steep precipice.         Unable
to make up his mind to take the desperate leap, or
allow himself to topple down, he remained for a
whole day in this position, but, pitying his forlorn
state, I  gently picked him up with a piece of bent
whalebone, and let him drop softly upon the pebbly
beach below.
   On another occasion     I possessed   a   Soldier-crab,
that inhabited   a Purpura shell, which was, however,
quite insufficient  to conceal him.     Whether it was
that his tail was weaker than usual,       I  cannot say,
but in spite of my efforts to make him shift his
quarters to some more suitable, though more weighty
couch, he always preferred his original dwelling.         I
dropped in for his approval, at different times, at least
six turbinated   cots, any one of which would have
suited him to a turn   ; but no, although his head and
the greater portion of his body were always exposed,
from some unaccountable reason, he always appeared
contented and happy with his choice.
   By accident did   I hit upon a plan to eject him.      I
had a Dog- whelk, which was at least twice the size of
the Hermit-crab, and, as it approximated too closely
to the top of the tank to suit my notions of propriety,
I gave   him a sudden jerk that sent lum plump to the
bottom.     He landed in a corner close to a piece of
sandstone,   on which    some   delicate Ulva latissima
was growing, and luckily, in the same corner the Her-
mit was seated performing his toilet, little anticipat-
ing my disturbance.      Meantime Mr Whelk in a few

seconds, not being at all maimed by his fall, prepared
as usual to make a move, and gently turning back his
horny door, or operculum, he affixed his broad breast
to the first object within reach,         and the aforesaid
Purpura shell holding this position, it of course was
selected for the purpose.
   Shortly thereafter, the Crab, wishing to take his
morning walk, prepared to move.                  Imagine his
surprise    and    indignation,     upon   finding   that   his
carriage refused to be drawn after him with its usual
facility.   He knew that the obstruction            could not
have arisen from its having stuck in the mud, and
therefore probably concluded that        I  or somebody else
(not at all an unusual occurrence) was playing tricks
upon him.       In this belief he gave a strong pull, and
then,   finding   he   did not advance       in the least his
vehicle from its former position, he popped inside
with the intention of tiring us out, and so getting
free.    Accordingly,      after a short  interval,   thinking
perhaps that all was right, he peeped at first rather
slyly out, but in      a  little with great boldness, when,
to his horror, what should meet his eye but the
monster mollusc bearing down upon him, and threat-
ening to crush himself and his dwelling all to pieces
beneath its weight       !    That he was greatly alarmed
was evident       if not from his face, at least judging
from his actions, for he pulled and tugged and shook
his long    antennaB     threateningly,   although     without
the slightest success.         A  pony might as well have
attempted to pull a phaeton to which was attached a

heavy brewer's dray, as the Crab to move the united
weight of his shell and the great Whelk combined.
There was one hole left for him, whereby he might
creep out of his difficulty.         It  was not a pleasant
alternative certainly, but it must be done, so giving
a final tug, quite as futile as any he had before made,
he unhooked      his tail, and clambered up the friendly
piece of sandstone that stood hard by.               From the
apex of this resting-place he looked savagely down
upon the wretch, who had, as he thought, wilfully
robbed him of his house          his all  !
    " Is it not too bad, sir, for such a crawling rascal
                                                            "
to stick to his neighbour's property like that ?              he
 seemed to ask, looking up at me.
                                            " Honi soit qui mal
 y pense," thought I, for      I knew    the Whelk had, like
 Michael Cassio,
            " Err'd in ignorance, and not in cunning."
 I  could not, therefore, think of going to the rescue.
 The result proved that it was unnecessary           ; for, soon
 afterwards, he had crept over the Hermit's cell, and
 was quietly wending his way towards the wrinkled
 sands.
     The Crab, who had been attentively watching every
 movement, no sooner perceived the coast clear, than
  he scrambled down to his
                                   " old house at home," be-
  fore the door of which          I  had just    mischievously
  pushed a .pebble.       Determined not to be baffled by
  such an obstacle, he quickly scraped it away, sorted

iris shell, and, giving    a kind of gymnastic leap (that
 made   me laugh      heartily) from the place where he
 stood, he dropped his tail with the greatest        precision
 into the aperture, adjusted his body, and galloped off
 to some more favourable spot.
    This little incident taught him a lesson, from which
 it was evident   he profited on another occasion.         In-
 deed, the next day     I found   he had voluntarily taken
 up with a shell much better suited to the calibre of
 his body.
    It was very annoying, after      I  had waited so long
 and patiently to    see  him "flit"  to another residence,
 to find that he had done it on the sly, and under the
 shadow of night, like a swindler that had not paid
 his rent.    But many a time have I, in common with
 other zealous    observers,   been similarly disappointed.
 Most animals, especially simple ones such as those of
 which   I  write, have a sweet will of their own, and
 will not   be forced, even in the slightest degree, to do
 what their masters might wish.         It is on this account
 that it is so difficult to treat of their habits from per-
 sonal observation.      It  not unfrequently occurs that
 before a circumstance can be chronicled         which, when
 written,   takes but a few minutes to read              days,
 weeks, and even months are spent in constant watch-
 ings by the anxious student.
    I have   found, at certain times, on placing several
  Hermit-crabs    in my tank, that they have quickly
 left their shells and died.     Yet, on other occasions,    I

112              THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUAEIUM.
have had them live for months.                   For    a long time,     I
was much puzzled at this.                   Experience, however, has
solved the mystery; and as my young friends may
derive benefit from my labours,                  I
                                   shall proceed to
enlighten them upon the philosophy of the tank,
     I found,    then, that      if,   when  I   saw the Crab leave
its shell,I      took   it   up and placed       it    in   a   cup full of
water, dipped gently out of the Aquarium, that                          it
generally in      a     short time revived, and was as lively
as ever.     Why should          it     live in one place, and not
in the other? the water was the same. The same
in appearance only, but in reality very different; the
one being much salter than the other, and the ani-
mals, being suddenly immersed in                  a   fluid the density
of which was so different to what they had been ac-
customed, could not live in     any length of time;
                                            it
whereas the consistency of the water taken from the
upper portion of the tank would perhaps be* the same
as in their own rock pool.
     When so situated,  would advise the young aqua-

is disturbed, to hold  saucer inverted in his left hand
                             a

his right, pour about            a     tumbler   over the saucer, or
more, according to the size of the Aquarium.                        When
the water       is   clear again, place in the Soldier-crabs,
and they will no longer need to dread their saline
enemy; for he, having been subdued by your pro-
cedure,   will   become their best friend, the preserver of
their very existence         !

                        HERMIT-CEAB.                   113
     A  short time since, I  placed two Hermit-crabs     in
  a cup, for reasons  above stated.    One was about an
  inch and a-half, the other three-quarters of an inch,
 in length.     They both soon seemed to recover their
  health and spirits.   As it is highly amusing to witness
 a   Lobster-crab   proceed   to occupy a new shell,      I
 placed in the cup a Purpura, that had several old
  Barnacle shells attached parasitically upon it.
     The little Crab seemed as lively as a kitten, and
 about as fall of pranks.     He very quickly crept inside
 the shell, and hid himself from view, whether inten-
 tionally or not it is impossible for me to say.   Imme-
 diately afterwards, the large Crab came to the smooth
 lip of the Whelk, and put in his claw, in the usual
 style of all members of his family, to see if anything
 was there to hinder his quiet occupancy of the dwell-
 ing.    We can fancy how the mischievous little Crab
 would shrink into the very end whorl as soon as he
 got a hint of his big brother's procedure.         Being
 satisfied with his survey, the sober Hermit lifted up
 his soft and beautifully-painted     "continuation," and
 let it drop with a graceful curve inside the aperture,
 then moved it about to find a proper spot on which
 to hook it.
     Not an instant elapsed before he whipped it out
 again with the celerity of lightning.
     He was in a rage. He had been tricked and in-
 sulted, and in his fright perhaps thought he was in-
jured, instead of only being slightly tickled.   Eevenge
 was evidently indicated by his excited movements.
                              H

 114         THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
   Presently the wee practical joker peeped up, doubt-
less thinking his pranks had been taken in good
part.    Such was not the case.     No sooner did he ap-
pear than he was clutched, and, in spite of his puny
opposition, a forcible ejectment was served upon him,
in addition to which he received rather a severe per-
sonal chastisement.
   The large Crab then quickly seated himself in his
testaceous castle, and    I have no doubt thought him-
self at last supremely happy.        Alas ! nor we, nor
peaceful Hermits, like our friend, can make sure of
anything for long.
   His quiet speedily was disturbed.         The  infant
Pagurus, searching about, found an empty Barnacle
shell on the top of the Whelk, and in this he ensconced
himself.    From his turret he put out his claws and
annoyed his brother, by catching hold of his sensitive
antennae, without the latter having any power to
punish his troublesome relation, in consequence of
not being able to bend his claws over or behind his
head.
   The only plan would have been for him to come
out of his shell, and mount up to where his adversary
was so snugly seated    ;   but this he did not seem to
think of, but evidently preferred settling despairingly
down into the innermost recesses of the Purpura, out
of reach of petty annoyance.
   Next day    I dropped into the miniature tank an
old Whelk shell, the surface of which had been worn
smooth by constant knocking about on the beach.

It    was rather a peculiar            shell, being nearly full of
various sized holes. *
     Into this object the large Crab quickly                    entered and
took up his abode.               The little fellow being left in
his elevated position, soon deserted                      it,   and roamed
about in search of food.              I   took this opportunity of
lifting out the original shell, put    little sea- weed in
                                                a

 I     could relate many other anecdotes of the Hermit-
crabs, did not my limited space forbid me.                          I   may,
however, mention that scarcely             a    day passes in which
the strange habits and quaint comicalities of these
singular animals do not afford food for the note-book
of the student.
     In   conclusion,   I    may inform the reader, that there
are seven species of Hermit-crabs,                   but of these,        one
only (Pagurus lernardhus) can be called common.

myriads of objects, springing and jumping about in
all directions. A sight so different from what          I had
observed    at any other locality,     naturally raised my
curiosity,    and made me anxious to capture a few
specimens.
    The task was not so easy as     I had imagined ; I did,
however, succeed, and found them to be what are
popularly termed " Sand-hoppers" a species of Shrimp
of a different form to the Crangon vulgaris, Sand-
raiser, or Common Shrimp, which grows to such a
nice, handsome, eatable size, and are found in abun-
dance    in most rock-pools near low tide, and even
along the whole extent of the Portobello Sands.
    To oblige a juvenile friend,      I  turned occasionally
                         "
during last summer Shrimper."              I had a net made,
and not a little mystified the human sand-raisers, by
my dredging operations.          While wading up to my
knees in water, not a few persons stepped down and
tried to get a peep into the tin vessel that held my
Shrimps. My protege was, however, generally paddling
in too great a depth for any person to get a distinct
view.     Baffled curiosity would then turn round and
 respectfully inquire, what it was we were catching           1
 I remember one day upon my naming " Shrimps" to an
 individual, whom by his accent I knew to be a
 Londoner, he exclaimed,
                                " What, real live Shrimps ?
 Shrimps good to eat ?

 tinued,   " they are  as fine as what we get at Greenwich
 and Gravesend     ?

                         whispered to his companion as
they moved away,
                    " I'd no idea there was sick a thing
to be got here at all."   This remark did not surprise
Hie,   when      I know    that local inhabitants         are as pro-
foundly ignorant, and, what my English readers will
think still more surprising, as heedless of the fact.
   I   saw one evening while dredging, a lad stooping
near the edge of the water with a builder's                    trowel in
his hand.         With this instrument,               he was    rapidly
scooping the sand in a semicircle before him, and dex-
terously catching a large number of Sand-eels, which
he popped into a basin as fast as he could pick them
up.     I    had noticed several persons with spades at-
tempt this sport of Eel-catching, but with compara-
tively poor success.  The weapons they employed
were too unwieldy to be of efficient service, but the
use of the trowel         is,
                          I         believe, an admirable plan.
   The Sand-eels are in great favour among amateur
anglers as bait for Pike.            I   have tried them, and can
speak as to their usefulness, the fish snapping at them
with great eagerness. may add, that the lad above
                                I
mentioned did not apply his haul for bait, but for
home        consumption;   I        asked him    if   they were good
flavour when cooked             ?
   " Aye " said he, " real fine
             !                             ;   in fawk,I   dinna ken
onything half sae guid."
I      have      tried   the Sand-eels many times in the
Aquarium,        but they have rarely survived beyond                 a
few hours.
   Most writers speak about Shrimps being suitable

for the tank, but my experience     does not warrant
such  a  statement.   I  have  repeatedly   introduced
them, but never found them to live beyond two or
three days   indeed only a few hours,   if the Fiddler
was there.    No matter how diminutive he, nor how
large the poor Shrimp, the Crab always made them
" food for worms " in a very short time.

THE sea can hardly exhibit, among all its countless

interesting than the Living Flowers, or Sea-anemones.
These may be numbered by the thousand, clustering

of profound      contemplation,    alike to the naturalist
and to the philosopher.
   " We cannot     excuse our neglect of them by saying,
what is true with respect to not a few of the most
interesting objects in nature, that they are too small
to be seen without the aid of the microscope; for all
Actinias can be seen by the naked eye, and several of
them, when fully expanded, are of considerable mag-
nitude.    The very names by which they are com-
monly known, shew that their beauty has been both
seen and appreciated.         Even more than a hundred
years ago, when little was known of their nature, and
when zoophytology was yet in its infancy, before our
naturalists had made them an object of study, more
common observers had given them appropriate Eng-
lish names.      Ellis knew that it would     be understood
what he meant when he spoke of them as Sea-ane-
mones.     He says,    t
                         Their tentacles being disposed in
regular circles, and tinged with a variety of bright,
lively colours, very nearly represent the beautiful
petals of some of our most elegantly fringed and
radiated flowers, such as the          carnation, marigold,
and anemone.'        Nay, not only has the resemblance
been acknowledged by man, but, in one case at least
on record,   it forced itself on  a connoisseur, who had
more practical acquaintance with flowers than any of
our florists or botanists.     A distinguished naturalist
(Mr Couch) mentions, that when             he was one   day
admiring    the   beauty of a Sea-anemone,         as on a
sunny day it lay, with fully expanded tentacula, in a

 shallow rock-pool, a bee, on honey intent, deceived
 by appearances,     pounced upon       the marine flower.
 The tentacula, being at the very surface of the water,
 instantly caught the unfortunate intermeddler, and, in
 spite of its struggles, swallowed it up."
                                              *
    The Anemones, perhaps, are the most interesting
 of all the occupants of the Aquarium.          Residents in
 Edinburgh can easily command a supply.             There are
three species extremely plentiful at Joppa and all
along the Frith of Forth.          Many pools are thickly
studded with specimens, varying in size from a silver
threepenny-piece to a cheese-plate.
    The first I shall  refer to is the Bellis, or Sea-daisy.
The members       of this class are especial favourites of
mine, from their suitableness to the Aquarium.          They
vary considerably in appearance         some are red, violet,
and purple, others nearly white.           Some specimens
possess tentacles,   that in colour and character look,
at a little distance, like a mass of brown eider down,
spread out in a circular form.        A  better comparison,
perhaps, presents itself in the smallest plumage of a
bird, beautifully stippled, and radiating from a centre.
This centre is the mouth of the animal, and is of a
light yellow colour.
   From its corners there branch out a pair of yellow-
ish white horns, that taper to very delicate points,
and are ofttimes gracefully curled like Ionic volutes,
or rather like the tendrils of a vine.

to disappear altogether in the sand, or to present only
a small unsightly knob      of dirty white jelly.   They
are so hardy,    that having once affixed themselves,
and become attached to their new home, they will
bloom    and excite your admiration        many   months
throughout    winter or summer.         I  remember two
that remained alive at the bottom of the tank, after
I  had emptied it of all its contents, and washed it
thoroughly with fresh water, which is generally sup-
posed to act as a poison upon them.
   The members of the next species, which has the
disadvantage of possessing a very long name, Actinia
mesembryanthemum      (in colloquial parlance abbreviated
to "Mess"), or Smooth-anemone, are very numerous,
and may be found pendant from the under parts of
rocks, situated at, or even beyond, the highest tide-
mark.     They are in consequence very hardy, and well
adapted to flourish in an Aquarium; but they are
unfortunately, in every respect, inferior in beauty and
effect  to their little sister Daisies.     They possess,
however, one pleasant feature peculiar to themselves,
namely, a string of gems always attached to their
necks.    These gems exactly resemble in shape and
colour the blue turquoise, and when contrasted to
the creature's  tawny skin, have a charming appear-

ance.    These ornaments are not unfrequently obscured
by a profusion of tentacles, and can only be discerned
by close inspection.
                  ACTINIA StESEMBRYANTHEMUM.
  The last, but certainly not least in importance, is
named Bunodes crassicornis (or "Crass" for shortness),
commonly Thick-horned-anemone.            It varies   so   much
in appearance,       that two are seldom found exactly
alike.    It   is rather    a   delicate animal, and never
appears to thrive in the confinement of an Aquarium
for any length of time.          Such at least has been my
experience,    and   I   have had a great many, though           I
never    kept more than one or two at a time.                  All
have, after a month or so, become sickly and died.
  The extraordinary manner in which they conti-
nually change their form, has been made the subject
of discussion by many writers, and         is,
                                      indeed,   cir-       a
cumstance well calculated to inspire curiosity.
   The last "Crass" that     adopted far surpassed any
                                I
which   I   had seen before as   contortionist, and fur-

 of which are truly amusing, considering the form and
 configuration of the animal in its natural state.
        I   must give a sketch of this curious Anemone.
 The first announcement that                I received of     his having
 commenced    his performances, was from a servant
                                              "
 (who had privately taken an interest in the    Qua-
 rium," as she called             it,
                         and endeavoured to catch up
 the names of its inhabitants) poking her head within
 the door of my sanctum, and crying out, "    pleassir,      O !
 do come and look, the enemy (meaning the Anemone)
is  a  turning hisself inside out didn't touch him,
                                             !   I
                        "
 sir, indeed    didn't
                  I           !
  I         discovered, however, that from           a   natural enough
 curiosity she had touched the
                                             " enemy"      the preceding
 day         a   liberty he immediately resented by losing no
 time in, to her great alarm and surprise, "turning
 hisself" outside in         !
        For   a   whole week the animal continued his ma-
 noeuvres, until he finally detached his base from the
 rock.        After this, he rolled about in           a   most inflated,
 dropsical condition, being at least three times his usual
 size.        For   a   time, uncertain what treatment to adopt,
        occurred to me that       if     the water were well aerated,
it it
        might do him good.        I     accordingly took the syringe,
 and forced several jets of the briny fluid over his
 body.           This, of course, caused         a   disturbance of the
 sand and weed, producing myriads of bubbles in the
 water, and finally making                 it    quite opaque.     Upon
 becoming clear again,            I     looked to see what effect my
 doctoring had had upon the patient.                     To my intense

                      SEA- ANEMONES.                    125
astonishment,   I found that he had disappeared,      there
being nothing left of him but a mass of jelly the size
of a plum.
   A  post-mortem    examination of so shrivelled a car-
case   not satisfactorily   aiding    my diagnosis  of the
deceased's ailment,    I was   left very much in the dark
regarding its nature.       I  incline to believe that the
skin had become       so  much extended as to be of the
fineness of tissue paper, and that, under such circum-
stances, the slightest pressure       of water punctured it
and caused a collapse, from which the "Crass" did
not recover.     At all events, he was quite dead when
I lifted him out of the tank.
                ACTINIA  BUNODES   CRASSICORNIS,
    Since writing the above,      I  have met with the fol-
 lowing remarks of Professor           Eymer Jones.    This
 author observes   :
    " The Actiniae, like the
                                 Hydra, possess the power

126            THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
of changing their position.          They elongate     their
bodies, and remaining fixed at the base, stretch from
side to side as      if searching for food at a distance.
They can even change their place by gliding upon
the disc which supports them; or detaching them-
selves entirely     and swelling themselves with water,
they become nearly of the same specific gravity as
the element which they inhabit, and the least agita-
tion is sufficient to drive them elsewhere
When they wish to fix themselves,          they expel the
water from their distended body, and sinking to the
bottom, attach themselves again by the disc at their
base, which forms a powerful sucker."
   With all due deference to so respectable       an autho-
rity, I think the assertion regarding these        creatures
detaching themselves for the purpose of being thrown
or blown about into some new locality, is incorrect.
My doubts       are due to the following causes":
    1st, That upon no occasion have         I ever seen an
Actinia    so detached,   and rolling about in any rock-
pool.     I  have had opportunities, during various sea-
sons of the year, of viewing some thousands of these
animals;     and had such been their usual habit,      I am
surely justified in expecting that     I  should have met
with at least a solitary instance.
    2dly,   I  have watched them often, especially the
Mesembryanthemum,        creeping along the base and upon
the sides of the tank, apparently enjoying a pleasant
ramble, the body not being at all disturbed.
   And 3dly,      I have had specimens     of the "Crass"

                             SEA-ANEMONES.                           127
which        remained for weeks fully and naturally ex-
panded;        then,       from    some    unknown         cause,    they
seemed suddenly to assume                  a sickly hue, their lips
became discoloured, and a thin, white, fibrous mem-
brane would issue from their mouth.                       The creature
would undergo an almost endless variety of metamor-
phoses, becoming at every stage weaker and weaker,
and finally losing its muscular power, get detached
from its resting-place, "so that the least agitation
would be sufficient to drive it elsewhere," without,                   I
believe, any power of again affixing itself when drifted
to another spot.             It   then very soon collapsed and
died ; at least        I   have observed         in several instances
this to be the result.
    There is besides a fourth species that                 I must    not
omit to mention, viz. the A ctinia coriacea.                It is   much
like the Crassicornis, but not so brightly coloured,
and    is,
       moreover, tougher in its nature.   Dr Lands-
borough thus writes of            it:
    "It   is   about two inches in diameter at the base,
variously coloured, often reddish, blotched with green,
covered with many pale, perforated warts.                   The tenta-
cula are numerous in three or four series.                 It   attaches
itself to sand-covered rocks, and   often pretty much
                                                is
buried in sand, so as to be partly concealed when in
a  contracted state.  Its warts stand   in good steadit                ;
for they have the power of causing to adhere to them
sand and gravel, and fragments of shells, so that the
body   is    quite covered.        This,   it   is   probable, answers
a   double      purpose.          By this covering the animal,

128               THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
when left by the tide naked, is defended from the
scorching beams of the sun.                     It    answers nobly also
the purpose of concealment; that kind Providence
which cares for the inferior animals, furnishing various
means of eluding their enemies.         The ptarmigan,
which inhabits the lofty mountains, gets white plum-
age when          winters       returns, so that even the keen-
eyed eagle can scarcely distinguish                   it from the snow-
clad peaks among which it dwells.                       Were the Alpine
hare to be white in summer, it would be too conspicu-
ous when skipping along the heath;                      and it would be
not less so in winter, when all is white around, were
its fur not to lose its summer hue, and to become
white       as   the      mountain Nothing could be
                                         snow.
better fitted to conceal this Actinia, which abounds
on our shores, than this very covering, with which
it knows         so well how           to clothe itself.        When the
ebbing       tide      leaves    the    sand-covered rocks dry,            a
Sea-anemone           of so large a size, even when contracted,
would be very observable.     But when the tentacula
are all retracted, and the warty skin covered with the
sand and shelly fragments that so firmly adhere to                        it,
it   is   so like everything around, that              itis   very difficult
to detect        it    so much so, that very often            I   have not
had the slightest suspicion of an Actinia being at hand
till, by     some accidental pressure, the water squirted
up through its warts and tentacles. When the tide
returns, however, the Anemone unfolds itself in
beauty, and           a   marine       flower    is    immediately     seen
where there was nothing but sterility before.                           The

 tentacula are shorter than the body, and are annulated
 or variegated with white or red."*
    I must   not conclude this chapter without caution-
ing the young zoologist that, while collecting Actinise,
great care should be taken in detaching them from
their position.     If possible, it is by far the better
plan not to disturb them, but to transport them to
the Aquarium on the piece of rock or other substance
to which they are affixed.        This can in general be
accomplished by a smart stroke of the chisel and
hammer.       Should the attempt        fail, an endeavour
should be made to insinuate the finger nails under
the base, and so to detach them uninjured.             This
operation is a delicate one, requiring practice, much
patience,   and no little skill.      We are told by one
author that a slight tear is of no consequence, since
the animal is represented as having the power of soon
darning it up.     It may be so, but, for my part,    I am
inclined to be sceptical on the point.
   I  never attempt to capture a Daisy-anemone, un-
less  I first see it fully expanded before commencing
operations.     I am    able, in consequence,    to form a
pretty probable accurate estimate of its appearance in
the Aquarium.
   This condition     of its being seen, necessitates, of
course, its being covered with water, and, conse-
quently, increases the difficulty of making it captive,
especially when the animal happens to be seated on a
combination of stone and solid rock, or in a crevice,
               "His. Brit. Zoophytes," page 250.

or in a detestably muddy                pool, which, when dis-
turbed, seems as         if it would    never come clear again.
    It  in consequence, advisable to search for those
          is,
situated in shallow water, the bottom of which                            is
covered with clean sand.   When such       favourable    a
spot     is   found, take hammer and chisel, and commence
operations.          Several strokes may be given before any
alarm      is   caused to the Anemone, provided                it   is   not
actually touched.   No sooner, however, does     feel             it       a
palpable vibration, and suspect the object of such dis-
turbance, than, spouting up       stream of water,
                                            a                             it
infolds its blossom, and shrinks to the smallest pos-
sible compass.          At     the same time     it   tightens its hold
of the rock, and         is,   indeed, often enabled successfully
to defy the utmost efforts to dislodge it.
    After little experience, the zoologist will be able
                a
to guess whether he        likely to succeed in getting
                                 is
his prize perfect and entire        not, let me beg of
                                        :   if
him not to persevere, but immediately to try some
other place, and hope for better fortune.
    The last-mentioned class of Anemones                     is   certainly
the most difficult             to be captured, from the great
length to which they are enabled to elongate                           their
bodies, and thereby fixing themselves                   to the base of
empty Pholas' holes.              On the top of such       a   spot they
frequently display their plumes, or perhaps they select
a   stone buried four or five inches below the surface of
the sand.
I        remember on one occasion to have seen                 a   beauti-
ful specimen, which        I      endeavoured to grasp.                It, of

 course,     instantly     closed    its  tentacles,   and,    as   the
 water was somewhat opaque,                 I  could not observe
 what   I   was doing.        But, pushing down my hand,               I
 clutched as large a portion of sand as possible, exactly
over the spot where          I   had noticed the creature disap-
pear.      I   then drew my fingers and thumb together,
 expecting to feel the shrinking object of my search,
but only felt what appeared to be a slimy annelid.
I  have a peculiar instinctive antipathy to worms, and
therefore      instantly drew up my hand, when, to my
surprise,     I found it held the bulb of the pretty Bellis.
What I thought was a worm was only the drawn-out
body of the fair Daisy.
    There is no necessity for specially feeding these
animals, at all events not oftener than once a month.
Some     writers      assert    that a single meal       in twelve
months is sufficient;           yet they are very greedy crea-
tures,   and will devour any kind of fish                    shell or
otherwise        that comes within their reach.              The last
" Crass" that       I  captured had swallowed a Crab'"" of so
large a size, that its tentacula could not meet, when
contracted over the poor victim.
    The Anemones, moreover,               possess    the power of
ejecting a poisonous secretion, that has the effect of
speedily paralysing any animal that comes in contact
with them, and even imparts to man a sensation of
   * I am really at a loss to conjecture why       Mr Lewes, in his
        <e
recent     Sea-side   Studies,"   would venture to assert that Ane-
mones never devour Crabs.         I have repeatedly seen illustrations
of the fact.

burning or smarting. This peculiarity did not escape
the notice of Pliny, who says, " It is just like that
produced by the nettle found on land."        The classical
naturalist rather exaggerates the effect. At least, in
any that     I  have experimented upon, the urticating
power has been much less severe.
    Miss Pratt mentions that the poison is not equal
in all the species.    In  some, she says,
                                           " it is sufficient
to cause only a slight sensation of tingling in the
fingers which have touched the Anemone; in others
the     sensation is more of a smarting         or burning
nature."      But what is very curious, this author men-
tions that different persons are variously affected by
the touching of the same individual, and gives an in-
 stance which occurred under        her own observation.
 Miss Pratt "had placed in a vessel of sea water a fine
 specimen of the Fig-marigold Sea-anemone (a Mesem-
 bri/anthemum), which she was accustomed to touch
 many times during the day.        Her surprise was great
 on finding that the same Anemone, on being touched
 by another person, communicated a more powerful
 sensation, which    her friend assured her, was felt up
 the whole of the arm.         More than twenty persons
 touched this Anemone, and the writer was amused
 by observing how variously they were affected ; some
 being only slightly tingled, while others started back
 as  if  stung by a nettle."
     Ckacim a son gout; but certainly, although         I  ad-
 mire exceedingly the pretty Anemones,        I  should not
 care much to eat one.        Indeed, when seeing       them

closed, covered with sand and mud,      it is hardly   pos-
sible to conceive   any objects more     repulsive as an
article of food.    Yet " in tropical countries they    are
much used for this purpose; and a beautiful species,
with crimson tentacles, which is abundant on the
shores of the Mediterranean, is a favourite dish of
Italian epicures.    Our common Purple Sea-anemone
(or Crassicornis) is said by the Abbe Dicquemare
to be               to       other for table.      "
        preferable      any                          Being
boiled in sea water," says this writer, " these polypes
acquire a firm and palatable consistence,        and then
may be eaten with any kind of sauce.           They are of
an inviting appearance, of a light, shivering texture,
and of a soft white and reddish hue.        Their smell is
not unlike that of a warm Crab or Lobster."          Eugh !
I   shudder to think of having such a a dainty dish"
set before me, and being compelled to partake of
it !  Ah  ! if the good Abbe had known anything of
Finnon Haddocks       or Kippered Herrings,      he would
not have written thus.      At  all events,  I  agree with
the excellent Dr Landsborough,       that, while we can
get such fish as these out of the sea, we shall willingly
let the most tempting of our Actiniae bloom unscathed
in all their beauty.

more than we shall fathom."         REV. C. KINGSLEY.
ON peering into any rock-pool, the young zoologist
cannot fail to perceive, attached to various pieces of
rock, broken crockery, loose shells or stones, clusters
of certain white twisted tubes, that resemble nothing
in the world so much as minute rams' horns, or
calcareous     serpents,     strangely intertwined with each
other.     Each of these tubes is inhabited by a species
of marine annelid, or worm, called Serpula.                      This
curious animal, having once attached itself to any

                            SERPTJLA.                        135
 object, has no power ever after to change its position.
 Its stony sheath is formed by itself
           " From  its own essence exquisitely modell'd,"
 and in this it lives throughout its existence.
    One species (Serpula contortuplicata) affects a stately
 pride, refusing to mix much in fish society.           Its mem-
 bers hold their heads higher than their neighbours,
 and live and die in solitary grandeur.
    These generally select an Oyster or Scallop for a
 resting-place, a single Serpula occupying a shell or
valve to itself.      The tube of this class being attached
at the base, springs upwards to a height of several
inches, whereas the tube of the other (Serpula vermi-
cularis), above mentioned, is always prostrate.
    I  am fond of having at all times some of these
extraordinary creatures in the tank, were it to serve
no other purpose than to amuse my juvenile friends.
Young people take no small delight in getting a peep
at the peculiar revelations of marine life, afforded by
the hand-lens.
   The appearance        of the Serpula when out of the
water is by no means prepossessing, but no sooner
is it placed in water, and allowed to remain there
for a short time, than it presents a good opportunity
for examining its curious structure, more particularly
that    portion      the breathing      apparatus      which   it
usually exhibits in its native haunts.            This consists
of   a  very curious and brilliant plume of feathers,
exquisitely     coloured with red or violet, which the
animal protrudes from the mouth                of its shell and

spreads    open    like a fan.        In  the centre a kind of
conical plug or stopper appears, around which                   the
feathers seem to have been rolled.
    The sense of vision which the Serpula possesses is
                           COMMON   SERPULA.
extremely acute, and this is the more curious from the
fact that all naturalists have hitherto failed to discover
any eyes.'*    Still, that these organs exist, is manifested
by, among other proofs, the fact that                if  a hand be
passed    over the tank, the fan instantly disappears.
After a while, this extreme sensibility, however, be-
comes dulled by familiarity with shadows cast by
passing objects, such as Blennies, &c.
   * M. A. Quatrefages thinks      he has discovered  eyes upon the
branchiae of the Sabellse.    Vide
                                    " Mag.  Nat. Hist./'  1850.

                             CHITON.                         137
    The sketch exhibits one of these creatures reclining
 on a piece of rock.         It   is drawn from nature, but
 appears somewhat different from the usual represen-
 tations, in respect that the fan seems to open from
 a double centre, and that the stopper is under the
 expanded plume.         It   struck    me as being rather a
 surprising fact, that from the centre of the stopper,
there    sprung    a   small    frond    of dulse.    How this
managed     to become attached to such an extremely
sensitive organ,     I am at a loss to imagine.
    There is another class of annelids, nearly allied to
the above, named Sabdlce.
    Their tubes are formed of sand, and are found
generally congregated around the edges of the rock-
pools, among the weeds.             It is easy to detect their
presence from the number of holes that appear to
have been newly bored, as if with a small brad-awl.
They are by no           means       suitable  objects   for  an
Aquarium, as they do not live long in confinement.
    On turning over almost any piece of stone, such as
those to which the Serpula affixes its tubes, a strange
creature, something like a Wood-louse,            will often   be
met with.     This animal, which is known as Chiton,
                                           I
is not very pretty to look at; and merely mention it
here, because   it is common, and       because  it holds  a sin-
gular position in the marine animal kingdom. While
the majority of its brethren, such as the Patellae, &c.,
have their bodies protected by a testaceous               shield,
the covering of the Chiton consists             of eight shelly
plates, or scales, that overlap each other like slates on

 138          THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUAKIUM.
the roof of a house, or like the mail plates on some
knightly gauntlet.
   It generally measures from half to three quarters
of an inch in length, although on foreign shores it
attains a much greater size.     A  specimen now before
me is exactly two inches long.        The colour of this
animal is dark brown.      Its mode of locomotion, and
general character, are precisely the same as those of
the Limpet.
   Such animals as the Chiton,       Limpet, and others
resembling them, belong to a species of molluscs
called Gasteropoda, which are so named from their
locomotive organs being attached to the under part of
their bodies.    They are, however, to a certain extent,
armed against attack or danger by a shelly covering.
   There is another class of molluscs that creep about
without any such protection, and whose gills or lungs,
instead of being inside, are exposed on the exterior
of their bodies.    These are hence called Nudibranchs,
or Naked-gilled Molluscs.      The Doris and Eolis are
                        THE EOLIS.
types of this class.   The gills of the former are spread
out in an arborescent form, and have a most elegant

effect.  The latter has these organs           branching  out
over its entire body like semi-transparent quills, giv-
ing a most remarkable appearance to the animal as it
glides along.      Both are to be found adherent to the
under surface of stones, &c.
    The writer had always been led to believe that
these animals were very voracious, and, indeed, that
" a wolf would be about       as  appropriate an inmate of
a sheep-fold,    as one of them in an Aquarium where
Sea-anemones       live."   Naturally, in consequence of
this sweeping assertion against the beautiful Eolis,
he watched his specimen with considerable attention
for several weeks, and came to the conclusion that he
had been shamefully libelled by sundry writers.          But
that this opinion on his part was premature, he one
day discovered.        Happening    to give my usual peep
into the tank before going to bed,        I saw plainly that
my Eolis "was no better than he should be," and
that the charge of greed brought against him was
perfectly correct.      I was therefore  obliged to come to
the conclusion that his quiet, sedate manner,             was
merely assumed for my deception.            During the dusk
of evening, the little fellow had crept to the neigh-
bourhood of a sweet purple Bellis, that sat flowering
on a grassy bank.         Upon my first discovering him,
he had just reached the object of his attack. The
plan of his operation was rather remarkable.               It
seemed as     if  he possessed the power of fascinating
his victim by a basilisk glance       ; for if  I touched the
little Daisy, though ever so slightly, it would close

140          THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUAEIUM.
its hands quickly over its breast, shrinking, like the
sensitive plant, in evident alarm.        But now, this dan-
dified mollusc, with his milk-white coat and purple-
tipped streamers waving therefrom, not only touched
my pet, but insidiously      crawled about, and by slow
degrees detached   it entire from the      disc, the tentacles
not being in the slightest degree contracted during
the whol6 of the manoeuvre.            When this was done,
he dragged down the unsuspecting creature, and, ser-
pent-like, crept forward until he reached her pretty
golden lips.   Then, and then only, did she infold her
blossom, and,
                   "  Like a lily drooping,
                     Bow her head and die."
    Next morning, having despatched his meal, the
Eolis appeared highly delighted with himself; and to
shew that his gormandising           had had no bad effect
upon his usual graceful gait, but on the contrary
had rather exhilarated his spirits, he marched prettily
up the sides of the tank.           Thereafter, to my great
astonishment, he walked on the surface of the water,
like a fly upon the ceiling of a room, head down-
ward* !
    Such an occurrence      is by no means unusual with
this class of animals; but it struck me at the time
as being very curious, as       I   had not had any oppor-
tunity of witnessing it before.         I have   often done so
since.
    Mr  Gosse, in his
                         " Natural History of        Mollusca,"
 explains the operation thus      :

                              EOLIS.                     141
     " Many of the  aquatic members of this class (Gas-
 teropoda) are able to float at the surface, by means
 of their broad expanded muscular disc or foot. They
 crawl to the top of the water, up the stems of a plant
 or the side of a rock, and stretching out the bottom
 of the foot along the surface, the back being down-
 wards, it presently dries by contact with the air;
 while it remains dry, it will float the animal, which
 then glides along as     if   on a solid body, crawling,  in
fact, on the inferior surface of the air ; but, if by any
 agitation of the water, or by the will of the animal,
 the foot become overflowed, the state of suspension is
 ended, and the creature falls to the bottom."
     My first experiment led      me to a very different con-
 clusion.    Before meeting with the above passage,         I
 had written as follows :
     The Eolis,  I believe,   swims on the surface of the
 water by a very simple process, viz., by ejecting a
 thick transparent slime, which floats on and partly
 blends with the water.         To this gelatinous substance
  the animal attaches      itself, and so becomes perfectly
 buoyant, roaming about wherever its will directs.
     The truth of this statement can easily be tested.
  Take up an Eolis, lay it gently on the surface of the
  water, try by every means in your power to make           it
  stick there.   The result will be a failure, for the crea-
  ture will assuredly sink to the bottom whenever you
  release your hold.       But, supposing it has thought
  proper to climb the sides of the tank, and crawl on
  the face of the fluid contained therein, take a piece of

 142           THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
 stick, push the creature, endeavour to make it sink,
and you will find it more difficult than you would at
first imagine.        When the experiment is successful,
the animal, not caring for such treatment, will in time
permit you.       You will perceive that it     does not drop
down at once, even when entirely              covered  by the
water, but first its head, then its body sinks.             At
last, you will see the whole creature suspended by the
tip of its tail  (?), after which it falls softly to the base
of the vessel.
    After this, in lifting up some of the water at that
part to which the Eolis was attached, you will find
it  does not fall from your stick in drops, but clings
to it like fluid jelly        a  circumstance that naturally
suggests    the idea, that by its adhesion to the gela-
tinous mass, the animal owes its power of floating on
the surface of the water.
    A  friend who witnessed along with me the appear-
ance which      I   have   just explained in     a somewhat
feasible way, exclaimed,        " That  is wonderful, truly !
                                                              "
I  thought so too.        It  is equally wonderful to think,
that although     I have   tried the same experiment again
and again, scores of times, it has always failed.
    I  therefore conclude that the learned naturalist,
Mr    Gosse,  is in the right.        I have,  however, given
my own early notion, in order that it may serve as a
caution to the young student in coming to a hurried
conclusion upon any matters relative to the mysteries
of nature.
    The Doris is generally about one inch in length.

                            DOPJS.                    143
It  is sometimes      of a pale yellow, and sometimes
milky-white.
                           THE DORIS.
   There is another species which grows to a large
size ; this is commonly       called the Sea-lemon, from
some fancied resemblance        to that fruit when cut in
half lengthways.        Its technical  name   is D. tuber-
culata.
   I   captured one of these animals at Joppa that
measured nearly five inches in length.         It was of a
cream     colour, almost approaching to a white, while
on several parts of its body were patches of the most
brilliant purple, and also numerous tubercles.
   I  tried to preserve it by dipping it in fresh water,
but it emitted such a quantity of mucus, even after      I
had the trouble of changing the water four or five
times, that    I felt so disgusted as to throw it out of
the window.
   The Eolis is a more difficult object for the unprac-
tised eye to discover than the Doris; and even those
familiar with its likeness, would fail to recognise in
the strange mass before them the beauteous           Nudi-
branch of the picture-books.

more    especially such, as it is necessary to introduce
into a good Aquarium. The Algas not only add to
its picturesqueness and beauty, but their presence
is absolutely essential for the existence and health
of its occupants.
   This combination which we urge, of sea-weed and
sea animals in the Aquarium, is just following out
the laws of Nature, as apparent to all who will watch
an   ocean in miniature      at the sea-side.    There the
most inattentive observer cannot fail to perceive that
wherever living creatures        are found, there  are also
plants and sea- weeds      of various kinds growing in
luxurious profusion, " the one being essential to the
other in supporting the life of both."
   " The animal and vegetable respirations counter-
balance each other, the animal's blood being purified
by the oxygen given off by the plants           the plants
fed by the carbonic acid breathed by the. animals."
When your Aquarium has been established a short
time, if all goes well, you will perceive
                                               " thousands
of tiny globules (like quicksilver balls of various sizes)

the infant vegetation is beginning to grow, and these

termission, so long as the rays of the sun are uninter-
rupted.    These bubbles consist of pure oxygen given
out by the plants, under the influence of light, and

   It     is therefore of the utmost importance that we
should select those Algae which have been ascertained
to possess the property of generating this elixir of
life in the greatest degree.                    Of this   class, none are so
noted as the Ulva latissima                          a plant that       belongs
to the Chlorosperm                     or    Green-seeded     Algae.       It   is
variously termed Green-sloke, Green-laver, and again,
Sea-lettuce.              It   grows in great profusion upon the
sea-shore near Edinburgh.
   Like         so   many others of the most common natural
productions, it is also one of the handsomest.                               In-

and consequently there was                       a   greater abundance          of

light than usual. On looking at the Aquarium,                       I
found that the Ulva had risen in the water, and was
hanging in most elegant festoons from the surface,
forming     emerald caves and grottoes, such as a sea-
nymph would love.          Even at a little distance it was
a   pretty sight, but a closer inspection           revealed   still
more    beauties; for, being excited by the unwonted
light, the plant had poured forth so much oxygen,
that its entire surface was thickly studded with tiny
sparkling beads, that had buoyed up the whole plant,
each bubble acting as a miniature balloon.                 When,
however, a black cloud came over the sun, the bubbles
soon detached     themselves,        ascended   to the surface,
and as there was no more to take their place, down
dropped the plant to the bottom."
    Totally opposite in character to the Ulva above men-
tioned is the Enteromorpha            compressa, or Sea-grass,
which is also extremely useful, especially in forming a
kind of close thicket at the bottom of the tank.      In
it the fishes are very fond of wandering, either for en-
joyment or protection from the glaring heat of the sun.
This sea-plant grows in great abundance upon rocks.

candle be placed at the edge of the tank,      it will  soon
be seen that the diet is not altogether         imaginary.
Thousands of minute but lively shrimps, and other
objects, may be seen, even with the limited vision of
the naked      eye,  swimming     about in all directions,
making for the light.       If these are examined with a
hand-lens, the marvel of the appearance will      "be  not a
little increased.    The Sea-grass, as its common but
expressive   name would lead us to suppose, grows in
thin wiry fronds, although occasionally       I  have seen
it half an inch broad. A novice is apt to be led
away with the idea that it is a juvenile specimen of
the broad green Ulva.
    There is another plant, Zostera marina, that in like
manner bears the generic name of Sea-grass.       It differs
from that which       we   have  been  describing   in this
                        that it grows with a root        " on
important    respect,
sandy shallows and banks in the sea.          It  has very
long grass-green leaves, and hence its botanic name is
derived from the Greek word riband.           The French
term it La Zostere, the Germans Sea-tang, and our
own coast people commonly call it Sea-grass."           It  is
frequently torn up by the force of the waves, and
thrown upon the shore, where it soon becomes of a
brown     or blackish    hue.   Most of my readers will
know it by its commercial name of Ulva, or Alva
 marina, it being used extensively in many places for
 the purpose of filling beds and mattresses in lieu of
horse-hair and other expensive material.
    I was much    pleased   on meeting with a passage in

  150         THE SEA -SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
 the works of Sir Thomas Browne, in which that great
 and quaint author alludes to the several varieties of
 Marine Algae, such   as the Sea-lettuce (Ulva latissima),
 the Zostera marina, and others, that grow so proli-
 fically at great depths.    Sir Thomas states that the
 following passage of Holy Writ, " Where waters stood
 before, dry land appeared     without impediment, and
 out of the violent streams a green field," would seem
 to imply, that the Israelites passed over a green field
 at the bottom of the sea.       He also adds his belief
 that the words may be taken literally,         instead of
                                                    " there
 metaphorically, since (to use his own words)
 is a part of the Mediterranean Sea called La Prairie,
 or the Meadowy Sea, from the bottom thereof being
 so plentifully covered   with plants; since vast heaps
 of weeds are found in the bellies of some whales taken
in the Northern Ocean, and at a great distance from
the shore, and since the providence of nature hath
provided this shelter for minor fishes, both for their
spawn and safety of their young ones ; and this might
be more peculiarly allowed to be spoken of the Ked
Sea, since the Hebrews named       it Suph, or the Weedy
Sea."
    The next sea-plant in my list is Dulse, Duillisg,
or Dillisk (Rkodymenia       palmatd).    It  belongs to
the Rhodosperm,     or Red-seeded Algae.     Should the
reader ever feel at a loss from not being able to fall
in with this sea-weed, he has only to ask the first
ragged urchin that comes in his way.           Several of
these   will  dodge  in amazement      about the young

zoologist, attempting to get a peep into his bottles,
and exceedingly anxious to ascertain what he can be
poking and hunting after.           It is probable that some
more intelligible idea may be formed              of gathering
Dulse than of his other pursuits on the sea-shore,
for that weed is a favourite esculent with the poor.
I have frequently seen many of them make a meal
upon Dulse.       It  is not limited as an article of diet to
persons    near the shore, but is one of those humble
luxuries that are eagerly sought after by the poorer
classes in large towns.         These either eat it raw, or
boil it to make a kind of jelly.
    Dulse varies from a rich Burgundy colour to a          very-
deep purple.     It affixes  itself to the rocks, and ofttimes
grows fringe-like      upon the thick stems of the great
Oar- weed (L. digitata).
    Growing in even greater profusion than the above
is Chondus-chrispus,       or Irish Moss       an article that,
in its dried state, may be had at most grocers' shops.
It is sold to make a nutritious jelly for invalids, and,
if not  so  pleasant to look at, is certainly as wholesome
as the expensive
                      " shapes" sold by     confectioners.
    This plant forms a very pretty feature in an Aqua-
rium.     As Mr      Gosse truly remarks,       "it  is elegant
in form and brilliant in colour; the expanding fan-
shaped fronds cut into segments, cut, and cut again,
make fine bushy tufts in a deep pool; and every seg-
ment of every frond reflects a flush of the most lus-
 trous azure, like that of a tempered sword-blade."

vidual plant belongs, the width of the frond                 is so
different;   sometimes     it is  an inch across its widest
part, sometimes       not a twelfth part of that width.
Then it divides itself into such various shapes; some-
times the segments at the edges being round, in others
acute or jagged, or forming long slender points; and
if this sea-weed grows in a spot where            it is  exposed
to the influence of fresh water, it alters so much that
an ordinary observer of marine plants would think                it
belonged to a different genus.            Then its colour is
variable.     When growing in a shady pool it is irride-
scent ; while    it has been lying, it is bleached perfectly
white, when it may be seen in all the intermediate
tints between white and dark purple, often tinged,
too, with green.       Nor is it even constant in its place
of growth ; for on the very shore where in one spring
it lies in great profusion, it is not unlikely that in
the following year a few specimens               only will      be
found."*
   Perhaps the most notable of all marine plants for
purifying the water of the tank is the blood-coloured
Fucus, the scientific name of which is Delessaria san-
guinea.    This Fucus has the good fortune to be a
great favourite with the lady collectors.           I  have seen
specimens     so   cleverly mounted upon card-board, or
the pages of an album, that although the fair artist
told me she had " collected" them herself,                I could
not resist slily scraping the edge of the weed with
my thumb-nail, to make sure           I  was not being plea-

santly imposed upon      ;   so  much did the whole look
like a highly finished painting.         It is common only
in summer.      After rough weather, the beach will be
everywhere strewed with its transparent pink leaves,
so prettily and so delicately veined.
   This beautiful Alga, one writer observes, " so much
excels its congeners, that it carries away the palm
with no less justice from the vegetables of the ocean,
than the rose, the flower of the poets, from its rivals
of the garden."
   It  reaches a great     size in certain localities.      Dr
                         " There is in the
Landsborough      says                           possession of
my friend Major Martin, of Ardrossan, a magnificent
frond of D. sanguined, which Sir W. Hooker said
was the largest he had ever seen; the single frond or
leaf is thirteen inches long and eight inches broad."
The average length of this species, however, is about
five or six inches.
   Most writers divide the      sea- weeds  into three classes,
olive, green, and red.      " This division is not    an arbi-
trary, but a natural one, for in a great measure with
similarity of colour is connected a similar structure.
It  is not, however, so invariable as to be a perfect
distinction.    Among the red sea-weeds we find every
shade of purple tint, and of a few of the darker kinds
we almost hesitate as to whether we should pronounce
them to be red or olive-green; while exposure to air
and light, in some cases, turns a red sea- weed into a
dull yellow or dirty white hue, or renders its crimson
of   a bright scarlet; and drying       in the sun blackens

                      ON SEA- WEEDS.                    155
 almost all the olive-green species.    Yet, in practically
 studying sea- weeds, this presents little difficulty, for
 very generally we find the olive-green plants tough
and leathery; the red usually frail and delicate;
 while the grass-green are always of simplest structure,
and of a tint little liable to change.      In this almost
constancy of colour, the Algce differ greatly from the
plants of our upper earth, among which           colour is
almost useless as a characteristic, giving us scarcely
any idea of the nature or properties of the plant, and
varying under circumstances of soil or culture.       Thus
we see the wild hyacinth        trembling  in the spring-
wood, and we call it a       blue bell; but we step into
the next copsewood,     and there we find our favourite
woodland    flower   arrayed in purest       white.    The
'brown or purple heath' sometimes greets us un-
expectedly with snowy bells, and white blossoms
sometimes surprise us on the root where we expect
to find the pink flowers of the Kobert-leaved cranes-
bill."*
   The olive species of sea-weeds are called Melano-
sperms,  or Black-seeded, and many, the most pro-
minent of them, are coarse by comparison with the
red or green spored Algae.
   On approaching the piers or rocks situated on any
part   of our sea-coast, we cannot fail to observe
them tapestried with the dishevelled locks of the
common Bladder- wrack, Fucus vesiculosus.           This is
the commonest     of our sea-weeds, and one that child-

156          THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
ren are so fond of treading upon, and cracking under
their feet. The noise they make is occasioned by
the explosion of the oval bladders that swell at inter-
vals upon each frond.
   Another plant, Fucus nodosus, is sometimes mis-
taken for the above, it also having oval bladders,
which serve to buoy up the plant amidst the waves.
But the distinction between the two is easily made,
by remembering that those of the latter are longer
and tougher, and will not break easily; although,
when thrown into the fire, they produce a loud re-
port.     These   bladders    are  sometimes   made    into
whistles by the juveniles, who, in consequence, have
a great   penchant for the knobbed or knotted wrack,
as  it is commonly    called.
    This Fucus may be easily distinguished from the
common Bladder-wrack by the absence of a mid-rib.
 I have a specimen before        me that has  a- beautiful
appearance    imparted to it by the thick bushy tufts
 of Polysiphonia fastigiata, that grows parasitically
upon it.     This little plant has a pleasing effect, when
its hair-like filaments of deep purple         colour    are
 spread upon white paper or card-board.
    Confined by the same string that binds the Nodo-
 suSj and many other weeds that lie on my table,           I
 may mention      the Fucus     sermtus,  another   of the
 Melanosperms.       It has no vesicles upon its surface,
 but it has something which is far more wonderful
 and pretty.
    Its fronds  are shaggy with the Sertularia pumila,

the Sea-oak Coralline, and at the same time profusely
studded with patches of most beautiful      silver lace-
work, Fluslra membranacea (another species of zoo-
phyte).    The movements of the marvellous creatures
that occupy these cells, can only be seen and appre-
ciated by aid of the microscope, under which instru-
ment, says   Dr Johnston, " when the polypes      are all
protruded,   they form a beautiful   object from their
numbers, their delicacy, and the regularity of their
disposition,  and the vivacity of their motions, now
expanding their tentacular into a beautiful campanu-
late figure, now contracting the circle, and ever and
anon retreating    within the shelter of their cells."
Dr Landsborough having carefully examined        a speci-
men, reckoned that on every square inch of the web
of the silvery lace, as every cell was inhabited by a
living polype, there existed above two millions of in-
dustrious, and, doubtless, happy inmates,     so  that a
single colony, on a submarine island, of a foot in
length, is almost equal in number to the population
of Scotland.
    But a common hand-lens is quite sufficiently power-
ful for viewing the singular little mollusc (Spirorbis)
that ornaments each frond, making it appear at a
 short distance as  if a number    of chalk beads had
been newly gummed and sprinkled thereon.
    The shell of this animal is quite flat on one side,
 and curled like a ram's horn.   From the thickest end
we   see  protruded  several exquisite feathers   and a
 small stopper, much in the same style as the Sabella.

158          THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
    This Fucus, whose edges are serrated or notched
like a saw, is called in Scotland Black-wrack, or
Prickly-tang.    It  is  extensively   employed      on  the
sea-coast as a manure.
                             " In Norway, it is     used as
food for cattle, mixed with meal.      The Dutch employ
it to   cover their crabs and lobsters, and keep them
alive and moist, preferring it to any other, because it
is destitute of that mucus which causes them to fer-
ment and putrify."
    There is one other sea-weed that    I must    not forget
to mention, viz., Laminaria digitata.       It  is variously
termed Sea^girdle, Sea-hanger,     Tangle, Sea- wand, and
                Oar- weed.     " It is  called Laminaria
Five-fingered
on account of the thin flat plates or laminae of the
frond, and digitata or fingered, because the frond is
split into segments, like the fingers of a hand."          It
has a woody stem, measuring sometimes           one inch to
one and a-half inches in diameter, and from two to
six feet in length.     Dr Landsborough, in his admir-
able " History of   Sea- weeds," a book which none of
my readers should be without, says      :
    " But of what  use is this great Algae    ?   Can it be
eaten  ?  We have never tasted it ; but the young stalks
and leaves are eaten along with Dulse; and old Gerard
tells us, that when well boiled, and eaten with butter,
pepper, and vinegar, it makes good food.            Can the
woody stems be turned to good account ?             To very
good account ; though we cannot rank high in the list
of useful purposes an amusing one mentioned by Dr
Neill, that of making knife handles f A pretty thick

 stem is selected, and cut into pieces about four inches
 long.     Into  these are stuck blades of knives, such as
 gardeners use for pruning and grafting; as the stem
 dries, it contracts and hardens,       closely and firmly
 embracing the hilt of the blade.         In  the course of
some months, the handles become quite firm, and very
hard and shrivelled, so that when tipped with metal
they are hardly to be distinguished from hart's horn.'
Neither do we envy the inhabitants of Orkney, Shet-
land, and the Channel Islands, the use of the plant
as fuel.      Having abundance of good pit coal at hand,
we are very thankful that we need not have recourse
to tangle.       Were it converted into peat, we should
not be unwilling to use it; and we have seen it thus
metamorphosed, but on too small a scale to be useful.
This was among sandhills on the coast of Ayrshire,
where it had been drifted a considerable way inland
by some unusually high tide      ; and having been deeply
covered with driven sand,      it had lain, it may   be, for
ages,  and had become a layer of peat about two inches
thick, in which the stout tubular rind of the tangle
stem, in a compressed state, was quite distinguishable.
    " But far from
                        unimportant are the purposes to
which it has been put in the formation of kelp, to
which the stems, and indeed the whole of this plant,
greatly contribute.       Who would have thought that
burned sea- weed would ever have been found useful in
the manufacture of such a substance as glass       ?   And
yet,  till  lately, the materials out of which the best
window-glass       was formed, were two parts      of kelp

160           THE SEA-SIDE AND AQUARIUM.
and one of white sand.         The kelp was substituted
         '
for the    fossil alkali/ which, according to a probable
account, was accidentally found to contribute to the
                                             'a
formation of glass.     According to Pliny,      merchant
vessel, loaded with nitre or fossil alkali, having been
driven ashore on the coast of Palestine, near the river
Bolas, the crew went in search         of provisions, and
accidentally     supported   the kettles on which they
dressed them upon pieces of the fossil alkali.        The
river sand above which this operation was performed
was vitrified by its union with the alkali, and thus
produced glass.     The important hint, thus accidentally
obtained, was soon adopted, and the art of making
glass was     gradually    improved.    Though kelp, till
lately, was chiefly employed in Britain in the manu-
facture of soap and glass, it is now principally manu-
 factured for the iodine it contains, and no sea-weed
is so rich in iodine as this great tangle, especially its
                  "
 woody stems.'
    As  I have already   stated, two or three of the red
 and green Algae are all that are necessary for purify-
 ing the water in an Aquarium. There are, however,
 several others of each class, w hich, when introduced
                                   r
judiciously, and watched with care, and rejected when
 they begin to fade or die, look very graceful and ele-
 gant.    Many of the latter sort are seen to the best
 advantage when made to jut out from the crevices of
 rocks, or anchored close to the sides of the glass
  such as the common red Coralline,         Comllina   offi-
  emails, the Ptilota plumosa, the rich green feathery

to enumerate, are to be easily met with at Joppa, and

   " In  1762, there was one house,       and one only, on the spot
where Portobello now stands.        It was built by an old sailor who
had taken part in the capture of Portobello in America, and he
named his house after that town.        Circumstances afterwards led
to the selection of this neighbourhood as a site for private dwell-
ings for the Edinburgh folk, and a very pretty sea-side town has
hence arisen.     The Portobello sands furnish a fine spot for sea-
bathing, and the town is full of the usual kind of holiday visitors
during the bathing season."      The Land we Live in.
PERSONS residing in Edinburgh scarcely require to be
informed that the village of Joppa does not possess
great attraction for visitors.            As   a bathing-place,    it
has been long ago deserted for the more fashionable

ever, persons who prefer the seclusion of the one to
the bustle of its more successful rival.              The writer
of these pages,     item of the minority, has passed
                      as an
more than one vacation by the more secluded beach;
and, of course, as soon as his eyes were in any degree
opened to the wonders of the sea-shore, he naturally
preferred to prosecute his studies where there was less
chance of interruption.
   Before he had the good fortune to discover the
recommendation these new pursuits conferred upon
the place, he would not have hesitated in expressing
his decided conviction            that Joppa was one of the
dullest spots that ever went under the name of a
watering-place.
  The rocks, to any but the ardent student of zoology,
are of the most uninviting character, damp and shaggy,
with various fuci, and consequently slippery, suggest-
ing, especially to persons of sensitive toes, anything
but pleasant spots for looking across at the Fife shore-
coast, or down to the rich shores of East Lothian.
Indeed, the most agile walker can hardly advance a
step without incurring imminent danger of a slip.
  But   I had no       sooner got acquainted with a little of
marine zoology, than Joppa became quite a different
place ; and   I can     assure my reader that, under similar
circumstances,        the most stupid and indifferent spot
on the sea-coast will assume an interest superior to
that of the most charming scenery.             Poor and tame
as Joppa   is,   it   possesses, in my eyes,   a   beauty which

only a very limited number of objects in the impe-
rial city beside it can inspire. These same rocks,
objects of my former aversion, are now to me what
the stairs of Holyrood are to the antiquarian,               the
Calton   Hill   to seekers after fine views, or, to expand
the metaphor, each barren crag offers to me what
quiet woods full of game, and fields abounding in
rare flowers, offer to the sportsman and to the botan-
ist.   After a time it became a pleasure, almost bor-
dering upon a passion, to be examining some crystal
pool, by whose side
                          " Nought was heard
         Save the rough cadence of the dashing wave."
Even the commonest          sea- weeds, once    that I began  to
know something of their physiological wonders, as-
sumed an importance they could never otherwise attain.
Nor was    there wanting,      I hope,  one of the most salu-
tary results of initiation into any branch of knowledge

upon the mind, opening it to a higher conception of
the wonders of the universe, and, consequently, of the
might and grandeur of that Being from whom all
these things are, and by whom all things exist. Never
surely shall the immortal lines of the poet be more
frequently quoted than by the sea-shore           :
       " These are Thy glorious works, Parent .of good,
         Almighty ! Thine this universal frame,
         Thus wondrous fair; Thyself how wondrous then     !
         Unspeakable, who sitt'st above these heavens
         To us invisible, or dimly seen
         In  these Thy lowest works  ; yet these declare
         Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine."

              ON  THE KOCK-POOLS OF JOPPA.                  165
    One has only to bend down, and peep into the
smallest rock-pool, that mimic ocean at his feet, to
behold fresh wonders, to which no pen can ever do
sufficient justice.     Besides the obvious beauty that
results from the mirroring of every passing cloudlet
on its face, see the host of Serpula               plumes that
vanish whenever the sky looks frowningly upon them,
and again bashfully       unveil themselves         when all is
clear in the deep blue of heaven.          Note the pink and
purple corallines, and the variegated algae, that cling
around, fixing their stems upon its marge, and
bending forward, spread their bannered fronds, like
silken streamers.      Or, again, keep your eye fixed on
this little time-worn cavity.         Small and insignificant
though it appear to the heedless passer by, it con-
tains a combination of wonders that no mind could
more conceive than hands could execute.                Well, in-
 deed, may the poet ask,
                         " Who   can paint
            Like nature? Can imagination boast,
            Amid its gay creation, hues like hers 1
            Or can it mix them with that matchless skill
            And lose them in each other, as appears
            In                        "

     Yet, withal, how few persons are able to appre-
 ciate   or to enjoy these       treasures    that encompass
 them at every step.          It  is not enough       that such
 wonders exist, nay, are so prodigally scattered            that
 little trouble and no expense are incurred in observ-

ing them      wonders, the study of which expands the
mind, that humble pride.
   But the study of marine zoology has another re-
commendation, that ought not to be omitted.                As
pursued in aquariums, it is one of the few objects in
which invalids can interest themselves, not only with
pleasure, but with perfect safety.        And   even to those
whose ailments do not make in-door               confinement
necessary, but are, nevertheless,     unable to take active
exercise, the study of marine zoology, at least along
the shores of the Frith of Forth, is far from hope-
lessly difficult.   Of the benefit which would accrue
to invalids from a knowledge of this fact,             I  was
one   summer      forcibly reminded       on   the following
account:
   I  often passed, along the beach         at Portobello, a
canopied carriage, wheeled down            to the shore, in
which a young lady reclined
                               " Watching  aye
       The foam-wreaths which the faint tide wove below
      Upon the spangled sands."
The fair occupant was evidently suffering from some
malady that deprived her of the use of her limbs.
Although no symptoms of acute pain were to be seen
on her handsome      and kindly countenance, none could
look unsympathisingly at one so young, bedridden,
and incapable of moving about.              Everything that
the eye of affection could suggest, seemed to be
adopted for her comfort.          Among the most devoted
of her attendants was     a  little Skye terrier, whose in-

               ON   THE ROCK-POOLS OP JOPPA.           167
 genuity in pleasing his mistress was never idle.       He
 appeared    to be     continually scampering along the
 sands    and bringing back pebbles in his mouth,
 which, after dropping on the coverlet, he would shew
 by his barking, he expected         as plainly as a dumb
 creature   could ask      his mistress to throw the stone
 into the   sea,  in order that he might paddle in and
fetch it out.      She, alas  ! could only hang down her
slender fingers for him to kiss.
    The reader will easily understand how natural it
was in me to wish that          I might have been able to
direct the attention of this poor lady to the objects
of the  sea-shore.
    At  the risk of being considered impertinent,        as
some may think,       I  should offer to have done some-
thing of the sort, had she not suddenly ceased to
visit her accustomed spot.
    I am sure    I need   not attempt to impress the ob-
vious fact, that to such as are blessed with health
and strength, it is much better to occupy their time
with zoological research, however humble, than, as
many thousands at the sea-side do, saunter listlessly
about upon the beach, or yawn over silly novels, or
" dip into the     sugared slough of sentimental poetry,
in comparison with which the old fairy tales were
manful and rational," or spend their time in flimsy
chit-chat on the trivial topics of the hour.

                     CHAPTER XIT.
     How     TO
                 " COLLECT," AND STOCK THE " TANK."
      " And thus while I wander'd on ocean's bleak shore,
        And survey'd its vast surface, and heard its waves roar,
        I  seem'd wrapt in a dream of romantic delight,
        And haunted by Majesty, Grlory, and Might."
                                                   B. BARTON.
   " Thus I    found, as  I  have often done before in my natural
 history experience,  that  it is not always the  most likely places
 that yield the richest harvest to the explorer."  P. H. GOSSE.
 I  DO  not think     I  can more fitly conclude this little
work than by giving some plain directions regarding
the establishment of an Aquarium.
    Of    course   the first thing that is required is the
tank.       This indispensable requisite can be had, of all
sizes, ready made, at many shops, both in London and
Edinburgh, and at prices varying from two shillings
to ten pounds.         The expensive kind are' of consider-
able size, and are either square or oblong in form.
Their construction is very peculiar, and unless ex-
tremely well made, they are apt to become leaky and
get seriously out of order.            Indeed, the most care-

         HOW TO COLLECT, AND STOCK THE TANK.               169
 fully constructed Aquariums of large dimensions            are
 apt to occasion     much trouble, especially      if  shifted
 often when full of water.
     In addition   to several primitive tanks, consisting
 of a china sugar-basin, two glass tumblers, &c., I have
 two others, the largest of which measures fifteen
 inches in diameter by six inches in depth, and cost
 me just four shillings.     It  rests on a mahogany base
 supported by ball feet, and presents,      I believe,  rather
 a pleasing effect, standing on a small table near the
 window.
     Some persons object to the circular tank, on the
 ground that its occupants, when seen from the sides,
 appear magnified.       This fact is rather a recommenda-
 tion with me, as it presents more distinct views of
 each movement in the vessel; and whenever          I wish to
 see  the objects at their natural size,    I can  do so by
looking in from the top.
    On the edge of the tank are placed three corks,
notched out to the thickness of the glass ; on these
there is placed a circular piece of common glass, cut
two inches larger than the diameter of the tank.            As
the corks are about three quarters of an inch above
the tank, they allow a current of air to pass over the
water, and also prevent, to a certain extent, particles
of dust from falling in. On the edge of the moveable
      I
lid paste a stripe of white paper, binding like, which
prevents the glass from cutting the hand of any per-
son moving     it about.
    I employ   a glass syringe to aerate the water occa-

sionally (the price of this instrument, may mention,    I
is ninepence) ; a camel-hair pencil, an ivory crochet
pin, and a bent piece             of whalebone, complete the
whole machinery of the Aquarium.                        The cost is so
trifling that    I am     sure the poorest person might man-
age to procure it.            I sincerely    hope the time is not
far distant when a parlour or drawing-room will not
be considered completely furnished unless                         it contain
an    ocean    in miniature       in the shape of a tasteful
Aquarium.
  Now, supposing the tank to be complete, let me
describe how to collect stock for as well as the  it,
simple equipment that           is   required.      Different writers
have different opinions upon this subject.                            One tells
us we must have           a   "pair of      high wading boots;"              a
second states, among other things, that                     it   is   necessary
to engage the services           of "   a   strong-backed quarry-
man, with      a   strong-backed crowbar."                  The labours of
an individual of this class, who assisted the learned
author from whom          I   quote, are thus chronicled                 :
     "After    five minutes' tugging, propping, slipping,
and splashing, the boulder gradually tips over, and
we rush greedily to the spoil;                a    muddy,             dripping
surface   it   is," &c.
   Very probably so: indeed there cannot be much
difficulty in realising this picture to the mind's eye.
For my own part,      I       should decidedly object to make
a    toil of pleasure,        and submit to such slavery.                    I
should also object to the " meet me by moonlight
alone" appearance of the respectable                    individual with

the burglar's walking-stick on his shoulders, as my
companion through any sea-side place.                                I have    little
doubt that a party so equipped would excite no small
surprise at, for instance, Portobello                        !   Depend upon
it,   Mr Policeman,           if   he could be found, would get                     a
hint from some lazy promenader to ask us                                      a    few
questions on our return                      perhaps search our basket
      perhaps get his fingers nipped for his pains by some
irascible crab.
I       may here observe that, to country folk in general,
a   naturalist, ardently pursuing his studies on the sea-
shore,    is   looked upon as                     a   madman.         Dr Lands-
borough narrates an anecdote relative to this subject,
in his " Excursions to Arran," with such                         a   rich vein of
humour, that        I    cannot refrain from quoting                     it   entire.
   "Meeting      Highlander, who had been angling
                    a

pocket. During the repast the Highlander said to
him, 'Ye '11 no belang to this place   No,' said                 V   '

him with a very suspicious eye ; but as the meat and
drink were very good, and very acceptable on so cold
a day, he continued to enjoy the repast,             convinced
that, though the gentleman might be daft, he was
 neither unkind nor uncannie"
    Dr Landsborough then adds :
    " He is not the only naturalist in the west who
 has fallen under the suspicion of being rather ' wrong
 in the mind.'     Captain  Carmichael, of Appin, being
 often seen by the country people wandering on the
 shore, and even wading in the sea, taking up hand-
 fuls of trashy sea-weeds, and, after examining them,
 casting them back into the sea, or, what was worse,
 carefully securing them in a tin box, as          if they had
 been precious treasures, they came to the conclusion
 that he was decidedly wrong in the head.             However,
  as he was very kind and peaceful, they regarded him
  with compassion.      A stranger, walking on the shore
  one day with a person belonging to that neighbour-
  hood, seeing the Captain wading in the sea, with his
  shoes and stockings in one hand, and some sea-weeds
  in the other, said to his companion, 'Who is that?'

side, is exceedingly     simple    merely  a  nice brown
wicker fancy basket, with a division at each end for
two preserving jars or glass bottles, the central space
being used for holding the small hammer and chisel,
hand-net, weeds, &c.       A lady could carry the whole
with the greatest ease.
   To persons resident, say in Edinburgh or within
two or three      miles from    the " hunting-ground,"   as
the fancy basket would not be very suitable for a
gentleman,    I would  simply recommend a small leather
(carpet  1) bag to be kept for the purpose.      It would,
of course, have a division in the centre, lengthways.
It might be prudent to stow a pair of old shoes in one
compartment;       and as the sea water is rather inju-
rious to leather, these could be slipped on while at
the rocks.      In  the other division,   at each corner,
might be placed a glass bottle, while the intervening
space might hold a flat strawberry basket,      if nothing
better offers.    The bottles can be used for fish, fine
sea- weeds,  nudibranchs, &c., and the basket will hold
the indispensable hammer and chisel,          weeds,   uni-
valves, bivalves, actiniae, &c.
   It is seldom that an hour's search at the rocks will
not suffice to afford an ample stock of objects, unless
one happens to be on the          search after curiosities.
Should the zoologist have the good fortune to settle
upon an interesting spot, then two, or even three
hours will seem insufficient.

dinary traveller. Very few, indeed, would have the
least idea of the kind of luggage that your carpet bag
contained.
      Sea water can always be readily enough obtained.
A     stone   jar should   be kept for the purpose of holding
it.      Care must be taken that the jar is perfectly free
from any smell, as that of spirits, dirty cork, or the like ;
any such impurities would instantly spoil the supply.
One great point in favour of an Aquarium, and one by
no means generally understood,               is,
                                   that having once
filled the tank with the briny fluid,                it   will last for
months, and even years,              if   proper     care   be   taken,
without requiring one particle of sea water to be again
added for as the water evaporates, the salt falls to
         ;
the bottom,         and the     deficiency         may be supplied
with fresh water from the cistern or filter. In order
to ascertain when the sea water    of the proper den-
                                            is
sity, you require to have           a   gravity bubble, which can
be had for sixpence.        This may always be kept in

advisable, as this matter is so arbitrary, for me to
state how my own is mapped out, leaving it to my
readers to imitate my arrangement or adopt a style of
their own as they may think proper.
    I always   had, until lately, a penchant         for placing
about two inches of sand at the bottom of the tank,
from the idea that it would be obliging the Fiddler-
crabs    and their      crustaceous    friends.    I    now find
this is quite unnecessary.         The crabs can hide under
stones   if they   like, or make themselves at home, and
walk about the grounds in a free and easy style. The
fact is that, in aerating the water, it frequently stirs
up the sand     ;  and when this is the case, it settles on
 weeds and     other objects,      making them look rather
 unsightly.     I   therefore   now only place a few milk-
 white pebbles and shells at the base of the vessel               ;
 around     the outward       edge  I   dispose  the pieces     of
 rock that have the various delicate weeds attached.
 These, rising up against the sides of the tank, have,
 to my eye, a charming effect.           Sometimes     I place  in
 it temporary     pieces of rock, and on these      I lay two   or
 three mussels.       When the latter have moored them-
 selves to the glass by their silken cables,       I take    away
 the pieces of rock from below.              The animals then
 live suspended as long as       I please.     On the pebbles    I
 lay Pholades, in such a position that             I   can easily
 watch their movements.           In  the centre of the Aqua-
 rium   I have    a large oblong piece of sandstone,          that
 projects always two inches above the top of the water,
 in order that the fishes can get air easily,        if  required,

or rest themselves  if they  feel disposed.   At  the base
of this stone are several flat pieces of rock, on which
some Daisy-anemones are flowering, with the large
Pholas, in his chair of state, poised in the centre.
Behind the high rock is a mass of sea-grass and green
ulva for my pretty pack of Blennies to hide in or
shelter themselves at will.    Two Soldier-crabs peram-
bulate here, there,    and everywhere, as do several
Winkles and Limpets. A fine Trochus, a pearly- white
Doris, and a purple-coated Eolis ofttimes affix them-
selves to the centre rock, and add to its picturesque-
ness and beauty; while several minute Star-fish "drag

their slow length along over the sides of the tank.
Some Serpula, one Crassicornis, and one Mesembryan-
themum complete my stock, which,       I  am proud to say,
are all in a healthy condition.      The water is clear as
crystal; and   I feel satisfied in my own mind that,
although   so  many little creatures     are in .captivity,
they are as comfortable and happy in this mimic
pool as in their native haunts by the sea-shore.

     " Tn our previous cursory              to the
                                 reference          wonderful
transformations undergone by the Barnacle tribe, the
reader would understand that these assertions rest upon
the    evidence  of modern naturalists" In fact, prin-
cipally upon the evidence of Mr J. V. Thompson,
of Cork,* who states, that he watched one of these
singular little creatures through the wonderful changes
of its existence.    We may say, with Mr Kirby, in his
" Bridgewater Treatise " on the History, Habits, and
Instincts of Animals, that the thing is not impos-
sible, for with God all things are possible, but it ap-
pears in the highest degree improbable.

motive animal, gifted with eyes and legs, should, by
an extraordinary metamorphosis, in its perfect state,
become      a Barnacle, without head, eyes, or locomo-
tive organs, can never be admitted, till confirmed by
   *
      Mr  Spence Bate has also endeavoured   to corroborate Mr
Thompson's theory.   See
                         " Mag. Nat. His.," 1851, xiii. 8.

repeated experiments of the most able and practised
zoologists, so as to place the matter beyond dispute."
I  by no means, however, mean to assert, that Mr
Thompson did not think he saw what he has stated
in both    cases   to take place; but he was probably
deceived    by appearances,      in some such way      as  he
states Sldber to have been.
   A  single fact by Poli is sufficient to overturn this
whole hypothesis.        This illustrious conchologist re-
lates that he had an opportunity of examining the
immense fecundity of the Sessile Barnacles.         " In the
beginning of June he found innumerable aggregations
of them covering certain boats that had long been
stationary, which,     when closely examined, were         so
minute, that single shells were not bigger than the
point of a needle j and that from that time they grew
very rapidly, and arrived at their full size in Octo-
ber." These very minute ones must have been hatched
from the eggs, and not produced from larvse.

   " Then   there are gnarled trunks      of what were once
noble forest trees, still clinging with, stony roots to their
native soil"     There are few subjects more deeply in-
teresting than those that bear upon the encroachments
of the mighty    sea upon the land.    For the information

                         APPENDIX.                     181
of the youthful reader,     I may be permitted     to quote
a  few passages which relate to this topic.
    Plato and Pliny, among ancient authors, give many
wonderful statements of the sea swallowing up cer-
tain lands and cities, as well as lofty mountains, in
various parts of Europe.      And   the old historian Cam-
den observes   :
    " We may gather from the words of Giraldus, that
Cape St David's once extended further into the sea,
and that the form of the promontory has been altered.
When Henry the Second was in Ireland, by reason of
an extraordinary violence of storms, the sandy shores
of this coast were laid bare, and the face of the land
appeared,    which had been covered for many ages,
also the   trunks of trees which had been cut down,
standing in the midst of the sea, with the strokes of the
axe as fresh as if they had been cut yesterday, with
very black earth, and several      old blocks like ebony;
so  that it did not appear like the sea-shore, but rather
resembled    a grove    by a miraculous metamorphosis,
perhaps, ever since the time of the deluge, or long
after, at least very anciently        cut down and con-
sumed, and swallowed up by degrees, by the violence
of the  sea  continually encroaching upon and washing
off the land."
    Scotland has suffered     severely from this dreadful
enemy.      Even  so late as 1769, an estate near Forres,
worth at one time three hundred pounds per annum,
was entirely overwhelmed and destroyed.            So rapid
were the encroachments      of the sand, which came upon

  it in sweeping         heaps, that an apple-tree which grew
  there was, in the course of the season, so buried, as
 that nothing but the summit remained visible.
     In    Wales, a long range of coast was at one time
 overwhelmed by the sea           ;  so sudden was the calamity,
 and so unexpected, that it is stated, at the time of
 its occurrence, there were in one lordly mansion many
 persons assembled at a great feast given by its owner.
 "When the          guests    were    carousing and calling for
 more      wine, the       harper was      suddenly    struck with
 amazement         as   his spirit foresaw the coming evil;
 and the servant, who had gone down to the cellar
 for wine, rushed wildly into the hall, crying out, ' The
 tide   !  the tide   !'    The harper and the servant alone
 had time to escape, and found safety in the moun-
tains; all the rest were swallowed up                lands, flocks,
and houses                                            *

&c.       These animals, when caught, look like small
bubbles in the net.             So transparent are they, that

 touched with the hand, or the pressure of the fingers
 is sure to injure their delicate form; but "when the
 net is taken out of the water, it must be carefully
 reversed, and its contents gently emptied into a basin
 or glass jar filled with clear salt water.   It is best
 to plunge the net beneath the surface when being
 emptied, as thus the Medusae are enabled to detach
 themselves from the threads and swim away without
injury.    When the net is taken out of the water, they
appear like little adhering shapeless masses of clear
jelly, and exhibit no traces of their elegant form and
ornaments.     When in the jar or basin, they are often,
on account of their extreme transparency, very diffi-
cult to distinguish; but by placing the vessel in the
sun, or beside a strong artificial light, we see their
shadows floating over the sides and bottom of the
basin, like the shadows of flitting clouds on a land-

   "William       Paterson, driven by religious persecution from his
native land, at an early age zealously took to mercantile matters,
and became opulent at the West Indies.           He then settled in London.
Besides founding the Bank of England, he originated the ill ma-

started a Company still in existence, to supply the north of London

 His copious extracts from his hero's written works shew how con-

 respect we conceive his readers will allow him to have fully succeeded,
