SOME PRESS OPINIONS
"This singular, significant, and most fascinating book. It is
beautifully written, a literary document of the most sensitive taste
and susceptibility. it would be impossible to imagine a task of
regretful and fond remembrance undertaken with more propriety or
with a more detached and delicate sense of balance. There is not a
father but could learn something of consideration and sympathy from
its perusal, nor a son but should follow its course with a kind
indulgence. And since every one is either parent or child, there is
no one but should find in it some personal appeal to the most
primitive and the most enduring of all human associations."
Daily Telegraph.
"His sentences flow like a river, not a 'swart and bubble-crested
stream,' but cheerful and alive, breaking constantly into ripple and
music, but never ceasing to flow, never tardy, never interrupted,
never ringing harshly. It is a pure delight and a most valuable
lesson to read such writing. But the charm is wielded unconsciously
and is therefore all the more powerful. Let no one suppose that the
spirit of this book is unfilial. It could not have been written except
by one to whom the filial relation was most dear and sacred."
British Weekly.
"Quivering with an interest which holds us enthralled from the
first page to the last."-Christian World.
"This is a book of remarkable human interest. We have a narrative of deep and poignant human confidence which holds the intelligent reader entranced to the end." --The Outlook.
/ " Told with unfailing tact, taste and good humour. For all students
of human nature and all historians of the psychology of religion the
book is invaluable."-Pall Mall Gazette.
"This book is as interesting as any piece of real life described by a
skilful hand must be. It is effective and well written, and it records
a certain phase of life which is worth seizing while it is still
credible."- Westminster Gazette.
"We must express our admiration for the way in which this
intensely human and vivid story is written. There is not a false note
in the book. It is written with perfect art and the sincerity that
inspires art."-Daily Mail.
" The book is unique in its sympathy, its broad view of life, and its
purity of style. Something, too, we think, has been added to our
understanding in the matter of rigid religious bigotry."
Literary World.
a "The whole narrative is absorbingly interesting; it need not jar
upon the tenderest of susceptibilities; it is grave, but very gracious, and
invariably gentle. A very fine book, with a very fine lesson shining
clear on every page."-Liverpool Courier.

PREFACE
AT the present hour, when fiction takes forms
so ingenious and so specious, it is perhaps
necessary to say that the following narrative,
in all its parts, and so far as the punctilious
attention of the writer has been able to keep
it so, is scrupulously true. If it were not true,
in this strict sense, to publish it would be to
trifle with all those who may be induced to
read it. It is offered to them as a document,
as a record of educational and religious conditions which, having passed away, will never
return. In this respect, as the diagnosis of
a dying Puritanism, it is hoped that the
narrative will not be altogether without
significance.
It offers, too, in a subsidiary sense, a study
of the development of moral and intellectual
ideas during the progress of infancy. These
have been closely and conscientiously noted,
and may have some value in consequence of
v
PREFACE
the unusual conditions in which they were
produced. The author has observed that
those who have written about the facts of
their own childhood have usually delayed to
note them down until age has dimmed their
recollections. Perhaps an even more common
fault in such autobiographies is that they are
J sentimental, and are falsified by self-admiration
and self-pity. The writer of these recollections
has thought that if the examination of his
earliest years was to be undertaken at all, it
should be attempted while his memory is still
perfectly vivid and while he is still unbiased
by the forgetfulness or the sensibility of advancing years.
At one point only has there been any
tampering with precise fact. It is believed
that, with the exception of the Son, there
is but one person mentioned in this book
who is still alive. Nevertheless, it has been
thought well, in order to avoid any appear-:.. ance of offence, to alter the majority of
the proper names of the private persons
spoken of.
As regards the anonymous writer himself,
whether the reader does or does not recognise
an old acquaintance, occasionally met with in
quite other fields, is a matter of no importance.

PREFACE
Here no effort has been made to conceal or to
identify.
It is not usual, perhaps, that the narrative
of a spiritual struggle should mingle merriment and humour with a discussion of the
most solemn subjects. It has, however, been
inevitable that they should be so mingled in
this narrative. It is true that most funny
books try to be funny throughout, while
theology is scandalised if it awakens a single
smile. But life is. not constituted thus, and
this book is nothing if it is not a genuine
slice of life. There was an extraordinary
mixture of comedy and tragedy in the situation which is here described, and those who
are affected by the pathos of it will not need
to have it explained to them that the comedy
was superficial and the tragedy essential.

CHAPTER I
THIS book is the record of a struggle between
two temperaments, two consciences and almost
two epochs. It ended, as was inevitable, in
disruption. Of the two human beings here
described, one was born to fly backward, the
other could not help being carried forward,
There came a time when neither spoke the
same language as the other, or encompassed
the same hopes, or was fortified by the same
desires. But, at least, it is some consolation
to the survivor, that neither, to the very last
hour, ceased to respect the other, or to regard
him with a sad indulgence.
The affection of these two persons was assailed by forces in comparison with which the
changes that health or fortune or place introduce are as nothing. It is a mournful satisfaction, but yet a satisfaction, that they were both
of them able to obey the law which says that ties
of close family relationship must be honoured
l
A
FATHER AND SON
and sustained. Had it not been so, this story
would never have been told.
The struggle began soon, yet of course
it did not begin in early infancy. But to
familiarise my readers with the conditions of
the two persons (which were unusual) and
with the outlines of their temperaments (which
were, perhaps innately, antagonistic), it is
needful to open with some account of all that
I can truly and independently recollect, as
well as with some statements which are, as
will be obvious, due to household tradition.
My parents were poor gentlefolks; not
young; solitary, sensitive and, although they
did not know it, proud. They both belonged
to what is called the Middle Class, and there
was this further resemblance between them
that they each descended from families which
had been more than well-to-do in the eighteenth
century, and had gradually sunken in fortune.
In both houses there had been a decay of
energy which had led to decay in wealth. In
the case of my Father's family it had been a
slow decline; in that of my Mother's, it had
been rapid. My maternal grandfather was
born wealthy, and in the opening years of the
nineteenth century, immediately after his
marriage, he bought a little estate in North
2
FATHER AND SON
Wales, on the slopes of Snowdon. Here he
seems to have lived in a pretentious way,
keeping a pack of hounds and entertaining on
an extravagant scale. He had a wife who
encouraged him in this vivid life, and three
children, my Mother and her two brothers.
His best trait was his devotion to the
education of his children, in which he proclaimed himself a disciple of Rousseau. But
he can hardly have followed the teaching of
"'Emile" very closely, since he employed
tutors to teach his daughter, at an extremely
early age, the very subjects which Rousseau
forbade, such as history, literature and foreign
languages.
My Mother was his special favourite, and
his vanity did its best to make a blue-stocking
of her. She read Greek, Latin and even a
little Hebrew, and, what was more important,
her mind was trained to be self-supporting.
But she was diametrically opposed in essential
matters to her easy-going, luxurious and selfindulgent parents. Reviewing her life in her
thirtieth year, she remarked in some secret
notes: "I cannot recollect the time when I did
not love religion." She used a still more
remarkable expression: "If I must date my
conversion from my first wish, and trial to be
FATHER AND SON
holy, I may go back to infancy; if I am to
postpone it till after my last wilful sin, it is
scarcely yet begun." The irregular pleasures
of her parents' life were deeply distasteful to
her, as such were to many young persons in
those days of the wide revival of Conscience,
and when my grandfather, by his reckless
expenditure, which he never checked till ruin
was upon him, was obliged to sell his estate,
and live in penury, my Mother was the only
member of the family who did not regret the
change. For my own part, I believe I should
have liked my reprobate maternal grandfather,
but his conduct was certainly very vexatious.
He died, in his eightieth year, when I was
nine months old.
It was a curious coincidence that life had
brought both my parents along similar paths
to an almost identical position in respect to
religious belief. She had started from the
Anglican standpoint, he from the WATesleyan,
and each, almost without counsel from others,
and after varied theological experiments, had
come to take up precisely the same attitude
towards all divisions of the Protestant Church,
that, namely, of detached and unbiased contemplation. So far as the sects agreed with
mny Father and my Mother, the sects were
4
FATHER AND SON
walking in the light; wherever they differed
from them, they had slipped more or less
definitely into a penumbra of their own
making, a darkness into which neither of my
parents would follow them. Hence, by a
process of selection, my Father and my Mother
alike had gradually, without violence, found
themselves shut outside all Protestant communions, and at last they met only with a few
extreme Calvinists like themselves, on terms
of what may almost be called negation-with
no priest, no ritual, no festivals, no ornament of
any kind, nothing but the Lord's Supper and
the exposition of Holy Scripture drawing these
austere spirits into any sort of cohesion. They
called themselves "the Brethren," simply; a
title enlarged by the world outside into
" Plymouth Brethren."
It was accident and similarity which brought
my parents together at these meetings of the
Brethren. Each was lonely, each was poor,
each was accustomed to a strenuous intellectual
self-support. He was nearly thirty-eight, she
was past forty-two, when they married. From
a suburban lodging, he brought her home to
his mother's little house in the north-east of
London without a single day's honeymoon.
My Father was a zoologist, and a writer of
5
FATHER AND SON
books on natural history; my Mother also
was a writer, author already of two slender
volumes of religious verse-the earlier of
which, I know not how, must have enjoyed
some slight success, since a second edition was
printed-afterwards she devoted her pen to
popular works of edification. But how infinitely removed in their aims, their habits, their
ambitions from "' literary " people of the present
day, words are scarcely adequate to describe.
Neither knew nor cared about any manifestation
of current literature. For each there had been
no poet later than Byron, and neither had read
a romance since, in childhood, they had dipped
into the Waverley Novels as they appeared in
succession. For each the various forms of
imaginative and scientific literature were
merely means of improvement and profit,
which kept the student " out of the world,"
gave him full employment, and enabled him to
maintain himself. But pleasure was found
nowhere but in the Word of God, and to the
endless discussion of the Scriptures each
hurried when the day's work was over.
In this strange household the advent of a
child was not welcomed, but was borne with
resignation. The event was thus recorded in
my Father's diary:
6
FATHER AND SON
"E. delivered of a son. Received green
swallow from Jamaica."
This entry has caused amusement, as
showing that he was as much interested in the
bird as in the boy. But this does not follow;
what the wording exemplifies is my Father's
extreme punctilio. The green swallow arrived
later in the day than the son, and the earlier
visitor was therefore recorded first; my Father
was scrupulous in every species of arrangement.
Long afterwards, my Father told me that
my Mother suffered much in giving birth to
me, and that, uttering no cry, I appeared to be
dead. 1 was laid, with scant care, on another
bed in the room, while all anxiety and attention were concentrated on my Mother. An
old woman who happened to be there, and who
was unemployed, turned her thoughts to me,
and tried to awake in me a spark of vitality.
She succeeded, and she was afterwards complimented by the doctor on her cleverness.
My Father could not-when he told me the
story-recollect the name of my preserver. I
have often longed to know who she was. For
all the rapture of life, for all its turmoils, its
anxious desires, its manifold pleasures, and
even for its sorrow and suffering, I bless and
7
FATHER AND SON
praise that anonymous old lady from the
bottom of my heart.
It was six weeks before my Mother was
able to leave her room. The occasion was
made a solemn one, and was attended by a
species of Churching. Mr. Balfour, an aged
minister of the denomination, held a private
service in the parlour, and " prayed for our
child, that he may be the Lord's." This was
the opening act of that "dedication" which
was never henceforward forgotten, and of
which the following pages will endeavour to
describe the results. Around my tender and
unconscious spirit was flung the luminous web,
the light and elastic but impermeable veil,
which it was hoped would keep me " unspotted
from the world."
Until this time my Father's mother had
lived in the house and taken the domestic
charges of it on her own shoulders. She now
consented to leave us to ourselves. There is
no question that her exodus was a relief to
my Mother, since my paternal grandmother
was a strong and masterful woman, buxom,
choleric and practical, for whom the interests
of the mind did not exist. Her daughter-inlaw, gentle as she was, and ethereal in manner
and appearance-strangely contrasted (no
8
FATHER AND SON
doubt), in her tinctures of gold hair and white
skin, with my grandmother's bold carnations
and black tresses-was yet possessed of a will
like tempered steel. They were better friends
apart, with my Grandmother lodged hard by,
in a bright room, her household gods and
bits of excellent eighteenth-century furniture
around her, her miniatures and sparkling china
arranged on shelves.
Left to my Mother's sole care, I became the
centre of her solicitude. But there mingled
with those happy animal instincts which
sustain the strength and patience of every
human mother, and were fully present with
her-there mingled with these certain spiritual
determinations which can be but rare. They
are, in their outline, I suppose, vaguely
common to many religious mothers, but there
are few indeed who fill up the sketch with so
firm a detail as she did. Once again I am
indebted to her secret notes, in a little
locked volume, seen until now, nearly sixty
years later, by no eye save her own. Thus
she wrote when I was two months old:
" We have given him to the Lord; and we
trust that He will really manifest him to be
His own, if he grow up; and if the Lord take
9
FATHER AND SON
him early, we will not doubt that he is taken
to Himself Only, if it please the Lord to
take him, I do trust we may be spared seeing
him suffering in lingering illness and much pain.
But in this as in all things His will is better
than what we can choose. Whether his life
be prolonged or not, it has already been a
blessing to us, and to the saints, in leading us to
much prayer, and bringing us into varied need
and some trial."
The last sentence is somewhat obscure to
me. How, at that tender age, I contrived to
be a blessing "to the saints" may surprise
others and puzzles myself. But " the saints "
was the habitual term by which were indicated
the friends who met on Sunday mornings for
Holy Communion, and at many other times
in the week for prayer and discussion of
the Scriptures, in the small hired hall at
Hackney, which my parents attended. I
suppose that the solemn dedication of me to
the Lord, which was repeated in public in my
Mother's arms, being by no means a usual or
familiar ceremony even among the Brethren,
created a certain curiosity and fervour in the
immediate services, or was imagined so to do
by the fond, partial heart of my Mother.
10
FATHER AND SON
She, however, who had been so much isolated,
now made the care of her child an excuse for
retiring still further into silence. With those
religious persons who met at the Room, as the
modest chapel was called, she had little
spiritual and no intellectual sympathy. She
noted:
"I do not think it would increase my
happiness to be in the midst of the saints at
Hackney. I have made up my mind to give
myself up to Baby for the winter, and to accept
no invitations. To go when I can to the
Sunday morning meetings and to see my own
Mother."
The monotony of her existence now became
extreme, but she seems to have been happy.
Her days were spent in taking care of me, and
in directing one young servant. My Father
was for ever in his study, writing, drawing,
dissecting; sitting, no doubt, as I grew afterwards accustomed to see him, absolutely
motionless, with his eye glued to the microscope, for twenty minutes at a time. So the
greater part of every week-day was spent, and
on Sunday he usually preached one, and sometimes two extempore sermons. His work-day
11
FATHER AND SON
labours were rewarded by the praise of the
learned world, to which he was indifferent, but
by very little money, which he needed more.
For over three years after their marriage,
neither of my parents left London for a single
day, not being able to afford to travel. They
received scarcely any visitors, never ate a meal
away from home, never spent an evening
in social intercourse abroad. At night they
discussed theology, read aloud to one another,
or translated scientific brochures from French
or German. It sounds a terrible life of pressure and deprivation, and that it was physically
unwholesome there can be no shadow of a
doubt. But their contentment was complete
and unfeigned. In the midst of this, materially,
the hardest moment of their lives, when I was
one year old, and there was a question of our
leaving London, my Mother recorded in her
secret notes
" We are happy and contented, having all
things needful and pleasant, and our present
habitation is hallowed by many sweet associa
tions. We have our house to ourselves and
enjoy each other's society. If we move we
shall no longer be alone. The situation may be
more favourable, however, for Baby, as being
12
FATHER AND SON
more in the country. I desire to have no
choice in the matter, but as I know not what
would be for our good, and God knows, so I
desire to leave it with Him, and if it is not
His will we should move, He will raise objections and difficulties, and if it is His will He
will make Henry [my Father] desirous and
anxious to take the step, and then, whatever
the result, let us leave all to Him and not
regret it."
No one who is acquainted with the human
heart will mistake this attitude of resignation
for weakness of purpose. It was not poverty of
will, it was abnegation, it was a voluntary act.
My Mother, underneath an exquisite amenity
of manner, concealed a rigour of spirit which
took the form of a constant self-denial. For it
to dawn upon her consciousness that she wished
for something, was definitely to renounce that
wish, or, more exactly, to subject it in every
thing to what she conceived to be the will of
God.
This is perhaps the right moment for me to
say that at this time, and indeed until the hour
of her death, she exercised, without suspecting
it, a magnetic power over the will and nature
of my Father. Both were strong, but my
13
FATHER AND SON
Mother was unquestionably the stronger of the
two; it was her mind which gradually drew his
to take up a certain definite position, and this remained permanent although she, the cause of it,
was early removed. Hence,while it waswith my
Father that the long struggle which I have to
narrate took place, behind my Father stood the
ethereal memory of my Mother's will, guiding
him, pressing him, holding him to the unswerving purpose which she had formed and defined.
And when the inevitable disruption came,
what was unspeakably painful was to realise
that it was not from one, but from both parents
that the purpose of the child was separated.
My Mother was a Puritan in grain, and
never a word escaped her, not a phrase exists
in her diary, to suggest that she had any
privations to put up with. She seemed strong
and well, and so did I; the one of us who
broke down was my Father. With his attack
of acute nervous dyspepsia came an unexpected
small accession of money, and we were able, in
my third year, to take a holiday of nearly ten
months in Devonshire. The extreme seclusion,
the unbroken strain, were never repeated, and
when we returned to London, it was to conditions of greater amenity and to a less rigid
practice of " the world forgetting by the world
14
FATHER AND SON
forgot." That this relaxation was more relative than positive, and that nothing ever really
tempted either of my parents from their cavern
in an intellectual Thebaid, my recollections
will amply prove. But each of them was
forced by circumstances into a more or less
public position, and neither could any longer
quite ignore the world around.
It is not my business here to re-write the
biographies of my parents. Each of them became, in a certain measure, celebrated, and
each was the subject of a good deal of contemporary discussion. Each was prominent before
the eyes of a public of his or her own, half a
century ago. It is because their minds were
vigorous and their accomplishments distinguished that the contrast between their spiritual point of view and the aspect of a similar
class of persons to-day is interesting and may,
I hope, be instructive. But this is not another
memoir of public individuals, each of whom
has had more than one biographer. My serious
duty, as I venture to hold it, is other;
that's the world's side,
Thus men saw them, praised them, thought they knew
them!
There, in turn, I stood aside and praised them!
Out of my own self, I dare to phrase it.
15
FATHER AND SON
But this is a different inspection, this is a
study of
the other side, the novel
Silent silver lights and darks undreamed of,
the record of a state of soul once not uncommon in Protestant Europe, of which my
parents were perhaps the latest consistent exemplars among people of light and leading.
The peculiarities of a family life, founded
upon such principles, are, in relation to a little
child, obvious; but I may be permitted to recapitulate them. Here was perfect purity,
perfect intrepidity, perfect abnegation; yet
there was also narrowness, isolation, an absence
of perspective, let it be boldly admitted, an
absence of humanity. And there was a
curious mixture of humbleness and arrogance;
entire resignation to the will of God and not
less entire disdain of the judgment and
opinion of man. My parents founded every
action, every attitude, upon their interpretation
of the Scriptures, and upon the guidance of
the Divine Will as revealed to them by direct
answer to prayer. Their ejaculation in the
face of any dilemma was, "Let us cast it before
the Lord!"
So confident were they of the reality of their
intercourse with God, that they asked for no
16
FATHER AND SON
other guide. They recognised no spiritual
authority among men, they subjected themselves to no priest or minister, they troubled
their consciences about no current manifestation of " religious opinion." They lived in an
intellectual cell, bounded at its sides by the
walls of their own house, but open above to
the very heart of the uttermost heavens.
This, then, was the scene in which the soul
of a little child was planted, not as in an
ordinary open flower-border or carefully tended
social parterre, but as on a ledge, split in the
granite of some mountain. The ledge was
hung between night and the snows on one
hand, and the dizzy depths of the world upon
the other; was furnished with just soil enough
for a gentian to struggle skywards and open
its stiff azure stars; and offered no lodgment,
no hope of salvation, to any rootlet which
should stray beyond its inexorable limits.
17
B.
CHAPTER II
OUT of the darkness of my infancy there comes
only one flash of memory. I am seated alone,
in my baby-chair, at a dinner-table set for
several people. Somebody brings in a leg of
mutton, puts it down close to me, and goes out.
I am again alone, gazing at two low windows,
wide open upon a garden. Suddenly, noiselessly, a large, long animal (obviously a greyhound) appears at one window-sill, slips into
the room, seizes the leg of mutton and slips
out again. When this happened I could not
yet talk. The accomplishment of speech came
to me very late, doubtless because I never
heard young voices. Many years later, when
I mentioned this recollection, there was a shout
of laughter and surprise:
"That, then, was what became of the
mutton! It was not you, who, as your Uncle
A. pretended, ate it up, in the twinkling of an
eye, bone and all!"
18
FATHER AND SON
1 suppose that it was the startling intensity
of this incident which stamped it upon a
memory from which all other impressions of
this early date have vanished.
The adventure of the leg of mutton occurred,
evidently, at the house of my Mother's
brothers, for my parents, at this date, visited
no other. My uncles were not religious men,
but they had an almost filial respect for my
Mother, who was several years senior to the
elder of them. When the catastrophe of my
Grandfather's fortune had occurred, they had
not yet left school. My Mother, in spite of
an extreme dislike of teaching, which was
native to her, immediately accepted the situation of a governess in the family of an Irish
nobleman. The mansion was only to be
approached, as Miss Edgeworth would have
said, "through eighteen sloughs, at the
imminent peril of one's life," and when one had
reached it, the mixture of opulence and squalour, of civility and savagery, was unspeakable.
But my Mother was well paid, and she stayed
in this distasteful environment, doing the work
she hated most, while with the margin of her
salary she helped first one of her brothers and
then the other through his Cambridge course.
They studied hard and did well at the uni19
FATHER AND SON
versity. At length their sister received, in her
ultimna Thule, news that her younger brother
had taken his degree, and then and there, with
a sigh of intense relief, she resigned her situation and came straight back to England.
It is not to be wondered at, then that my
uncles looked up to their sister with feelings of
especial devotion. They were not inclined,
they were hardly in a position, to criticise her
modes of thought. They were easy-going, cultured and kindly gentlemen, rather limited in
their views, without a trace of their sister's
force of intellect or her strenuous temper. E.
resembled her in person; he was tall, fair, with
auburn curls; he cultivated a certain tendency
to the Byronic type, fatal and melancholy. A.
was short, brown and jocose, with a pretension
to common sense; bluff and chatty. As a
little child, I adored my Uncle E., who sat
silent by the fireside, holding me against his
knee, saying nothing, but looking unutterably
sad, and occasionallyshakinghis warm-coloured
tresses. With great injustice, on the other
hand, I detested my Uncle A., because he used
to joke in a manner very displeasing to me, and
because he would so far forget himself as to
chase, and even, if it will be credited, to tickle
me. My uncles, who remained bachelors to
20
\Y
FATHER AND SON
the end of their lives, earned a comfortable
living, E. by teaching, A. as "something in
the City," and they rented an old rambling
house in Clapton, that same in which I saw
the greyhound.: Their house had a strange,
delicious smell, so unlike anything I smelt
anywhere else, that it used to fill my eyes with
tears of mysterious pleasure. I know now
that this was the odour of cigars, tobacco being
a species of incense tabooed at home on the
highest religious grounds.
It has been recorded that I was slow in
learning to speak. I used to be told that
having met all invitations to repeat such
words as " Papa "and " Mamma " with gravity
and indifference, I one day drew towards me
a volume, and said " book" with startling
distinctness. I was not at all precocious, but
at a rather early age, I think towards the
beginning of my fourth year, I learned to
read. I cannot recollect a time when a
printed page of English was closed to me. Vt
But perhaps earlier still my Mother used to
repeat to me a poem which I have always
f taken for granted that she had herself composed, a poem which had a romantic place in
my early mental history. It ran thus, I
think:
21
FATHER AND SON

0 pretty Moon, you shine so bright!

I'll go to bid Mamma good-night,

And then I'll lie upon my bed

A nd watch you move above my head.

Ah! there, a cloud has hidden you!

But I can see your light shine thro'!

It tries to hide you-quite in vain,

For-there you quickly come again!

It's God, I know, that makes you shine

Upon this little bed of mine;

But I shall all about you know

When I can read and older grow.

Long, long after the last line had become

an anachronism, I used to shout this poem

from my bed before I went to sleep, whether

the night happened to be moon-lit or no.

It must have been my Father who taught

me my letters. To my Mother, as I have

said, it was distasteful to teach, though she

was so prompt and skilful to learn.     My

Father, on the contrary, taught cheerfully,

by fits and starts. In particular, he had

a scheme for rationalising geography, which I

think was admirable. I was to climb upon a

chair, while, standing at my side, with a pencil

and a sheet of paper, he was to draw a chart

of the markings on the carpet. Then, when I

understood the system, another chart on a

Z2
FATHER AND SON
smaller scale of the furniture in the room,
then of a floor of the house, then of the backgarden, then of a section of the street. The
result of this was that geography came to me
of itself, as a perfectly natural miniature
arrangement of objects, and to this day has
always been the science which gives me least
difficulty. My Father also taught me the
simple rules of arithmetic, a little natural
history, and the elements of drawing; and he
laboured long and unsuccessfully to make me
learn by heart hymns, psalms and chapters of
Scripture, in which I always failed ignominiously and with tears. This puzzled and vexed
him, for he himself had an extremely retentive
textual memory. He could not help thinking /
that I was naughty, and would not learn thej
chapters, until at last he gave up the effort.
All this sketch of an education began, I believe,
in my fourth year, and was not advanced or
modified during the rest of my Mother's life.
Meanwhile, capable as I was of reading, I
found my greatest pleasure in the pages of
books. The range of these was limited, for
story-books of every description were sternly
excluded. No fiction of any kind, religious
or secular, was admitted into the house. In
this it was to my Mother, not to my Father,
23
FATHER AND SON
that the prohibition was due. She had a
remarkable, I confess to me still somewhat
unaccountable impression, that to " tell a
story," that is, to compose fictitious narrative
of any kind, was a sin. She carried this conviction to extreme lengths. My Father, in
later years, gave me some interesting examples
of her firmness. As a young man in America,
he had been deeply impressed by " Salathiel,"
a pious prose romance of that then popular
writer, the Rev. George Croly. When he
first met my Mother, he recommended it to
her, but she would not consent to open it.
Nor would she read the chivalrous tales in
verse of Sir Walter Scott, obstinately alleging
that they were not "true." She would read:
none but lyrical and subjective poetry. Her
secret diary reveals the history of this singular
aversion to the fictitious, although it cannot be
said to explain the cause of it. As a child, however, she had possessed a passion for making
up stories, and so considerable a skill in it that
she was constantly being begged to indulge
others with its exercise. But I will, on so
curious a point, leave her to speak for
herself:
"When I was a very little child, I used to
24
FATHER AND SON
amuse myself and my brothers with inventing
stories, such as I read. Having, as I suppose,
naturally a restless mind and busy imagination,
this soon became the chief pleasure of my life.
Unfortunately, my brothers were always fond
of encouraging this propensity, and I found in
Taylor, my maid, a still greater tempter. I
had not known there was any harm in it, until
Miss Shore [a Calvinist governess], finding it
out, lectured me severely, and told me it was
wicked. From that time forth I considered
that to invent a story of any kind was a sin.
But the desire to do so was too deeply rooted
in my affections to be resisted in my own
strength [she was at that time nine years of
age], and unfortunately I knew neither my
corruption nor my weakness, nor did I know
where to gain strength. The longing to
invent stories grew with violence; everything
I heard or read became food for my distemper.
The simplicity of truth was not sufficient for
me; I must needs embroider imagination upon
it, and the folly, vanity and wickedness which
disgraced my heart are more than I am able
to express. Even now [at the age of twentynine], tho' watched, prayed and striven against,
this is still the sin that most easily besets me.
It has hindered my prayers and prevented my
25
FATHER AND SON
improvement, and therefore has humbled me
very much."
This is, surely, a very painful instance of the
repression of an instinct. There seems to have
been, in this case, a vocation such as is rarely
heard, and still less often wilfully disregarded
and silenced. Was my Mother intended by
nature to be a novelist? I have often thought
so, and her talents and vigour of purpose,
directed along the line which was ready to
form "the chief pleasure of her life," could
hardly have failed to conduct her to great
success. She was a little younger than Bulwer
Lytton, a little older than Mrs. Gaskell,-but
these are vain and trivial speculations!
My own state, however, was, I should think,
almost unique among the children of cultivated
parents. In consequence of the stern ordinance
which I have described, not a single fiction
was read or told to me during my infancy.
The rapture of the child who delays the
process of going to bed by cajoling " a story
out of his mother or his nurse, as he sits upon
her knee, well tucked up, at the corner of the
nursery fire,-this was unknown to me.
Never, in all my early childhood, did any one
address to me the affecting preamble, " Once
upon a time!" I was told about missionaries,
26
FATHER AND SON
but never about pirates; I was familiar with
humming-birds, but I had never heard of
fairies. Jack the Giant-Killer, Rumpelstiltskin
and Robin Hood were not of my acquaintance,
and though I understood about wolves, Little
Red Ridinghood was a stranger even by name.
So far as my " dedication" was concerned, I
can but think that my parents were in error
thus to exclude the imaginary from my
outlook upon facts. They desired to make
me truthful; the tendency was to make me
positive and sceptical. Had they wrapped me
in the soft folds of supernatural fancy, my
mind might have been longer content to follow
their traditions in an unquestioning spirit.
Having easily said what, in those early years,
I did not read, I have great difficulty in saying
what I did read. But a queer variety of
natural history, some of it quite indigestible
by my undeveloped mind; many books of
travels, mainly of a scientific character, among
them voyages of discovery in the South Seas,
by which my brain was dimly filled with
splendour; some geography and astronomy,
both of them sincerely enjoyed; much
theology, which I desired to appreciate but
could never get my teeth into (if I may venture
to say so), and over which my eye and tongue
97
FATHER AND SON
learned to slip without penetrating, so that I
would read, and read aloud, and with great
propriety of emphasis, page after page without
having formed an idea or retained an expression.
There was, for instance, a writer on prophecy
called Jukes, of whose works each of my
parents was inordinately fond, and I was early
set to read Jukes aloud to them. I did it
glibly, like a machine, but the sight of Jukes's
volumes became an abomination to me, and I
never formed the outline of a notion what
they were about. Later on, a publication
called "The Penny Cyclopedia" became my
daily, and for a long time almost my sole
study; to the subject of this remarkable work
I may presently return.
It is difficult to keep anything like chronological order in recording fragments of early
recollection, and in speaking of my reading I
have been led too far ahead. My memory
does not, practically, begin till we returned
from certain visits, made with a zoological
purpose, to the shores of Devon and Dorset,
and settled, early in my fifth year, in a house
at Islington, in the north of London. Our
circumstances were now more easy; my Father
had regular and well-paid literary 'work; and
the house was larger and more comfortable
28
FATHER AND SON
than ever before, though still very simple and
restricted. My memories, some of which are
exactly dated by certain facts, now become
clear and almost abundant. What I do not
remember, except from having it very often
repeated to me, is what may be considered the
only 'clever" thing that I said during an
otherwise unillustrious childhood. It was not
startlingly "clever," but it may pass. A lady
-when I was just four-rather injudiciously
showed me a large print of a human skeleton,
saying "There! you don't know what that is,
do you?" Upon which, immediately and very
archly, I replied, " Isn't it a man with the meat
off? " This was thought wonderful, and, as it
is supposed that I had never had the phenomenon explained to me, it certainly displays
some quickness in seizing an analogy. I had
often watched my Father, while he soaked the
flesh off the bones of fishes and small mammals.
If I venture to repeat this trifle, it is only to
point out that the system on which I was being
educated deprived all things, human life among
the rest, of their mystery. The " bare-grinning
skeleton of death " was to me merely a prepared specimen of that featherless plantigrade
vertebrate, homo sapiens.
As I have said that this anecdote was thought
29
FATHER AND SON
worth repeating, I ought to proceed to say
that there was, so far as I can recollect, none
of that flattery of childhood which is so often
merely a backhanded way of indulging the
vanity of parents. My Mother, indeed, would
hardly have been human if she had not occasionally entertained herself with the delusion
that her solitary duckling was a cygnet. This
my Father did not encourage, remarking, with
great affection, and chucking me under the
chin, that I was " a nice little ordinary boy."
My Mother, stung by this want of appreciation,
would proceed so far as to declare that she
believed that in future times the F.R.S. would
be chiefly known as his son's father! (This is
a pleasantry frequent in professional families.)
To this my Father, whether convinced or
not, would make no demur, and the couple)
would begin to discuss, in my presence, the?
direction which my shining talents would take. -
In consequence of my dedication to "'the
Lord's Service," the range of possibilities was
much restricted. My Father, who had lived
long in the Tropics, and who nursed a perpetual nostalgia for " the little lazy isles where
the trumpet-orchids blow," leaned towards
the field of missionary labour. My Mother,
who was cold about foreign missions, preferred
so
FATHER AND SON
to believe that I should be the Charles Wesleyof my age, " or perhaps," she had the candour
to admit, " merely the George Whitefield." I
cannot recollect the time when I did notJ.
understand that I was going to be a minister
of the Gospel.
It is so generally taken for granted that a
life strictly dedicated to religion is stiff and
dreary, that I may have some difficulty in
persuading my readers that, as a matter of fact,
in these early days of my childhood, before
disease and death had penetrated to our
slender society, we were always cheerful and
often gay. My parents were playful with one
another, and there were certain stock family
jests which seldom failed to enliven the breakfast table. My Father and Mother lived so
completely in the atmosphere of faith, and
were so utterly convinced of their intercourse
with God, that, so long as that intercourse
was not clouded by sin, to which they were.delicately sensitive, they could afford to take
the passing hour very lightly. They would
even, to a certain extent, treat the surroundings of their religion as a subject ofjest, joking
very mildly and gently about such things as
an attitude at prayer or the nature of a supplication. They were absolutely indifferent to
31
FATHER AND SON
forms. They prayed, seated in their chairs, as
willingly as, reversed, upon their knees; no
ritual having any significance for them. My
Mother was sometimes extremely gay, laughing with a soft, merry sound. What I have
since been told of the guileless mirth of nuns
in a convent has reminded me of the gaiety of
my parents during my early childhood.
So long as I was a mere part of them,
without individual existence, and swept on,
a satellite, in their atmosphere, I was mirthful
when they were mirthful, and grave when
they were grave. The mere fact that I had"e
no young companions, no story books, no
outdoor amusements, none of the thousand
and one employments provided for other
children in more conventional surroundings,
did not make me discontented or fretful, because I did not know of the existence of
such entertainments. In exchange, I became
keenly attentive to the limited circle of interests open to me. Oddly enough, I have no
recollection of any curiosity about other children, nor of any desire to speak to them or
play with them. They did not enter into my
dreams, which were occupied entirely with
grown-up people and animals. I had three..f
dolls, to whom my attitude was not very
32
i.
FATHER AND SON
intelligible. Two of these were female, one
with a shapeless face of rags, the other in wax.
But, in my fifth year, when the Crimean War
broke out, I was given a third doll, a soldier,
dressed very smartly in a scarlet cloth tunic.
I used to put the dolls on three chairs, and
harangue them aloud, but my sentiment to
them was never confidential, until our maidservant one day, intruding on my audience,
and misunderstanding the occasion of it, said:
"What? a boy, and playing with a soldier
when he's got two lady-dolls to play with?"
I had never thought of my dolls as confidants
before, but from that time forth I paid a
special attention to the soldier, in order to
make up to him for Lizzie's unwarrantable
insult.
The declaration of war with Russia brought
the first breath of outside life into our Calvinist cloister. My parents took in a daily
newspaper, which they had never done before,
and events in picturesque places, which my
Father and I looked out on the map, were
eagerly discussed. One of my vividest early
memories can be dated exactly. I was playing about the house, and suddenly burst into
the breakfast-room, where, close to the door,
sat an amazing figure, a very tall young man,
33
C
FATHER AND SON
as stiff as my doll, in a gorgeous scarlet tunic.
Quite far away from him, at her writing-table,
my Mother sat with her Bible open before her,
and was urging the gospel plan of salvation on
his acceptance. She promptly told me to run
awayand play, but I had seen a great sight. This
guardsman was in the act of leaving for the
Crimea, and his adventures,-he was converted
in consequence of my Mother's instruction,were afterwards told by her in a tract, called
"The Guardsman of the Alma," of which I
believe that more than half a million of copies
were circulated. He was killed in that battle,
and this added an extraordinary lustre to my
dream of him. I see him still in my mind's eye,
large, stiff, and unspeakably brilliant, seated,
from respect, as near as possible to our parlour
door. This apparition gave reality to my subsequent conversations with the soldier doll.
That same victory of the Alma, which was
reported in London on my fifth birthday, is
also marked very clearly in my memory by a
family circumstance. We were seated at
breakfast, at our small round table drawn close
up to the window, my Father with his back to
the light. Suddenly, he gave a sort of cry,
and read out the opening sentences from the
Times announcing a battle in the valley
34
FATHER AND SON
of the Alma. No doubt the strain of national
anxiety had been very great, for both he and
my Mother seemed deeply excited. He broke
off his reading when the fact of the decisive
victory was assured, and he and my Mother
sank simultaneously on their knees in front of
their tea and bread-and-butter, while in a loud
voice my Father gave thanks to the God of
Battles. This patriotism was the more remarkable, in that he had schooled himself, as
he believed, to put his "heavenly citizenship "
above all earthly duties. To those who said:
" Because you are a Christian, surely you are
not less an Englishman?" he would reply by
shaking his head, and by saying: "I am a
citizen of no earthly State." He did not realise that, in reality, and to use a cant phrase
not yet coined in 1854, there existed in Great
Britain no more thorough "Jingo " than he.
Another instance of the remarkable way in
which the interests of daily life were mingled,
in our strange household, with the practice of
religion, made an impression upon my memory.
We had all three been much excited by a report that a certain dark geometer-moth, generated in underground stables, had been met
with in Islington. Its name, 1 think is Boletobia fuliginaria, and I believe that it is
35
FATHER AND SON
excessively rare in England. We were sitting1
at family prayers, on a summer morning, I
think in 1855, when through the open window
a brown moth came sailing. My Mother
immediately interrupted the reading of the
Bible by saying to my Father, "0! Henry,
do you think that can be Boletobia?c" My
Father rose up from the sacred book, examined
the insect, which had now perched, and replied:
"No! it is only the common Vapourer, Orgygia
antique!", resuming his seat, and the exposition of the Word, without any apology or
embarrassment.
In the course of this, my sixth year, there
happened a series of minute and soundless
incidents which, elementary as they may seem
when told, were second in real importance to
none in my mental history. The recollection
of them confirms me in the opinion that
certain leading features in each human soul
are inherent to it, and cannot be accounted for
by suggestion or training, In my own case,
I was most carefully withdrawn, like Princess
Blanchefleur in her marble fortress, from every
outside influence whatever, yet to me the
instinctive life came as unexpectedly as her
lover came to her in the basket of roses.
What came to me was the consciousness of
FATHER AND SON
self, as a force and as a companion, and it came
as the result of one or two shocks, which I will
relate.
In consequence of hearing so much about an
Omniscient God, a being of supernatural wisdom and penetration who was always with us,
who made, in fact, a fourth in our company, I
had come to think of Him, not without awe,
but with absolute confidence. My Father and
Mother, in their serene discipline of me, never
argued with one another, never even differed;
their wills seemed absolutely one. My Mother
always deferred to my Father, and in his ab-t
sence spoke of him to me, as if he were all-wise.
I confused him in some sense with God; at all
events I believed that my Father knew everything and saw everything. One morning in
my sixth year, my Mother and I were alone
in the morning-room, when my Father came in
and announced some fact to us. I was standing
on the rug, gazing at him, and when he made
this statement, I remember turning quickly,
in embarrassment, and looking into the fire.
t\The shock to me was as that of a thunderbolt,
for what my Father had said was not true. My
Mother and I, who had been present at the X
trifling incident, were aware that it had not
happened exactly as it had been reported to
37
FATHER AND SON
him. My Mother gently told him so, and he
accepted the correction, Nothing could
possibly have been more trifling to my parents,
but to me it meant an epoch. Here was the
appalling discovery, never suspected before,
that my Father was not as God, and did not I
know everything. The shock was not caused
by any suspicion that he was not telling the
truth, as it appeared to him, but by the awful
proof that he was not, as I had supposed,
omniscient.
This experience was followed by another,
which confirmed the first, but carried me a
great deal further. In our little back-garden,
my Father had built up a rockery for ferns
and mosses, and from the water-supply of the
house he had drawn a leaden pipe so that it
pierced upwards through the rockery and
produced, when a tap was turned, a pretty
silvery parasol of water. The pipe was
exposed somewhere near the foot of the
rockery. One day, two workmen, who were
doing some repairs, left their tools during the
dinner-hour in the back-garden, and as I was
marching about I suddenly thought that to
see whether one of these tools could make a
hole in the pipe would be attractive. It did
make such a hole, quite easily, and then the
S8
FATHER AND SON
matter escaped my mind. But a day or two
afterwards, when my Father came in to dinner,
he was very angry. He had turned the tap,
and instead of the fountain arching at the
summit, there had been a rush of water
through a hole at the foot. The rockery was
absolutely ruined.
Of course I realised in a moment what I
had done, and I sat frozen with alarm, waiting
to be denounced. But my Mother remarked
on the visit of the plumbers two or three days
before, and my Father instantly took up the
suggestion. No doubt that was it; the
mischievous fellows had thought it amusing
to stab the pipe and spoil the fountain. No
suspicion fell on me; no question was asked
of me. I sat there, turned to stone within,
but outwardly sympathetic and with unchecked appetite.
We attribute, I believe, too many moral
ideas to little children. It is obvious that in
this tremendous juncture, I ought to have
been urged forward by good instincts, or held
back by naughty ones. But 1 am sure that the
fear which I experienced for a short time, and
which so unexpectedly melted away, was a
purely physical one. It had nothing to do
with the motions of a contrite heart. As to
39
FATHER AND SON
the destruction of the fountain, I was sorry
about that, for my own sake, since I admired
the skipping water extremely, and had had no
idea that I was spoiling its display. But the
emotions which now thronged within me, and
which led me with an almost unwise alacrity,
to seek solitude in the back-garden, were not
moral at all, they were intellectual. I was
not ashamed of having successfully-and so
surprisingly-deceived my parents by my
crafty silence,; I looked upon that as a
providential escape, and dismissed all further
thought of it. I had other things to think of.
In the first place, the theory that my Father
was oin-risc-ient or infallible was now dead arid
buried, lie probably knew very little; in this
case he had not known a fact of such importance that if you did not know that, it
could hardly matter what you knew. My
Father, as a deity, as a natural force of
immense prestige, fell in my eyes to a human
level. In future, his statements about things
in general need not be accepted implicitly.
But of all the thoughts which rushed upon my
savage and undeveloped little brain at this
crisis, the most curious was that I had found
a companion and a confidant in myself."
There was a secret in this world and it
40
FATHER AND SON
belonged to me and to a somebody who lived
in the same body with me. There were two
of us, and we could talk with one another. It
is difficult to define impressions so rudimentary, but it is certain that it was in this
dual form that the sense of my individuality
now suddenly descended upon me, and it is
equally certain that it was a great solace to, me
to find a sympathiser in my own breast.
About this time, my Mother, carried away
by the current of her literary and her philanthropic work, left me more and more to my
own devices. She was seized with a great
enthusiasm; as one of her admirers and
disciples has written, " she went on her way,
sowing beside all waters." I would not for
a moment let it be supposed that I regard
her as a Mrs. Jellyby, or that I think she
neglected me. But a remarkable work had
opened up before her; after her long years in a
mental hermitage, she was drawn forth into the
clamorous harvest-field of souls. She developed
an unexpected gift of persuasion over strangers
whom she met in the omnibus or in the train,
and with whom she courageouslygrappled. This
began by her noting, with deep humility and
joy, that " I have reason to judge the sound
conversion to God of three young persons
41
FATHER AND SON
within a few weeks, by the instrumentality of
my conversations with them." At the same time,
as another of her biographers has said, " those
testimonies to the Blood of Christ, the fruits
of her pen, began to be spread very widely,
even to the most distant parts of the globe."
My Father, too, was at this time at the height
of his activity. After breakfast, each of them
was amply occupied, perhaps until night-fall;
our evenings we still always spent together.
Sometimes my Mother took me with her on
her '"unknown day's employ"; I recollect
pleasant rambles through the City by her side,
and the act of looking up at her figure soaring
above me. But when all was done, I had
hours and hours of complete solitude, in my
Father's study, in the back-garden, above all in
the garret.
The garret was a fairy place. It was a low
lean-to, lighted from the roof. It was wholly
unfurnished, except for two objects, an ancient
hat-box and a still more ancient skin-trunk.
The hat-box puzzled me extremely, till one
day, asking my Father what it was, I got a
distracted answer which led me to believe that
it was itself a sort of hat, and I made a
laborious but repeated effort to wear it. The
skin-trunk was absolutely empty, but the
42
FATHER AND SON
inside of the lid of it was lined with sheets of
what 1 now know to have been a sensational
novel. It was, of course, a fragment, but I
read it, kneeling on the bare floor, with indescribable rapture. It will be recollected that
the idea of fiction, of a deliberately invented
story, had been kept from me with entire
success. I therefore implicitly believed the
tale in the lid of the trunk to be a true
account of the sorrows of a lady of title, who
had to flee the country, and who was pursued
into foreign lands by enemies bent upon her
ruin. Somebody had an interview with a
minion" in a "mask "; I went downstairs
and looked up these words in Bailey's " English
Dictionary," but was left in darkness as to
what they had to do with the lady of title.
This ridiculous fragment filled me with
delicious fears; I fancied that my Mother,
who was out so much, might be threatened by
dangers of the same sort; and the fact that
the narrative came abruptly to an end, in the
middle of one of its most thrilling sentences,
wound me up almost to a disorder of wonder
and romance.
The preoccupation of my parents threw me
more and more upon my own resources. But
what are the resources of a solitary child of
43
FATHER AND SON
six? I was never inclined to make friends
with servants, nor did our successive maids
proffer, so far as I recollect, any advances.
Perhaps, with my "dedication" and my
grown-up ways of talking, I did not seem to
them at all an attractive little boy. I continued to have no companions, or even
acquaintances of my own age. I am unable to
recollect exchanging two words with another
child till after my Mother's death.
The abundant energy which my Mother now
threw into her public work did not affect the
quietude of our private life. We had some
visitors in the day-time, people who came to
consult one parent or the other. But they
never stayed to a meal, and we never returned
their visits. I do not quite know how it was
that neither of my parents took me to any of
the sights of London, although I am sure it
was a question of principle with them. Notwithstanding all our study of natural history,
I was never introduced to live wild beasts at
the Zoo, nor to dead ones at the British
Museum. I can understand better why we
never visited a picture-gallery or a concertroom. So far as I can recollect, the only
time I was ever taken to any place of entertainment was when my Father and I paid
44
FATHER AND SON
a visit, long anticipated, to the Great Globe
in Leicester Square. This was a huge structure, the interior of which one ascended by
means of a spiral staircase. It was a poor
affair; that was concave in it which should
have been convex, and my imagination was
deeply affronted. I could invent a far better
Great Globe than that in my mind's eye in
the garret.
Being so restricted, then, and yet so active,
my mind took refuge in an infantile species of
natural magic. This contended with the
definite ideas of religion which my parents
were continuing, with too mechanical a persistency, to force into my nature, and it ran
parallel with them. I formed strange superstitions, which I can only render intelligible
by naming some concrete examples. I persuaded myself that, if I could only discover
the proper words to say or the proper passes
to make, I could induce the gorgeous birds
and butterflies in my Father's illustrated
manuals to come to life, and fly out of the
book, leaving holes behind them. I believed
that, when, at the Chapel, we sang, drearily
and slowly, loud 'hymns of experience and
humiliation, I could boom forth with a sound
- equal to that of dozens of singers, if I could
45
FATHER AND SON
only hit upon the formula. During morning
and evening prayers, which were extremely
lengthy and fatiguing, I fancied that one of
my two selves could flit up, and sit clinging to
the cornice, and look down on my other selt
and the rest of us, if I could only find the key.
I laboured for hours in search of these formulas,
thinking to compass my ends by means
absolutely irrational. For example, I was
convinced that if I could only count consecutive
numbers long enough, without losing one, I
should suddenly, on reaching some far-distant
figure, find myself in possession of the great
secret. I feel quite sure that nothing external
suggested these ideas of magic, and I think it
probable that they approached the ideas of
savages at a very early stage of development.
All this ferment of mind was entirely
unobserved by my parents. But when I
formed the belief that it was necessary, for
the success of my practical magic, that I
should hurt myself, and when, as a matter of
fact, I began, in extreme secrecy, to run pins x
into my flesh and bang my joints with books, \
no one will be surprised to hear that my
Mother's attention was drawn to the fact that
I was looking" delicate." The notice nowadays
universally given to the hygienic rules of life
46
FATHER AND SON
was rare fifty years ago, and among deeply
religious people, in particular, fatalistic views
of disease prevailed. If any one was ill, it
showed that " the Lord's hand was extended
in chastisement," and much prayer was poured
forth in order that it might be explained to
the sufferer, or to his relations, in what he or
they had sinned. People would, for instance,
go on living over a cess-pool, working themselves up into an agony to discover how they
had incurred the displeasure of the Lord, but
never moving away. As I became very pale
and nervous, and slept badly at nights, with
visions and loud screams in my sleep, I was
taken to a physician, who stripped me and
tapped me all over (this gave me some valuable
hints for my magical practices), but could find
nothing the matter. He recommended,whatever physicians in such cases always
recommend,-but nothing was done. If I
was feeble it was the Lord's Will, and we
must acquiesce.
It culminated in a sort of fit of hysterics,
when I lost all self-control, and sobbed with
tears, and banged my head on the table.
While this was proceeding, I was conscious of
that dual individuality of which I have already
spoken, since while one part of me gave way,
47
FATHER AND SON
and could not resist, the other part in some
extraordinary sense seemed standing aloof,
much impressed. I was alone with my Father
when this crisis suddenly occurred, and I was
interested to see that he was greatly alarmed.
It was a very long time since we had spent a
day out of London, and I said, on being
coaxed back to calmness, that I wanted " to. go into the country." Like the dying Falstaff,
I babbled of green fields. My Father, after a
little reflection, proposed to take me to
Primrose Hill. I had never heard of the place,
and names have always appealed directly to
my imagination. I was in the highest degree
delighted, and could hardly restrain my
impatience. As soon as possible we set forth
westward, my hand in my Father's, with the
liveliest anticipations. I expected to see a
mountain absolutely carpeted with primroses,
a terrestrial galaxy like that which covered
the hill that led up to Montgomery Castle in
Donne's poem. But at length, as we walked
from the Chalk Farm direction, a miserable
acclivity stole into view-surrounded, even in
those days, on most sides by houses, with its
grass worn to the buff by millions of boots,
and resembling what I meant by " the country"
i about as much as Poplar resembles Paradise.
48
FATHER AND SON
We sat down on a bench at its inglorious
summit, whereupon I burst into tears, and in
a heart-rending whisper sobbed, " Oh I Papa,
let us go home!"
This was the lachrymose epoch in a career
not otherwise given to weeping, for I must tell
one more tale of tears. About this time,-the
autumn of 1855,-my parents were disturbed
more than once in the twilight, after I had
been put to bed, by shrieks from my crib.
They would rush up to my side, and find me
in great distress, but would be unable to discover the cause of it. The fact was that I
was half beside myself with ghostly fears.
increased and pointed by the fact that there
had been some daring burglaries in our street.
Our servant-maid, who slept at the top of the
house, had seen, or thought she saw, upon a
moonlight night, the figure of a crouching man,
silhouetted against the sky, slip down from
the roof and leap into her room. She
screamed, and he fled away. Moreover, as if
this were not enough for my tender nerves,
A there had been committed a horrid murder, at
a baker's shop just round the corner in the
Caledonian Road, to which murder actuality
was given to us by the fact that my Mother
had been " just thinking" of getting her bread
49 D
FATHER AND SON
from this shop. Children, I think, were not
spared the details of these affairs fifty years
ago; at least, I was not, and my nerves were
a packet of spilikins.
But what made me scream o' nights, was
that when my Mother had tucked me up in
bed, and had heard me say my prayer, and
had prayed aloud on her knees at my side, and
had stolen downstairs, noises immediately
began in the room. There was a rustling of
clothes, and a slapping of hands, and a gurgling, and a sniffing, and a trotting. These
horrible muffled sounds would go on, and die
away, and be resumed; I would pray very
fervently to God to save me from my enemies;
and sometimes I would go to sleep. But on
other occasions, my faith and fortitude alike
gave way, and I screamed " Mama! Mama! "
Then would my parents come bounding up
the stairs, and comfort me, and kiss me, and
assure me it was nothing. And nothing it
was while they were there, but no sooner had
they gone than the ghostly riot recommenced.
It was at last discovered by my Mother that A
the whole mischief was due to a card of framed
texts, fastened by one nail to the wall; this did
nothing when the bed-room door was shut, but
when it was left open (in order that my parents
50
FATHER AND SON
might hear me call), the card began to gallop
in the draught, and made the most intolerablei \}
noises.
Several things tended at this time to alienate my conscience from the line which my
Father had so rigidly traced for it. The question of the efficacy of prayer, which has puzzled
wiser heads than mine was, began to trouble
me. It was insisted on in our household that
if anything was desired, you should not, as my
Mother said, " lose any time in seeking for it,
but ask God to guide you to it." In many
junctures of life, this is precisely what, in sober
fact, they did. I will not dwell here on their
theories, which my Mother put forth, with
unflinching directness, in her published writings. But I found that a difference was made
between my privileges in this matter and
theirs, and this led to many discussions. My
parents said: " hatever you need, tell Him
and He will grant it, if it is His will." Very
well; I had need of a large painted hummingtop which I had seen in a shop-window in the i
Caledonian Road. Accordingly, I introduced A- J/
a supplication for this object into my evening
prayer, carefully adding the words:" If it is
Thy will." This, I recollect, placed my Mother
in a dilemma, and she consulted my Father.
/ 51
FATHER AND SON
Taken, I suppose, at a disadvantage, my Father
told me I must not pray for "things like
that." To which I answered by another query,
"Why?" And I added that he said we
ought to pray for things we needed, and that
I needed the humming-top a great deal more
than I did the conversion of the heathen or
the restitution of Jerusalem to the Jews, two
objects of my nightly supplication which left
me very cold.
I have reason to believe, looking back upon
this scene, conducted by candle-light in the
front parlour, that my Mother was much
baffled by the logic of my argument. She
had gone so far as to say publicly that no
" things or circumstances are too insignificant
to bring before the God of the whole earth."
I persisted that this covered the case of the
humming-top, which was extremely significant
to me. I noticed that she held aloof from the
discussion, which was carried on with some
show of annoyance by my Father. He had
never gone quite so far as she did in regard
to this question of praying for material things.
I am not sure that she was convinced that I
ought to have been checked; but he could not
help seeing that it reduced their favourite
theory to an absurdity for a small child to
52
FATHER AND SON

exercise the privilege. He ceased to argue,

and told me peremptorily that it was not

right for me to pray for things like hummingtops, and that I must do it no more. His

authority, of course, was paramount, and I 11

yielded; but my faith in the efficacy of prayer 1

was a good deal shaken. The fatal suspicion

had crossed my mind that the reason why I

was not to pray for the top was because it was

too expensive for my parents to buy, that

being the usual excuse for not getting things

I wished for.   7I

It was about the date of my sixth birthday

that I did something very naughty, some act

of direct disobedience, for which my Father,

after a solemn sermon, chastised me, sacrificially, by giving me several cuts with a cane.

This action was justified, as everything he did

was justified, by reference to Scripture- " Spare

the rod and spoil the child." I suppose that

there are some children, of a sullen and lymphatic temperament, who are smartened up

and made more wide-awake by a whipping.

It is largely a matter of convention, the exercise

being endured (I am told) with pride by the K

infants of our aristocracy, but not tolerated by

the lower classes. I am afraid that I proved

my inherent vulgarity by being made, not

5~3
FATHER AND SON
contrite or humble, but furiously angry by this
caning. I cannot account for the flame of
rage which it awakened in my bosom. My
dear, excellent Father had beaten me, not very
severely, without ill-temper, and with the most
genuine desire to improve me. But he was
not well-advised, especially so far as the
" dedication to the Lord's service" was
concerned. This same "dedication" had
ministered to my vanity, and there are some
natures which are not improved by being
humiliated. I have to confess with shame
that I went about the house for some days
with a murderous hatred of my Father locked
within my bosom. He did not suspect that
the chastisement had not been wholly efficacious, and he bore me no malice; so that after
a while, I forgot and thus forgave him. But
I do not regard physical punishment as a wise
element in the education of proud and sensitive
children.
My theological misdeeds culminated, however, in an act so puerile and preposterous that
I should not venture to record it if it did not
throw some glimmering of light on the subject
which I have proposed to myself in writing
these pages. My mind continued to dwell on
the mysterious question of prayer. It puzzled
54
FATHER AND SON
me greatly to know why, if we were God's
children, and if he was watching over us by
night and day, we might not supplicate for
toys and sweets and smart clothes as well as
for the conversion of the heathen. Just at this
juncture, we had a special service at the Room,
at which our attention was particularly called
to what we always spoke of as " the field of
missionary labour.5' The East was represented
among " the saints " by an excellent Irish peer,
who had, in his early youth, converted and
married a lady of colour; this Asiatic sharedin our Sunday morning meetings, and was
an object of helpless terror to me; I shrank
from her amiable caresses, and vaguely identified her with a personage much spoken of in
our family circle, the 46 Personal Devil."
All these matters drew my thoughts to the
subject of idolatry, which was severely censured
at the missionary meeting. I cross-examined
my Father very closely as to the nature of
this sin, and pinned him down to the categorical statement that idolatry consisted in
praying to any one or anything but God
himself. Wood and stone, in the words of
the hymn, were peculiarly liable to be bowed
down to by the heathen in their blindness. I
pressed my Father further on this subject, and
55
FATHER AND SON
he assured me that God would be very angry,
and would signify his anger, if any one, in a
Christian country, bowed down to wood and
stone. I cannot recall why I was so pertinacious on this subject, but I remember that my
Father became a little restive under my crossexamination. I determined, however, to test
the matter for myself, and one morning, when
both my parents were safely out of the house,
I prepared for the great act of heresy. I was
in the morning-room on the ground-floor,
where, with much labour, I hoisted a small
chair on to the table close to the window. My
heart was now beating as if it would leap out
of my side, but I pursued my experiment. I
knelt down on the carpet in front of the table
and looking up I said my daily prayer in a loud
voice, only substituting the address " 0 Chair!"
for the habitual one.
Having carried this act of idolatry safely
through, I waited to see what would happen.
It was a fine day, and I gazed up at the slip of
white sky above the houses opposite, and expected something to appear in it. God would
certainly exhibit his anger in some terrible
form, and would chastise my impious and wilful action. I was very much alarmed, but still
more excited; I breathed the high, sharp air
56
FATHER AND SON
of defiance. But nothing happened; there
was not a cloud in the sky, not an unusual
sound in the street. Presently I was quite
sure that nothing would happen. I had cormmitted idolatry, flagrantly and deliberately,
and God did not care.
The result of this ridiculous act was not
to make me question the existence and
power of God; those were forces which I did
not dream of ignoring. But what it did was
to lessen still further my confidence in my
Father's knowledge of the Divine mind. My
Father had said, positively, that if I worshipped a thing made of wood, God would
manifest his anger. I had then worshipped a
chair, made (or partly made) of wood, and God
had made no sign whatever. My Father, therefore, was not really acquainted with the Divine
practice in cases of idolatry. And with that,
dismissing the subject, I dived again into the
unplumbed depths of the "Penny Cyclopeedia."
IN yA
2,, e,/., a
57
CHAPTER III
THAT I might die in my early childhood was
a thought which frequently recurred to the
mind of my Mother. She endeavoured, with
a Roman fortitude, to face it without apprehension. Soon after I had completed my
fifth year she had written as follows in her
secret journal:
" Should we be called on to weep over the
early grave of the dear one whom now we are
endeavouring to train for heaven, may we be
able to remember that we never ceased to pray
for and watch over him. It is easy, comparatively, to watch over an infant. Yet shall I
be sufficient for these things? I am not.
But God is sufficient. In his strength I have
begun the warfare, in his strength I will persevere, and I will faint not till either I myself
or my little one is beyond the reach of earthly
solicitude."
58
FATHER AND SON
That either she or I would be called away
from earth, and that our physical separation
was at hand, seems to have been always vaguely
present in my Mother's dreams, as an obstinate
conviction to be carefully recognised and
jealously guarded against.
It was not, however, until the course of my
seventh year, that the tragedy occurred, which
altered the whole course of our family existence. My Mother had hitherto seemed strong
and in good health'; she had even made the
remark to my Father, that " sorrow and pain,
the badges of Christian discipleship," appeared
to be withheld from her. On her birthday,
which was to be her last, she had written
these ejaculations in her locked diary:
"Lord, forgive the sins of the past, and help
me to be faithful in future! May this be a
year of much blessing, a year ofjubilee! May
I be kept lowly, trusting, loving! May I
have more blessing than in all former years
combined! May I be happier as a wife,
mother, sister, writer, mistress, friend!"
But a symptom began to alarm her and in
the beginning of May, having consulted a
local physician without being satisfied, she
59
FATHER AND SON
went to see a specialist in a northern suburb
in whose judgment she had great confidence.
This occasion I recollect with extreme vividness. I had been put to bed by my Father,
in itself a noteworthy event. My crib stood
near a window overlooking the street; my
parents' ancient four-poster, a relic of the
eighteenth century, hid me from the door, but
I could see the rest of the room. After falling
asleep on this particular evening, I awoke
silently, surprised to see two lighted candles
on the table, and my Father seated writing
by them. I also saw a little meal arranged.
While I was wondering at all this, the
door opened, and my Mother entered the
room; she emerged from behind the bedcurtains, with her bonnet on, having returned
from her expedition. My Father rose hurriedly,
pushing back his chair, and greeted her by
exclaiming: "Well, what does he say?"
There was a pause, while my Mother seemed
to be steadying her voice, and then she replied,
loudly and distinctly, " He says it is -" and
she mentioned one of the most cruel maladies
by which our poor mortal nature can be tormented. Then I saw them fold one another
in a silent long embrace, and presently sink
together out of sight on their knees, at the
60
FATHER AND SON
further side of the bed, whereupon my Father
lifted up his voice in prayer. Neither of them
had noticed me, and now I lay back on my
pillow and fell asleep.
Next morning, when we three sat at breakfast, my mind reverted to the scene of the
previous night. With my eyes on my plate,
as I was cutting up my food, I asked, casually,
"What is-?" mentioning the disease whose
unfamiliar name I had heard from my bed.
Receiving no reply, I looked up to discover
why my question was not answered, and I saw
my parents gazing at each other with lamentable eyes. In some way, I know not how, I
was conscious of the presence of an incommunicable mystery, and I kept silence, though
tortured with curiosity, nor did I ever repeat
my inquiry.
About a fortnight later, my Mother began
to go three times a week all the long way from
Islington to Pimlico, in order to visit a certain
practitioner, who undertook to apply a special
treatment to her case. This involved great
fatigue and distress to her, but so far as I was
personally concerned it did me a great deal of
good. I invariably accompanied her, and when
she was very tired and weak, I enjoyed the
pride of believing that I protected her. The
61
FATHER AND SON
movement, the exercise, the occupation, lifted
my morbid fears and superstitions like a cloud.
The medical treatment to which my poor
Mother was subjected was very painful, and
she had a peculiar sensitiveness to pain. She
carried on her evangelical work as long as she
possibly could, continuing to converse with her
fellow passengers on spiritual matters. It was
wonderful that a woman, so reserved and
proud as she by nature was, could conquer so
completely her natural timidity. In those last
months, she scarcely ever got into a railway
carriage or into an omnibus, without presently
offering tracts to the persons sitting within
reach of her, or endeavouring to begin a conversation with some one on the sufficiency of
the Blood of Jesus to cleanse the human heart
from sin. Her manners were so gentle and
persuasive, she looked so innocent, her small,
sparkling features were lighted up with so
much benevolence, that I do not think she
ever met with discourtesy or roughness.
Imitative imp that I was, I sometimes took
part in these strange conversations, and was
mightily puffed up by compliments paid, in
whispers, to my infant piety. But my Mother
very properly discouraged this, as tending in
me to spiritual pride.
62
FATHER AND SON
If my parents, in their desire to separate
themselves from the world, had regretted that
through their happiness they seemed to have
forfeited the Christian privilege of affliction,
they could not continue to complain of any
absence of temporal adversity. Everything
seemed to combine, in the course of this fatal
year 1856, to harass and alarm them. Just at
a moment when illness created a special drain
upon their resources, their slender income,
instead of being increased, was seriously
diminished. There is little sympathy felt in
this world of rhetoric for the silent sufferings
of the genteel poor, yet there is no class that
deserves a more charitable commiseration.
At the best of times, the money which my
parents had to spend was an exiguous and an
inelastic sum. Strictly economical, proudin an old-fashioned mode now quite out of
fashion-to conceal the fact of their poverty,
painfully scrupulous to avoid giving inconvenience to shop-people, tradesmen or servants,
their whole financial career had to be carried
on with the adroitness of a campaign through
a hostile country. But now, at the moment
when fresh pressing claims were made on their
resources, my Mother's small capital suddenly
disappeared. It had been placed, on bad
63
FATHER AND SON
advice (they were as children in such matters),
in a Cornish mine, the grotesque name of
which, Wheal Maria, became familiar to my
ears. One day the river Tamar, in a playful
mood, broke into Wheal Maria, and not a
penny more was ever lifted from that unfortunate enterprise. About the same time, a small
annuity which my Mother had inherited also
ceased to be paid.
On my Father's books and lectures, therefore,
the whole weight now rested, and that at a
moment when he was depressed and unnerved
by anxiety. It was contrary to his principles to
borrow money, so that it became necessary to
pay doctor's and chemist's bills punctually, and
yet to carry on the little household with the
very small margin. Each artifice of economy
was now exercised to enable this to be done
without falling into debt, and every branch of
expenditure was cut down; clothes, books, the
little garden which was my Father's pride, all
felt the pressure of new poverty. Even our
food, which had always been simple, now
became Spartan indeed, and I am sure that
my Mother often pretended to have no appetite that there might remain enough to satisfy
my hunger. Fortunately my Father was able
to take us away in the autumn for six weeks
64
FATHER AND SON
by the sea in Wales, the expenses of this tour
being paid for by a professional engagement,
so that my seventh birthday was spent in an
ecstasy of happiness, on golden sands, under
a brilliant sky, and in sight of the glorious
azure ocean beating in from an infinitude of
melting horizons. Here, too, my Mother,
perched in a nook of the high rocks, surveyed
the west, and forgot for a little while her,weakness and the gnawing, grinding pain.
But in October, our sorrows seemed to close
in upon us. We went back to London, and
for the first time in their married life, my
parents were divided. My Mother was now so
seriously weaker that the omnibus-journeys to
Pimlico became impossible. My Father could
not leave his work, and so my Mother and I
had to take a gloomy lodging close to the
doctor's house. The experiences upon which
I presently entered were of a nature in which
childhood rarely takes a part. T was now my
Mother's sole and ceaseless companion; the
silent witness of her suffering, of her patience,
of her vain and delusive attempts to obtain
alleviation of her anguish. For nearly three
months I breathed the atmosphere of pain,
saw no other light, heard no other sounds,
thought no other thoughts, than those which
65 E
FATHER AND SON
accompany physical suffering and weariness.
To my memory these weeks seem years; I
have no measure of their monotony. The
lodgings were bare and yet tawdry; out of
dingy windows we looked from a second storey
upon a dull small street, drowned in autumnal
fog. My Father came to see us when he
could, but otherwise, save when we made our
morning expedition to the doctor, or when a
slatternly girl waited upon us with our
distasteful meals, we were alone,-without
any other occupation than to look forward to
that occasional abatement of suffering which
was what we hoped for most.
It is difficult for me to recollect how these
interminable hours were spent. But I read
aloud in a great part of them. I have now in
my mind's cabinet a picture of my chair
turned towards the window, partly that I
might see the book more distinctly, partly not
to see quite so distinctly that dear patient
figure rocking on her sofa, or leaning, like a
funeral statue, like a muse upon a monument,
with her head on her arms against the mantelpiece. I read the Bible every day, and at
much -ength; also,-with I cannot but think
some praiseworthy patience,-a book of incommunicable dreariness, called Newton's
66
FATHER AND SON
" Thoughts on the Apocalypse." Newton bore
a great resemblance to my old aversion, Jukes,
and I made a sort of playful compact with my
Mother that if I read aloud a certain number
of pages out of " Thoughts on the Apocalypse,"
as a reward I should be allowed to recite "my
own favourite hymns."' Among these there
was one which united her suffrages with mine.
Both of us extremely admired the piece by
Toplady which begins:What though my frail eyelids refuse
Continual watchings to keep.
And, punctual as midnight renews,
Demand the refreshment of sleep.
To this day, I cannot repeat this hymn
without a sense of poignant emotion, nor can
I pretend to decide how much of this is due
to its merit and how much to the peculiar
nature of the memories it recalls. But it
might be as rude as I genuinely think it to be
skilful, and I should continue to regard it as a
sacred poem. Among all my childish memories
none is clearer than my looking up,-after
reading, in my high treble,
Kind Author and Ground of my hope,
Thee, Thee for my God I avow;
My glad Ebenezer set up,
And own Thou hast help'd me till now;
67
FATHER AND SON
I muse on the years that are past,
Wherein my defence Thou hast prov'd,
Nor wilt Thou relinquish at last
A sinner so signally lov'd,and hearing my Mother, her eyes brimming
with tears and her alabastrine fingers tightly
locked together, murmur in unconscious
repetition:
Nor wilt Thou relinquish at last
A sinner so signally lov'd.
In our lodgings at Pimlico I came across a
piece of verse which exercised a lasting
influence on my taste. It was called " The
Cameronian's Dream," and it had been written
by a certain James Hyslop, a schoolmaster on
a man-of-war. I do not know how it came
into my possession, but I remember it was
adorned by an extremely dim and ill-executed
wood-cut of a lake surrounded by mountains,
with tombstones in the foreground. This lugubrious frontispiece positively fascinated me,
and lent a further gloomy charm to the ballad
itself. It was in this copy of mediocre verses
that the sense of romance first appealed to me,
the kind of nature-romance which is connected
with hills, and lakes, and the picturesque
costumes of old times. The following stanza,
for instance, brought a revelation to me:
68
FATHER AND SON
Twas a dream of those ages of darkness and blood,
When the minister's home was the mountain and wood;
When in Wellwood's dark valley the standard of Zion,
All bloody and torn, 'mong the heather was lying.
I persuaded my Mother to explain to me
what it was all about, and she told me of the
affliction of the Scottish saints, their flight to
the waters and the wilderness, their cruel
murder while they were singing "their last
song to the God of Salvation." I was greatly
fired, and the following stanza, in particular,
reached my ideal of the Sublime:
The muskets were flashing, the blue swords were
gleaming,
The helmets were cleft, and the red blood was streaming,
The heavens grew dark, and the thunder was rolling,
When in Wellwood's dark muirlands the mighty were
falling.
Twenty years later I met with the only
other person whom I have ever encountered
who had even heard of "The Cameronian's
Dream." This was Robert Louis Stevenson,
who had been greatly struck by it when he
was about my age. Probably the same
ephemeral edition of it reached, at the same
time, each of our pious households
As my Mother's illness progressed, she
could neither sleep, save by the use of opiates,
nor rest, except in a sloping posture, propped
69
FATHER AND SON
up by many pillows. It was my great joy,
and a pleasant diversion, to be allowed to
shift, beat up, and rearrange these pillows, a
task which I learned to accomplish not too
awkwardly. Her sufferings, I believe, were
principally caused by the violence of the
medicaments to which her doctor, who was
trying a new and fantastic " cure," thought it
proper to subject her. Let those who take a
pessimistic view of our social progress ask
themselves whether such tortures could to-day
be inflicted on a delicate patient, or whether
that patient would be allowed to exist, in the
greatest misery, in a lodging with no professional nurse to wait upon her, and with no
companion but a little helpless boy of seven
years of age. Time passes smoothly and
swiftly, and we do not perceive the mitigations
which he brings in his hands.' Everywhere,
in the whole system of human life, improvements, alleviations, ingenious appliances and
humane inventions are being introduced to
lessen the great burden of suffering.
If we were suddenly transplanted into the
world of only fifty years ago, we should be
startled and even horror-stricken by the
wretchedness to which the step backwards
would re-introduce us. It was in the very year
70
FATHER AND SON
of which I am speaking, a year of which my
personal memories are still vivid, that Sir
James Simpson received the Monthyon prize
as a recognition of his discovery of the use of
anaesthetics. Can our thoughts embrace the
mitigation of human torment which the
application of chloroform alone has caused?
My early experiences, I confess, made me
singularly conscious, at an age when one
should know nothing about these things, of
that torrent of sorrow and anguish and terror
which flows under all the footsteps of man.
Within my childish conscience, already, some
dim inquiry was awake as to the meaning of
this mystery of painThe floods of the tears meet and gather;
The sound of them all grows like thunder;
O into what bosom, I wonder,
Is poured the whole sorrow of years?
For Eternity only seems keeping
Account of the great human weeping;
May God then, the Maker and Father,
May He find a place for the tears!
In my Mother's case, the savage treatment
did no good; it had to be abandoned, and a
day or two before Christmas, while the fruits
were piled in the shop-fronts and the butchers
were shouting outside their forests of carcases,
my Father brought us back in a cab through
71
FATHER AND SON
the streets to Islington, a feeble and languishing company. Our invalid bore the journey
fairly well, enjoying the air, and pointing out
to me the glittering evidences of the season,
but we paid heavily for her little entertainment,
since, at her earnest wish the window of the
cab having been kept open, she caught a cold,
which became, indeed, the technical cause of a
death that no applications could now have long
delayed.
Yet she lingered with us six weeks more,
and during this time I again relapsed, very
naturally, into solitude. She now had the
care of a practised woman, one of the " saints"
from the Chapel, and I was only permitted to
pay brief visits to her bedside. That I might
not be kept indoors all day and every day, a
man, also connected with the meeting-house,
was paid a trifle to take me out for a walk each
morning. This person, who was by turns
familiar and truculent, was the object of my
intense dislike. Our relations became, in the
truest sense, " forced "; I was obliged to walk
by his side, but I held that I had no further
responsibility to be agreeable, and after a while
I ceased to speak to him, or to answer his remarks. On one occasion, poor dreary man,
he met a friend and stopped to chat with him.
72
FATHER AND SON
I considered this act to have dissolved the
bond; I skipped lightly from his side, examined
several shop-windows which I had been forbidden to look into, made several darts down
courts and up passages, and finally, after a delightful morning, returned home, having known
my directions perfectly. My official conductor, in a shocking condition of fear, was
crouching by the area-rails looking up and
down the street. He darted upon me, in a
great rage, to know " what I meant by it?"
I drew myself up as tall as I could, hissed
" Blind leader of the blind! " at him, and, with
this inappropriate (but very effective) Parthian
shot, slipped into the house.
When it was quite certain that no alleviations and no medical care could prevent, or
even any longer postpone, the departure of my
Mother, I believe that my future conduct became the object of her greatest and her most
painful solicitude. She said to my Father that
the worst trial of her faith came from the
feeling that she was called upon to leave that
child whom she had so carefully trained from
his earliest infancy for the peculiar service of
the Lord, without any knowledge of what his
further course would be. In many conversations, she most tenderly and closely urged my
73
FATHER AND SON
Father, who, however, needed no urging, to
watch with unceasing care over my spiritual
welfare. As she grew nearer her end, it was
observed that she became calmer, and less
troubled by fears about me. The intensity of
her prayers and hopes seemed to have a prevailing force; it would have been a sin to doubt
that such supplications, such confidence and
devotion, such an emphasis of will, should not
be rewarded by an answer from above in the
affirmative. She was able, she said, to leave
me "in the hands of her loving Lord," or, on
another occasion, "to the care of her covenant
God."
Although her faith was so strong and simple,
my Mother possessed no quality of the mystic.
She never pretended to any visionary gifts,
believed not at all in dreams or portents, and
encouraged nothing in herself or others which
was superstitious or fantastic. In order to
realise her condition of mind, it is necessary, I
think, to accept the view that she had formed
a definite conception of the absolute, unmodified and historical veracity, in its direct and
obvious sense, of every statement contained
within the covers of the Bible. For her, and
for my Father, nothing was symbolic, nothing
allegorical or allusive in any part of Scripture,
74
FATHER AND SON
except what was, in so many words, proffered
as a parable or a picture. Pushing this to its
extreme limit, and allowing nothing for the
changes of scene or time or race, my parents
read injunctions to the Corinthian converts
without any suspicion that what was apposite
in dealing with half-breed Achaian colonists of
the first century might not exactly apply to
respectable English men and women of the
nineteenth. They took it, text by text, as it
no sort of difference existed between the
surroundings of Trimalchion's feast and those
of a City dinner. Both of my parents, I think,
were devoid of sympathetic imagination; in my
Father, I am sure, it was singularly absent.
Hence, although their faith was so strenuous
that many persons might have called it fanatical, there was no mysticism about them.
They went rather to the opposite extreme, to
the cultivation of a rigid and iconoclastic
literalness.
This was curiously exemplified in the very
lively interest which they both took in what is
called "the interpretation of prophecy," and
particularly in unwrapping the dark sayings
bound up in the Book of Revelation. In
their impartial survey of the Bible, they came
to this collection of solemn and splendid visions,
75
FATHER AND SON
sinister and obscure, and they had no intention
of allowing these to be merely stimulating to
the fancy, or vaguely doctrinal in symbol.
When they read of seals broken and of vials
poured forth, of the star which was called
Wormwood that fell from Heaven, and of
men whose hair was as the hair of women and
their teeth as the teeth of lions, they did not
admit for a moment that these vivid mental
pictures were of a poetic character, but they
regarded them as positive statements, in
guarded language, describing events which
were to happen, and could be recognised when
they did happen. It was the explanation, the
perfectly prosaic and positive explanation, of
all these wonders which drew them to study
the Jukeses and the Newtons whose books
they so much enjoyed. They were helped by
these guides to recognise in wild Oriental
visions direct statements regarding Napoleon
III. and Pope Pius IX. and the King of
Piedmont, historic figures which they conceived
as foreshadowed, in language which admitted
of plain interpretation, under the names of
denizens of Babylon and companions of the
Wild Beast.
My {Father was in the habit of saying, in
later years; that no small element in his
76
FATHER AND SON
wedded happiness had been the fact that my
Mother and he were of one mind in the
interpretation of Sacred Prophecy. Looking
back, it appears to me that this unusual mental
exercise was almost their only relaxation, and
that in their economy it took the place which
is taken, in profaner families, by cards or the
piano. It was a distraction; it took them
completely out of themselves. During those
melancholy weeks at Pimlico, I read aloud
another work of the same nature as those of
Newton and Jukes, the " Horae Apocalyptice"
of a Mr. Elliott. This was written, I think,
in a less disagreeable style, and certainly it
was less opaquely obscure to me. My recollection distinctly is that when my Mother
could endure nothing else, the arguments of
this book took her thoughts away from her
pain and lifted her spirits. Elliott saw " the
queenly arrogance of Popery" everywhere,
and believed that the very last days of Babylon
the Great were come. Lest I say what may
be thought extravagant, let me quote what
my Father wrote in his diary at the time of my,Mother's death. He said that the thought
that Rome was doomed (as seemed not
impossible in 1857) so affected my Mother
that it "irradiated her dying hours with an
77
FATHER AND SON
assurance that was like the light of the
Morning Star, the harbinger of the rising sun."
After our return to Islington, there was a
complete change in my relation to my Mother.
At Pimlico, I had been all-important, her only
companion, her friend, her confidant. But
now that she was at home again, people and
things combined to separate me from her.
Now, and for the first time in my life, I no
longer slept in her room, no longer sank to
sleep under her kiss, no longer saw her mild
eyes smile on me with the earliest sunshine.
Twice a day, after breakfast and before 1 went
to rest, I was brought to her bedside; but we
were never alone, other people, sometimes
strange people, were there. We had no cosy
talk; often she was too weak to do more than
pat my hand: her loud and almost constant
cough terrified and harassed me. I felt, as I
stood, awkwardly and shyly, by her high bed,
that I had shrunken into a very small and insignificant figure, that she was floating out of
my reach, that all things, but I knew not what
nor how, were coming to an end. She herself
was not herself; her head, that used to be held
so erect, now rolled or sank upon the pillow;
the sparkle was all extinguished from those
bright, dear eyes. I could not understand it;
78
FATHER AND SON
I meditated long, long upon it all in my infantile darkness, in the garret, or in the little
slip of a cold room where my bed was now
placed; and a great, blind anger against I knew
not what awakened in my soul.
The two retreats which I have mentioned
were now all that were left to me. In the backparlour some one from outside gave me occasional lessons, of a desultory character. The
breakfast-room was often haunted by visitors,
unknown to me by face or name,-ladies, who
used to pity me and even to pet me, until 1
became nimble in escaping from their caresses.
Everything seemed to be unfixed, uncertain; it
was like being on the platform of a railwaystation waiting for a train. In all this time,
the agitated, nervous presence of my Father,
whose pale face was permanently drawn with
anxiety, added to my perturbation, and I became miserable, stupid, as if I had lost my
way in a cold fog.
Had 1 been older and more intelligent, of
course, it might have been of him and not of
myself that I should have been thinking. As
I now look back upon that tragic time, it is for
him that my heart bleeds,- for them both, so
singularly fitted as they were to support and
cheer one another in an existence which their
79
FATHER AND SON
own innate and cultivated characteristics had
made little hospitable to other sources of
comfort. This is not to be dwelt on here.
But what must be recorded was the extraordinary tranquillity, the serene and sensible
resignation, with which at length my parents
faced the awful hour. Language cannot utter
\ what they suffered, but there was no rebellion,
Ino repining; in their case even an atheist
might admit that the overpowering miracle of
grace was mightily efficient.
It seems almost cruel to the memory of their
opinions that the only words which rise to my
mind, the only ones which seem in the least degree adequate to describe the attitude of my
parents, had fallen from the pen of one whom,
in their want of imaginative sympathy, they
had regarded as anathema. But John Henry
Newman might have come from the contemplation of my Mother's death-bed when he wrote:," All the trouble which the world inflicts upon
us, and which flesh cannot but feel,-sorrow,
pain, care, bereavement,-these avail not to
disturb the tranquillity and the intensity with
which faith gazes at the Divine Majesty." It
was "tranquillity," it was not the rapture of
the mystic. Almost in the last hour of her
life, urged to confess her "joy " in the Lord,
80
FATHER AND SON

my Mother, rigidly honest, meticulous in selfanalysis, as ever, replied: " I have peace, but

not joy. It would not do to go into eternity

with a lie in my mouth."

When the very end approached, and her

mind was growing clouded, she gathered her

strength together to say to my Father, c; I shall

walk with Him in white. Won't you take

your lamb and walk with me? " Confused with

sorrow and alarm, my Father failed to understand her meaning. She became agitated, and

she repeated two or three times: " Take our

lamb, and walk with me!" Then my Father

comprehended, and pressed me forward; her

hand fell softly upon mine and she seemed

content. Thus was my dedication, that had

begun in my cradle, sealed with the most

solemn, the most poignant and irresistible insistence, at the death-bed of the holiest and

purest of women. But what a weight, intolerable as the burden of Atlas, to lay on the

shoulders of a little fragile child!  //

81

F
CHAPTER IV
CERTAINLY the preceding year, the seventh
of my life, had been weighted for us with
comprehensive disaster. I have not yet mentioned that, at the beginning of my Mother's
fatal illness, misfortune came upon her
brothers. I have never known the particulars of their ruin, but, I believe in consequence
of A.'s unsuccessful speculations, and of the
fact that E. had allowed the use of his name
as a surety, both my uncles were obliged to fly
from their creditors, and take refuge in Paris.
This happened just when our need was the
sorest, and this, together with the poignancy
of knowing that their sister's devoted labours
for them had been all in vain, added to their
unhappiness. It was doubtless also the
reason why, having left England, they wrote
to us no more, carefully concealing from us
even their address, so that when my Mother
died, my Father was unable to communicate
82
FATHER AND SON
with them. I fear that they fell into dire
distress; before very long we learned that
A. had died, but it was fifteen years more
before we heard anything of E., whose life had
at length been preserved by the kindness of
an old servant, but whose mind was now so
clouded that he could recollect little or nothing
of the past; and soon he also died. Amiable,
gentle, without any species of practical ability,
they were quite unfitted to struggle with the
world, which had touched them only to wreck
them.
The flight of my uncles at this particular
juncture left me without a relative on my
Mother's side at the time of her death. This
isolation threw my Father into a sad perplexity.
His only obvious source of income-but it
happened to be a -remarkably hopeful onewas an engagement to deliver a long series of
lectures on- marine natural history throughout
the north and centre of England. These
lectures were an entire novelty; nothing like
them had been offered to the provincial public
before; and the fact that the newly-invented
marine aquarium was the fashionable toy of
the moment added to their attraction. My
Father was bowed down by sorrow and care,
but he was not broken. His intellectual
83
FATHER AND SON
forces were at their height, and so was his
popularity as an author. The lectures were
to begin in March; my Mother was buried on
the 13th of February. It seemed at first, in
the inertia of bereavement, to be all beyond
his powers to make the supreme effort, but the
wholesome prick of need urged him on. It
was a question of paying for food and clothes,
of keeping a roof above our heads. The captain of a vessel in a storm must navigate his
ship, although his wife lies dead in the cabin.
That was my Father's position in the spring
of 1857; he had to stimulate, instruct, amuse
large audiences of strangers, and seem gay,
although affliction and loneliness had settled
in his heart. He had to do this, or starve.
But the difficulty still remained. During
these months what was to become of me?
My Father could not take me with him from
hotel to hotel and from lecture-hall to lecturehall. Nor could he leave me, as people leave
the domestic cat, in an empty house for the
neighbours to feed at intervals. The dilemma
threatened to be insurmountable, when suddenly there descended upon us a kind, but
little-known, paternal cousin from the west
of England, who had heard of our calamities.
This lady had a large family of her own at
84
FATHER AND SON
Bristol; she offered to find room in it for me
so long as ever my Father should be away in
the north, and when my Father, bewildered
by so much goodness, hesitated, she came up
to London and carried me forcibly away in a
whirlwind of good-nature. Her benevolence
was quite spontaneous; and I am not sure
that she had not added to it already by helping
to nurse our beloved sufferer through part of
her illness. Of that I am not positive, but
I recollect very clearly her snatching me from
our cold and desolate hearthstone, and carrying me off to her cheerful house at Clifton.: Here, for the first time, when half through
my eighth year, I was thrown into the society
of young people. My cousins were none of
them, I believe, any longer children, but thev
were youths and maidens busily engaged in
various personal interests, all collected in a hive
of wholesome family energy. Everybody was
very kind to me, and I sank back, after the
strain of so many months, into mere childhood again. This long visit to my cousins at
Clifton must have been very delightful: I am
dimly aware that it was: yet 1 remember but
few of its incidents. My memory, so clear
and vivid about earlier solitary times, now in
all this society becomes blurred and vague.
85
FATHER AND SON
I recollect certain pleasures; being taken, for
instance, to a menagerie, and having a practical joke, in the worst taste, played upon me
by the pelican. One of my cousins, who was
a medical student, showed me a pistol, and
helped me to fire it; he smoked a pipe, and I
was oddly conscious that both the firearm and
the tobacco were definitely hostile to my
"dedication." My girl-cousins took turns in
putting me to bed, and on cold nights, or when
they were in a hurry, allowed me to say my
prayer under the bed-clothes instead of
kneeling at a chair. The result of this was
further spiritual laxity, because I could
not help going to sleep before the prayer was
ended.
The visit to Clifton was, in fact, a blessed
interval in my strenuous childhood. It probably prevented my nerves from breaking down
under the pressure of the previous months.
The Clifton family was God-fearing, in a quiet,
sensible way, but there was a total absence of
all the intensity and compulsion of our
religious life at Islington. I was not encouraged-I even remember that I was gently
snubbed-when I rattled forth, parrot-fashion,
the conventional phraseology of "the saints."
For a short, enchanting period of respite, I
86
FATHER AND SON
lived the life of an ordinary' little boy, relapsing, to a degree which would have filled my
Father with despair, into childish thoughts
and childish language. The result was that
of this little happy breathing-space I have
nothing to report. Vague, half-blind remembrances of walks, with my tall cousins waving
like trees above me, pleasant noisy evenings
in a great room on the ground-floor, faint
silver-points of excursions into the country, all
this is the very pale and shadowy testimony
to a brief interval of healthy, happy child-life,
when my hard-driven soul was allowed to
have, for a little while, no history.
The life of a child. is so brief, its impressions
are so illusory and fugitive, that it is as
difficult to record its history as it would be to
design a morning cloud sailing before the
wind. It is short, as we count shortness in
after years, when the drag of lead pulls down
to earth the foot that used to flutter with a
winged impetuosity, and to float with the
pulse of H-ermes. But in memory, my childhood was long, long with interminable hours,
hours with the pale cheek pressed against the
window pane, hours of mechanical and
repeated lonely " games," which had lost their
savour, and were kept going by sheer inert87
FATHER AND SON
ness. Not unhappy, not fretful, but long,long, long. It seems to me, as I look back to
the life in the motherless Islington house, as
I resumed it in that slow eighth year of my
life, that time had ceased to move. There
was a whole age between one tick of the
eight-day clock in the hall, and the next tick.
When the milkman went his rounds in our
grey street, with his eldritch scream over the
top of each set of area railings, it seemed as
though he would never disappear again.
There was no past and no future for me, and
the present felt as though it were sealed up
in a Leyden jar. Even my dreams were
interminable, and hung stationary from the
nightly sky.
At this time, the street was my theatre,
and I spent long periods, as I have said,
leaning against the window. I feel now the
coldness of the pane, and the feverish heat
that was produced, by contrast, in the orbit
round the eye. Now and then amusing
things happened. The onion-man was a joy
long waited for. This worthy was a tall and
bony Jersey protestant with a raucous voice,
who strode up our street several times a week,
carrying a yoke across his shoulders, from the
ends of which hung ropes of onions. He used
88
FATHER AND SON
to shout, at abrupt intervals, in a tone which
might wake the dead:
Here's your rope.
To hang the Pope....
And a penn'orth of cheese to choke him.
The cheese appeared to be legendary; he
sold only onions. My Father did not eat
onions, but he encouraged this terrible fellow,
with his wild eyes and long strips of hair,
because of his " godly attitude towards the
Papacy," and I used to watch him dart out of
the front door, present his penny, and retire,
graciously waving back the proffered onion.
On the other hand, my Father did not approve
of a fat sailor, who was a constant passer-by.
This man, who was probably crazed, used to
walk very slowly up the centre of our street,
vociferating with the voice of a bull,
Wa-a-atch and pray-hay!
Night and day-hay!
This melancholy admonition was the entire
business of his life. He did nothing at all but
walk up and down the streets of Islington
exhorting the inhabitants to watch and pray.
I do not recollect that this sailor-man stopped
to collect pennies, and my impression is that
he was, after his fashion, a volunteer evangelist.
89
FATHER AND SON
The tragedy of Mr. Punch was another, and
a still greater delight. I was never allowed to
go out into the street to mingle with the little
crowd which gathered under the stage, and as
I was extremely near-sighted, the impression
I received was vague. But when, by happy
chance, the show stopped opposite our door, I
saw enough ofthat ancient drama to be thrilled
with terror and delight. I was much affected
by the internal troubles of the Punch family;
I thought that with a little more tact on the
part of Mrs. Punch and some restraint held
over a temper, naturally violent, by Mr. Punch,
a great deal of this sad misunderstanding
might have been prevented.
The momentous close, when a figure of shapeless horror appears on the stage, and quells the
hitherto undaunted Mr. Punch, was to me the
bouquet of the entire performance. When Mr.
Punch, losing his nerve, points to this shape
and says in an awestruck, squeaking whisper,
"Who's that? Is it the butcher?" and the stern
answer comes, " No, Mr. Punch I" And then,
"Is it the baker?" "No, Mr. Punch!" "Who
is it then?" (this in a squeak trembling with
emotion and terror); and then the full, loud
reply, booming like a judgment-bell, " It is the
Devil come to take you down to Hell," and
90
FATHER AND SON
the form of Punch, with kicking legs, sunken
in epilepsy on the floor,-all this was solemn
and exquisite to me beyond words. I was not
amused-I was deeply moved and exhilarated,
"purged," as the old phrase hath it, "with pity
and terror."
Another joy, in a lighter key, was watching
a fantastic old man who came slowly up the
street, hung about with drums and flutes and
kites and coloured balls, and bearing over his
shoulders a great sack. Children and servantgirls used to bolt up out of areas, and chaffer
with this gaudy person, who would presently
trudge on, always repeating the same set of
wordsHere's your toys
For girls and boys,
For bits of brass
And broken glass,
(these four lines being spoken in a breathless hurry)
A penny or a vial-bottell....
(this being drawled out in an endless wail).
I was not allowed to go forth and trade with
this old person, but sometimes our servantmaid did, thereby making me feel that if I did
not hold the rose of merchandise, I was very
near it. My experiences with my cousins at
Clifton had given me the habit of looking out
91
FATHER AND SON
into the world,-even though it was only into
the pale world of our quiet street.
My Father and I were now great friends. I
do not doubt that he felt his responsibility to
fill as far as might be the gap which the death of
my Mother had made in my existence. I spent
a large portion of my time in his study, while
he was writing or drawing, and though very
little conversation passed between us, I think
that each enjoyed the companionship of the
other. There were two, and sometimes three
aquaria in the room, tanks of sea-water, with
glass sides, inside which all sorts of creatures
crawled and swam; these were sources of endless pleasure to me, and at this time began to be
laid upon me the occasional task of watching
and afterwards reporting the habits of animals.
At other times, I dragged a folio volume
of the " Penny Cyclopedia " up to the study
with me, and sat there reading successive articles on such subjects as Parrots,
Parthians, Passion-flowers, Passover and
Pastry, without any invidious preferences, all
information being equally welcome, and
equally fugitive. That something of all this
loose stream of knowledge clung to odd cells
of the back of my brain seems to be shown by
the fact that to this day, I occasionally find
FATHER AND SON
myself aware of some stray useless fact about
peonies or pemmican or pepper, which I can
only trace back to the "; Penny Cyclopeedia"
of my infancy.
It will be asked what the attitude of my
Father's mind was to me, and of mine to his,
as regards religion, at this time, when we
were thrown together alone so much. It is
difficult to reply with exactitude. But so far
as the former is concerned, I think that the
extreme violence of the spiritual emotions to
which my Father had been subjected, had now
been followed by a certain reaction. He had
not changed his views in any respect, and he
was prepared to work out the results of them
with greater zeal than ever, but just at present
his religious nature, like his physical nature,
was tired out with anxiety and sorrow. He
accepted the, supposition that I was entirely
with hirn in all respects, so far, that is to say,
as a being so rudimentary and feeble as a little
child could be. My Mother, in her last hours,
had dwelt on our unity in God; we were drawn
together, she said, elect from the world, in a
triplicity of faith and joy. She had constantly
repeated the words: " We shall be one family,
one song. One Song! one Family!" My
Father, I think, accepted this as a prophecy,
92
FATHER AND SON
he felt no doubt of our. triple unity; my
Mother had now merely passed before us,
through a door, into a world of light, where
we should presently join her, where all things
would be radiant and blissful, but where we
three would, in some unknown way, be
particularly drawn together in a tie of
inexpressible benediction. He fretted at the
delay; he would fain have taken me by the
hand, and have joined her in the realms of
holiness and light, at once, without this dreary
dalliance with earthly cares.
He held this confidence and vision steadily
before him, but nothing availed against the
melancholy of his natural state. He was
conscious of his dull and solitary condition,
and he saw, too, that it enveloped me. I
think his heart was, at this time, drawn out
towards me in an immense tenderness.
Sometimes, when the early twilight descended
upon us in the study, and he could no longer
peer with advantage into the depths of his
microscope, he would beckon me to him
silently, and fold me closely in his arms. I
used to turn my face up to his, patiently and
wonderingly, while the large, unwilling tears
gathered in the corners of his eyelids. My
training had given me a preternatural faculty
94
FATHER AND SON
of stillness and we would stay so, without a
word or a movement, until the darkness filled
the room. And then, with my little hand in
his, we would walk sedately downstairs, to
the parlour, where we would find that the lamp
was lighted, and that our melancholy vigil
was ended. I do not think that at any part
of our lives my Father and 1 were drawn so
close to one another as we were in that
summer of 1857. Yet we seldom spoke of
what lay so warm and fragrant between us,
the flower-like thought of our Departed.
The visit to my cousins had made one considerable change in me. Under the old
solitary discipline, my intelligence had grown
at the expense of my sentiment. I was innocent, but inhuman. The long suffering and
the death of my Mother had awakened my
heart, had taught me what pain was, but had
left me savage and morose. I had still no idea
of the relations of human beings to one
another; I had learned no word of that philosophy which comes to the children of the poor
in the struggle of the street and to the children
of the well-to-do in the clash of the nursery. In
other words, I had no humanity; I had been
carefully shielded from the chance of" catching " it, as though it were the most dangerous
FATHER AND SON
of microbes. But now that II had enjoyed a
little of the common experience of childhood, a
great change had come upon me. Before I went
to Clifton, my mental life was all interior, a rack
of baseless dream upon dream. But, now, 1
was eager to look out of window, to go out in
the streets; I was taken with a curiosity about
human life. Even, from my vantage of the
window-pane, I watched boys and girls go by
with an interest which began to be almost
wistful.
Still I continued to have no young companions. But on summer evenings I used to
drag my Father out, taking the initiative
myself, stamping in playful impatience at his
irresolution, fetching his hat and stick, and
waiting. We used to sally forth at last
together, hand in hand, descending the Caledonian Road, with all its shops, as far as
Mother Shipton, or else winding among the
semi-genteel squares and terraces westward by
Copenhagen Street, or, best of all, mounting to
the Regent's Canal, where we paused to lean
over the bridge and watch flotillas of ducks
steer under us, or little white dogs dash,
impotently furious, from stem to stern of the
great, lazy barges painted in a crude vehemence
of vermilion and azure. These were happy
96
FATHER AND SON
hours, when the spectre of Religion ceased to
overshadow us for a little while, when my
Father forgot the Apocalypse and dropped his
austere phraseology, and when our bass and
treble voices used to ring out together over
some foolish little jest or some mirthful recol- lX
' lection of his past experiences. Little soft
oases these, in the hard desert of our sandy
spiritual life at home.
There was an unbending, too, when we used
to sing together, in my case very tunelessly.
I had inherited a plentiful lack of musical
genius from my Mother, who had neither ear
nor voice, and who had said, in the course of
her last illness, "I shall sing His praise, at
length, in strains I never could master here
below." My Father, on the other hand, had
some knowledge of the principles of vocal
music, although not, I am afraid, much taste.
He had at least great fondness for singing
hymns, in the manner then popular with the
Evangelicals, very loudly, and so slowly that I
used to count how many words 1 could read,
silently, between one syllable of the singing
and another. My lack of skill did not prevent
me from being zealous at these vocal exercises,
and my Father and I used to sing lustily
together. The Wesleys, Charlotte Elliott
97 G
FATHER AND SON
(" Just as I am, without one plea "), and James
Montgomery ("For ever with the Lord ")
represented his predilection in hymnology. I
acquiesced, but that would not have been my
independent choice. These represented the
devotional verse which made its direct appeal
to the evangelical mind, and served in those
"Puseyite " days to counteract the High
Church poetry founded on "The Christian
Year." Of that famous volume I never met with
a copy until I was grown up, and equally unknown in our circlewere the hymns ofNewman,
Faber and Neale.
It was my Father's plan from the first to
keep me entirely ignorant of the poetry of
the High Church, which deeply offended his
Calvinism; he thought that religious truth
could be sucked in, like mother's milk, from
hymns which were godly and sound, and yet
correctly versified; and I was therefore
carefully trained in this direction from an
early date. But my spirit had rebelled against
some of these hymns, especially against those
written-a mighty multitude-by Horatio
Bonar; naughtily refusing to read Bonar's " I
heard the voice of Jesus say" to my Mother
in our Pimlico lodgings. A secret hostility to
this particular form of effusion was already, at
98
FATHER AND SON
the age of seven, beginning to define itself in I
my brain, side by side with an unctuous
infantile conformity.
I find a difficulty in recalling the precise
nature of the religious instruction which my
Father gave me at this time. It was incessant,
i and it was founded on the close inspection of
the Bible, particularly of the epistles of the
New Testament. This summer, as my eighth
year advanced, we read the "Epistle to the
Hebrews," with very great deliberation, stopping every moment, that my Father might
expound it, verse by verse. The extraordinary
beauty of the language,-for instance, the
matchless cadences and images of the first
chapter,-made a certain impression upon my
imagination, and were (I think) my earliest
initiation into the magic of literature. I was
incapable of defining what I felt, but I certainly had a grip in the throat, which was in
its essence a purely eesthetic emotion, when
my Father read, in his pure, large, ringing
voice, such passages as "The heavens are
the works of Thy hands. They shall perish,
but Thou remainest, and they all shall wax old
as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou
fold them up, and they shall be changed; but
Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not
99 cl 1
FATHER AND SON
fail." But the dialectic parts of the Epistle
puzzled and confused me. Such metaphysical
ideas as '" laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works " and;" crucifying
the Son of God afresh" were not successfully
brought down to the level of my understanding.
My Father's religious teaching to me was
almost exclusively doctrinal. He did not
observe the value of negative education, that
is to say, of leaving Nature alone to fill up the
gaps which it is her design to deal with at a
later and riper date. He did not, even, satisfy
himself with those moral injunctions which
should form the basis of infantile discipline.
He was in a tremendous hurry to push on my
spiritual growth, and he fed me with theological meat which it was impossible for me to
digest. Some glimmer of a suspicion that he
was sailing on the wrong tack must, I should
suppose, have broken in upon him when we
had reached the eighth and ninth chapters of
Hebrews, where, addressing readers who had
been brought up under the Jewish dispensation, and had the formalities of the Law of
Moses in their very blood, the apostle battles
with their dangerous conservatism. It is a very
noble piece of spiritual casuistry, but it is::..,. 100
FATHER AND SON
signally unfitted for the comprehension of a
child. Suddenly, by my flushing up with
anger and saying, "0 how I do hate that Law,"
my Father perceived, and paused in amazement to perceive, that I took the Law to be a
person of malignant temper from whose cruel
bondage, and from whose intolerable tyranny
and unfairness, some excellent person was
crying out to be delivered. I wished to hit
Law with my fist, for being so mean and
unreasonable.
Upon this, of course, it was necessary to
reopen the whole line of exposition. My
Father, without realising it, had been talking
on his own level, not on mine, and now he
condescended to me. But without very great
success. The melodious language, the divine
forensic audacities, the magnificent ebb and \
flow of argument which make the " Epistle to
the Hebrews" such a miracle, were far and
away beyond my reach, and they only
bewildered me. Some evangelical children of
my generation, I understand, were brought up
on a work called " Line upon Line: Here a
Little, and there a Little." My Father's
ambition would not submit to anything
suggested by such a title as that, and he
committed, from his own point of view, a
101
FATHER AND SON
fatal mistake when he sought to build spires
and battlements without having been at the
pains to settle a foundation beneath them.
We were not always reading the '" Epistle to
the Hebrews," however; not always was my
flesh being made to creep by having it insisted
upon that " almost all things are by the Law
purged with blood, and without blood is no
remission of sin." In our lighter moods, we
turned to the "'Book of Revelation," and
chased the phantom of Popery through its
fuliginous pages. My Father, I think, missed
my Mother's company almost more acutely in
his researches into prophecy than in anything
else. This had been their unceasing recreation,
and no third person could possibly follow the
curious path which they had hewn for themselves through this jungle of symbols. But,
more and more, my Father persuaded himself
that I, too, was initiated, and by degrees I
was made to share in all his speculations and
interpretations.
Hand in hand we investigated the number
of the Beast, which number is six hundred
three score and six. Hand in hand we
inspected the nations, to see whether they
had the mark of Babylon in their fore.
heads. Hand in hand we watched the spirits
Iog2
FATHER AND SON
of devils gathering the kings of the earth into
the place which is called in the Hebrew
tongue Armageddon. Our unity in these
excursions was so delightful, that my Father
was lulled in any suspicion he might have
formed that I did not quite understand what
it was all about. Nor could he have desired a
pupil more docile or more ardent than I was
in my flaming denunciations of the Papacy.
If there was one institution more than
another which, at this early stage of my
history, I loathed and feared, it was what we
invariably spoke of as "the so-called Church
of Rome." In later years, I have met with
stout Protestants, gallant " Down-with-thePope" men from County Antrim, and ladies
who see the hand of the Jesuits in every
public and private misfortune. It is the habit
of a loose and indifferent age to consider this
dwindling body of enthusiasts with suspicion,
and to regard their attitude towards Rome as
illiberal. But my own feeling is that they are
all too mild, that their denunciations err on
the side of the anodyne. I have no longer
the slightest wish myself to denounce the
Roman communion, but, if it is to be done, I
have an idea that the latter-day Protestants
do not know how to do it. In Lord Beacons103
FATHER AND SON
field's phrase, these anti-Pope men "don't
understand their own silly business."' They
make concessions and allowances, they put on
gloves to touch the accursed thing.
Not - thus did we approach the Scarlet
Woman in the'fifties. We palliated nothing,
we believed in no good intentions, we used (I
myself used, in my tender innocency) language
of the seventeenth century such as is now no
longer introduced into any species of controversy. As a little boy, when I thought,
with intense vagueness, of the Pope, I used to
shut my eyes tight and clench my fists. We
welcomed any social disorder in any part of
Italy, as likely to be annoying to the Papacy.
If there was a custom-house officer stabbed in
a fracas at Sassari, we gave loud thanks that
liberty and light were breaking in upon
Sardinia. If there was an unsuccessful
attempt to murder the Grand Duke, we lifted
up our voices to celebrate the faith and
sufferings of the dear persecuted Tuscans, and
the record of some apocryphal monstrosity in
Naples would only reveal to us a glorious
opening for Gospel energy. My Father
celebrated the announcement in the newspapers of a considerable emigration from the
Papal Dominions, by rejoicing at "this out104
FATHER AND SON
crowding of many, throughout the harlot's
domain, from her sins and her plagues."
No, the Protestant League may consider
itself to be an earnest and active body, but 1
can never look upon its efforts as anything but
lukewarm, standing, as I do, with the light of
other days around me. As a child, whatever 1
might question, I never doubted the turpitude
of Rome. I do not think I had formed any
idea whatever of the character or pretensions or
practices of the Catholic Church, or indeed ot
what it consisted, or its nature, but I regarded
it with a vague terror as a wild beast, the only
good point about it being that it was very old
and was soon to die. When I turned to
Jukes or Newton for further detail, I could
not understand what they said. Perhaps, on
the whole, there was no disadvantage in that.
It is possible that some one may have
observed to my Father that the conditions of
our life were unfavourable to our health,
although I hardly think that he would have
encouraged any such advice. As I look back
upon this far-away time, I am surprised at the
absence in it of any figures but our own. He
and I together, now in the study among the
sea-anemones and star-fishes; now on the canalbridge, looking down at the ducks; now at our
105
FATHER AND SON
hard little meals, served up'as those of a dreamy
widower are likely to be when one maid-of-allwork provides them, now under the lamp at
the maps we both loved so much, this is what
I see:-no third presence is ever with us.
Whether it occurred to himself that such a
solitude a deux was excellent, in the long run,
for neither of us, or whether any chance visitor
or one of the " Saints," who used to see me at
the Room every Sunday morning, suggested
that a female influence might put a little rosecolour into my pasty cheeks, I know not. All
I am sure of is that one day, towards the close
of the summer, as I was gazing into the street,
I saw a four-wheeled cab stop outside our
door, and deposit, with several packages, a
strange lady, who was shown up into my
Father's study and was presently brought down
and introduced to me.
Miss Marks, as I shall take the liberty of
calling this person, was so long a part of my
life that I must pause to describe her. She
was tall, rather gaunt, with high cheek-bones;
her teeth were prominent and very white; her
eyes were china-blue, and were always
absolutely fixed, wide open, on the person she
spoke to; her nose was inclined to be red at
the tip. She had a kind, hearty, sharp mode
106
FATHER AND SON
of talking, but did not exercise it much, being
on the whole taciturn. She was bustling and
nervous, not particularly refined, not quite, I
imagine, what is called " a lady." I supposed
her, if I thought of the matter at all, to be
very old, but perhaps she may have seen, when
we knew her first, some forty-five summers.
Miss Marks was an orphan, depending upon
her work for her living; she would not, in
these days of examinations, have come up to
the necessary educational standards, but she
had enjoyed experience in teaching, and was
prepared to be a conscientious and careful
governess, up to her lights. I was now informed by my Father that it was in this capacity
that she would in future take her place in our
household. I was not informed, what I
gradually learned by observation, that she
would also act in it as housekeeper.
Miss Marks was a somewhat grotesque personage, and might easily be painted as a kind
of eccentric Dickens character, a mixture of
Mrs. Pipchin and Miss Sally Brass. I will
confess that when, in years to come, I read
"Dombey and Son," certain features of Mrs.
Pipchin did irresistibly remind me of my excellent past governess. 1 can imagine Miss
Marks saying, but with a facetious intent, that
1o7
FATHER AND SON
i children who sniffed would not go to heaven.
But I was instantly ashamed of the parallel,
because my gaunt old friend was a thoroughly
good and honest woman, not intelligent and
not graceful, but desirous in every way to do
her duty. Her duty to me she certainly did,
and I am afraid I hardly rewarded her with
the devotion she deserved. From the first, I
was indifferent to her wishes, and, as much as
was convenient, I ignored her existence. She
held no power over my attention, and if I
accepted her guidance along the path of
instruction, it was because, odd as it may
sound, I really loved knowledge. I accepted
her company without objection, and though
there were occasional outbreaks of tantrums
on both sides, we got on very well together
for several years. I did not, however, at any
time surrender my inward will to the wishes
of Miss Marks.
In the circle of our life the religious element
took so preponderating a place, that it is impossible to avoid mentioning, what might
otherwise seem unimportant, the theological
views of Miss Marks. How my Father had
discovered her, or from what field of educational
enterprise he plucked her in her prime, I never
knew, but she used to mention that my Father's
108
FATHER AND SON
ministrations had "opened her eyes,". from
which "scales" had fallen. She had accepted,
on their presentation to her, the entire gamut
of his principles. Miss Marks was accustomed,
while putting me to bed, to dwell darkly on
the incidents of her past, which had, I fear,
been an afflicted one., I believe I do her
rather limited intelligence no injury when I
say that it was prepared to swallow, at one
mouthful, whatever my Father presented to it,
so delighted was its way-worn possessor to find
herself in a comfortable, or, at least, an independent position. She soon bowed, if there was
indeed any resistance from the first, very contentedly in the House of Rimmon, learning to
repeat, with marked fluency, the customary
formulas and shibboleths. On my own religious development she had no great influence.
Any such guttering theological rushlight as
Miss Marks might dutifully exhibit faded for
me in the blaze of my Father's glaring beaconlamp of faith.
Hardly was Miss Marks settled in the family,
than my Father left us on an expedition about
which my curiosity was exercised, but not
until later, satisfied. He had gone, as we
afterwards found, to South Devon, to a point
on the coast which he had known of old.
109
FATHER AND SON
Here he had hired a horse, and had ridden
about until he saw a spot he liked, where a
villa was being built on speculation. Nothing
equals the courage of these recluse men; my
Father got off his horse, and tied it to the gate,
and then he went in and bought the house on
a ninety-nine years' lease. I need hardly say
that he had made the matter a subject of the
most earnest prayer, and had entreated the
Lord for guidance. When he felt attracted to
this particular villa, he did not doubt that he
was directed to it in answer to his supplication,
and he wasted no time in further balancing or
inquiring. On my eighth birthday, with bag
and baggage complete, we all made the toilful
journey down into Devonshire, and I was a
town-child no longer.
110
CHAPTER V
A NEW element now entered into my life,
a fresh rival arose to compete for me with
my Father's dogmatic theology. This rival
was the Sea. When Wordsworth was a little
child, the presence of the mountains and the
clouds lighted up his spirit with gleams that
were like the flashing of a shield. He has
described, in the marvellous pages of the
"Prelude," the impact of nature upon the infant
soul, but he has described it vaguely and
faintly, with some "infirmity of love for days disowned by memory,"-I think because he was
brought up in the midst of spectacular beauty,
and could name no moment, mark no " here "
or " now," when the wonder broke upon him.
At the age of twice five summers, he thought
it was, that he began to hold unconscious
intercourse with nature, " drinking in a pure
organic pleasure" from the floating mists and
winding waters. Perhaps, in his anxiety to be
111
FATHER AND SON
truthful, and in the absence of any record, he
put the date of this conscious rapture too late
rather than too early. Certainly my own
impregnation with the obscurely-defined but
keenly-felt loveliness of the open sea dates
from the first week of my ninth year.
The village, on the outskirts of which we
had taken up our abode, was built parallel to
the cliff-line above the shore, but half a mile
inland. For a long time after the date I have
now reached, no other form of natural scenery
than the sea had any effect upon me at all.
The tors of the distant moor might be drawn
in deep blue against the pallor of our morning
or our evening sky, but I never looked at
them. It was the Sea, always the sea, nothing
but the sea. From our house, or from the
field at the back of our house, or from any
part of the village itself, there was no appearance to suggest that there could lie anything
in an easterly direction to break the infinitude
of red ploughed fields. But on that earliest
morning, how my heart remembers! we
hastened,-Miss Marks, the maid, and I
between them,-along a couple of high-walled
lanes, when suddenly, far below.us, in an
immense arc of light, there stretched the
enormous plain of waters. We had but to
112
FATHER AND SON
cross a step or two of downs, when the hollow
sides of the great limestone cove yawned at
our feet, descending, like a broken cup, down,
down to the moon of snow-white shingle and
the expanse of blue-green sea.
In these twentieth-century days, a careful
municipality has studded the down with rustic
seats and has shut its dangers out with railings,
has cut a winding carriage-drive round the
curves of the cove down to the shore, and has
planted sausage-laurels at intervals in clearings
made for that aesthetic purpose. When last I
saw the place, thus smartened and secured,
with its hair in curl-papers and its feet in
patent-leathers, I turned from it in anger and
disgust, and could almost have wept. I sup-,
pose that to those who knew it in no other
guise, it may still have beauty. No parish
councils, beneficent and shrewd, can obscure
the lustre of the waters or compress the vastness of the sky. But what man could do to
make wild beauty ineffectual, tame and empty,
has amply been performed at Oddicombe.
Very different was it fifty years ago, in its
uncouth majesty. No road, save the merest
goat-path, led down its concave wilderness, in
which loose furze-bushes and untrimmed
brambles wantoned into the likeness of trees,
113
H
FATHER AND SON
each draped in audacious tissue of wild clematis. Through this fantastic maze the
traveller wound his way, led by little other
clue than by the instinct of descent. For me,
as a child, it meant the labour of a long, an
endless morning, to descend to the snow-white
pebbles, to sport at the edge of the cold, sharp
sea, and then to climb up home again, slipping
in the sticky red mud, clutching at the smooth
boughs of the wild ash, toiling, toiling upwards
into flat land out of that hollow world of
rocks.
On the first occasion, I recollect, our Cockney housemaid, enthusiastic young creature
that she was, flung herself down upon her
knees, and drank of the salt waters. Miss
Marks, more instructed in phenomena, refrained, but I, although I was perfectly aware
what the taste would be, insisted on sipping a
few drops from the palm of my hand. This
was a slight recurrence of what I have called
my " natural magic" practices, which had
passed into the background of my mind, but
had not quite disappeared. I recollect that I
thought I might secure some power of walking on the sea, if I drank of it-a perfectly
irrational movement of mind, like those of
savages.
114
FATHER AND SON
My great desire was to walk out over
the sea as far as I could, and then lie flat i
on it, face downwards, and peer into the
depths. -- I was tormented with this ambition,
and, like many grown-up people, was so fully
occupied by these vain and ridiculous desires
that 1 neglected the actual natural pleasures
around me. The idea was not quite so demented as it may seem, because we were in
the habit of singing, as well as reading, of
those enraptured beings who spend their days
in "flinging down their golden crowns upon
the jasper sea." Why, I argued, should I not
be able to fling down my straw hat upon the
tides of Oddicombe? And, without question,
a majestic scene upon the Lake of Gennesaret
had also inflamed my fancy. Of all these
things, of course, I was careful to speak to no
one.
It was not with Miss Marks, however, but
with my Father, that I became accustomed to
make the laborious and exquisite journeys
down to the sea and back again. His work
as a naturalist eventually took him, laden with
implements, to the rock-pools on the shore, and
I was in attendance as an acolyte. But our
earliest winter in South Devon was darkened
for us both by disappointments, the cause of
1i5
FATHER AND SON
which lay, at the time, far out of my reach.
In the spirit of my Father were then running,
with furious velocity, two hostile streams of
influence. I was standing, just now, thinking
of these things, where the Cascine ends in the
wooded point which is carved out sharply by
the lion-coloured swirl of the Arno on the one
side and by the pure flow of the Mugnone on
the other. The rivers meet, and run parallel,
but there comes a moment when the one or
the other must conquer, and it is the yellow
vehemence that drowns the purer tide.
So, through my Father's brain, in that year
of scientific crisis, 1857, there rushed two kinds
of thought, each absorbing, each convincing,
yet totally irreconcilable. There is a peculiar
agony in the paradox that truth has two forms,
each of them indisputable, yet each antagonistic to the other. It was this discovery,
that there were two theories of physical life,
each of which was true, but the truth of each
incompatible with the truth of the other,
which shook the spirit of my Father with
perturbation. It was not, really, a paradox, it
was a fallacy, if he could only have known it,
(but he allowed the turbid volume of superstition to drown the delicate stream of reason.)
He took one step in the service of truth, and
116
FATHER AND SON
then he drew back in an agony, and accepted
the servitude of error.
This was the great moment in the history
of thought when the theory of the mutability
of species was preparing to throw a flood of
light upon all departments of human speculation and action. It was becoming necessary to
stand emphatically in one army or the other.
Lyell was surrounding himself with disciples,
who were making strides in the direction of
discovery. Darwin had long been collecting
facts with regard to the variation of animals
and plants. Hooker and Wallace, Asa Gray
and even Agassiz, each in his own sphere, were
coming closer and closer to a perception of that
secret which was first to reveal itself clearly
to the patient and humble genius of Darwin.
In the year before, in 1856, Darwin, under
pressure from Lyell, had begun that modest
statement of the new revelation, that " abstract
of an essay," which developed so mightily into
" The Origin of Species." Wollaston's " Variation of Species " had just appeared, and had
been a nine days' wonder in the wilderness.
On the other side, the reactionaries, although
never dreaming of the fate which hung over
them, had not been idle. In 1857 the astounding question had for the first time been
117
FATHER AND SON
propounded with contumely, " What, then, did
we come from an orang-outang?" The famous
"Vestiges of Creation " had been supplying a
sugar-and-water panacea for those who could
not escape from the trend of evidence, and who
yet clung to revelation. Owen was encouraging reaction by resisting, with all the strength
of his prestige, the theory of the mutability of
species.
In this period of intellectual ferment, as
when a great political revolution is being
planned, many possible adherents were confidentially tested with hints and encouraged to
reveal their bias in a whisper. It was the
notion of Lyell, himself a great mover of men,
that before the doctrine of natural selection
was given to a world which would be sure to
lift up at it a howl of execration, a certain
body-guard of sound and experienced naturalists, expert in the description of species, should
be privately made aware of its tenour. Among
those who were thus initiated, or approached
with a view towards possible illumination, was
my Father. He was spoken to by Hooker, and
later on by Darwin, after meetings of the Royal
Society in the summer of 1857.
My Father's attitude towards the theory of
natural selection was critical in his career, and,
118
FATHER AND SON
oddly enough, it exercised an immense influence
on my own experience as a child. Let it be
admitted at once, mournful as the admission is,
that every instinct in his intelligence went out
at first to greet the new light. It had hardly
done so, when a recollection of the opening
chapter of " Genesis" checked it at the outset. He consulted with Carpenter, a great
investigator, but one who was fully as incapable as himself of remodelling his ideas with
regard to the old, accepted hypotheses. They
both determined, on various grounds, to have
nothing to do with the terrible theory, but to
hold steadily to the law of the fixity of species.
It was exactly at this juncture that we left
London, and the slight and occasional, but
always extremely salutary personal intercourse
with men of scientific leading which my Father
had enjoyed at the British Museum and at the
Royal Society came to an end. His next act
was to burn his ships, down to the last beam
and log out of which a raft could have been
made. By a strange act of wilfulness, he
closed the doors upon himself for ever.
My Father had never admired Sir Charles
Lyell. I think that the famous " Lord
Chancellor manner" of the geologist intimidated him, and we undervalue the intelligence
119
FATHER AND SON
of those whose conversation puts us at a disadvantage. For Darwin and Hooker, on the
other hand, he had a profound esteem, and I
know not whether this had anything to do
with the fact that he chose, for his impetuous
experiment in reaction, the field of geology,
rather than that of zoology or botany. Lyell
had been threatening to publish a book on the
geological history of Man, which was to be a
bomb-shell flung into the camp of the catastrophists. My Father, after long reflection,
prepared a theory of his own, which, as he
fondly hoped, would take the wind out of
Lyell's sails, and justify geology to godly
readers of "Genesis." It was, very briefly,
that there had been no gradual modification of
the surface of the earth, or slow development
of organic forms, but that when the catastrophic act of creation took place, the world
presented, instantly, the structural appearance
of a planet on which life had long existed.
The theory, coarsely enough, and to my
Father' great indignation, was defined by a
hasty press as being this-that God hid the fossils in the rocks in order to tempt geologists
into infidelity. In truth, it was the logical and
inevitable conclusion of accepting, literally,
the doctrine of a sudden act of creation; it
120
FATHER AND SON
emphasised the fact that any breach in the
circular course of nature could be conceived
only on the supposition that the object
created bore false witness to past processes,
which had never taken place. For instance,
Adam would certainly possess hair and teeth
and bones in a condition which it must have
taken many years to accomplish, yet he was
created full-grown yesterday. He would certainly-though Sir Thomas Browne denied it
-display an omphalos, yet no umbilical cord
had ever attached him to a mother.
Never was a book cast upon the waters with
greater anticipations of success than was this
curious, this obstinate, this fanatical volume.
My Father lived in a fever of suspense, waiting
for the tremendous issue. This " Omphalos "
of his, he thought, was to bring all the turmoil
of scientific speculation to a close, fling
geology into the arms of Scripture, and make
the lion eat grass with the lamb. It was not
surprising, he admitted, that there had been
experienced an ever-increasing discord between
the facts which geology brings to light and
the direct statements of the early chapters of
"Genesis." Nobody was to blame for that.
My Father, and my Father alone, possessed the
secret of the enigma; he alone held the key
121
FATHER AND SON
which could smoothly open the lock of geological mystery. He offered it, with a glowing gesture, to atheists and Christians alike.
This was to be the universal panacea; this the
system of intellectual therapeutics which could
not but heal all the maladies of the age. But,
alas! atheists and Christians alike looked at it
and laughed, and threw it away.
In the course of that dismal winter, as thepost
began to bring in private letters, few and chilly,
and public reviews, many and scornful, my
Father looked in vain for the approval of the
churches, and in vain for the acquiescence of the
scientific societies, and in vain for the gratitude
of those 6" thousands of thinking persons,"
which he had rashly assured himself of receiving. As his reconciliation of Scripture statements and geological deductions was welcomed
nowhere; as Darwin continued silent, and the
youthful Huxley was scornful, and even Charles
Kingsley, from whom my Father had expected
the most instant appreciation, wrote that he
could not "give up the painful and slow conclusion of five and twenty years' study of geology,
and believe that God has written on the rocks
one enormous and superfluous lie,"-as all
this happened or failed to happen, a gloom,
cold and dismal, descended upon our morning
122
g^.;i-A ': ' *
FATHER AND SON
teacups. It was what the poets mean by an
"inspissated " gloom; it thickened day by day,
as hope and self-confidence evaporated,in thin
clouds of disappointment. My Father was not
prepared for such a fate. He had been the
spoiled darling of the public, the constant
favourite of the press, and now, like the dark
angels of old,
so huge a rout
Encumbered him with ruin.
He could not recover from amazement at
having offended everybody by an enterprise
which had been undertaken in the cause of
universal reconciliation.
During that grim season, my Father was no
lively companion, and circumstance after circumstance combined to drive him further from
humanity. He missed more than ever the sympathetic ear of my Mother; there was present
to support him nothing bf that artful, female
casuistry which insinuates into the wounded
consciousness of a man the conviction that,
after all, he is right and all the rest of the
world is wrong. My Father used to tramp in
solitude round and round the red ploughed
field which was going to be his lawn, or, sheltering himself from the thin Devonian rain,
pace up and down the still-naked verandah
123
FATHER AND SON
where blossoming creepers were to be. And
I think that there was added to his chagrin
with all his fellow mortals a first tincture of
that heresy which was to attack him later on.
It was now that, I fancy, he began, in his
depression, to be angry with God. How
much devotion had he given, how many sacrifices had he made, only to be left storming
round this red morass with no one in all the
world to care for him except one pale-faced
child with its cheek pressed to the window!
After one or two brilliant excursions to the
sea, winter, in its dampest, muddiest, most
languid form, had fallen upon us and shut us
in. It was a dreary winter for the wifeless
man and the motherless boy. We had come
into the house, in precipitate abandonment to
that supposed answer to prayer, a great deal
too soon. In order to rake together the lump
sum for buying it, my Father had denuded
himself of almost everything, and our sticks of
chairs and tables filled but two or three rooms.
Half the little house, or " villa" as we called
it, was not papered, two-thirds were not
furnished. The workmen were still finishing
the outside when we arrived, and in that connection I recall a little incident which exhibits
my Father's morbid delicacy of conscience.
124
FATHER AND SON
He was accustomed, in his brighter moments
-and this was before the publication of his
" Omphalos "-occasionally to sing loud Dorsetshire songs of his early days, in a strange,
broad Wessex lingo that I loved. One
October afternoon he and I were sitting on
the verandah, and my father was singing;
just round the corner, out of sight, two carpenters were putting up the framework of a
greenhouse. In a pause, one of them said to
his fellow: "He can zing a zong, zo well's k
another, though he be a minister." My Father,
who was holding my hand loosely, clutched it,
and looking up, I saw his eyes darken. He
never sang a secular song again during the
whole of his life.
Later in the year, and after his literary
misfortune, his conscience became more
troublesome than ever. I think he considered
the failure of his attempt at the reconciliation
of science with religion to have been intended,
by God as a punishment for something he had
done or left undone. In those brooding tramps
round and round the garden, his soul was on
its knees searching the corners of his conscience
for some sin of omission or commission, and one
by one every pleasure, every recreation, every
trifle scraped out of the dust of past experience,
125
FATHER AND SON
was magnified into a huge offence. He
thought that the smallest evidence of levity,
the least unbending to human instinct, might
be seized by those around him as evidence of
inconsistency, and might lead the weaker
brethren into offence. The incident of the
carpenters and the comic song is typical of a
condition of mind which now possessed my
Father, in which act after act became taboo,
not because each was sinful in itself, but because it might lead others into sin.
I have the conviction that Miss Marks was
now mightily afraid of my Father. Whenever
she could, she withdrew to the room she called
her " boudoir," a small, chilly apartment,
sparsely furnished, looking over what was in
process of becoming the vegetable garden.
Very properly, that she might have some
sanctuary, Miss Marks forbade me to enter
this virginal bower, which, of course, became
to me an object of harrowing curiosity.
Through the key-hole I could see practically
nothing; one day I contrived to slip inside,
and discovered that there was nothing to see
but a plain bedstead and a toilet-table, void of
all attraction. In this "boudoir," on winter
afternoons, a fire would be lighted, and Miss
Marks would withdraw to it, not seen by us
126
FATHER AND SON
any more between high-tea and the apocalyptic
exercise known as "worship"-in less strenuous
households much less austerely practised under
the name of "family prayers." Left meanwhile to our own devices, my Father would
mainly be reading, his book or paper held close
up to the candle, while his lips and heavy eyebrows occasionally quivered and palpitated,
with literary ardour, in a manner strangely exciting to me. Miss Marks, in a very high cap,
and her large teeth shining, would occasionally
appear in the doorway, desiring, with spurious
geniality, to know how we were " getting on."
But on these occasions neither of us replied to
Miss Marks.
Sometimes, in the course of this winter, my
Father and I had long cosy talks together over
the fire. Our favourite subject was murders. i
I wonder whether little boys of eight, soon to
go up-stairs alone at night, often discuss violent
crime with a widower-papa? The practice, I
cannot help thinking, is unusual; it was, however, consecutive with us. We tried other
secular subjects, but we were sure to come
round at last to " what do you suppose they
really did with the body?" I was told, a
thrilled listener, the adventure of Mrs. Manning,
who killed a gentleman on the stairs and buried
127
FATHER AND SON
him in quick-lime in the back-kitchen, and it
was at this time that I learned the useful
historical fact, which abides with me after half"
a century, that Mrs. Manning was hanged.
in black satin, which thereupon went wholly\
out of fashion in England. I also heard
about Burke and Hare, whose story nearly
froze me into stone with horror.
These were crimes which appear in the
chronicles. But who will tell me what " the
Carpet-bag Mystery" was, which my Father
and I discussed evening after evening? I have
never come across a whisper of it since, and I
suspect it of having been a hoax. As I recall
the details, people in a boat, passing down the
Thames, saw a carpet-bag hung high in air,
on one of the projections of a pier of Waterloo
Bridge. Being with difficulty dragged downor perhaps up-this bag was found to be full
of human remains, dreadful butcher's business
of joints and fragments. Persons were missed,
were identified, were again denied-the whole
is a vapour in my memory which shifts as I try
to define it. But clear enough is the picture
I hold of myself, in a high chair, on the lefthand side of the sitting-room fire-place, the
leaping flames reflected in the glass-case of
tropical insects on the opposite wall, and my
128
FATHER AND SON
Father, leaning anxiously forward, with uplifted
finger, emphasising to me the pros and cons of
the horrible carpet-bag evidence.
I suppose that my interest in these discussions and Heaven knows I was animated
enough-amused and distracted my Father,
whose idea of a suitable theme for childhood's
ear now seems to me surprising. I soon found
that these subjects were not welcome to everybody, for, starting the Carpet-bag Mystery one
morning with Miss Marks, in the hope of delaying my arithmetic lesson, she fairly threw
her apron over her ears, and told me, from that
vantage, that if I did not desist at once, she
should scream.
Occasionally we took winter walks together,
my Father and I, down some lane that led to a
sight of the sea, or over the rolling downs.
We tried to recapture the charm of those delightful strolls in London, when we used to
lean over the bridges and watch the ducks.
But we could not recover this pleasure. My
Father was deeply enwoven in the chain of his
own thoughts, and would stalk on, without a
word, buried in angry reverie. If he spoke to
me, on these excursions, it was a pain to me to
answer him. I could talk on easy terms with
him indoors, seated in my high chair, with our
129
FATHER AND SON
heads on a level, but it was intolerably laborious to look up into the firmament and converse
with a dark face against the sky. The actual
exercise of walking, too, was very exhausting to
me; the bright red mud, to the strange colour
of which I could not for a long while get accustomed, becoming caked about my little
shoes, and wearying me extremely. I would
grow petulant and cross, contradict my Father,
and oppose his whims. These walks were distressing to us both, yet he did not like to walk
alone, and he had no other friend. However,
as the winter advanced, they had to be abandoned, and the habit of our taking a " constitutional" together was never resumed.
I look back upon myself at this time as upon
a cantankerous, ill-tempered and unobliging
child. The only excuse I can offer is that I
really was not well. The change to Devonshire had not suited me; my health gave the
excellent Miss Marks some anxiety, but she
was not ready in resource. The dampness of
the house was terrible; indoors and out, the
atmosphere seemed soaked in chilly vapours.
Under my bed-clothes at night I shook like a
jelly, unable to sleep for cold, though I was
heaped with coverings, while my skin was all
puckered with goose-flesh. 1 could eat nothing
130
FATHER AND SON
solid, without suffering immediately from violent hiccough, so that much of my time was
spent lying prone on my back upon the hearthrug, awakening the echoes like a cuckoo.
Miss Marks, therefore, cut off all food but
milk-sop, a loathly bowl of which appeared at
every meal. In consequence the hiccough
lessened, but my strength declined with it. I
languished in a perpetual catarrh. I was roused
to a consciousness that I was not considered
well by the fact that my Father prayed publicly at morning and evening " worship " that
if it was the Lord's will to take me to himself
there might be no doubt whatever about my
being a sealed child of God and an inheritor
of glory. I was partly disconcerted by, partly
vain of, this open advertisement of my ailments.
Of our dealings with the " Saints," a fresh
assortment of whom met us on our arrival in
Devonshire, I shall speak presently. My
Father's austerity of behaviour was, I think,
perpetually accentuated by his fear of doing
anything to offend the consciences of these
persons, whom he supposed, no doubt, to be
more sensitive than they really were. He was
fond of saying that "a very little stain Upon1
the conscience makes a wide breach in our
131
FATHER AND SON
communion with God," and he counted
possible errors of conduct by hundreds and by
thousands. It was in this winter that his
attention was particularly drawn to the
festival of Christmas, which, apparently, he
had scarcely noticed in London.
On the subject of all feasts of the Church he
held views of an almost grotesque peculiarity.
He looked upon each of them as nugatory
and worthless, but the keeping of Christmas
appeared to him by far the most hateful, and
nothing less than an act of idolatry. "The
very word is Popish," he used to exclaim,
"Christ's Mass!" pursing up his lips with the
gesture of one who tastes assafoetida by
accident. Then he would adduce the antiquity of the so-called feast, adapted from
horrible heathen rites, and itself a soiled relic
of the abominable Yule-Tide. He would
denounce the horrors of Christmas until it
almost made me blush to look at a hollyberry.
On Christmas Day of this year 1857 our
villa saw a very unusual sight. My Father
had given strictest charge that no difference
whatever was to be made in our meals on
that day; the dinner was to be neither more
copious than usual nor less so. He was
132
FATHER AND SON
obeyed, but the servants, secretly rebellious,
made a small plum-pudding for themselves.
(I discovered afterwards, with pain, that Miss
Marks received a slice of it in her boudoir.)
Early in the afternoon, the maids,-of whom
we were now advanced to keeping two,kindly remarked that "the poor dear child
ought to have a bit, anyhow," and wheedled
me into the kitchen, where I ate a slice of
plum-pudding. Shortly I began to feel that
pain inside which in my frail state was
inevitable, and my conscience smote me
violently. At length I could bear my
spiritual anguish no longer, and bursting into
the study I called out: "Oh! Papa, Papa,
I have eaten of flesh offered to idols!" It
took some time, between my sobs, to explain
what had happened. Then my Father sternly
said: " Where is the accursed thing?" I
explained that as much as was left of it
was still on the kitchen table. He took me
by the hand, and ran with me into the
midst of the startled servants, seized what
remained of the pudding, and with the plate
in one hand and me still tight in the other,
ran till we reached the dust-heap, when he
flung the idolatrous confectionery on to the
middle of the ashes, and then raked it deep
133
FATHE;R AND SONT
down into the mass. lThe suddenness, the
violence, the velocity of this extraordinary act;
made an impression on my memory which
nothing will ever efface.
The key is lost by which I might unlock
the perverse malady from which my Father's
conscience seemed to suffer during the whole
of this melancholy winter. But I think that
a dislocation of his intellectual system had a
great deal to do with it. Up to this point in
his career, he had, as we havre seen, nourished
the delusion that science and revelation could
be mutually justified, that some sort of
comnpromise was possible. With great and
ever greater distinctness, his investigations
had shown him that in all departments of
organic nature there are visible the evidences
of slow modification of formns, of the type
developed by the pressure and practice of
t~ons. Tlhis conviction had been borne in
upon him until it was positively irresistible.
Wphere was his place, then, as a sincere and
accurate observer? Manifestly, it was with
the pioneers of the new truth, it was with
Darwin, Wallace and Hooker. But Xdid not.;
the second chapter of " Genesis "~ say that in
six days the heavens and earth were finished,
and the host of them, and that on the seventh
1.34
FATHER AND SON
day God ended his work which he had
made?
Here was a dilemma! Geology certainly,
seemed to be true, but the Bible, which was
God's word, was true. If the Bible said that
all things in Heaven and Earth were created
in six days, created in six days they were,-in
six literal days of twenty-four hours each. The
evidences of spontaneous variation of form,
acting, over an immense space of time, upon
ever-modifying organic structures, seemed
overwhelming, but they must either be
brought into line with the six-day labour of
creation, or they must be rejected. I have
already shown how my Father worked out
the ingenious " Omphalos" theory in order to
justify himself as a strictly scientific observer
who was also a humble slave of revelation.
But the old convention and the new rebellion
would alike have none of his compromise.
To a mind so acute and at the same time
so narrow as that of my Father-a mind which
is all logical and positive without breadth,
without suppleness and without imagination
-to be subjected to a check of this kind is
agony. It has not the relief of a smaller
nature, which escapes from the dilemma by
some foggy formula; nor the resolution of a
135
FATHER AND SON
larger nature to take to it wings and surmount the obstacle. My Father, although
half suffocated by the emotion of being lifted,
as it were, on the great biological wave, never
dreamed of letting go his clutch of the ancient
tradition, but hung there, strained and buffeted.
It is extraordinarythat he-an "honest hodman
of science," as Huxley once called him-should
not have been content to allow others, whose
horizons were wider than his could be, to
pursue those purely intellectual surveys for
which he had no species of aptitude. As a
collector of facts and marshaller of observations,
he had not a rival in that age; his very absence
of imagination aided him in this work. But
he was more an attorney than a philosopher,
and he lacked that sublime humility which is
the crown of genius. For, this obstinate persuasion that he alone knew the mind of God,
that he alone could interpret the designs of
the Creator, what did it result from if not
from a congenital lack of that highest modesty
i which replies " I do not know " even to the
questions which Faith, with menacing finger,
insists on having most positively answered?
136
CHAPTER VI
DURING the first year of our life in Devonshire,
the ninth year of my age, my Father's existence,
and therefore mine, was almost entirely divided
between attending to the little community of
"Saints "in the village and collecting, examining and describing marine creatures from the
sea-shore. In the course of these twelve
months, we had scarcely any social distractions
of any kind, and I never once crossed the
bounds of the parish. After the worst of the
winter was over, my Father recovered much of
his spirits and his power of work, and the
earliest sunshine soothed and refreshed us both.
I was still almost always with him, but we had
now some curious companions.
The village, at the southern end of which
our villa stood, was not pretty, It had no
rural picturesqueness of any kind. The only
pleasant feature of it, the handsome and
ancient parish church, with its umbrageous
137
FATHER AND SON
churchyard, was then almost entirely concealed
by a congeries of mean shops, which were
ultimately, before the close of my childhood,
removed. The village consisted of two parallel
lines of contiguous houses, all whitewashed
and most of them fronted by trifling shopwindows; for half a mile this street ascended
to the church, and then it descended for
another half-mile, ending suddenly in fields,
the hedges of which displayed, at intervals,
the inevitable pollard elm-tree. The walk
through the village, which we seemed to make
incessantly, was very wearisome to me. I
dreaded the rudeness of the children, and
there was nothing in the shops to amuse
me. Walking on the inch or two of broken
pavement in front of the houses was disagreeable and tiresome, and the foetor which
breathed on close days from the open doors
and windows made me feel faint. But this
walk was obligatory, since the " Public Room,"
as our little chapel was called, lay at the
further extremity of tht dreary street.
We attended this place of worship immediately on our arrival, and my Father, uninvited
but unresisted, immediately assumed the administration of it. It was a square, empty
room, built, for I know not what purpose, over
138
FATHER AND SON
a stable. Ammoniac odours used to rise
through the floor as we sat there at our long
devotions. Before our coming, a little flock
of persons met in the Room, a community of
the indefinite sort just then becoming frequent
in the West of England, pious rustics connected with no other recognised body of
Christians, and depending directly on the
independent study of the Bible. They were
largely women, but there was more than a
sprinkling of men, poor, simple and generally
sickly. In later days, under my Father's ministration, the body increased and positively
flourished. It came to include retired professional men, an admiral, nay, even the
brother of a peer. But in those earliest years
the " brethren " and " sisters " were all of them
ordinary peasants. They were jobbing gardeners and journeymen carpenters, masons and
tailors, washerwomen and domestic servants.
I wish that I could paint, in colours so vivid
that my readers could perceive what their little
society consisted of, this quaint collection of
humble, conscientious, ignorant and gentle
persons. In chronicle or fiction, I have never
been fortunate enough to meet with anything
which resembled them. The caricatures of
enmity and worldly scorn are as crude, to my
139
FATHER AND SON
memory, as the unction of religious conventionality is featureless.
The origin of the meeting had been odd.
A few years before we came, a crew of Cornish
fishermen, quite unknown to the villagers,
were driven by stress of weather into the haven
under the cliff. They landed, and, instead of
going to a public-house, they looked about for
a room where they could hold a prayer-meeting.
They were devout Wesleyans; they had come
from the open sea, they were far from home,
and they had been starved by lack of their
customary religious privileges. As they stood
about in the street before their meeting, they
challenged the respectable girls who came out
to stare at them, with the question, " Do you
love the Lord Jesus, my maid?" Receiving
dubious answers, they pressed the inhabitants
to come in and pray with them, which several
did. Ann Burmington, who long afterwards
told me about it, was one of those girls, and
she repeated that the fishermen said, " What
a dreadful thing it will be, at the Last Day,
when the Lord says, ' Come, ye blessed,' and
says it not to you, and then, ' Depart, ye
cursed,' and you maidens have to depart."
They were finely-built young men, with
black beards and shining eyes, and I do not
140
FATHER AND SON
question that some flash of sex unconsciously
mingled with the curious episode, although
their behaviour was in all respects discreet.
It was, perhaps, not wholly a coincidence
that almost all those particular girls remained
unmarried to the end of their lives. After
two or three days, the fishermen went off to
sea again. They prayed and sailed away,
and the girls, who had not even asked their
names, never heard of them again. But several
of the young women were definitely converted,
and they formed the nucleus of our little
gathering.
My Father preached, standing at a desk; or
celebrated the communion in front of a deal
table, with a white napkin spread over it.
Sometimes the audience was so small, generally so unexhilarating, that he was discouraged,
but he never flagged in energy and zeal. Only
those who had given evidence of intelligent
acceptance of the theory of simple faith in
their atonement through the Blood of Jesus
were admitted to the communion, or, as it
was called "the Breaking of Bread.' It was
made a very strong point that no one should
"break bread,"-unless for good reason shown
-until he or she had been baptized, that is to
say, totally immersed, in solemn conclave, by
141
FATHER AND SON
the ministering brother. This rite used, in
our earliest days, to be performed, with
picturesque simplicity, in the sea on the
Oddicombe beach, but to this there were, even
in those quiet years, extreme objections. A
jeering crowd could scarcely be avoided, and
women, in particular, shrank from the ordeal.
This used to be a practical difficulty, and my
Father, when communicants confessed that
they had not yet been baptized, would shake
his head and say gravely, " Ah! ah! you shun
the Cross of Christ!" But that baptism in
the sea on the open beach was a " cross," he
would not deny, and when we built our own
little chapel, a sort of font, planked over, was
arranged in the room itself.
Among these quiet, taciturn people, there
were several whom I recall with affection.
In this remote corner of Devonshire, on the
road nowhither, they had preserved much of
the air of that eighteenth century which the
elders among them perfectly remembered.
There was one old man, born before the
French Revolution, whose figure often recurs
to me. This was James Petherbridge, the
Nestor of our meeting, extremely tall and
attenuated; he came on Sundays in a full,
white smock-frock, smartly embroidered
142
FATHER AND SON
down the front, and when he settled himself
to listen, he would raise this smock like a
skirt, and reveal a pair of immensely long thin
legs, cased in tight leggings, and ending in
shoes with buckles. As the sacred message
fell from my Father's lips, the lantern jaws of
Mr. Petherbridge slowly fell apart, while his
knees sloped to so immense a distance from
one another that it seemed as though they
never could meet again. He had been pious
all his life, and he used to tell us, in some
modest pride, that when he was a lad, the
farmer's wife who was his mistress used to say,
I think our Jem is going to be a Methody,
he do so hanker after godly discoursings."
Mr. Petherbridge was accustomed to pray
orally, at our prayer-meetings, in a funny old
voice like wind in a hollow tree, and he
seldom failed to express a hope that "the
Lord would support Miss Lafoy"-who was
the village schoolmistress, and one of our
congregation,-" in her labour of teaching the
young idea how to shoot." 1, not understanding this literary allusion, long believed the
school to be addicted to some species of pistolpractice.
The key of the Room was kept by Richard
Moxhay, the mason, who was of a generation
143
FATHER AND SON
younger than Mr. Petherbridge, but yet " getting on in years." Moxhay, I cannot tell
why, was always dressed in white corduroy,
on which any stain of Devonshire scarlet
mud was painfully conspicuous; when he
was smartened up, his appearance suggested
that somebody had given him a coating of
that rich Western whitewash which looks like
Devonshire cream. His locks were long and
sparse, and as deadly black as his clothes were
white. lHe was a modest, gentle man, with a
wife even more meek and gracious than himself. They never, to my recollection, spoke
unless they were spoken to, and their melancholy impassiveness used to vex my Father,
who once, referring to the Moxhays, described
them, sententiously but justly, as being "laborious, but it would be an exaggeration to say
happy, Christians." Indeed, my memory pictures almost all the " saints " of that early time
as sad and humble souls, lacking vitality, yet
) not complaining of anything definite. A quite
surprising number of them, it is true, male
and female, suffered from different forms of
consumption, so that the Room rang in winter
evenings with a discord of hacking coughs.
But it seems to me that, when I was quite
young, half the inhabitants of our rural district
144
FATHER AND SON
were affected with phthisis. No doubt, our
peculiar religious community was more likely
to attract the feeble members of a population,
than to tempt the flush and the fair.
Miss Marks, patient pilgrim that she was,
accepted this quaint society without a murmur, although I do not think it was much to
her taste. But in a very short time it was
sweetened to her by the formation of a devoted
and romantic friendship for one of the " sisters,"
who was, indeed, if my childish recollection
does not fail me, a very charming person.
The consequence of this enthusiastic alliance
was that I was carried into the bosom of the
family to which Miss Marks' new friend
belonged, and of these excellent people I must
give what picture I can. Almost opposite
the Room, therefore at the far end of the
village, across ones of the rare small gardens,
(in which this first winter I discovered with
rapture the magenta stars of a new flower,
hepatica)-a shop-window displayed a thin row
of plates and dishes, cups and saucers; above
it was painted the name of Burmington. This
china-shop was the property of three orphan
sisters, Ann, Mary Grace, and Bess, the latter
lately married to a carpenter, who was " elder"
at our meeting; the other two, resolute old
145
K
FATHER AND SON
maids. Ann, whom I have already mentioned,
had been one of the girls converted by the
Cornish fishermen. She was about ten years
older than Bess, and Mary Grace came halfway between them. Ann was a very worthy
woman, but masterful and passionate, suffering
from an ungovernable temper, which, at calmer
moments she used to refer to, not without
complacency, as "the sin which doth most
easily beset me." Bess was insignificant, and
vulgarised by domestic cares. But Mary
Grace was a delightful creature.
The Burmingtons lived in what was almost
the only old house surviving in the village.
It was an extraordinary construction of two
storeys, with vast rooms, and winding passages,
and surprising changes of level. The sisters
were poor, but very industrious, and never in
anything like want; they sold, as I have said,
crockery, and they took in washing, and did a
little fine needlework, and sold the produce of
a great, vague garden at the back. In process
of time, the elder sisters took a young woman,
whose name was Drusilla Elliott, to live with
them as servant and companion; she was a
converted person, worshipping with a kindred
sect, the Bible Christians. 1 remember
being much interested in hearing how Bess,
143
FATHER AND SON
before her marriage, became converted. Mary
Grace, on account of her infirm health, slept
alone in one room; in another, of vast size,
stood a family four-poster, where Ann slept with
Drusilla Elliott, and another bed in the same
room took Bess. The sisters and their friend
had been constantly praying that Bess might
" find peace," for she was still a stranger to
salvation. One night, she suddenly called out,
rather crossly, " What are you two whispering
about? Do go to sleep," to which Ann
replied " We are praying for you." "How do
you know," answered Bess, "that I don't
believe?." And then she told them that, that
very night, when she was sitting in the shop,
she had closed with God's offer of redemption.
Late in the night as it was, Ann and Drusilla
could do no less than go in and waken Mary
Grace, whom, however, they found awake,
praying, she too, for the conversion of Bess.
They told her the good news, and all four,
kneeling in the darkness, gave thanks aloud to
God for his infinite mercy.
It was Mary Grace Burmington who now
became the romantic friend of Miss Marks,
and a sort of second benevolence to me. She
must have been under thirty years of age; she
Was very small, and she was distressingly
147
FATHER AND SON
deformed in the spine, but she had an animated,
almost a sparkling countenance. When we
first arrived in the village, Mary Grace was
only just recovering from a gastric fever which
had taken her close to the grave. I remember
hearing that the vicar, a stout and pompous
man at whom we always glared defiance, went,
in Mary Grace's supposed extremity, to the
Burmingtons' shop-door, and shouted: Peace
be to this house," intending to offer his ministrations, but that Ann, who was in one of her
tantrums, positively hounded him from the
doorstep and down the garden, in her passionate nonconformity. Mary Grace, however,
recovered, and soon became, not merely Miss
Marks' inseparable friend, but my Father's
spiritual factotum. He found it irksome to
visit the "saints" from house to house, and
Mary Grace Burmington gladly assumed this
labour. She proved a most efficient coadjutor;
searched out, cherished and confirmed any of
those, especially the young, who were attracted
by my Father's preaching, and for several
years was a great joy and comfort to us all.
Even when her illness so increased that she
could no longer rise from her bed, she was a
centre of usefulness and cheerfulness from that
retreat, where she "received," in a kind of
148
FATHER AND SON
rustic state, under a patchwork coverlid that
was like a basket of flowers.
My Father, ever reflecting on what could be
done to confirm my spiritual vocation, to pin
me down, as it were, beyond any possibility of
escape, bethought him that it would accustom
me to what he called " pastoral work in the
Lord's service," if I accompanied Mary Grace
on her visits from house to house. If it
is remembered that I was only eight and a half
when this scheme was carried into practice, it
will surprise no one to hear that it was not
crowned with success. I disliked extremely
this visitation of the poor. I felt shy, I had
nothing to say, with difficulty could I understand their soft Devonian patois, and most of
all-a signal perhaps of my neurotic condition
-I dreaded and loathed the smells of their
cottages. One had to run over the whole
gamut of odours, some so faint that they
embraced the nostril with a fairy kiss, others
bluntly gross, of the " knock-you-down" order;
some sweet, with a dreadful sourness; some
bitter, with a smack of rancid hair-oil. There
were fine manly smells of the pigsty and the
open drain, and these prided themselves on
being all they seemed to be; but there were
also feminine odours, masquerading as you
149
FATHER AND SON
knew not what, in which penny whiffs, vials of
balm and opoponax, seemed to have become
tainted, vaguely, with the residue of the sloppail. It was not, I think, that the villagers
were particularly dirty, but those were days
before the invention of sanitary science, and
my poor young nose was morbidly, nay
ridiculously sensitive. I often came home
from " visiting the saints" absolutely incapable
of eating the milk-sop, with brown sugar
strewn over it, which was my evening meal.
There was one exception to my unwillingness to join in the pastoral labours of Mary
Grace. When she announced, on a fine afternoon, that we were going to Pavor and Barton,
I was always agog to start. These were two
hamlets in our parish, and, I should suppose,
the original home of its population. Pavor
was, even then, decayed almost to extinction,
but Barton preserved its desultory street of
ancient, detached cottages. Each, however
poor, had a wild garden round it, and, where
the inhabitants possessed some pride in their
surroundings, the roses and the jasmines and
that distinguished creeper,-which one sees nowhere at its best but in Devonshire cottagegardens,-the stately cotoniaster, made the
whole place a bower. Barton was in vivid
150.
FATHER AND SON
contrast to our own harsh, open, squalid village,
with its mean modern houses, its absence of
all vegetation. The ancient thatched cottages
of Barton were shut in by moist hills, and
canopied by ancient trees; they were approached along a deep lane which was all a
wonder and a revelation to me that spring,
since, in the very words of Shelley:
There in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,
Green cow-bind and the moonlight-coloured may,
And cherry blossoms, and white cups, whose wine.
Was the bright dew yet drained not by the day;
And wild roses, and ivy serpentine
With its dark buds and leaves, wandering astray.
Around and beyond Barton there lay fairyland. All was mysterious, unexplored, rich
with infinite possibilities. I should one day
enter it, the sword of make-believe in my
hand, the cap of courage on my head, "when
you are a big boy," said the oracle of Mary
Grace. For the present, we had to content
ourselves with being an unadventurous couple
-a little woman, bent half double, and a preternaturally sedate small boy-as we walked
very slowly, side by side, conversing on terms
of high familiarity, in which Biblical and
colloquial phrases were quaintly jumbled,
151
FATHER AND SON
through the sticky red mud of the Pavor lanes
with Barton as a bourne before us.
When we came home, my Father would
sometimes ask me for particulars. Where had
we been, whom had we found at home, what
testimony had those visited been able to give
of the Lord's goodness to them, what had
Mary Grace replied in the way of exhortation,
reproof or condolence? These questions I
hated at the time, but they were very useful
to me, since they gave me the habit of concentrating my attention on what was going on in
the course of our visits, in case I might be
called upon to give a report. My Father was
very kind in the matter; he cultivated my
powers of expression, he did not snub me
when I failed to be intelligent. But I overheard Miss Marks and Mary Grace discussing
the whole question under the guise of referring
to "you know whom, not a hundred miles
hence," fancying that I could not recognise
their little ostrich because its head was in a
bag of metaphor. I understood perfectly, and
gathered that they both of them thought this
business of my going into undrained cottages
injudicious. Accordingly, I was by degrees
taken "visiting" only when Mary Grace was
going into the country-hamlets, and then I was?:.: 152
FATHER AND SON
usually left outside, to skip among the flowers
and stalk the butterflies.
I must not, however, underestimate the very
prominent part taken all through this spring
and summer of 1858 by the collection of
specimens on the sea-shore. My Father had
returned, the chagrin of his failure in theorising now being mitigated, to what was his
real work in life, the practical study of animal
forms in detail. He was not a biologist, in the
true sense of the term. That luminous indication which Flaubert gives of what the action
of the scientific mind should be, "affranchissant
l'esprit et pesant les mondes, sans haine, sans
peur, sans pitie, sans amour et sans Dieu," was
opposed in every segment to the attitude of
my Father, who, nevertheless, was a man of
very high scientific attainment. But, again I
repeat, he was not a philosopher; he was incapable, by temperament and education, of
forming broad generalisations and of escaping
in a vast survey from the troublesome pettiness of detail. He saw everything through a
lens, nothing in the immensity of nature.
Certain senses were absent in him; I think
that, with all his justice, he had no conception
of the importance of liberty; with all his
intelligence, the boundaries of the atmosphere
153
FATHER AND SON
in which his mind could think at all were
always close about him; with all his faith in the
Word of God, he had no confidence in the
Divine Benevolence; and with all his passionate piety, he habitually mistook fear for love.
It was down on the shore, tramping along
the pebbled terraces of the beach, clambering
over the great blocks of fallen conglomerate
which broke the white curve with rufous
promontories that jutted into the sea, or,
finally, bending over those shallow tidal pools
in the limestone rocks which were our proper
hunting-ground,-it was in such circumstances
as these that my Father became most easy,
most happy, most human. That hard look
across his brows, which it wearied me to see,
the look that came from sleepless anxiety of
conscience, faded away, and left the dark
countenance still always stern indeed, but
serene and unupbraiding. Those pools were our
mirrors, in which, reflected in the dark hyaline
and framed by the sleek and shining fronds
of oar-weed, there used to appear the shapes
of a middle-aged man and a funny little boy,
equally eager, and, I almost find the presumption to say, equally well prepared for business.
If any one goes down to those shores
now, if man or boy seeks to follow in our
154
FATHER AND SON
traces, let him realise at once, before he takes
the trouble to roll up his sleeves, that his zeal
will end in labour lost. There is nothing,
now, where in our days there was so much.
Then the rocks between tide and tide were
submarine gardens of a beauty that seemed
often to be fabulous, and was positively delusive, since, if we delicately lifted the weedcurtains of a windless pool, though we might
for a moment see its sides and floor paven
with living blossoms, ivory-white, rosy-red,
orange and amethyst, yet all that panoply
would melt away, furled into the hollow rock,
if we so much as dropped a pebble in to
disturb the magic dream.
Half a century ago, in many parts of the
coast of Devonshire and Cornwall, where the
limestone at the water's edge is wrought into
crevices and hollows, the tide-line was, like
Keats' Grecian vase, "a still unravished bride
of quietness." These cups and basins were
always full, whether the tide was high or low,
and the only way in which they were affected
was that twice in the twenty-four hours they
were replenished by cold streams from the
great sea, and then twice were left brimming
to be vivified by the temperate movement of
the upper air. They were living flower-beds,
155
FATHER AND SON
so exquisite in their perfection, that my
Father, in spite of his scientific requirements,
used not seldom to pause before he began to
rifle them, ejaculating that it was indeed a
pity to disturb such congregated beauty.
The antiquity of these rock-pools, and the
infinite succession of the soft and radiant
forms, sea-anemones, sea-weeds, shells, fishes,
which had inhabited them, undisturbed since
the creation of the world, used to occupy my
Father's fancy. We burst in, he used to say,
where no one had ever thought of intruding
before; and if the Garden of Eden had been
situate in Devonshire, Adam and Eve,
stepping lightly down to bathe in the
rainbow-coloured spray, would have seen the
identical sights that we now saw,-the great
prawns gliding like transparent launches,
anthea waving in the twilight its thick white
waxen tentacles, and the fronds of the dulse
faintly streaming on the water, like huge
red banners in some reverted atmosphere.
All this is long over, and done with. The
ring of living beauty drawn about our shores
was a very thin and fragile one. It had
existed all those centuries solely in consequence
of the indifference, the blissful ignorance of
man. These rock-basins, fringed by corallines,
156
FATHER AND SON
filled with still water almost as pellucid as
the upper air itself, thronged with beautiful
sensitive forms of life,-they exist no longer,
they are all profaned, and emptied, and
vulgarised. An army of "collectors" has
passed over them, and ravaged every corner of
them. The fairy paradise has been violated,
the exquisite product of centuries of natural
selection has been crushed under the rough
paw of well-meaning, idle-minded curiosity.
That my Father, himself so reverent, so
conservative, had by the popularity of his
books acquired the direct responsibility for a
calamity that he had never anticipated,
became clear enough to himself before many
years had passed, and cost him great chagrin.
No one will see again on the shore of England
what I saw in my early childhood, the
submarine vision of dark rocks, speckled and
starred with an infinite variety of colour, and
streamed over by silken flags of royal crimson
and purple.
In reviving these impressions, I am unable
to give any exact chronological sequence to
them. These particular adventures began
early in 1858, they reached their greatest
intensity in the summer of 1859, and they did
not altogether cease, so far as my Father was
157
FATHER AND SON
concerned, until nearly twenty years later.
But it was while he was composing what, as I
am told by scientific men of to-day, continues to be his most valuable contribution to
knowledge, his " History of the British SeaAnemones and Corals," that we worked together on the shore for a definite purpose, and
the last instalment of that still-classic volume
was ready for press by the close of 1859.
The way in which my Father worked, in
his most desperate escapades, was to wade
breast-high into one of the huge pools, and
examine the worm-eaten surface of the rock
above and below the brim. In such remote
places-spots where I could never venture,
being left, a slightly timorous Andromeda,
chained to a safer level of the cliff --in these
extreme basins, there used often to lurk a
marvellous profusion of animal and vegetable
forms. My Father would search' for the
roughest and most corroded points of rock,
those offering the best refuge for a variety of
creatures, and would then chisel off fragments
as low down in the water as he could. These
pieces of rock were instantly plunged in the
salt water of jars which we had brought with
us for the purpose. When as much had
been collected as we could carry away --my
158
l
FATHER AND SON
Father always dragged about an immense
square basket, the creak of whose handles I
can still fancy that I hear-we turned to
trudge up the long climb home. Then all
our prizes were spread out, face upward, in
shallow pans of clean sea-water.
In a few hours, when all dirt had subsided,
and what living creatures we had brought
seemed to have recovered their composure, my
work began. My eyes were extremely keen and
powerful, though they were vexatiously nearsighted. Of no use in examining objects at!
any distance, in investigating a minute surface
my vision was trained to be invaluable. The
shallow pan, with our spoils, would rest on a
table near the window, and I, kneeling on a
chair opposite the light, would lean over the
surface till everything was within an inch or
two of my eyes. Often I bent, in my zeal, so
far forward that the water touched the tip of
my nose and gave me a little icy shock. In
this attitude-an idle spectator might have
formed the impression that I was trying to
wash my head and could not quite summon
up resolution enough to plunge-in this odd
pose I would remain for a long time, holding
my breath, and examining with extreme care
every atom of rock, every swirl of detritus.
159
FATHER AND SON
This was a task which my Father could only
perform by the help of a lens, with which, of
course, he took care to supplement my examination. But that my survey was of use, he
has himself most handsomely testified in his
"Actinologia Britannica," where he expresses
his debt to the " keen and well-practised eye
X of my little son." Nor, if boasting is not to
A be excluded, is it every eminent biologist,! every proud and masterful F.R.S., who can?A: lay his hand on his heart and swear that,
before reaching the age of ten years, he had
added, not merely a new species, but a new
genus to the British fauna. That, however,
the author of these pages can do, who on
June 29, 1859, discovered a tiny atom,-and
ran in the greatest agitation to announce the
discovery of that object " as a form with
which he was unacquainted," --which figures
since then on all lists of sea-anemones as
phellia murocincta, or the walled corklet.
Alas! that so fair a swallow should have
made no biological summer in after-life.
These delicious agitations by the edge of
the salt sea wave must have greatly improved
my health, which however was still looked
upon as fragile. I was loaded with coats and
comforters, and strolled out between Miss
160
FATHER AND SON
Marks and Mary Grace Burmington, a muffled
ball of flannel. This alone was enough to
give me a look of delicacy, which the " saints,"
in their blunt way, made no scruple of commenting upon to my face. I was greatly
impressed by a conversation held over my bed
one evening by the servants. Our cook, Susan,
a person of enormous size, and Kate, the tattling, tiresome parlour-maid who waited upon
us, on the summer evening 1 speak of were
standing-I cannot tell why-on each side of
my bed. I shut my eyes, and lay quite still,
in order to escape conversing with them, and
they spoke to one another. " Ah, poor lamb,"'
Kate said trivially, "he's not long for this
world; going home to Jesus, he is,-in a jiffy,
I should say by the look of 'un." But Susan
answered: "Not so. I dreamed about 'un,
and I know for sure that he is to be spared
for missionary service." " Missionary service?"
repeated Kate, impressed. "Yes," Susan went
on, with solemn emphasis, "he'll bleed for his
Lord in heathen parts, that's what the future >
have in store for 'im. When they were gone,
( I beat upon the coverlid with my fists, and
\ I determined that whatever happened, I would
i not, not, not, go out to preach the Gospel
among horrid, tropical niggers.
161 L
CHAPTER VII
IN the history of an infancy so cloistered and
uniform as mine, such a real adventure as my
being publicly and successfully kidnapped
cannot be overlooked. There' were several
"innocents " in our village, harmless eccentrics
who had more or less unquestionably crossed
the barrier which divides the sane from the
insane. They were not discouraged by public
opinion; indeed, several of them were favoured
\X beings, suspected by my Father of exaggerating
their mental density in order to escape having
to work, like dogs, who, as we all know, could
speak as well as we do, were they not afraid
of being made to fetch and carry. Miss Mary
Flaw was not one of these imbeciles. She was
what the French call a detraquee; she had
enjoyed a good intelligence and an active mind,, but her wits had left the rails and were
careering about the country. Miss Flaw was
the daughter of a retired Baptist minister,
162
FATHER AND SON
and she lived, with I remember not what relations, in a little solitary house high up at
Barton Cross, whither Mary Grace and I
would sometimes struggle when our pastoral
duties were over. In later years, when I met
with those celebrated verses in which the
philosopher expresses the hope
In the downhill of life, when I find I'm declining,
May my lot no less fortunate be
Than a snug elbow-chair can afford for reclining,
And a cot that o'erlooks the wide sea,
my thoughts returned instinctively, and they
still return, to the high abode of Miss Flaw.
There was a porch at her door, both for shelter
and shade, and it was covered with jasmine;
but the charm of the place was a summerhouse close by, containing a table, encrusted
with cowry-shells, and seats from which one
saw the distant waters of the bay. At the
entrance to this grot there was always set a
"~snug elbow-chair," destined, I suppose, for
the Rev. Mr. Flaw, or else left there in pious
memory of him, since I cannot recollect
whether he was alive or dead.
I delighted in these visits to Mary Flaw.
She always received us with effusion, tripping
forward to meet us, and leading us, each by a
hand held high, with a dancing movement
W6s
FATHER AND SON
which I thought infinitely graceful, to the
cowry-shell bower, where she would regale us
with Devonshire cream and with small hard
biscuits that were like pebbles. The conversation of Mary Flaw was a great treat to
me. I enjoyed its irregularities, its waywardness; it was like a tune that wandered into,i several keys. As Mary Grace Burmington put
it, one never knew what dear Mary Flaw
j would say next, and that she did not herself
know added to the charm. She had become
crazed, poor thing, in consequence of a
disappointment in love, but of course I did
not know that, nor that she was crazed at all.
I thought her brilliant and original, and I
liked her very much. In the light of coming
events, it would be affectation were I to
pretend that she did not feel a similar
partiality for me.
Miss Flaw was, from the first, devoted to
my Father's ministrations, and it was part of
our odd village indulgence that no one ever
dreamed of preventing her from coming to
the Room. On Sunday evenings the bulk of
the audience was arranged on forms, with backs
to them, set in the middle of the floor, with a
passage round them, while other forms were
placed against the walls. My Father preached
164
FATHER AND SON
from a lectern, facing the audience. If darkness came on in the course of the service,
Richard Moxhay, glimmering in his creamwhite corduroys, used to go slowly round,
lighting groups of tallow candles by the help
of a box of lucifers. Mary Flaw always
assumed the place of honour, on the left
extremity of the front bench, immediately
opposite my Father. Miss Marks and Mary
Grace, with me ensconced and almost buried
between them, occupied the right of the same
bench. While the lighting proceeded. Miss
Flaw used to direct it from her seat, silently,
by pointing out to Moxhay, who took no
notice, what groups of candles he should light
next. She did this just as the clown in the
circus directs the grooms how to move the
furniture, and Moxhay paid no more attention
to her than the grooms do to the clown. Miss
Flaw had another peculiarity: she silently
went through a service exactly similar to ours,
but much briefer. The course of our evening
service was this. M y Father prayed, and we
all knelt down; then he gave out a hymn
and most of us stood up to sing; then he
preached for about an hour, while we sat and
listened; then a hymn again, then prayer and
the valediction.
FATHER AND SON
Mary Flaw went through this ritual, but on
a smaller scale. We all knelt down together,
but when we rose from our knees, Miss Flaw
was already standing up, and was pretending,
without a sound, to sing a hymn; in the
midst of our hymn, she sat down, opened her
Bible, found a text, and then leaned back, her
eyes fixed in space, listening to an imaginary
sermon, which our own real one soon caught
up, and coincided with for about three-quarters
of an hour. Then, while our sermon went
peacefully on, Miss Flaw would rise, and sing
in silence (if I am permitted to use such an
expression) her own visionary hymn; then she
would kneel down and pray, then rise, collect
her belongings, and sweep, in fairy majesty,
out of the chapel, my Father still rounding
his periods from the pulpit. Nobody ever
thought of preventing these movements, or of
checking the poor creature in her innocent
flightiness, until the evening of the great
event.
It was all my own fault. Mary Flaw had
finished her imaginary service earlier than
usual. She had stood up alone with her hymnbook before her; she had flung herself on her
knees alone, in the attitude of devotion; she
had risen; she had seated herself for a moment
166
FATHER AND SON
to put on her gloves, and to collect her Bible,
her hymn-book and her pocket-handkerchief
in her reticule. She was ready to start, and
she looked around her with a pleasant air; my
Father, all undisturbed, booming away meanwhile over our heads. I know not why the
manceuvres of Miss Flaw especially attracted
me that evening, but I leaned out across Miss
Marks and I caught Miss Flaw's eye. She
nodded, I nodded; and the amazing deed
was done, I hardly know how. Miss Flaw,
with incredible swiftness, flew along the line,
plucked me by the coat-collar from between
my paralysed protectresses, darted with me
down the chapel and out into the dark, before
any one had time to say "Jack Robinson."
My Father gazed from the pulpit and the
stream of exhortation withered on his lips. No
one in the body of the audience stirred; no
one but himself had clearly seen what had
happened. Vague rows of "saints" with
gaping countenances stared up at him, while
he shouted, " rill nobody stop them? " as we
whisked out through the doorway. Forth into
the moist night we went, and up the lampless
village, where, a few minutes later, the
swiftest of the congregation, with my Father
at their head, found us sitting on the door167
FATHER AND SON
step of the butcher's shop. My captor was
now quite quiet, and made no objection to
my quitting her,-" without a single kiss or
a good-bye," as the poet says.
Although I had scarcely felt frightened at
the time, doubtless my nerves were shaken by
this escapade, and it may have had something
to do with the recurrence of the distressing
visions from which I had suffered as a very
little child. These came back, with a force
and expansion due to my increased maturity.
I had hardly laid my head down on the pillow,
than, as it seemed to me, I was taking part in
a mad gallop through space. Some force,
which had tight hold of me, so that I felt myself an atom in its grasp, was hurrying me on,
over an endless slender bridge, under which
on either side a loud torrent rushed at a
vertiginous depth below. At first our helpless
flight,-for I was bound hand and foot like
Mazeppa,-proceeded in a straight line, but
presently it began to curve, and we raced and
roared along, in what gradually became a
monstrous vortex, reverberant with noises,
loud with light, while, as we proceeded,
enormous concentric circles engulfed us, and
wheeled above and about us. It seemed as if
we,-I, that is, and the undefined force which
168
FATHER AND SON
carried me,-were pushing feverishly on
towards a goal which our whole concentrated
energies were bent on reaching, but which a
frenzied despair in my heart told me we never
could reach, yet the attainment of which alone
could save us from destruction. Far away,
in the pulsation of the great luminous whorls,
I could just see that goal, a ruby-coloured
point waxing and waning, and it bore, or to
be exact it consisted of, the letters of the word
CARMINE.
This agitating vision recurred night after
night, and filled me with inexpressible distress.
The details of it altered very little, and I knew
what I had to expect when I crept into bed.
I knew that for a few minutes I should be
battling with the chill of the linen sheets, and
trying to keep awake, but that then, without
la pause, I should slip into that terrible realm
of storm and stress in which I was bound hand
and foot, and sent galloping through infinity.
Often have I wakened, with unutterable joy,
to find my Father and Miss Marks, whom my
screams had disturbed, standing one on each
side of my bed. They could release me from
my nightmare, which seldom assailed me
twice a night, but how to preserve me from its
original attack passed their understanding. My
169
FATHER AND SON
Father, in his tenderness, thought to exorcise
the demon by prayer. He would appear in the
bed-room, just as I was first slipping into bed,
and he would kneel at my side. The light
from a candle on the mantel-shelf streamed
down upon his dark head of hair while his face
was buried in the coverlid, from which a loud
voice came up, a little muffled, begging that
I might be preserved against all the evil spirits
that walk in darkness and that the deep might
not swallow me up.
This little ceremony gave a distraction to my
thoughts, and may have been useful in that
way. But it led to an unfortunate circumstance, My Father began to enjoy these
orisons at my bed-side, and to prolong them.
Perhaps they lasted a little too long, but I
contrived to keep awake through them, sometimes by a great effort. On one unhappy
night, however, I gave even worse offence
than slumber would have given. My Father
was praying aloud, in the attitude I have described, and I was half sitting, half lying in
bed, with the clothes sloping from my chin.
Suddenly a rather large insect, dark and flat,
with more legs than a self-respecting insect
ought to need, appeared at the bottom of the
counterpane, and slowly advanced. I think
170
FATHER AND SON
it was nothing worse than a beetle. It walked
successfully past my Father's sleek black ball
of a head, and climbed straight up at me,
nearer, nearer, till it seemed all a twinkle of
horns and joints. I bore it in silent fascination
till it almost tickled my chin, and then I
screamed "Papa! Papa!" My Father rose
in great dudgeon, removed the insect (what
were insects to him!) and then gave me a
tremendous lecture.
The sense of desperation which this incident
produced I shall not easily forget. Life
seemed really to be very harassing when to
visions within and beetles without there was
joined the consciousness of having grievously
offended God by an act of disrespect. It is
difficult for me to justify to myself the violent
jobation which my Father gave me in consequence of my scream, except by attributing
to him something of the human weakness of
vanity. I cannot help thinking that he liked /
to hear himself speak to God in the presence
of an admiring listener. He prayed with
fervour and animation, in pure Johnsonian
English, and I hope I am not undutiful if I
add my impression that he was not displeased
with the sound of his own devotions. My
cry for help had needlessly, as he thought,
171
FATHER AND SON
broken in upon this holy and seemly performance. "You, the child of a naturalist," he
remarked in awesome tones, " you to pretend
to feel terror at the advance of an insect?" It
could but be a pretext, he declared, for avoiding the testimony of faith in prayer. "If your
heart were fixed, if it panted after the Lord,
it would take more than the movements of a
beetle to make you disturb oral supplication
at His footstool. Beware! for God is a jealous
God and He consumes them in wrath who
make a noise like a dog."
My Father took at all times a singular
pleasure in repeating that " our God is a jealous
God." He liked the word, which I suppose
he used in an antiquated sense. He was accustomed to tell the " saints " at the room,-in a
very genial manner, and smiling at them as he
said it,-" I am jealous over you, my beloved
brothers and sisters, with a godly jealousy." I
know that this was interpreted by some of the
saints,-for I heard Mary Grace say so to Miss
Marks,-as meaning that my Father was resentful because some of them attended the
service at the Wesleyan chapel on Thursday
evenings. But my Father was utterly incapable of such littleness as this, and when he
talked of "jealousy" he meant a lofty
172
FATHER AND SON
solicitude, a careful watchfulness. He meant
that their spiritual honour was a matter of
anxiety to him. No doubt when he used to
tell me to remember that our God is a jealous
God, he meant that my sins and shortcomings
were not matters of indifference to the Divine
Being. But I think, looking back, that it was
very extraordinary for a man, so instructed and
so intelligent as he, to dwell so much on the
possible anger of the Lord, rather than on his i
pity and love. The theory of extreme Puri- /
tanism can surely offer no quainter example of
its fallacy than this idea that the omnipotent
Jehovah could be seriously offended, and could
stoop to revenge, because a little, nervous child
of nine had disturbed a prayer by being
frightened at an insect.
The fact that the word " Carmine " appeared
as the goal of my visionary pursuits is not so
inexplicable as it may seem. My Father was
at this time producing numerous water-colour
drawings of minute and even of microscopic
forms of life. These he executed in the manner
of miniature, with an amazing fidelity of form
and with a brilliancy of colour which remains
unfaded after fifty years. By far the most
costly of his pigments was the intense crimson
which is manufactured out of the very spirit
173
FATHER AND SON
and essence of cochineal. I had lately become
a fervent imitator of his works of art, and I
was allowed to use all of his colours, except
one; I was strictly forbidden to let a hair of
my paint-brush touch the little broken mass of
carmine which was all that he possessed. TWe
believed, but I do not know whether this
could be the fact, that carmine of this superlative quality was sold at a guinea a cake.
" Carmine," therefore, became my shibboleth
of self-indulgence; it was a symbol of all that
taste and art and wealth could combine to
produce. I imagined, for instance, that at
Belshazzar's feast, the loftiest epergne of gold,
surrounded by flowers and jewels, carried the
monarch's proudest possession, a cake of
carmine. I knew of no object in the world of
luxury more desirable than this, and its obsession in my waking hours is quite enough, I
think, to account for " carmine " having been
the torment of my dreams.
The little incident of the beetle displays my
Father's mood at this period in its worst light.
His severity was not very creditable, perhaps,
to his good sense, but without a word of
explanation it may seem even more unreasonable than it was. My Father might have been
less stern to my lapses from high conduct, and
174
FATHER AND SON
my own mind at the same time less armoured
against his arrows, if our relations had been
those which exist in an ordinary religious
family. He would have been more indulgent,
and my own affections might nevertheless
have been more easily alienated, if I had been
treated by him as a commonplace child, standing as yet outside the pale of conscious
Christianity. But he had formed the idea,
and cultivated it assiduously, that I was an
adne d'lite, a being to whom the mysteries of
salvation had been divinely revealed and by
whom they had been accepted. I was, to his
partial fancy, one in whom the Holy Gbost
had already performed a real and permanent
work. Hence, I was inside the pale; 1 had
attained that inner position which divided, as
we used to say, the Sheep from the Goats.
Another little boy might be very well-behaved,
but if he had not consciously "laid hold on
Christ," his good deeds, so far, were absolutely
useless. 'Whereas I might be a very naughty
boy, and require much chastisement from God
and man, but nothing-so my Father thought
-could invalidate my election, and sooner or
later, perhaps even after many stripes, I must
inevitably be brought back to a state of grace.
The paradox between this unquestionable
175
FATHER AND SON
sanctification by faith and my equally unquestionable naughtiness, occupied my Father
greatly at this time. iHe made it a frequent
subject of intercession at family prayers, not
caring to hide from the servants misdemeanours of mine, which he spread out with
a melancholy unction before the Lord. He
cultivated the belief that all my little ailments,
all my aches and pains, were sent to correct
my faults. He carried this persuasion very
far, even putting this exhortation before,
instead of after, an instant relief of my sufferings. If I burned my finger with a sulphur
match, or pinched the end of my nose in the
door (to mention but two sorrows that recur
to my memory), my Father would solemnly
ejaculate: "0 may these afflictions be much
sanctified to him! " before offering any remedy
for my pain. So that I almost longed, under
the pressure of these pangs, to be a godless
child, who had never known the privileges of
saving grace, since I argued that such a child
would be subjected to none of the sufferings
which seemed to assail my path.
What the ideas or conduct of "another
child" might be 1 had, however, at this time
no idea, for, strange as it may sound, I had
not, until my tenth year was far advanced,
176
FATHER AND SON
made acquaintance with any such creature.
The "saints" had children, but I was not
called upon to cultivate their company, and I
had not the slightest wish to do so. But
early in 1859 I was allowed, at last, to
associate with a child of my own age. I do
not recall that this permission gave me any
rapture; I accepted it philosophically, but
without that delighted eagerness which I
might have been expected to show. My
earliest companion, then, was a little boy of
almost exactly my own age. His name was
Benny, which no doubt was short for
Benjamin. His surname I have forgotten,
but his mother-I think he had no fatherwas a solemn and shadowy lady of means who
lived in a villa, which was older and much
larger than ours, on the opposite side of the
road. Going to "play with Benny" involved
a small public excursion, and this I was
now allowed to make by myself-an immense
source of self-respect.
Everything in my little memories seems to
run askew; obviously I ought to have been
extremely stirred and broadened by this
earliest association with a boy of my own age!
Yet I cannot truly say that it was so. Benny's
mother possessed what seemed to me a vast
177 M
FATHER AND SON
domain, with lawns winding among broad
shrubberies, and a kitchen-garden, with aged
fruit-trees in it. The ripeness of this place,
mossed and leafy, was gratifying to my senses,
on which the rawness of our own bald garden
jarred. There was an old brick wall between
the two divisions, upon which it was possible
for us to climb up, and from this we gained
Pisgah-views which were a prodigious pleasure.
But I had not the faintest idea how to
" play "; I had never learned, had never heard
of any "games." I think Benny must have
lacked initiative almost as much as I did.
We walked about, and shook the bushes, and
climbed along the wall; I think that was
almost all we ever did do. And, sadly enough,
I cannot recover a phrase from Benny's lips,
nor an action, nor a gesture although I remember quite clearly how some grown-up people of
that time looked, and the very words they said.
For example, I recollect Miss Wilkes very
distinctly, since I studied her with great deliberation, and with a suspicious watchfulness
that was above my years. In Miss Wilkes a
type that had hitherto been absolutely unfamiliar to us obtruded upon our experience.
In our Eveless Eden, Woman, if not exactly
hirsuta et horrida, had always been "of a
178
FATHER AND SON
certain age." But Miss Wilkes was a comparatively young thing, and she advanced not
by any means unconscious of her charms. All
was feminine, all was impulsive, about Miss
Wilkes; every gesture seemed eloquent with
girlish innocence and the playful dawn of life.
In actual years I fancy she was not so
extremely youthful, since she was the responsible and trusted head-mistress of a large
boarding-school for girls, but in her heart the
joy of life ran high. Miss Wilkes had a small,
round face, with melting eyes, and when she E
lifted her head, her ringlets seemed to vibrate 'f
and shiver like the bells of a pagoda. She had
a charming way of clasping her hands, and
holding them against her bodice, while she
said, " 0, but-really now?" in a manner inexpressibly engaging. She was very earnest, and
she had a pleading way of calling out: " but
aren't you teasing me?" which would have
brought a tiger fawning to her crinoline.
After we had spent a full year without any
social distractions, it seems that our circle of
acquaintances had now begun to extend, in
spite of my Father's unwillingness to visit his
neighbours. He was a fortress that required
to be stormed, but there was considerable
local curiosity about him, so that by-and-by
179
FATHER AND SON
escalading parties were formed, some of which
were partly successful. In the first place,
Charles Kingsley had never hesitated to come,
) from the beginning, ever since our arrival.
) He had reason to visit our neighbouring town
rather frequently, and on such occasions he
always marched up and attacked us. It
was extraordinary how persistent he was, for
my Father must have been a very trying
friend. I vividly recollect that a sort of crossexamination of would-be communicants was
going on in our half-furnished drawing-room
one week-day morning, when Mr. Kingsley
was announced; my Father, in stentorian
tones, replied: Tell Mr. Kingsley that I am
engaged in examining Scripture with certain
of the Lord's children." And I, a little later,
kneeling at the window, while the candidates
were being dismissed with prayer, watched the
author of "Hypatia" nervously careering about
the garden, very restless and impatient, yet
preferring this ignominy to the chance of losing
my Father's company altogether. Kingsley,
a daring spirit, used sometimes to drag us out
trawling with him in Torbay, and although his
hawk's beak and rattling voice frightened me
a little, his was always a jolly presence that
brought some refreshment to our seriousness.
186
L
FATHER AND SON
But the other visitors who came in
Kingsley's wake and without his excuse, how
they disturbed us! We used to be seated,
my Father at his microscope, I with my map
or book, in the down-stairs room we called
the study. There would be a hush around us
in which you could hear a sea-anemone sigh.
Then, abruptly, would come a ring at the front
door; my Father would bend at me a corrugated brow, and murmur, under his breath,
"What's that? " and then, at the sound of footsteps, would bolt into the verandah, and round
the garden into the potting-shed. If it was no
visitor more serious than the postman or the
tax-gatherer, I used to go forth and coax the
timid wanderer home. If it was a caller,
above all a female caller, it was my privilege
to prevaricate, remarking innocently that
"Papa is out!"
Into a paradise so carefully guarded, I
know not how that serpent Miss Wilkes
could penetrate, but there she was. She
" broke bread" with the Brethren at the
adjacent town, from which she carried on
strategical movements, which were, up to a
certain point, highly successful. She professed
herself deeply interested in microscopy, and
desired that some of her young ladies should
181
FATHER AND SON
study it also. She came attended by an
unimportant mamma, and by pupils to whom
I had sometimes, very unwillingly, to show
our "natural objects." They would invade
us, and fill our quietness with chattering
noise; I could bear none of them, and I was
singularly drawn to Miss Marks by finding
that she disliked them too.
By whatever arts she worked, Miss Wilkes
certainly achieved a certain ascendency.
When the knocks came at the front door, I
was now instructed to see whether the visitor
were not she, before my Father bolted to the
potting-shed. She was an untiring listener,
and my Father had a genius for instruction.
Miss Wilkes was never weary of expressing
what a revelation of the wonderful works of
God in creation her acquaintance with us had
been. She would gaze through the microscope
at awful forms, and would persevere until the
silver rim which marked the confines of the
drop of water under inspection would ripple
inwards with a flash of light and vanish,
because the drop itself had evaporated.,"Well, I can only say, how marvellous are
Thy doings!" was a frequent ejaculation of
Miss Wilkes, and one that was very well
received. She learned the Latin names of
182
FATHER AND SON

many of the species, and it seems quite

pathetic to me, looking back, to realise how

much trouble the poor woman took. She

"hung," as the expression is, upon my

Father's every word, and one instance of this

led to a certain revelation.

My Father, who had an extraordinary way i

of saying anything that came up into his mind,

stated one day,-the fashions, I must suppose,

being under discussion,-that he thought white

the only becoming colour for a lady's stockings.

The stockings of Miss Wilkes had up to that

hour been of a deep violet, but she wore white

ones in future whenever she came to our house.

This delicacy would have been beyond my

unaided infant observation, but I heard Miss

Marks mention the matter, in terms which

they supposed to be secret, to her confidante,

and I verified it at the ancles of the lady.

Miss Marks continued by saying, in confidence,

and "quite as between you and me, dear

Mary Grace," that Miss Wilkes was a " minx."

I had the greatest curiosity about words, and

as this was a new one, I looked it up in our...,

large English Dictionary. But there the de-?

finition of the term was this:-" Minx: the

female of minnock; a pert wanton." I was

as much in the dark as ever.  )

183
FATHER AND SON
Whether she was the female of a minnock
(whatever that may be) or whether she was
only a very well-meaning schoolmistress desirous of enlivening a monotonous existence,
Miss Wilkes certainly took us out of ourselves
a good deal. Did my Father know what
danger he ran? It was the opinion of Miss
Marks and of Mary Grace that he did not,
and in the back-kitchen, a room which served
those ladies as a private oratory in the
summer-time, much prayer was offered up
that his eyes might be opened ere it was too
late. But I am inclined to think that they
were open all the time, that, at all events, they
were what the French call entr'ouvert, that
enough light for practical purposes came sifted
in through his eyelashes. At a later time,
being reminded of Miss Wilkes, he said with a
certain complaisance, "Ah, yes! she proffered
much entertainment during my widowed
years I " He used to go down to her boardingschool, the garden of which had been the scene
of a murder, and was romantically situated on
the edge of a quarried cliff; he always took
me with him, and kept me at his side all
through these visits, notwithstanding Miss
Wilkes' solicitude that the fatigue and excitement would be too much for the dear
184
FATHER AND SON
child's strength, unless I rested a little on the!
parlour sofa.
About this time, the question of my
education came up for discussion in the household, as indeed it well might. Miss Marks
had long proved practically inadequate in this
respect, her slender acquirements evaporating,
I suppose, like the drops of water under the
microscope, while the field of her general
duties became wider. The subjects in which
I took pleasure, and upon which I possessed
books, I sedulously taught myself; the other
subjects, which formed the vast majority, I
did not learn at all. Like Aurora Leigh,
I brushed with extreme flounce
The circle of the universe,
especially zoology, botany and astronomy, but
with the explicit exception of geology, which
my Father regarded as tending directly to
the encouragement of infidelity. I copied a
great quantity of maps, and read all the books
of travels that I could find. But I acquired no
mathematics, no languages, no history, so that
I was in danger of gross illiteracy in these
important departments.
My Father grudged the time, but he felt
it a duty to do something to fill up these
deficiencies, and we now started Latin, in a
185
FATHER AND SON
little eighteenth-century reading-book, out
of which my Grandfather had been taught.
It consisted of strings of words, and of grim
arrangements of conjunction and declension, presented in a manner appallingly unattractive. I used to be set down in the
study, under my Father's eye, to learn a solid
page of this compilation, while he wrote or
painted. The window would be open in
summer, and my seat was close to it. Outside, a bee was shaking the clematis-blossom,
or a red-admiral butterfly was opening and
shutting his wings on the hot concrete of the
verandah, or a blackbird was racing across the
lawn. It was almost more than human nature
could bear to have to sit holding up to my
face the dreary little Latin book, with its
sheep-skin cover that smelt of mildewed paste.
But out of this strength there came an unexpected sudden sweetness. The exercise of
hearing me repeat my strings of nouns and
verbs had revived in my Father his memories
of the classics. In the old solitary years, a
long time ago, by the shores of Canadian
rapids, on the edge of West Indian swamps,
his Virgil had been an inestimable solace to
him. To extremely devout persons, there is
something objectionable in most of the great
186
FATHER AND SON
writers of antiquity. Horace, Lucretius,
Terence, Catullus, Juvenal,-in each there is
one quality or another definitely repulsive to
a reader who is determined to know nothing
but Christ and him crucified. From time
immemorial, however, it has been recognised
in the Christian church that this objection
does not apply to Virgil. He is the most
evangelical of the classics; he is the one who
can be enjoyed with least to explain away and
least to excuse. One evening my Father
took down his Virgil from an upper shelf, and
his thoughts wandered away from surrounding
things; he travelled in the past again. The
book was a Delphin edition of 1798, which
had followed him in all his wanderings; there
was a great scratch on the sheep-skin cover that
a thorn had made in a forest of Alabama. And
then, in the twilight, as he shut the volume at
last, oblivious of my presence, he began to
murmur and to chant the adorable verses by
memory.
Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi,
he warbled; and I stopped my play, and
listened as if to a nightingale, till he reached
tu, Tityre, lentus in umbra
Formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas.
187
FATHER AND SON
" 0 Papa, what is that?" I c6uld not prevent myself from asking. He translated the
verses, he explained their meaning, but his
exposition gave me little interest. What to
me was beautiful Amaryllis? She and her
love-sick Tityrus awakened no image whatever
in my mind.
jII But a miracle had been revealed to me,
t the incalculable, the amazing beauty which
could exist in the sound of verses. My prosodical instinct was awakened, quite suddenly
that dim evening, as my Father and I sat
alone in the breakfast-room after tea, serenely
accepting the hour, for once, with no idea of
exhortation or profit. Verse, " a breeze mid
blossoms playing," as Coleridge says, descended
from the roses as a moth might have done,
and the magic ofit took hold of my heart for
ever. I persuaded my Father, who was a
little astonished at my insistence, to repeat
the lines over and over again. At last my
brain caught them, and as I walked in Benny's
garden, or as I hung over the tidal pools at
the edge of the sea, all my inner being used to
ring out with the sound of
Formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas.
188
CHAPTER VII1
IN the previous chapter I have dwelt on some
of the lighter conditions of our life at this
time; I must now turn to it in a less frivolous
aspect. As my tenth year advanced, the
development of my character gave my Father,
I will not say, anxiety, but matter for serious
reflection. My intelligence was now perceived
to be taking a sudden start; visitors drew my
Father's attention to the fact that I was
" coming out so much." I grew rapidly in
stature, having been a little shrimp of a thing
up to that time, and I no longer appeared
much younger than my years. Looking back,
I do not think that there was any sudden
mental development, but that the change was
mainly a social one. I had been reserved,
timid and taciturn; I had disliked the company of strangers. But with my tenth year,
I certainly unfolded, so far as to become
sociable and talkative, and perhaps I struck
189
FATHER AND SON
those around me as grown " clever," because
I said the things which I had previously only
thought. There was a change, no doubt, yet
I believe that it was mainly physical, rather
than mental. My excessive fragility-or apparent fragility, for I must have been always
wiry-decreased; I slept better, and therefore
grew less nervous; I ate better, and therefore
put on flesh. If I preserved a delicate look
-people still used to say in my presence,
" That dear child is not long for this world! "
-it was in consequence of a sort of habit into
which my body had grown; it was a transparency which did not speak of what was in
store for me, but of what I had already passed
through.
The increased activity of my intellectual
system now showed itself in what I believe to
be a very healthy form, direct imitation. The
rage for what is called " originality" is pushed
to such a length in these days that even
children are not considered promising, unless
they attempt things preposterous and unparalleled. From his earliest hour, the
ambitious person is told that to make a road
where none has walked before, to do easily
what it is impossible for others to do at all, to
create new forms of thought and expression,
190
FATHER AND SON
are the only recipes for genius; and in trying
to escape on all sides from every resemblance
to his predecessors, he adopts at once an air of
eccentricity and pretentiousness. This continues to be the accepted view of originality;
but, in spite of this conventional opinion, I
hold that the healthy sign of an activity of
mind in early youth is not to be striving after
unheard-of miracles, but to imitate closely and
carefully what is being said and done in the
vicinity. The child of a great sculptor will
hang about the studio, and will try to hammer
a head out of a waste piece of marble with a
nail; it does not follow that he too will be a
sculptor. The child of a politician will sit in
committee with a row of empty chairs, and
will harangue an imaginary senate from behind
the curtains. 1, the son of a man who looked
through a microscope and painted what he
saw there, would fain observe for myself, and
paint my observations. It did not follow,
alas! that I was built to be a miniaturepainter or a savant, but the activity of a
childish intelligence was shown by my desire
to copy the results of such energy asp 1 saw
nearest at hand.
In the secular direction, this now took the
form of my preparing little monographs on sea191
FATHER AND SON
side creatures, which were arranged, tabulated
and divided as exactly as possible on the pattern
of those which my Father was composing for
his "Actinologia Britannica." I wrote these
out upon sheets of paper of the same size as
his printed page, and I adorned them with
water-colour plates, meant to emulate his
precise and exquisite illustrations. One or
two of these ludicrous postiches are still preserved, and in glancing at them now I wonder,
not at any skill that they possess, but at the
perseverance and the patience, the evidence of
close and persistent labour. I was not set to
these tasks by my Father, who, in fact, did
not much approve of them. He was touched,
too, with the " originality " heresy, and exhorted
me not to copy him, but to go out into the
garden or the shore and describe something
new, in a new way. That was quite impossible;
I possessed no initiative. But I can now well
understand why my Father, very indulgently
and good-temperedly, deprecated these exercises of mine. They took up, and, as he might
well think, wasted, an enormous quantity of
time; and they were, moreover, parodies, rather
than imitations, of his writings, for I invented
new species, with sapphire spots and crimson
tentacles and amber bands, which were close
192
',
FATHER AND SON
enough to his real species to be disconcerting.
He came from conscientiously shepherding
the flocks of ocean, and I do not wonder that
my ring-straked, speckled and spotted varieties
put him out of countenance. If I had not
been so innocent and solemn, he might have
fancied I was mocking him.
These extraordinary excursions into science,
falsely so called, occupied a large part of my
time. There was a little spare room at the
back of our house, dedicated to lumber and to
empty portmanteaux. There was a table in it
already, and I added a stool; this cheerless
apartment now became my study. I spent so
many hours here, in solitude and without
making a sound, that my Father's curiosity, if
not his suspicion, was occasionally roused, and
he would make a sudden raid on me. I was
always discovered, doubled up over the table,
with my pen and ink, or else my box of colours
and tumbler of turbid water by my hand,
working away like a Chinese student shut up
in his matriculating box.
It might have been done for a wager,
if anything so sinful had ever been dreamed
of in our pious household. The apparatus
was slow and laboured. In order to keep
my uncouth handwriting in bounds, I was
193
N
FATHER AND SON
obliged to rule not lines only, but borders to
my pages. The subject did not lend itself
to any flow of language, and I was obliged
incessantly to borrow sentences, word for word,
from my Father's published books. Discouraged by every one around me, daunted by
the laborious effort needful to carry out the
scheme, it seems odd to me now that I persisted in so strange and wearisome an employment, but it became an absorbing passion, and
was indulged in to the neglect of other lessons
and other pleasures.
My Father, as the spring advanced, used to
come up to the Box-room, as my retreat was
called, and hunt me out into the sunshine.
But I soon crept back to my mania. It gave
him much trouble, and Miss Marks, who
thought it sheer idleness, was vociferous in
objection. She would gladly have torn up all
my writings and paintings, and have set me to
a useful task. My Father, with his strong
natural individualism, could not take this
view. He was interested in this strange
ireak of mine, and he could not wholly
condemn it. But he must have thought it a
little crazy, and it is evident to me now that
it led to the revolution in domestic polity by
which he began to encourage my acquaintance
194
FATHER AND SON
with other young people as much as he had
previously discouraged it. He saw that I could
not be allowed to spend my whole time in a
little stuffy room making solemn and ridiculous imitations of Papers read before the Linnaean Society. He was grieved, moreover, at
the badness of my pictures, for I had no
native skill; and he tried to teach me his own
system of miniature-painting as applied to
natural history. I was forced, in deep depression of spirits, to turn from my grotesque
monographs, and paint under my Father's eye,
and from a finished drawing of his, a gorgeous
tropic bird in flight. Aided by my habit of
imitation, I did at length produce something
which might have shown promise, if it had
not been wrung from me, touch by touch,
pigment by pigment, under the orders of a
task-master.
All this had its absurd side, but I seem to
perceive that it had also its value. It is,
surely, a mistake to look too near at hand for
the benefits of education. What is actually
taught in early childhood is often that part of
training which makes least impression on the
character, and is of the least permanent
importance. My labours failed to make me a
zoologist, and the multitude of my designs
195
FATHER AND SON
and my descriptions have left me helplessly
ignorant of the anatomy of a sea-anemone.
Yet I cannot look upon the mental discipline
as useless. It taught me to concentrate my
attention, to define the nature of distinctions,
to see accurately, and to name what I saw.
Moreover, it gave me the habit of going on
with any piece of work I had in hand, not
flagging because the interest or picturesqueness
of the theme had declined, but pushing forth
towards a definite goal, well foreseen and
limited beforehand. For almost any intellectual employment in later life, it seems to
me that this discipline was valuable. I am,
however, not the less conscious how ludicrous
was the mode in which, in my tenth year, I
obtained it.
My spiritual condition occupied my Father's
thoughts very insistently at this time. Closing,
as he did, most of the doors of worldly pleasure
and energy upon his conscience, he had continued to pursue his scientific investigations
without any sense of sin. Most fortunate it
was, that the collecting of marine animals in
the tidal pools, and the description of them
in pages which were addressed to the wide
scientific public, at no time occurred to him as
in any way inconsistent with his holy calling.
I 96
FATHER AND SON
His conscience was so delicate, and often so
morbid in its delicacy, that if that had occurred
to him, he would certainly have abandoned
his investigations, and have been left without
an employment. But happily he justified his
investigation by regarding it as a glorification
of God's created works. In the introduction
to his "Actinologia Britannica," written at the
time which I have now reached in this narrative, he sent forth his labours with a phrase
which I should think unparalleled in connection with a learned and technical biological
treatise. He stated concerning that book,
that he published it "as one more tribute
humbly offered to the glory of the Triune God,
who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in
working." Scientific investigation sincerely
carried out in that spirit became a kind of
week-day interpretation of the current creed
of Sundays.
The development of my faculties, of which
I have spoken, extended to the religious
sphere no less than to the secular. Here also,
as I look back, I see that I was extremely
imitative. I expanded in the warmth of my
Father's fervour, and, on the whole, in a
manner that was satisfactory to him. He observed the richer hold that I was now taking
197
FATHER AND SON
on life; he saw my faculties branching in many
directions, and he became very anxious to
secure my maintenance in grace. In earlier
years, certain sides of my character had offered
a sort of passive resistance to his ideas. I had
let what I did not care to welcome pass over
my mind in the curious density that children
adopt in order to avoid receiving impressionsblankly, dumbly, achieving by stupidity what
they cannot achieve by argument. I think
that I had frequently done this; that he had
been brought up against a dead wall; although
on other sides of my nature I had been
responsive and docile. But now, in my tenth
year, the imitative faculty got the upper hand,
and nothing seemed so attractive as to be what
I was expected to be. If there was a doubt
now, it lay in the other direction; it seemed
hardly normal that so young a child should
appear so receptive and so apt.
My Father believed himself justified, at this
juncture, in making a tremendous effort. He
wished to secure me finally, exhaustively,
before the age of puberty could dawn, before
my soul was fettered with the love of carnal
things. He thought that if I could now be
identified with the "saints," and could stand
on exactly their footing, a habit of conformity
198
FATHER AND SON
would be secured, I should meet the paganising tendencies of advancing years with
security if I could be forearmed with all the
weapons of a sanctified life. He wished me,
in short, to be received into the community of
the Brethren on the terms of an adult. There
were difficulties in the way of carrying out
this scheme, and they were urged upon him,
more or less courageously, by the elders of the
church. But he overbore them. What the
difficulties were, and what were the arguments
which he used to sweep those difficulties away,
I must now explain, for in this lay the centre
of our future relations as father and son.
In dealing with the peasants around him,
among whom he was engaged in an active
propaganda, my Father always insisted on the
necessity of conversion. There must be a
new birth and being, a fresh creation in God.
This crisis he was accustomed to regard as
manifesting itself in a sudden and definite
upheaval. There might have been prolonged
practical piety, deep and true contrition for
sin, but these, although the natural and
suitable prologue to conversion, were not
conversion itself. People hung on at the
confines of regeneration, often for a very long
time; my Father dealt earnestly with them,
199
FATHER AND SON
the elders ministered to them, with explanation, exhortation and prayer. Such persons
were in a gracious state, but they were not in
a state of grace. If they should suddenly die,
they would pass away in an unconverted condition, and all that could be said in their favour
was a vague expression of hope that they would
benefit from God's uncovenanted mercies.
But on some day, at some hour and minute,
if life was spared to them, the way of salvation
would be revealed to these persons in such an
aspect that they would be enabled instantaneously to accept it. They would take
it consciously, as one takes a gift from the
hand that offers it. This act of taking was
the process of conversion, and the person who
so accepted was a child of God now,
although a single minute ago he had been
a child of wrath. The very root of human
nature had to be changed, and, in the
majority of cases, this change was sudden,
patent, palpable.
I have just said, "in the majority of cases,"
because my Father admitted the possibility of
exceptions. The formula was, " If any man
hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of
his." As a rule, no one could possess the
Spirit of Christ, without a conscious and full
200
FATHER AND SON
abandonment of the soul, and this, however
carefully led up to, and prepared for with tears
and renunciations, was not, could not, be made,
except at aset moment of time. Faith, in
an esoteric and almost symbolic sense, was
necessary, and could not be a result of
argument, but was a state of heart. In these
opinions my Father departed no wise from~i
the strict evangelical doctrine of the Protestant
churches, but he held it in a mode and with a
severity peculiar to himself. Now, it is plain
that this state of heart, this voluntary deed of
acceptance, presupposed a full and rational
consciousness of the relations of things. It
might be clearly achieved by a person of
humble cultivation, but only by one who was
fully capable of independent thought, in other
words by a more or less adult person. The
man or woman claiming the privileges of
conversion must be able to understand and to
grasp what his religious education was aiming
at.
It is extraordinary what trouble it often
gave my Father to know whether he was
justified in admitting to the communion
people of very limited powers of expression.
A harmless, humble labouring man would
come with a request to be allowed to " break
201
FATHER AND SON
bread." It was only by the use of strong
leading questions that he could be induced to
mention Christ as the ground of his trust at
all. I recollect an elderly agricultural labourer
being closeted for a long time with my
Father, who came out at last, in a sort of dazed
condition, and replied to our inquiries,-with
a shrug of his shoulders as he said it,-" I was
obliged to put the Name and Blood and
Work of Jesus into his very mouth. It is
true that he assented cordially at last, but I
confess I was grievously daunted by the poor
intelligence!"
But there was, or there might be, another
class of persons, whom early training, separation
from the world, and the care of godly parents
had so early familiarised with the acceptable
calling of Christ that their conversion had
occurred, unperceived and therefore unrecorded, at an extraordinarily early age. It
would be in vain to look for a repetition of
the phenomenon in those cases. The heavenly
fire must not be expected to descend a second
time; the lips are touched with the burning coal
once, and once only. If, accordingly, these
precociously selected spirits are to be excluded
because no new birth is observed in them at
a mature age, they must continue outside in
202
FATHER AND SON
the cold, since the phenomenon cannot be
repeated. When, therefore, there is not
possible any further doubt of their being in
possession of salvation, longer delay is useless,
and worse than useless. The fact of conversion,
though not recorded nor even recollected,
must be accepted on the evidence of confession
of faith, and as soon as the intelligence is
evidently developed, the person not merely
may, but should be accepted into communion,
although still immature in body, although in
years still even a child. This my Father
believed to be my case, and in this rare class
did he fondly persuade himself to station me.
As I have said, the congregation,-although
docile and timid, and little able, as units, to
hold their own against their minister,-behind
his back were faintly hostile to this plan.
None of their own children had ever been so
much as suggested for membership, and each of
themselves, in ripe years, had been subjected
to severe cross-examination. I think it was
rather a bitter pill for some of them to swallow
that a pert little boy of ten should be admitted,
as a grown-up person, to all the hard-won privileges of their order. Mary Grace Burmington
came back from her visits to the cottagers,
reporting disaffection here and there, grumb203
FATHER AND SON
lings in the rank and file. But quite as many,
especially of the women, enthusiastically supported my Father's wish, gloried aloud in the
manifestations of my early piety, and professed
to see in it something of miraculous promise.
The expression " another Infant Samuel" was
widely used. I became quite a subject of
contention. A war of the sexes threatened to
break out over me; I was a disturbing element
at cottage breakfasts. I was mentioned at
public prayer-meetings, not indeed by name,
but, in the extraordinary illusive way customary in our devotions, as " one amongst us of
tender years " or as "a sapling in the Lord's
vineyard."
To all this my Father put a stop in his own
high-handed fashion. After the morning
meeting, one Sunday in the autumn of 1859,
he desired the attention of the saints to a
personal matter which was, perhaps, not
unfamiliar to them by rumour. That was, he
explained, the question of the admission of his
beloved little son to the communion of saints
in the breaking of bread. He allowedand I sat there in evidence, palely smiling at
the audience, my feet scarcely touching the
ground-that I was not what is styled adult;
I was not, he frankly admitted, a grown-up
204
FATHER AND SON
person. But I was adult in a knowledge of
the Lord; I possessed an insight into the plan
of salvation which many a hoary head might
envy for its fulness, its clearness, its conformity
with Scripture doctrine. This was a palpable
hit at more than one stumbler and fumbler
after the truth, and several hoary heads were
bowed.
My Father then went on to explain very
fully the position which I have already
attempted to define. He admitted the absence
in my case of a sudden, apparent act of conversion resulting upon conviction of sin. But
he stated the grounds of his belief that I had,
in still earlier infancy, been converted, and
he declared that if so, I ought no longer to be
excluded from the privileges of communion.
He said, moreover, that he was willing on this
occasion to waive his own privilege as a
minister, and that he would rather call on
Brother Fawkes and Brother Bere, the leading
elders, to examine the candidate in his stead.
This was a master-stroke, for Brothers Fawkes
and Bere had been suspected of leading the
disaffection, and this threw all the burden of
responsibility on them. The meeting broke
up in great amiability, and my Father and I
went home together in the very highest of
205
FATHER AND SON
spirits. I, indeed, in my pride, touched the
verge of indiscretion by saying: c" When I have
been admitted to fellowship, Papa, shall 1 be
allowed to call you' beloved Brother'?" My
Father was too well pleased with the morning's
work to be critical. He laughed, and answered:
"That, my Love, though strictly correct,
would hardly, I fear, be thought judicious! "
It was suggested that my tenth birthday,
which followed this public announcement by
a few days, would be a capital occasion for me
to go through the ordeal. Accordingly, after
dark (for our new lamp was lighted for the
first time in honour of the event), I withdrew
alone into our drawing-room, which had just,
at length, been furnished, and which looked, I
thought, very smart. Hither came to me, first
Brother Fawkes, by himself; then Brother
Bere, by himself; and then both together, so
that you may say, if you are pedantically
inclined, that I underwent three successive
interviews. My Father, out of sight somewhere, was, of course, playing the part of stage
manager.
I felt not at all shy, but so highly strung
that my whole nature seemed to throb with
excitement. My first examiner, on the other
hand, was extremely confused. Fawkes,
206
L
FATHER A!ND SON
who was a builder in a small business of his
own, was short and fat; his complexion, which
wore a deeper and more uniform rose-colour,
than usual, I observed to be starred with dewdrops of nervous emotion, which he wiped
away at intervals with a large bandana handkerchief. He was so long in coming to the
point, that I was obliged to lead him to it
myself, and I sat up on the sofa in the full
lamplight, and testified my faith in the atonement with a fluency that surprised myself.
Before I had done, Fawkes, a middle-aged man
with the reputation of being a very stiff
employer of labour, was weeping like a child.
Bere, the carpenter, a long, thin and dry
man, with a curiously immobile eye, did not
fall so easily a prey to my fascinations. He
put me through my paces very sharply, for he
had something of the temper of an attorney
mingled with his religiousness. However, I
was equal to him, and he, too, though he held
his own head higher, was not less impressed
than Fawkes had been, by the surroundings of
the occasion. Neither of them had ever been in
our drawing-room since it was furnished, and I
thought that each of them noticed how smart
the wall-paper was. Indeed, I believe I drew
their attention to it. After the two solitary
207
FATHER AND SON
examinations were over, the elders came in
again, as I have said, and they prayed for a
long time. We all three knelt at the sofa, I
between them. But by this time, to my
great exaltation of spirits there had succeeded
an equally dismal depression. It was my
turn now to weep, and I dimly remember my
Father coming into the room, and my being
carried up to bed, in a state of collapse and
fatigue, by the silent and kindly Miss Marks.
On the following Sunday morning, I was
the principal subject which occupied an
unusually crowded meeting. My Father,
looking whiter and yet darker than usual, called
upon Brother Fawkes and Brother Bere to
state to the assembled saints what their experiences had been in connection with their
visits to "; one'" who desired to be admitted to
the breaking of bread. It was tremendously
exciting to me to hear myself spoken of with
this impersonal publicity, and I had no fear
of the result.
Events showed that I had no need of fear.
Fawkes and Bere were sometimes accused
of a rivalry, which indeed broke out a few
years later, and gave my Father much
anxiety and pain. But on this occasion their
unanimity was wonderful. Each strove to
208
FATHER AND SON
exceed the other in the tributes which they
paid to my piety. My answers had been so
full and clear, my humility (save the mark!)
had been so sweet, my acquaintance with
Scripture so amazing, my testimony to all the
leading principles of salvation so distinct and
exhaustive, that they could only say that they
had felt confounded, and yet deeply cheered
and led far along their own heavenly path, by
hearing such accents fall from the lips of a
babe and a suckling. I did not like being
described as a suckling, but every lot has its
crumpled rose-leaf, and in all other respects
the report of the elders was a triumph. My
Father then clenched the whole matter by
rising and announcing that I had expressed an
independent desire to confess the Lord by the
act of public baptism, immediately after which
I should be admitted to communion "as an
adult." Emotion ran so high at this, that a
large portion of the congregation insisted on
walking with us back to our garden-gate, to
the stupefaction of the rest of the villagers.
My public baptism was the central event of >
my whole childhood. Everything, since the fa
earliest dawn of consciousness, seemed to have
been leading up to it. Everything, afterwards,
seemed to be leading down and away from it. )
209 o
FATHER AND SON
The practice of immersing communicants on
the sea-beach at Oddicombe had now been
completely abandoned, but we possessed as
yet no tank for a baptismal purpose in our own
Room. The Room in the adjoining town,
however, was really quite a large chapel, and
it was amply provided with the needful conveniences. It was our practice, therefore, at
this time, to claim the hospitality of our
neighbours. Baptisms were made an occasion
for friendly relations between the two congregations, and led to pleasant social intercourse.
1 believe that the ministers and elders of the
two meetings arranged to combine their forces
at these times, and to baptize communicants
from both congregations.
The minister of the town meeting was Mr. S.,
a very handsome old gentleman, of venerable
and powerful appearance. He had snowy hair
and a long white beard, but from under shaggy
eyebrows there blazed out great black eyes
which warned the beholder that the snow was
an ornament and not a sigh of decrepitude.
The eve of my baptism at length drew near;
it was fixed for October 12, almost exactly
three weeks after my tenth birthday. I was
dressed in old clothes, and a suit of smarter
things was packed up in a carpet-bag. After
210
FATHER AND SON
night-fall, this carpet-bag, accompanied by
my Father, myself, Miss Marks and Mary
Grace, was put in a four-wheeled cab,
and driven, a long way in the dark, to the
chapel of our friends. There we were received,
in a blaze of lights, with a pressure of hands,
with a murmur of voices, with ejaculations
and even with tears, and were conducted,
amid unspeakable emotion, to places of honour
in the front row of the congregation.
The scene was one which would have been
impressive, not merely to such hermits as we
were, but even to worldly persons accustomed
to life and to its curious and variegated
experiences. To me it was dazzling beyond
words, inexpressibly exciting, an initiation to
every kind of publicity and glory. There
were many candidates, but the rest of them,
mere grown-up men and women,-gave thanks
aloud that it was their privilege to follow
where I led. I was the acknowledged hero of
the hour. Those were days when newspaper
enterprise was scarcely in its infancy, and the
event owed nothing to journalistic effort. In
spite of that, the news of this remarkable
ceremony, the immersion of a little boy of ten
years old "as an adult," had spread far and
wide through the county in the course of
211
FATHER AND SON
three weeks. The chapel of our hosts was, as
I have said, very large; it was commonly too
large for their needs, but on this night it was
crowded to the ceiling, and the crowd had
come-as every soft murmurer assured meto see me.
There were people there who had travelled
from Exeter, from Dartmouth, from Totnes,
to witness so extraordinary a ceremony.
There was one old woman of eighty-five
who had come, my neighbours whispered to
me, all the way from Moreton-Hampstead, on
purpose to see me baptized. I looked at her
crumpled countenance with amazement, for
there was no curiosity, no interest visible in it.
She sat there perfectly listless, looking at
nothing, but chewing between her toothless
gums what appeared to be a jujube.
In the centre of the chapel-floor a number
of planks had been taken up, and revealed a
pool which might have been supposed to be a
small swimming-bath. We gazed down into
this dark square of mysterious waters, from
the tepid surface of which faint swirls of
vapour rose. The whole congregation was
arranged, tier above tier, about the four
straight sides of this pool; every person was
able to see what happened in it without any
2Vs
FATHER AND SON
unseemly struggling or standing on forms.
Mr. S. now rose, an impressive hieratic figure,
commanding attention and imploring perfect
silence. He held a small book in his hand,
and he was preparing to give out the number
of a hymn, when an astounding incident took
place.
There was a great splash, and a tall young
woman was perceived to be in the baptismal
pool, her arms waving above her head, and
her figure held upright in the water by the
inflation of the air underneath her crinoline,
which was blown out like a bladder, as in
some extravagant old fashion-plate. Whether
her feet touched the bottom of the font I
cannot say, but I suppose they did so. An
indescribable turmoil of shrieks and cries followed on this extraordinary apparition. A
great many people excitedly called upon other
people to be calm, and an instance was given
of the remark of James Smith that
He who, in quest of quiet, " Silence! " hoots
Is apt to make the hubbub he imputes.
The young woman, in a more or less fainting
condition, was presently removed from the
water, and taken into the sort of tent which
was prepared for candidates. It was found
213
FATHER AND SON
that she herself had wished to be a candidate
and had earnestly desired to be baptized, but
that this had been forbidden by her parents,
On the supposition that she fell in by accident,
a pious coincidence was detected in this affair;
the Lord had pre-ordained that she should be
baptized in spite of all opposition. But my
Father, in his shrewd way, doubted. He
pointed out to us, next morning, that, in the
first place, she had not, in any sense, been
baptized, as her head had not been immersed;
and that, in the second place, she must have
deliberately jumped in, since, had she stumbled
and fallen forward, her hands and face would
have struck the water, whereas they remained
quite dry. She belonged, however, to the
neighbour congregation, and we had no responsibility to pursue the inquiry any further.
Decorum being again secured, Mr. S., with
unimpaired dignity, proposed to the congregation a hymn, which was long enough to
occupy them during the preparations for the
actual baptism. I-e then retired to the
vestry, and I (for I was to be the first to
testify) was led by Miss Marks and Mary
Grace into the species of tent of which I have
just spoken. Its pale sides seemed to shake
with the jubilant singing of the saints outside,
214
FATHER AND SON
while part of my clothing was removed and I
was prepared for immersion. A sudden cessation of the hymn warned us that the Minister
was now ready, and we emerged into the
glare of lights and faces to find Mr. S. already
standing in the water up to his knees. Feeling as small as one of our microscopical
specimens, almost infinitesimally tiny as I
descended into his Titanic arms, I was handed
down the steps to him. He was dressed in a
kind of long surplice, underneath which-as
I could not, even in that moment, help -
observing-the air gathered in long bubbles
which he strove to flatten out. The end of
his noble beard he had tucked away; his shirtsleeves were turned up at the wrist.
The entire congregation was now silent, so
silent that the uncertain splashing of my feet
as I descended seemed to deafen me. Mr. S.,
a little embarrassed by my short stature, succeeded at length in securing me with one
palm on my chest and the other between my
shoulders. He said, slowly, in a loud, sonorous
voice that seemed to enter my brain and
empty it, " I baptize thee, my Brother, in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Ghost!" Having intoned this formula,
he then gently flung me backwards until I
215
FATHER AND SON
was wholly under the water, and then-as he
brought me up again, and tenderly steadied
my feet on the steps of the font, and delivered
me, dripping and spluttering, into the anxious
hands of the women, who hurried me to the
tent-the whole assembly broke forth in a
thunder of song, a plan of praise to God for
this manifestation of his marvellous goodness
and mercy. So great was the enthusiasm,
that it, could hardly be restrained so as to
allow the other candidates, the humdrum
adults who followed in my wet and glorious
footsteps, to undergo a ritual about which,
in their case, no one in the congregation
pretended to be able to take even the most
languid interest.
My Father's happiness during the next few
weeks it is now pathetic to me to look back
upon. His sternness melted into a universal
complaisance. He laughed and smiled, he
paid to my opinions the tribute of the gravest
consideration, he indulged-utterly unlike his
wont-in shy and furtive caresses. I could
express no wish that he did not attempt to
fulfil, and the only warning which he cared
to give me was one, very gently expressed,
against spiritual pride.
This was certainly required, for I was puffed
216
FATHER AND SON
out with a sense of my own holiness. I was
religiously confidential with my Father, condescending with Miss Marks (who I think
had given up trying to make it all out), haughty
with the servants, and insufferably patronising
with those young companions of my own age
with whom I was now beginning to associate.
I would fain close this remarkable episode
on a key of solemnity, but alas! if I am to be
loyal to the truth, I must record that some of
the other little boys presently complained to?
Mary Grace that I put out my tongue at them:
in mockery, during the service in the Room, to
remind them that I now broke bread as one of
the Saints and that they did not.
217
CHAPTER IX
THE result of my being admitted into the
co mmunion of the " Saints " was that, as soon
as the nine days' wonder of the thing passed
by, my position became, if anything, more
harassing and pressed than ever. It is true
that freedom was permitted to me in certain
directions; I was allowed to act a little more
on my own responsibility, and was not so
incessantly informed what " the Lord's will"
might be in this matter and in that, because
it was now conceived that, in such dilemmas,
I could command private intelligence of my
own. But there was no relaxation of our
rigid manner of life, and I think I now began,,
by comparing it with the habits of others, to
perceive how very strict it was.
The main difference in my lot as a communicant from that of a mere dweller in the tents
of righteousness was that I was expected to
respond with instant fervour to every appeal
218
FATHER AND SON
of conscience. When I did not do this, my
position was almost worse than it had been
before, because of the livelier nature of the
responsibility which weighed upon me. My
little faults of conduct, too, assumed shapes of
terrible importance, since they proceeded from
one so signally enlightened. My Father was
never tired of reminding me that, now that I
was a professing Christian, 1 must remember,
in everything I did, that I was an example to
others. He used to draw dreadful pictures of
supposititious little boys who were secretly
watching me from afar, and whose whole
career, in time and in eternity, might be
disastrously affected if I did not keep my
lamp burning.
The year which followed upon my baptism
did not open very happily at the Room.
Considerable changes had now taken place in
the community. My Father's impressive
services, a certain prestige in his preaching,
the mere fact that so vigorous a person was at
the head of affairs, had induced a large
increase in the attendance. By this time, if
my memory does not fail me as to dates, we
had left the dismal loft over the stables, and
had built ourselves a perfectly plain, but
commodious and well-arranged chapel in the
219
FATHER AND SON
centre of the village. This greatly added to
the prosperity of the meeting. Everything
had combined to make our services popular,
and had attracted to us a new element of
younger people. Numbers of youthful masons
and carpenters, shop-girls and domestic
servants, found the Room a pleasant trystingplace, and were more or less superficially
induced to accept salvation as it was offered
to them in my Father's searching addresses.
My Father was very shrewd in dealing with
mere curiosity or idle motive, and sharply
packed off any youths who simply came to
make eyes at the girls, or any " maids " whose
only object was to display their new bonnetstrings. But he was powerless against a
temporary sincerity, the simulacrum of a true
change of heart. I have often heard him
say,-of some young fellow who had attended
our services with fervour for a little while, and
then had turned cold and left us,-" and I
thought that the Holy Ghost had wrought
in him!" Such disappointments grievously
depress an evangelist.
Religious bodies are liable to strange and
unaccountable fluctuations. At the beginning
of the third year since our arrival, the congregation seemed to be in a very prosperous state,
220
FATHER AND SON
as regards attendance, conversions and other
outward signs of activity. Yet it was quite
soon after this that my Father began to be
harassed by all sorts of troubles, and the
spring of 1860 was a critical moment in the
history of the community. Ahthough he loved
to take a very high tone about the Saints, and
involved them sometimes in a cloud of laudatory metaphysics, the truth was that they were
nothing more than peasants of a somewhat
primitive type, not well instructed in the rules
of conduct and liable to exactly the same
weaknesses as invade the rural character in
every country and latitude. That they were
exhorted to behave as "children of light,"' and
that the majority of them sincerely desired to
do credit to their high calling, could not prevent their being beset by the sins which had
affected their forebears for generations past.
The addition of so many young persons of
each sex to the communion led to an entirely
new class of embarrassment. Now there arose
endless difficulties about " engagements,"
about youthful brethren who "went out
walking" with even more youthful sisters.
Glancing over my Father's notes, I observe
the ceaseless repetition of cases in which Soand-So is " courting " Such-an-one, followed by
221
FATHER AND SON
the melancholy record that he has " deserted"
her. In my Father's stern language, "desertion" would very often mean no more than
that the amatory pair had blamelessly changed
their minds; but in some cases it meant more
and worse than this. It was a very great
distress to him that sometimes the young men
and women who showed the most lively interest
in Scripture, and who had apparently accepted
the wayof salvation with the fullest intelligence,
were precisely those who seemed to struggle
with least success against a temptation to unchastity. He put this down to the concentrated malignityof Satanwho directed his most
poisoned darts against the fairest of the flock.
In addition to these troubles, there came
recriminations mutual charges of drunkenness
in private, all sorts of petty jealousy and
scandal. There were frequent definite acts of
"backsliding " on the part of members, who
had in consequence to be " put away." No one
of these cases might be in itself extremely
serious, but when many of them came together
they seemed to indicate that the church was in
an unhealthy condition. The particulars of
many of these scandals were concealed from
me, but I was an adroit little pitcher, and had
cultivated the art of seeming to be interested in
222
FATHER AND SON
something else, a book or a flower, while my
elders were talking confidentially. As a rule,
while I would fain have acquired more details,
I was fairly well-informed about the errors of
the Saints, although I was often quaintly ignorant of the real nature of those errors.
Not infrequently, persons who had fallen into
sin repented of it under my Father's penetrating ministrations. They were apt in their penitence to use strange symbolic expressions. I
remember Mrs. Pewings, our washerwoman,
who had been accused of intemperance and
had been suspended from communion, re-|
appearing with a face that shone with soap andi
sanctification, and saying to me, "Oh! blessed,
Child, you're wonderin' to zee old Pewings
here again, but He have rolled away my;
mountain!" For once, I was absolutely at a
loss, but she meant that the Lord had removed
the load of her sins, and restored her to a state
of grace.
It was in consequence of these backslidings,
which had become alarmingly frequent, that
early in 1860 my Father determined on proclaiming a solemn fast. He delivered one
Sunday what seemed to me an awe-inspiring
address, calling upon us all closely to examine
our consciences, and reminding us of the appal223
FATHER AND SON
ling fate of the church of Laodicea. He said
that it was not enough to have made a satisfactory confession. of faith, nor even to have
sealed that confession in baptism, if we did not
live up to our protestations. Salvation, he told
us, must indeed precede holiness of life,yet both
are essential. It was a dark and rainy winter
morning when he made this terrible address,
which frightened the congregation extremely.
When the marrow was congealed within our
bones, and when the bowed heads before him,
and the faintly audible sobs of the women in
the background, told him that his lesson had
gone home, he pronounced the keeping of a
day in the following week as a fast of contrition.
" Those of you who have to pursue your daily
occupations will pursue them, but sustained
only by the bread of affliction and by the water
of affliction."
His influence over these gentle peasant
people was certainly remarkable, for no effort
was made to resist his exhortation. It was
his customary plan to stay a little while, after
the morning meeting was over, and in a very
affable fashion to shake hands with the saints.
But on this occasion he stalked forth without
a word, holding my hand tight until we had
swept out into the street.
224
FATHER AND SON
How the rest of the congregation kept this
fast I do not know. But it was a dreadful
day for us. I was awakened in the pitchy
night to go off with my Father to the Room,
where a scanty gathering held a penitential
prayer-meeting. We came home, as dawn
was breaking, and in process of time sat down
to breakfast, which consisted-at that dismal
hour-of slices of dry bread and a tumbler of
cold water each. During the morning, I was
not allowed to paint, or write, or withdraw to
my study in the box-room. We sat, in a
state of depression not to be described, in the
breakfast-room, reading books of a devotional
character, with occasional wailing of some very
doleful hymn. Our midday dinner came at
last; the meal was strictly confined, as before,
to dry slices of the loaf and a tumbler of water.
The afternoon would have been spent as the
morning was, and so my Father spent it.
But Miss Marks, seeing my white cheeks and
the dark rings round my eyes, besought leave
to take me out for a walk. This was permitted, with a pledge that I should be given
no species of refreshment. Although I told
Miss Marks, in the course of the walk, that I
was feeling " so leer " (our Devonshire phrase
for hungry), she dared not break her word.
225 P
FATHER AND SON
Our last meal was of the former character, and
the day ended by our trapsing through the
wet to another prayer-meeting, whence I returned in a state bordering on collapse, and
was put to bed without further nourishment.
There was no great hardship in all this, I daresay, but it was certainly rigorous. My Father
took pains to see that what he had said about
the bread and water of affliction was carried
out in the bosom of his own family, and by no
one more unflinchingly than by himself.
My attitude to other people's souls when
I was out of my Father's sight was now a
constant anxiety to me. In our tattling
world of small things he had extraordinary
opportunities of learning how I behaved when
I was away from home; I did not realise this,
and I used to think his acquaintance with my
deeds and words savoured almost of wizardry.
He was accustomed to urge upon me the
necessity of " speaking for Jesus in season and
out of season," and he so worked upon my
feelings that I would start forth like St.
Teresa, wild for the Moors and martyrdom.
But any actual impact with persons marvellously cooled my zeal, and I should hardly ever
have " spoken " at all if it had not been for
that unfortunate phrase "out of season." It
226
FATHER AND SON
really seemed that one must talk of nothing
else, since if an occasion was not in season it
was out of season; there was no alternative,
no close time for souls.
My Father was very generous. He used to
magnify any little effort that I made, with stammering tongue, to sanctify a visit; and people,
I now see, were accustomed to give me a
friendly lead in this direction, so that they might
please him by reporting that I had " testified" in
the Lord's service. The whole thing, however,
was artificial, and was part of my Father's
restless inability to let well alone. It was
not in harshness or in ill-nature that he
worried me so much; on the contrary, it was
all part of his too-anxious love. He was in a
hurry to see me become a shining light, everything that he had himself desired to be, yet
with none of his shortcomings.
It was about this time that he harrowed my
whole soul into painful agitation by a phrase
that he let fall, without, I believe, attaching
any particular importance to it at the time.
He was occupied, as he so often was, in
polishing and burnishing my faith, and he was
led to speak of the day when I should ascend
the pulpit to preach my first sermon. "Oh
if I may be there, out of sight, and hear the
227
B) rig
'a S
FATHER AND SON
gospel message proclaimed from your lips,
then I shall say, 'My poor work is done. Oh!
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."' I cannot
express the dismay which this aspiration gave
me, the horror with which I anticipated such
a nunc diinittis. I felt like a small and solitary
bird, caught and hung out hopelessly and endlessly in a great glittering cage. The clearness
of the personal image affected me as all the
texts and prayers and predictions had failed to
do. I saw myself imprisoned forever in the
religious system which had caught me and
would whirl my helpless spirit as in the concentric wheels of my nightly vision. I did
not struggle against it, because I believed
that it was inevitable, and that there was no
other way of making peace with the terrible
and ever-watchful "God who is a jealous
God." But I looked forward to my fate without zeal and without exhilaration, and the fear
of the Lord altogether swallowed up and
cancelled any notion of the Jove of Him.
I should do myself an injustice, however, if
I described my attitude to faith at this time as
wanting in candour. I did very earnestly
desire to follow where my Father led. That
passion for imitation, which I have already
discussed, was strongly developed at this time,
228
*i
FATHER AND SON
and it induced me to repeat the language of
pious books in godly ejaculations which greatly
edified my grown-up companions, and were,
so far as I can judge, perfectly sincere. I
wished extremely to be good and holy, and I
had no doubt in my mind of the absolute infallibility of my Father as a guide in heavenly
things. But I am perfectly sure that there
never was a moment in which my heart truly
responded, with native ardour, to the words
which flowed so readily, in such a stream of unction, from my anointed lips. I cannot recall
anything but an intellectual surrender; there
was never joy in the act of resignation, never the
mystic's rapture at feeling his phantom self,
his own threadbare soul, suffused, thrilled
through, robed again in glory by a fire which
burns up everything personal and individual
about him.
Through thick and thin I clung to a hard nut
of individuality, deep down in my childish
nature. To the pressure from without, I
resigned everything else, my thoughts, my
words, my anticipations, my assurances, but
there was something which I never resigned,
my innate and persistent self. Meek as I
seemed, and gently respondent, I was always
conscious of that innermost quality which I
229
Ili
FATHER AND SON
had learned to recognise in my earlier days in
Islington, that existence of two in the depths
who could speak to one another in inviolable
secrecy.
" This a natural man may discourse of, and
that very knowingly, and give a kind of
natural credit to it, as to a history that may
be true; but firmly to believe that there is
divine truth in all these things, and to have a
persuasion of it stronger than of the very thing
we see with our eyes; such an assent as this is
the peculiar work of the Spirit of God, and is
certainly saving faith." This passage is not to
be found in the writings of any extravagant
Plymouth Brother, but in one of the most
solid classics of the Church, in Archbishop
Leighton's " Commentary on the First Epistle
of Peter." I quote it because it defines, more
exactly than words of my own could hope to
do, the difference which already existed, and
in secrecy began forthwith to be more and
more acutely accentuated, between my Father
and myself. He did indeed possess this
saving faith, which could move mountains of
evidence, and suffer no diminution under the
action of failure or disappointment. I, on
the other hand-as I began to feel dimly then,
and see luminously now-had only acquired
230
FATHER AND SON
the habit of giving what the Archbishop means
by " a kind of natural credit " to the doctrine
so persistently impressed upon my conscience.
From its very nature this could not but be
molten in the dews and exhaled in the sunshine
of life and thought and experience.
My Father, by an indulgent act for the
caprice of which I cannot wholly account,
presently let in a flood of imaginative light
which was certainly hostile to my heavenly
calling. My instinctive interest in geography
has already been mentioned. This was the
one branch of knowledge in which I needed
no instruction, geographical information seeming to soak into the cells of my brain without
an effort. At the age of eleven, I knew a
great deal more of maps, and of the mutual
relation of localities all over the globe, than
most grown-up people do. It was almost a
mechanical acquirement. I was now greatly
taken with the geography of the West Indies,
of every part of which I had made MS. maps.
There was something powerfully attractive to
my fancy in the great chain of the Antilles,
lying on the sea like an open bracelet, with its
big jewels and little jewels strung on an invisible thread. I liked to shut my eyes and
see it all, in a mental panorama, stretched!231
FATHER AND SON
from Cape Sant' Antonio to the Serpent's
Mouth. Several of these lovely islands, these
emeralds and amethysts set on the Caribbean
Sea, my Father had known well in his youth,
and I was importunate in questioning him
about them. One day, as I multiplied inquiries,
he rose in his impetuous way, and climbing to
the top of a bookcase, brought down a thick
volume and presented it to me. " You'll find alli
about the Antilles there," he said, and left me;
with " Tom Cringle's Log" in my possession.
The embargo laid upon every species of
fiction by my Mother's powerful scruple had
never been raised, although she had been dead
four years. As I have said in an earlierchapter, this was a point on which I believer
that my Father had never entirely agreed with
her. He had, however, yielded to her prejudice, and no work of romance, no fictitious
story, had ever come in my way. It is
remarkable that among our books, which
amounted to many hundreds, I had never discovered a single work of fiction until my
Father himself revealed the existence of
Michael Scott's wild masterpiece. So little
did I understand what was allowable in the
way of literary invention that 1 began the
story without a doubt that it was true, and 1
232
FATHER AND SON
think it was my Father himself who, in answer
to an inquiry, explained to me that it was " all
made up." He advised me to read the descriptions of the sea, and of the mountains of
Jamaica, and "skip" the pages which gave
imaginary adventures and conversations. But
I did not take his counsel; these latter were
the flower of the book to me. I had never
read, never dreamed of anything like them,
and they filled my whole horizon with glory
and with joy.
I suppose that when my Father was a
younger man, and less pietistic, he had read
" Tom Cringle's Log" with pleasure, because
it recalled familiar scenes to him. Much was
explained by the fact that the frontispiece of
this edition was a delicate line-engraving of
Blewfields, the great lonely house in a garden
of Jamaican all-spice where for eighteen
months he had worked as a naturalist. He
could not look at this print without recalling
exquisite memories and airs that blew from a
terrestrial paradise. But Michael Scott's ----<
noisy amorous novel of adventure was an
extraordinary book to put in the hands of a
child who had never been allowed to glance at
the mildest and most febrifugal story-book.
It was like giving a glass of brandy neat to
233
FATHER AND SON
some one who had never been weaned from a
milk diet. I have not read "Tomn Cringle's
Log" from that day to this, and I think that
I should be unwilling now to break the charm
of memory, which may be largely illusion.
But I remember a great deal of the plot and
not a little of the language, and, while I am
sure it is enchantingly spirited, I am quite as
sure that the persons it describes were far
from being unspotted by the world. The
scenes at night in the streets of Spanish Town
surpassed not merely my experience, but,
thank goodness, my imagination. The nautical
personages used, in their conversations, what is
called " a class of language," and there ran, if
I am not mistaken, a glow and gust of life
through the romance from beginning to end
which was nothing if it was not resolutely
pagan.
There were certain scenes and images in
"Tom Cringle's Log" which made not merely
a lasting impression upon my mind, but tinged
my outlook upon life. The long adventures,
fightings and escapes, sudden storms without,
and mutinies within, drawn forth as they were,
surely with great skill, upon the fiery blue of
the boundless tropical ocean, produced on my
inner mind a sort of glimmering hope, very \
234
FATHER AND SON
vaguely felt at first, slowly developing, long
stationary and faint, but always tending
towards a belief that I should escape at last
from the narrowness of the life we led at home,
from this bondage to the Law and the
Prophets.
I must not define too clearly, 'or endeavour too formally to insist on the blind movements of a childish mind. But of this I am
quite sure, that the reading and re-reading
of " Tom Cringle's Log" did mnore than anything else, in this critical eleventh year of my
life, to give fortitude to my individuality,
which was in great danger-as I now see-of
succumbing to the pressure my Father brought
to bear upon it from all sides. My soul was
shut up, like Fatima, in a tower to which no
external influences could come, and it might
really have been starved to death, or have lost
the power of recovery and rebound, if my
captor, by some freak not yet perfectly
accounted for, had not gratuitously opened a
little window in it and added a powerful
telescope. The daring chapters of Michael
Scott's picaresque romance of the tropics were
that telescope and that window.
In the spring of this year, I began to walk
about the village and even proceed for con235
FATHER AND SON
siderable distances into the country by myself,
and after reading " Tom Cringle's Log" those
expeditions were accompanied by a constant
hope of meeting with some adventures. I did
not court events, however, except in fancy, for
I was very shy of real people, and would break
off some gallant dream of prowess on the high
seas to bolt into a field and hide behind the
hedge, while a couple of labouring men went
by. Sometimes, however, the wave of a great
purpose would bear me on, as when once, but
certainly at an earlier date than I have now
reached, hearing the dangers of a persistent
drought much dwelt upon, I carried my small
red watering-pot, full of water, up to the top
of the village, and then all the way down
Petit-tor Lane, and discharged its contents in
a cornfield, hoping by this act to improve the
prospects of the harvest. A more eventful
excursion must be described, because of the
moral impression it left indelibly upon me.
I have described the sequestered and beautiful hamlet of Barton, to which I was so often
taken visiting by Mary Grace Burmington. At
Barton there lived a couple who were objects
of peculiar interest to me, because of the
rather odd fact that having come, out of pure
curiosity, to see me baptized, they had been
236
FATHER AND SON
then and there deeply convinced of their
spiritual danger. These were John Brooks,
an Irish quarryman, and his wife, Ann Brooks.
These people had not merely been hitherto
unconverted, but they had openly treated the
Brethren with anger and contempt. They
came, indeed, to my baptism to mock, but they
went away impressed.
Next morning, when Mrs. Brooks was at
the wash-tub, as she told us, Hell opened,,
at her feet, and the Devil came out hold`s
ing a long scroll on which the list of her>@
sins was written. She was so much excited,
that the emotion brought about a miscarriage
and she was soriously ill. Meanwhile, her
husband, who had been equally moved at the
baptism, was also converted, and as soon as
she was well enough, they were baptized
together, and then "broke bread" with us.
The case of the Brookses was much talked
about, and was attributed, in a distant sense,
to me; that is to say, if I had not been an
object of public curiosity, the Brookses might
have remained in the bond of iniquity. I,
therefore, took a very particular interest in
them, and as I presently heard that they were
extremely poor, I was filled with a fervent
longing to minister to their necessities.
237
FATHER AND SON
Somebody had lately given me a present of
money, and I begged little sums here and
there until I reached the very considerable
figure of seven shillings and sixpence. With
these coins safe in a little linen bag, I started
one Sunday afternoon, without saying anything
to any one, and I arrived at the Brookses'
cottage in Barton. John Brooks was a heavy
dirty man, with a pock-marked face and two
left legs; his broad and red face carried small
side-whiskers in the manner of that day, but
was otherwise shaved. When I reached the
cottage, husband and wife were at home, doing
nothing at all in the approved Sunday style.
I was received by them with some surprise,
but I quickly explained my mission, and produced my linen bag. To my disgust, all John
Brooks said was, "I know'd the Lord would'
provide," and after emptying my little bag into
the palm of an enormous hand, he swept the
contents into his trousers pocket, and slapped
his leg. He said not one single word of thanks
or appreciation, and I was absolutely cut to
the heart.
I think that in the course of a long life I
have never experienced a bitterer disappointment. The woman, who was quicker, and
more sensitive, doubtless saw my embar238
FATHER AND SON
rassment, but the form of comfort which she
chose was even more wounding to my pride.
"Never mind, little master," she said, " you
shall come and see me feed the pigs." But
there is a limit to endurance, and with a sense
of having been cruelly torn by the tooth of
Ingratitude, I fled from the threshold of the
Brookses, never to return.
At tea that afternoon, I was very much
downcast, and under cross-examination from
Miss Marks, all my little story came out. My
Father, who had been floating away in a
meditation, as he very often did, caught a word
that interested him and descended to consciousness. 1 had to tell my tale over again, this
time very sadly, and with a fear that I should
be reprimanded. But on the contrary, both
my Father and Miss Marks were attentive
and most sympathetic, and I was much comforted. "We must remember they are the
Lord's children," said my Father. " Even the
Lord can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear,"
said Miss Marks, who was considerably ruffled.
"Alas! alas!"5 replied my Father, waving his
hand with a deprecating gesture. " The dear
child I" said Miss Marks, bristling with indignation, and patting my hand across the teatable. "The Lord will reward your zealous
239
FATHER AND SON
loving care of his poor, even if they have
neither the grace nor the knowledge to thank
you," said my Father, and rested his brown
eyes meltingly upon me. " Brutes!" said Miss
Marks, thinking of John and Mary Brooks.
"Oh no! no!" replied my Father, "but
hewers of wood and drawers of water! We
must bear with the limited intelligence." All
this was an emollient to my wounds, and I
became consoled. But the springs of benevolence were dried up within me, and to this day
I have never entirely recovered from the shock
of John Brooks's coarse leer and his "I know'd
the Lord would provide." The infant plant
of philanthropy was burned in my bosom as if
by quick-lime.
In the course of the summer, a young
schoolmaster called on my Father to announce
to him that he had just opened a day-school
for the sons of gentlemen in our vicinity, and
he begged for the favour of a visit. My
Father returned his call; he lived in one of
the small white villas, buried in laurels, which
gave a discreet animation to our neighbourhood.
Mr. M. was frank and modest, deferential to my
Father's opinions and yet capable of defending
his own. His school and he produced an
excellent impression, and in August I began
240
FATHER AND SON
to be one of his pupils. The school was very
informal; it was held in the two principal
dwelling-rooms on the ground-floor of the
villa, and I do not remember that Mr. M. had
any help from an usher.
There were perhaps twenty boys in the
school at most, and often fewer. I made
the excursion between home and school four
times a day; if 1 walked fast, the transit
might take five minutes, and, as there were
several objects of interest in the way, it
might be spread over an hour. In fine
weather the going to and from school was
very delightful, and small as the scope of it
was, it could be varied almost indefinitely. I
would sometimes meet with a schoolfellow
proceeding in the same direction, and my
Father, observing us over the wall one morning, was amused to notice that I always
progressed by dancing along the curbstone
sideways, my face turned inwards and my
arms beating against, my legs, conversing
loudly all the time. This was a case of pure
heredity, for so he used to go to his school,
forty years before, along the streets of Poole.
One day when fortunately I was alone, I
was accosted by an old gentleman, dressed as
a dissenting minister. He was pleased with
241
9
FATHER AND SON
my replies, and he presently made it a habit to
be taking his constitutional when I was likely
to be on the high road. We became great
friends, and he took me at last to his house,
a very modest place, where to my great
amazement, there hung in the dining-room,
two large portraits, one of a man, the other of
a woman, in extravagant fancy-dress. My
old friend told me that the former was a
picture of himself as he had appeared, "' long
ago, in my unconverted days, on the stage."
I was so ignorant as not to have the slightest
conception of what was meant by the stage,
and he explained to me that he had been an
actor and a poet, before the Lord had opened
his eyes to better things. I knew nothing
about actors, but poets were already the
objects of my veneration. My friend was
the first poet I had ever seen. He was no
less a person than James Sheridan Knowles,
the famous author of Virginius and The
Hunchback, who had become a Baptist
minister in his old age. When, at home, I
mentioned this acquaintance, it awakened no
interest. T believe that my Father had never
heard, or never noticed, the name of one who
had been by far the most eminent English
playwright of that age.
242
FATHER AND SON
It was from Sheridan Knowles' lips that 1
first heard fall the name of Shakespeare. He
was surprised, I fancy, to find me so curiously
advanced in some branches of knowledge, and
so utterly ignorant of others. He could
hardly credit, that the names of Hamlet and
Falstaff and Prospero meant nothing to a little
boy who knew so much theology and geography as I did. Mr. Knowles suggested that
I should ask my schoolmaster to read some
of the plays of Shakespeare with the boys,
and he proposed The Merchant of Venice as
particularly well-suited for this purpose. I
repeated what my aged friend (Mr. Sheridan
Knowles must have been nearly eighty at that
time) had said, and Mr. M. accepted the idea
with promptitude. (All my memories of this
my earliest schoolmaster present him to me as
intelligent, amiable and quick, although I think
not very soundly prepared for his profession.)
Accordingly, it was announced that the
reading of Shakespeare would be one of our
lessons, and on the following afternoon we
began The Merchant of Venice. There was
one large volume, and it was handed about
the class; I was permitted to read the part of
Bassanio, and I set forth, with ecstatic pipe,
how
24 3
FATHER AND SON
In Belmont is a lady richly left,
And she is fair, and fairer than that word!
Mr. M. must have had some fondness for the
stage himself; his pleasure in the Shakespeare
scenes was obvious, and nothing else that he
taught me made so much impression on me as
what he said about a proper emphasis in reading aloud. I was in the seventh heaven of delight, but alas! we had only reached the second
act of the play, when the readings mysteriously
stopped. I never knew the cause, but I suspect that it was at my Father's desire. He
prided himself on never having read a page of,
Shakespeare, and on never having entered a
theatre but once. I think I must have spoken
at home about the readings, and that he must
have given the schoolmaster a hint to return to
the ordinary school curriculum.
The fact that I was " a believer," as it was
our custom to call one who had been admitted
to the arcana of our religion, and that therefore, in all commerce with "unbelievers," it
was my duty to be " testifying for my Lord,
in season and out of season,"-this prevented
my forming any intimate friendships at my
first school. I shrank from the toilsome and
embarrassing act of button-holing a schoolfellow as he rushed out of class, and of press244
FATHER AND SON
ing upon him the probably unintelligible
question"Have you found Jesus?" It was
simpler to avoid him, to slip like a lizard
through the laurels and emerge into solitude.
The boys had a way of plunging out into
the road in front of the school-villa when afternoon school was over; it was a pleasant rural
road lined with high hedges and shadowed by
elm-trees. Here, especially towards the
summer twilight, they used to linger and play
vague games, swooping and whirling in the
declining sunshine, and I used to join these
bat-like sports. But my company, though
not avoided, was not greatly sought for. I
think that something of my curious history
was known, and that I was, not unkindly
but instinctively, avoided, as an animal of a
different species, not allied to the herd. The
conventionality of little boys is constant; the
colour of their traditions is uniform. At the
same time, although I made no friends, I
found no enemies. In class, except in my
extraordinary aptitude for geography, which
was looked upon as incomprehensible and
almost uncanny, I was rather behind than in
front of the others. I, therefore, awakened
no jealousies, and, intent on my own dreams,
245
FATHER AND SON
I think my little shadowy presence escaped
the notice of most of my schoolfellows.
By the side of the road I have mentioned,
between the school and my home, there was a
large horse-pond. The hedge folded round
three sides of it, while ancient pollard elms
bent over it, and chequered with their foliage
in it the reflection of the sky. The roadside
edge of this pond was my favourite station;
it consisted of a hard clay which could be
moulded into fairly tenacious forms. Here I
created a maritime empire-islands, a seaboard with harbours, lighthouses, fortifications.
My geographical imitativeness had its full
swing. Sometimes, while I was creating, a
cart would be driven roughly into the pond,
and a horse would drink deep of my ocean,
his hooves trampling my archipelagoes and
shattering my ports with what was worse than
a typhoon. But I immediately set to work,
as soon as the cart was gone and tie mud had
settled, to tidy up my coast-line again and to
scoop out anew my harbours.
My pleasure in this sport was endless, and
what I was able to see, in my mind's eye, was
not the edge of a morass of mud, but a splendid
line of coast, and gulfs of the type of Tor Bay.
I do not recollect a sharper double humiliation
246
FATHER AND SON
than when old Sam Lamble, the blacksmith,
who was one of the " saints," being asked by my
Father whether he had met me, replied "Yes,
I zeed 'un up-long making mud pies in the
ro-ad!" What a position for one who had
been received into communion " as an adult! "
What a blot on the scutcheon of a would-be
Columbus! "Mud-pies," indeed!
Yet I had an appreciator. One afternoon,
as I was busy on my geographical operations,
a good-looking middle-aged lady, with a soft
pink cheek and a sparkling hazel eye, paused
and asked me if my name was not what it was.
I had seen her before; a stranger to our parts,
with a voice without a trace in it of the Devonshire drawl. I knew, dimly, that she came
sometimes to the meeting, that she was lodging at Upton with some friends of ours who
accepted paying guests in an old house that
was simply a basket of roses. She was Miss
Brightwen, and I now conversed with her for
the first time.
Her interest in my harbours and islands
was marked; she did not smile; she asked
questions about my peninsulas which were
intelligent and pertinent. I was even persuaded at last to leave my creations and to
walk with her towards the village. I was
247
FATHER AND SON
pleased with her voice, her refinement, her
dress, which was more delicate, and her
manners, which were more easy, than what I
was accustomed to. We had some very
pleasant conversation, and when we parted I
had the satisfaction of feeling that our intercourse had been both agreeable to me and
instructive to her. I told her that I should be
glad to tell her more on a future occasion; she
thanked me very gravely, and then she laughed
a little. I confess I did not see that there was
anything to laugh at. We parted on warm
terms of mutual esteem, but I little thought
that this sympathetic Quakerish lady was to
become my mother.
248
CHAPTER X
I SLEPT in a little bed in a corner of the room,
and my Father in the ancestral four-poster
nearer to the door. Very early one bright
September morning at the close of my eleventh
year, my Father called me over to him. 1
climbed up, and was snugly wrapped in the
coverlid; and then we held a momentous conversation. It began abruptly by his asking
me whether I should like to have a new
mamma. I was never a sentimentalist, and I
therefore answered, cannily, that that would 7
depend on who she was. He parried this,
and announced that, any way, a new mamma
was coming; I was sure to like her. Still in
a non-committal mood, I asked: " Will she go
with me to the back of the lime-kiln?" This
question caused my Father a great bewilderment. I had to explain that the ambition
of my life was to go up behind the lime-kiln
on the top of the hill that hung over Barton,
249
FATHER AND SON
a spot which was forbidden ground, being
locally held one of extreme danger. "Oh! I
daresay she will," my Father then said, "but
you must guess who she is." I guessed one
or two of the less comely of the female " saints,"
and, this embarrassing my Father,-since the
second I mentioned was a married woman
who kept a sweet-shop in the village,-he cut
my inquiries short by saying, "It is Miss
Brightwen."
So far so good, and 1 was well pleased.
But unfortunately I remembered that it was
my duty to testify "in season and out of
season." I therefore asked, with much earnestness, "But, Papa, is she one of the Lord's
children?" He replied, with gravity, that
she was. "Has she taken up her cross in
baptism?" I went on, for this was my own
strong point as a believer. My Father looked
a little shame-faced, and replied: " Well, she
has not as yet seen the necessity of that, but
we must pray that the Lord may make her
way clear before her. You see, she has been
brought up, hitherto, in the so-called Church
of England."
Our positions were now curiously changed.
It seemed as if it were I who was the
jealous monitor, and my Father the depre250
FATHER AND SON
eating penitent. I sat up in the coverlid, and
I shook a finger at him. "Papa," I said,
"don't tell me that she's a pedobaptist?" I
had lately acquired that valuable word, and I
seized this remarkable opportunity of using it.
It affected my Father painfully, but he repeated his assurance that if we united our
prayers, and set the Scripture plan plainly
before, Miss Brightwen, there could be no
doubt that she would see her way to accepting
the doctrine of adult baptism. And he said
we must judge not, lest we ourselves be
judged. I had just enough tact to let that
pass, but I was quite aware that our whole
system was one of judging, and that we had
no intention whatever of being judged ourselves. Yet even at the age of eleven one sees
that on certain occasions to press home the
truth is not convenient.
Just before Christmas, on a piercing night
of frost, my Father brought to us his bride.
The smartening up of the house, the new
furniture, the removal of my own possessions
to a private bed-room, the wedding-gifts of
the "1 saints," all these things paled in interest
before the fact that Miss Marks had made a
"scene," in the course of the afternoon. I
was dancing about the drawing-room, and was
251
FATHER AND SON
saying: (" Oh! I am so glad my new Mamma
is coming," when Miss Marks called out, in an
unnatural voice, "Oh! you cruel child." I
stopped in amazement and stared at her,
whereupon she threw prudence to the winds,
and moaned: "I once thought I should be
your dear mamma." I was simply stupefied,
and 1 expressed my horror in terms that were
clear and strong. Thereupon Miss Marks had
a wild fit of hysterics, while I looked
on, wholly unsympathetic and still deeply
affronted. She was right; I was cruel, alas!
but then, what a silly woman she had been!
The consequence was that she withdrew
in a moist and quivering condition to her
boudoir, where she had locked herself in when
1, all smiles and caresses, was welcoming the
bride and bridegroom on the doorstep as
politely as if I had been a valued old family
retainer.
My stepmother immediately became a
great ally of mine. She was never a tower of
strength to me, but at least she was always a
lodge in my garden of cucumbers. She was a
very well-meaning pious lady, but she was not
a fanatic, and her mind did not naturally revel
in spiritual aspirations. Almost her only social
fault was that she was sometimes a little fret252
k
FATHER AND SON
ful; this was the way in which her bruised
individuality asserted itself. But she was
affectionate, serene, and above all refined.
Her refinement was extraordinarily pleasant to
my nerves, on which much else in our surroundings jarred.
How life may have jarred, poor insulated
lady, on her during her first experience of
our life at the Room, I know not, but I think
she was a philosopher. She had, with surprising rashness, and in opposition to the
wishes of every member of her own family,
taken her cake, and now she recognised that
she must eat it, to the last crumb. Over her
wishes and prejudices my Father exercised a
constant, cheerful and quiet pressure. He
was never unkind or abrupt, but he went on
adding avoirdupois until her will gave way
under the sheer weight. Even to public immersion, which, as was natural in a shy and
sensitive lady of advancing years, she regarded
with a horror which was long insurmountable,-even to baptism she yielded, and my
Father had the joy to announce to the Saints
one Sunday morning at the breaking of bread
that " my beloved wife has been able at length
to see the Lord's Will in the matter of baptism,
and will testify to the faith which is in her on
253
FATHER AND SON
Thursday evening next." No wonder my
stepmother was sometimes fretful.
On the physical side, I owe her an endless
debt of gratitude. Her relations, who objected strongly to her marriage, had told her,
among other pleasant prophecies, that "the
first thing you will have to do will be to bury
that poor child." Under the old-world sway
of Miss Marks, I had slept beneath a load of
blankets, had never gone out save weighted
with great coat and comforter, and had been
protected from fresh air as if from a pestilence.
With real courage my stepmother reversed
all this. My bed-room window stood wide
open all night long, wraps were done away
with, or exchanged for flannel garments next
the skin, and I was urged t6 be out and about
as much as possible.
All the quidnuncs among the " saints " shook
their heads; Mary Grace Burmington, a little
embittered by the downfall of her Marks, made
a solemn remonstrance to my Father, who,
however, allowed my stepmother to carry out
herexcellentplan. Myhealth responded rapidly
to this change of regime, but increase of health
did not bring increase of spirituality. My
Father, fully occupied with moulding the will
and inflaming the piety of my stepmother, left
254
FATHER AND SON
me now, to a degree not precedented, in undisturbed possession of my own devices. I did not
lose my faith, but many other things took a
prominent place in my mind.
It will, I suppose, be admitted that there is
no greater proof of complete religious sincerity
than fervour in private prayer. If an individual, alone by the side of his bed, prolongs
his intercessions, lingers wrestling with his
divine Companion, and will not leave off until
he has what he believes to be evidence of a
reply to his entreaties-then, no matter what
the character of his public protestations, or
what the frailty of his actions, it is absolutely
certain that he believes in what he professes.
My Father prayed in private in what I may
almost call a spirit of violence. He entreated
for spiritual guidance with nothing less than
importunity. It might be said that he
stormed the citadels of God's grace, refusing
to be baffled, urging his intercessions without
mercy upon a Deity who sometimes struck me
as inattentive to his prayers or wearied by
them. My Father's acts of supplication, as I
used to witness them at night, when I was
supposed to be asleep, were accompanied by
stretchings out of the hands, by crackings of
the joints of the fingers, by deep breathings, by
255
FATHER AND SON
murmurous sounds which seemed just breaking out of silence, like Virgil's bees out of the
hive, mzagnis clamoribus. My Father fortified
his religious life by prayer as an athlete does
his physical life by lung-gymnastics and
vigorous rubbings.
It was a trouble to my conscience that I
could not emulate this fervour. The poverty
of my prayers had now long been a source of
distress to me, but I could not discover how
to enrich them. My Father used to warn us
very solemnly against " lip-service," by which
he meant singing hymns of experience and
joining in ministrations in which our hearts
took ho vital or personal part. This was an
outward act, the tendency of which I could
well appreciate, but there was a " lip-service "
even more deadly than that, against which it
never occurred to him to warn me. It assailed
me when I had come alone by my bedside,
and had blown out the candle, and had sunken
on my knees in my night-gown. Then it was
that my deadness made itself felt, in the
mechanical address 1 put up, the emptiness of
my language, the absence of all real unction.
I never could contrive to ask God for
spiritual gifts in the same voice and spirit in
which I could ask a human being for objects
256
FATHER AND SON
which I knew he could give me and which 1
earnestly desired to possess. That sense of
the reality of intercession was for ever denied
me, and it was, I now see, the stigma of my
want of faith. But at the time, of course,
I suspected nothing of the kind, and I tried
to keep up my zeal by a desperate mental
flogging, as if my soul had been a peg-top.
In nothing did I gain from the advent of
my stepmother more than in the encouragement she gave to my friendships with a group
of boys of my own age, of whom I had now
lately formed the acquaintance. These friendships she not merely tolerated, but fostered;
it was even due to her kind arrangements that
they took a certain set form, that our excursions started from this house or from that on
regular days. I hardly know by what stages
I ceased to be a lonely little creature of mockmonographs and mud-pies, and became a
member of a sort of club of eight or ten active
boys. The long summer holidays of 1861
were set in an enchanting brightness.
Looking back, I cannot see a cloud on the
terrestrial horizon-I see nothing but a blaze of
sunshine; descents of slippery grass to moons
of snow-white shingle, cold to the bare flesh;
red promontories running out into a sea that
257 R
FATHER AND SON
was like sapphire; and our happy clan climbing,
bathing, boating, lounging, chattering, all the
hot day through. Once more I have to
record the fact, which I think is not without
interest, that precisely as my life ceases to be
j solitary, it ceases to be distinct. I have no
difficulty in recalling, with the minuteness of
a photograph, scenes in which my Father and
I were the sole actors within the four walls of
/ a room, but of the glorious life among wild
boys on the margin of the sea I have nothing
but vague and broken impressions, delicious
and illusive.
It was a remarkable proof of my Father's
temporary lapse into indulgence that he made
no effort to thwart my intimacy with these
my new companions. He was in an unusually
humane mood himself. His marriage was one
proof of it; another was the composition at. this time of the most picturesque, easy and
graceful of all his writings, "The Romance of
I Natural History," even now a sort of classic.
Everything combined to make him believe
that the blessing of the Lord was upon him,
and to clothe the darkness of the world with
at least a mist of rose-colour. 1 do not
recollect that ever at this time he bethought
him, when I started in the morning for a long
258
FATHER AND SON
day with my friends on the edge of the sea, to
remind me that I must speak to them, in
season and out of season, of the Blood of
Jesus. And I, young coward that I was, let
sleeping dogmas lie.
My companions were not all of them the
sons of saints in our communion; their parents
belonged to that professional class which we
were only now beginning to attract to our
services. They were brought up in religious,
but not in fanatical, families, and I was the only
"converted" one among them. Mrs. Paget,
of whom I shall have presently to speak, characteristically said that it grieved her to see "one
lamb among so many kids." But "kid" is a
word of varied significance, and the symbol
did not seem to us effectively applied. As a
matter of fact, we made what I still feel was
an excellent tacit compromise. My young
companions never jeered at me for being" in
communion with the saints," and I, on my
part, never urged the Atonement upon them.
I began, in fact, more and more to keep my
own religion for use on Sundays.
It will, I hope, have been observed that
among the very curious grown.up people into
whose company I was thrown, although many
were frail and some were foolish, none, so far
259
FATHER AND SON
as I can discern, were hypocritical. I am not
one of those who believe that hypocrisy is a
vice that grows on every bush. Of course, in
religious more than in any other matters,
there is a perpetual contradiction between our
thoughts and our deeds which is inevitable to
our social order, and is bound to lead to
<' cette tromperie mutuelle" of which Pascal
speaks. But I have often wondered, while
admiring the splendid portrait of Tartufe,
whether such a monster ever, or at least often,
has walked the stage of life; whether Molibre
observed, or only invented him.
To adopt a scheme of religious pretension,
with no belief whatever in its being true, merely
for sensuous advantage, openly acknowledging
to one's inner self the brazen system of deceit,such a course may, and doubtless has been, trodden, yet surely much less frequently than cynics
love to suggest. But at the juncture which I
have now reached in my narrative, I had the
advantage of knowing a person who was
branded before the whole world, and punished
by the law of his country, as a felonious
hypocrite. My Father himself could only
sigh and admit the charge. And yet-I
doubt.
About half-way between our village and
26o
FATHER AND SON
the town there lay a comfortable villa
inhabited by a retired solicitor, or perhaps
attorney, whom 1 shall name Mr. Dormant.
We often called at his half-way house, and,
although he was a member of the townmeeting, he not unfrequently came up to us
for ",the breaking of bread." Mr. Dormant
was a solid, pink man, of a cosy habit. He
had beautiful white hair, a very soft voice,
and a welcoming, wheedling manner; he was
extremely fluent and zealous in using the
pious phraseology of the sect. My Father
had never been very much attracted to him,
but the man professed, and I think felt, an
overwhelming admiration for my Father.
Mr. Dormant was not very well off, and in
the previous year he had persuaded an aged
gentleman of wealth to come and board with
him. When, in the course of the winter,
this gentleman died, much surptise was felt at
the report that he had left almost his entire
fortune, which was not inconsiderable, to Mr.
Dormant.
Much surprise-for the old gentleman had
a son to whom he had always been warmly
attached, who was far away, I think in South
America, practising a perfectly respectable profession of which his father entirely approved.
261
FATHER AND SON
My own Father always preserved a delicacy
and a sense of honour about money which
could not have been more sensitive if he
had been an ungodly man, and I am very
much pleased to remember that when the
legacy was first spoken of, he regretted that
Mr. Dormant should have allowed the old
gentleman to make this will. If he knew the
intention, my Father said, it would have
shown a more proper sense of his responsibility
if he had dissuaded the testator from so
unbecoming a disposition. That was long
before any legal question arose; and now Mr.
Dormant came into his fortune, and began to
make handsome gifts to missionary societies,
and to his own meeting in the town. If I do
not mistake, he gave, unsolicited, a sum to our
building fund, which my Father afterwards
returned. But in process of time we heard
that the son had come back from the
Antipodes, and was making investigations.
Before we knew where we were, the news
burst upon us, like a bomb-shell, that Mr.
Dormant had been arrested on a criminal
charge and was now in gaol at Exeter.
Sympathy was at first much extended
amongst us to the prisoner. But it was
lessened when we understood that the old
262
FATHER AND SON
gentleman had been " converted " while under
Dormant's roof, and had given the fact that
his son was " an unbeliever " as a reason for
disinheriting him. All doubt was set aside
when it was divulged, under pressure, by the
nurse who attended on the old gentleman, herself one of the " saints," that Dormant had
traced the signature to the will by drawing
the fingers of the testator over the document
when he was already and finally comatose.
My Father, setting aside by a strong effort
of will the repugnance which he felt, visited
the prisoner in gaol before this final evidence
had been extracted. When he returned he said
that Dormant appeared to be enjoying a perfect confidence of heart, and had expressed a
sense of his joy and peace in the Lord; my
Father regretted that he had not been able to
persuade him to admit any error, even of judgment. But the prisoner's attitude in the dock,
when the facts were proved, and not by him
denied, was still more extraordinary. He
could be induced to exhibit no species of remorse, and, to the obvious anger of the judge
himself, stated that he had only done his duty
as a Christian, in preventing this wealth from
coming into the hands of an ungodly man, who
would have spent it in the service of the flesh
263
FATHER AND SON
and of the devil. Sternly reprimanded by the
judge, he made the final statement that at that
very moment he was conscious of his Lord's
presence, in the dock at his side, whispering to
him "Well done, thou good and faithful servant!" In this frame of conscience, and with
a glowing countenance, he was hurried away to
penal servitude.
This was a very painful incident, and it is
easy to see how compromising, how cruel, it
was in its effect upon our communion; what
occasion it gave to our enemies to blaspheme.
No one, in either meeting, could or would
raise a voice to defend Mr. Dormant. We
had to bow our heads when we met our
enemies in the gate. The blow fell more
heavily on the meeting of which he had been
a prominent and communicating member, but
it fell on us too, and my Father felt it severely.
For many years he would never mention the
man's name, and he refused all discussion of
the incident.
Yet I was never sure and I am not sure
now, that the wretched being was a hypocrite.
There are as many vulgar fanatics as there
are distinguished ones, and I am not convinced that Dormant, coarse and narrow as
he was, may not have sincerely believed that
264
FATHER AND SON
it was better for the money to be used in religious propaganda than in the pleasures of the
world, of which he doubtless formed a very
vague idea. On this affair I meditated much,
and it awakened in my mind, for the first
time, a doubt whether our exclusive system
of ethics was an entirely salutary one, if it
could lead the conscience of a believer to
tolerate such acts as these, acts which my
Father himself had denounced as dishonourable and disgraceful.
My stepmother brought with her a little
library of such books as we had not previously
seen, but which yet were known to all the
world except us. Prominent among these
was a set of the poems of Walter Scott, and
in his unwonted geniality and provisional
spirit of compromise, my Father must do no
less than read these works aloud to my stepmother in the quiet spring evenings. This
was a sort of aftermath of courtship, a tribute
of song to his bride, very sentimental and
pretty. She would sit, sedately, at her workbox, while he, facing her, poured forth the
verses at her like a blackbird. I was not
considered in this arrangement, which was
wholly matrimonial, but I was present, and
the exercise made more impression upon
265
FATHER AND SON
me than it did upon either of the principal
agents.
My Father read the verse admirably, with a
full,-some people (but not I) might say with
too full-a perception of the metre as well as of
the rhythm, rolling out the rhymes, and glorying in the proper names. He began, and it
was a happy choice, with "The Lady of the
Lake." It gave me singular pleasure to hear
his large voice do justice to "Duncrannon"
and " Cambus-Kenneth," and wake the echoes
with "Roderigh Vich Alphine dhu, ho!
ieroe!" I almost gasped with excitement,
while a shudder floated down my backbone,
when we came to:
A sharp and shrieking echo gave,
Coir-Uriskin, thy goblin cave!
And the grey pass where birches wave,
On Beala-nam-bo,
a passage which seemed to me to achieve the
ideal of sublime romance. My thoughts
were occupied all day long with the adventures of Fitzjames and the denizens of Ellen's
Isle. It became an obsession, and when I was
asked whether I remembered the name of the
cottage where the minister of the Bible
Christians lodged, I answered, dreamily,
"Yes,-Beala-nam-bo."
266
FATHER AND SON
Seeing me so much fascinated, thrown
indeed into a temporary frenzy, by the epic.
poetry of Sir Walter Scott, my stepmother ( +
asked my Father whether I might not start (,
reading the Waverley Novels. But he refused \
to permit this, on the ground that those tales
gave false and disturbing pictures of life, and
would lead away my attention from heavenly
things. I do not fully apprehend what distinction he drew between the poems, which
he permitted, and the novels, which he refused.
But I suppose he regarded a work in verse as
more artificial, and therefore less likely to
make a realistic impression, than one in prose.
There is something quaint in the conscientious
scruple which allows " The Lord of the Isles"
and excludes " Rob Roy."
But stranger still, and amounting almost to
a whim, was his sudden decision that, although
I might not touch the novels of Scott, I was
free to read those of Dickens. I recollect that
my stepmother showed some surprise at this,
and that my Father explained to her that
Dickens " exposes the passion of love in a ridiculous light." She did not seem to follow this
recommendation, which indeed tends to the
ultra-subtle, but she procured for me a copy
of "Pickwick," by which I was instantly and
267
FATHER AND SON
gloriously enslaved. My shouts of laughing
at the richer passages were almost scandalous,
and led to my being reproved for disturbing
my Father while engaged, in an upper room,
in the study of God's Word. I must have
expended months on the perusal of," Pickwick,"
for I used to rush through a chapter, and
then read it over again very slowly, word for
word, and then shut my eyes to realise the
figures and the action.
I suppose no child will ever again enjoy that
rapture of unresisting humorous appreciation
of " Pickwick." I felt myself to be in the company of a gentleman so extremely funny that
I began to laugh before he began to speak; no
sooner did he remark " the sky was dark and
gloomy, the air was damp and raw," than I was
in fits of laughter. My retirement in our sequestered corner of life made me, perhaps, even
in this matter, somewhat old-fashioned, and
possibly I was the latest of the generation who
accepted Mr. Pickwick with an unquestioning
and hysterical abandonment. Certainly few
young people now seem sensitive, as I was,
and as thousands before me had been, to the
quality of his fascination.
It was curious that living in a household
where a certain delicate art of painting was
268
FATHER AND SON
diligently cultivated, I had yet never seen a
real picture, and was scarcely familiar with
the design of one in engraving. My stepmother, however, brought a flavour of the fine
arts with her; a kind of aesthetic odour, like
that of lavender, clung to her as she moved.
She had known authentic artists in her youth;
she had watched Old Crome painting, and had
taken a course of drawing-lessons from no less
a person than Cotman. She painted small
water-colour landscapes herself, with a delicate
economy of means and a graceful Norwich
convention; her sketch-books were filled with
abbeys gently washed in, river-banks in sepia
by which, the elect might be dimly reminded
of Liber Studiorum, and woodland scenes
over which the ghost of Creswick had faintly
breathed. It was not exciting art, but it was,
so far as it went, in its lady-like reserve, the
real thing. Our sea-anemones, our tropic birds,
our bits of spongy rock frilled and sprayed
with corallines, had been very conscientious
and skilful, but, essentially, so far as art was
concerned, the wrong thing.
Thus I began to acquire, without understanding the value of it, some conception of the
elegant phases of early English water-colour
painting, and there was one singular piece of a
269
FATHER AND SON
marble well brimming with water, and a greyish.
blue sky over it, and dark-green poplars, shaped
like wet brooms, menacing the middle distance,
which Cotman himself had touched; and this
seemed beautiful and curious to me in its dim,
flat frame, when it was hoisted to a place on
our drawing-room wall.
But still I had never seen a subject-picture,
although my stepmother used to talk of the
joys of the Royal Academy, and it was therefore with a considerable sense of excitement
that I went, with my Father, to examine Mr.
Holman Hunt's Finding of Christ in the
Temple which at this time was announced to
be on public show at our neighbouring town.
We paid our shillings and ascended with
others to an upper room, bare of every disturbing object, in which a strong top-light
raked the large and uncompromising picture.
We looked at it for some time in silence, and
then my Father pointed out to me various
details, such as the phylacteries and the
mitres, and the robes which distinguished the
high priest.
Some of the other visitors, as I recollect,
expressed astonishment and dislike of what
they called the "Preraphaelite " treatment, but
we were not affected by that. Indeed, if
270
FATHER AND SON
anything, the exact, minute and hard execution
of Mr. Hunt was in sympathy with the
methods we ourselves were in the habit of
using when we painted butterflies and seaweeds, placing perfectly pure pigments side
by side, without any nonsense about chiaroscuro. This large, bright, comprehensive
picture made a very deep impression upon
me, not exactly as a work of art, but as a
brilliant natural specimen. I was pleased to
have seen it, as I was pleased to have seen the
comet, and the whale which was brought to
our front door on a truck. It was a prominent addition to my experience.
The slender expansions of my interest which
were now budding hither and thither do not
seem to have alarmed my Father at all. His
views were short; if I appeared to be contented and obedient, if I responded pleasantly
when he appealed to me, he was not concerned
to discover the source of my cheerfulness. He
put it down to my happy sense ofjoy in Christ,
a reflection of the sunshine of grace beaming
upon me through no intervening clouds of sin or
doubt. The " saints " were, as a rule, very easy
to comprehend; their emotions lay upon the
surface. If they were gay, it was because they
had no burden on their consciences, while, if
271
FATHER AND SON
they were depressed, the symptom might be depended upon as showing that their consciences
were troubling them, and if they were indifferent and cold, it was certain that they were
losing their faith and becoming hostile to godliness. It was almost a mechanical matter with
these simple souls. But, although I was so
much younger, I was more complex and more
crafty than the peasant " saints." My Father,
not a very subtle psychologist, applied to me
the same formulas] which served him well at
the meeting, but in my case the results were
less uniformly successful.
The excitement of school-life and the enlargement of my circle of interests, combined
to make Sunday, by contrast, a very tedious
occasion. The absence of every species of
recreation on the Lord's Day grew to be a
burden which might scarcely be borne. I have
said that my freedom during the week had now
become considerable; if I was at home punctually at meal-times, the rest of my leisure was
not challenged. But this liberty, which in the
summer holidays came to surpass that of " fishes
that tipple in the deep,' was put into more and
more painful contrast with the unbroken servitude of Sunday.
My Father objected very strongly to the
272
FATHER AND SON
expression Sabbath-day, as it is commonly used
by Presbyterians and others. He said, quite
justly, that it was an inaccurate modern innovation, that Sabbath was Saturday, the seventh
day of the week, not the first, a Jewish
festival and not a Christian commemoration.
Yet his exaggerated view with regard to the
observance of the First Day, namely, that it
must be exclusively occupied with public
and private exercises of divine worship, was
based much more upon a Jewish than upon a
Christian law. In fact, I do not remember
that my Father ever produced a definite
argument from the New Testament in support of his excessive passivity on the Lord's
Day. He followed the early Puritan practice,
except that he did not extend his observance,
as I believe the old Puritans did, from sunset
on Saturday to sunset on Sunday.
The observance of the Lord's Day has
already become universally so lax that I think
there may be some value in preserving an
accurate record of how our Sundays were spent
five and forty years ago. We came down to
breakfast at the usual time. My Father
prayed briefly before we began the meal; after
it, the bell was rung, and, before the breakfast
was cleared away, we had a lengthy service of
27S
FATHER AND SON
exposition and prayer with the servants. If
the weather was fine, we then walked about
the garden, doing nothing, for about half an
hour. We then sat, each in a separate room,
with our Bibles open and some commentary
on the text beside us, and prepared our minds
for the morning service. A little before 11 A.M.
we sallied forth, carrying our Bibles and hymnbooks, and went through the morning-service
of two hours at the Room; this was the
central event of Sunday.
We then came back to dinner,-curiously
enough to a hot dinner, always, with a joint,
vegetables and puddings, so that the cook at
least must have been busily at work,-and
after it my Father and my stepmother took
a nap, each in a different room, while I
slipped out into the garden for a little while,
but never venturing further afield. In the
middle of the afternoon, my stepmother
and I proceeded up the village to Sunday
School, where I was early promoted to the
tuition of a few very little boys. We returned
in time for tea, immediately after which we
all marched forth, again armed, as in the
morning, with Bibles and hymn-books, and
we went through the evening-service, at which
my Father preached. The hour was now
274
FATHER AND SON
already past my week-day bedtime, but we
had another service to attend, the Believers'
Prayer Meeting, which commonly occupied
forty minutes more. Then we used to creep
home, I often so tired that the weariness was
like physical pain, and I was permitted, without
further " worship," to slip upstairs to bed.
What made these Sundays, the observance
of which was absolutely uniform, so peculiarly trying was that I was not permitted the
indulgence of any secular respite. I might
not open a scientific book, nor make a drawing, ~
nor examine a specimen. I was not allowed:
to go into the road, except to proceed with my \
parents to the Room, nor to discuss worldly
subjects at meals, nor to enter the little /
chamber where I kept my treasures. I was e
hotly and tightly dressed in black, all day long,
as though ready at any moment to attend a
funeral with decorum. Sometimes, towards
evening, I used to feel the monotony and
weariness of my position to be almost unendurable, but at this time I was meek, and I
bowed to what I supposed to be the order of
the universe.
275
CHAPTER XI
As my mental horizon widened, my Father
followed the direction of my spiritual eyes
with some bewilderment, and knew not at
what I gazed. Nor could I have put into
words, nor can I even now define, the visions
which held my vague and timid attention.
As a child develops, those who regard it with
tenderness or impatience are seldom even
approximately correct in their analysis of its
intellectual movements, largely because, if
there is anything to record, it defies adult
definition. One curious freak of mentality I
must now mention, because it took a considerable part in the enfranchisement of my
mind, or rather in the formation of my thinking habits. But neither my Father nor my
stepmother knew what to make of it, and to
tell the truth 1 hardly know what to make of
it myself.
Among the books which my new mother
276
FATHER AND SON
had brought with her were certain editions of
the poets, an odd assortment. Campbell was
there, and Burns, and Keats, and the " Tales"
of Byron. Each of these might have been
expected to appeal to me; but my emotion
was too young, and I did not listen to them
yet. Their imperative voices called me later.
By the side of these romantic classics stood a
small, thick volume, bound in black morocco,
and comprising four reprinted works of the
eighteenth century, gloomy, funereal poems of
an order as wholly out of date as are the
cross-bones and ruffled cherubim on the gravestones in a country churchyard. The fourand in this order, as I never shall forgetwere "The Last Day" of Dr. Young, Blair's
" Grave," " Death " by Bishop Beilby Porteus,
and " The Deity" of Samuel Boyse. These
lugubrious effusions, all in blank verse or in
the heroic couplet, represented, in its most
redundant form, the artistic theology of the
middle of the eighteenth century. They
were steeped in such vengeful and hortatory
sentiments as passed for elegant piety in the
reign of George II.
How I came to open this solemn volume
is explained by the oppressive exclusiveness
of our Sundays. On the afternoon of the
277
FATHER AND SON,
Lord's Day, as I have already explained,
I might neither walk, nor talk, nor explore our scientific library, nor indulge in
furious feats of water-colour painting. The
Plymouth-Brother theology which alone was
open to me produced, at length, and particularly on hot afternoons, a faint physical
nausea, a kind of secret headache. But,
hitting one day upon the doleful book of
verses, and observing its religious character, I
asked " May I read that?" and after a brief,
astonished glance at the contents, I received
"0 certainly-if you can! "
The lawn sloped directly from a verandah
at our drawing-room window, and it contained two immense elm-trees, which had
originally formed part of the hedge of a
meadow. In our trim and polished garden
they then remained-they were soon afterwards cut down-rude and obtuse, with
something primeval about them, something
autochthonous; they were like two peasant
ancestors surviving in a family that had
advanced to gentility. They rose each out of
a steep turfed hillock, and the root of one of
them was long my favourite summer readingdesk; for I could lie stretched on the lawn,
with my head and shoulders supported by the
278
FATHER AND SON
elm-tree hillock, and the book in a fissure of
the rough turf. Thither then I escaped with my
grave-yard poets, and who shall explain the
rapture with which I followed their austere
morality?
Whether 1 really read consecutively in my
black-bound volume I can no longer be sure,
but it became a companion whose society I
valued, and at worst it was a thousand times
more congenial to me than Jukes' "On the
Apocalypse" or than a perfectly excruciating
work ambiguously styled "The Javelin of
Phineas," which lay smouldering in a dull red
cover on the drawing-room table. 1 dipped
my bucket here and there into my poets, and
I brought up strange things. I brought up
out of the depths of " The Last Day" the
following ejaculation of a soul roused by the
trump of resurrection:
Father of mercies! Why from silent earth
Didst thou awake, and curse me into birth?
Tear me from quiet, ravish me from night,
And make a thankless present of thy light?
Push into being a reverse of thee,
And animate a clod with misery?
I read these lines with a shiver of excitement,
and in a sense I suppose little intended by the
sanctimonious rector of Welwyn. I also read
~79
FATHER AND SON
in the same piece the surprising description of
how
Now charnels rattle, scattered limbs, and all
The various bones, obsequious to the call,
Self-mov'd, advance-the neck perhaps to meet
The distant head, the distant legs the feet,
but rejected it as not wholly supported by the
testimony of Scripture. I think that the
rhetoric and vigorous advance of Young's
verse were pleasant to me. Beilby Porteus
I discarded from the first as impenetrable. In
" The Deity,"-I knew nothing then of the life
of its extravagant and preposterous author,I took a kind of persistent, penitential pleasure,
but it was Blair's " Grave " that really delighted
me, and I frightened myself with its melodious
doleful images in earnest.
About this time there was a great flow of
tea-table hospitality in the village, and my
friends and their friends used to be asked out,
by respective parents and by more than one
amiable spinster, to faint little entertainments
where those sang who were ambitious to sing,
and where all played post and forfeits after a
rich tea. My Father was constantly exercised
in mind as to whether I should or should not
accept these glittering invitations. There
hovered before him a painful sense of danger
280
FATHER AND SON
in resigning the soul to pleasures which
savoured of "'the world." These, though
apparently innocent in themselves, might give
an appetite for yet more subversive dissipations.
I remember, on one occasion, --when the
Browns, a family of Baptists who kept a
large haberdashery shop in the neighbouring
town, asked for the pleasure of my company
"to tea and games," and carried complacency
so far as to offer to send that local vehicle " the
midge," to fetch me and bring me back,-my
Father's conscience was so painfully perplexed,
that he desired me to come up with him to the
now-deserted "boudoir" of the departed
Marks, that we might "lay the matter before -
the Lord." We did so, kneeling side by side,
with our backs to the window and our foreheads
pressed upon the horsechair cover of the small,
coffin-like sofa. My Father prayed aloud,
with great fervour, that it might be revealed
to me, by the voice of God, whether it was or ~
was not the Lord's will that I should attend
the Browns' party. My Father's attitude
seemed to me to be hardly fair, since he did
not scruple to remind the Deity of various
objections to a life of pleasure and of the
snakes that lie hidden in the grass of evening
281
FATHER AND SON
parties. It would have been more scrupulous,
I thought, to give no sort of hint of the kind
of answer he desired and expected.
It will be justly said that my life was made
up of very trifling things, since I have to confess that this incident of the Browns' invitation
was one of its landmarks. As I knelt, feeling
very small, by the immense bulk of my Father,
there gushed through my veins like a wine the
determination to rebel. Never before, in all
these years of my vocation, had I felt my resistance take precisely this definite form. We
rose presently from the sofa, my forehead and
the backs of my hands still chafed by the texture of the horsehair, and we faced one another
in the dreary light. My Father, perfectly confident in the success of what had really been a
sort of incantation, asked me in a loud wheedling voice, "Well, and what is the answer
which our Lord vouchsafes? " I said nothing,
and so my Father, more sharply, continued,
" We have asked Him to direct you to a true
knowledge of His will. We have desired Him
to let you know whether it is, or is not, in
accordance with His wishes that you should
accept this invitation from the Browns." He
positively beamed down at me; he had no
doubt of the reply. He was already, I believe,
28
FATHER AND SON
planning some little treat to make up to me
for the material deprivation. But my answer
came, in the high-piping accents of despair:.)
"The Lord says 1 may go to the Browns."
My Father gazed at me in speechless horror. iHe was caught in his own trap, and though he
was certain that the Lord had said nothing of
the kind, there was no road open for him but
just sheer retreat. Yet surely it was an error
in tactics to slam the door.
It was at this party at the Browns-to
which I duly went, although in sore disgrace-that my charnel poets played me a
mean trick. It was proposed that "our
young friends" should give their elders the
treat of repeating any pretty pieces that
they knew by heart. Accordingly a little
girl recited "Casabianca," and another little
girl "We are Seven," and various children
were induced to repeat hymns, "some rather
long," as Calverley says, but all very mild
and innocuously evangelical. I was then
asked by 3Mrs. Brown's maiden sister, a gush-,ing lady in corkscrew curls, who led the
revels, whether I also would not indulge them
"by repeating some sweet stanzas." No one
more ready than I. Without a moment's
hesitation, I stood forth, and in a loud voice I
283
FATHER AND SON
began one of my favourite passages from Blair's
"Grave":C If death were nothing, and nought after death, --
If when men died at once they ceased to be,-? Returning to the barren Womb of Nothing
Whence first they sprung, then might the debauchee...
"Thank you, dear, that will do nicely I" interrupted the lady with the curls. " But that's
only the beginning of it," I cried. "Yes,
dear, but that will quite do! We won't ask
you to repeat any more of it," and I withdrew
to the borders of the company in bewilderment. Nor did the Browns or their visitors
ever learn what it was the debauchee might
have said or done in more favourable circumstances.
The growing eagerness which I displayed
for the society of selected schoolfellows and
for such gentle dissipations as were within my
reach exercised my Father greatly. His fancy
rushed forward with the pace of a steamengine, and saw me the life and soul of a
gambling club, or flaunting it at the Mabille.
He had no confidence in the action of moderating powers, and he was fond of repeating
that the downward path is easy. If one fretted
to be bathing with one's companions on the
shingle, and preferred this exercise to the
284
FATHER AND SON
study of God's Word, it was a symbol of a
terrible decline, the angle of which would
grow steeper and steeper, till one plunged into
perdition. He was, himself, timid and reclusive, and he shrank from all avoidable
companionship with others, except on the
footing of a master and teacher. My stepmother and I, who neither taught nor ruled,
yearned for a looser chain and lighter relationships. With regard to myself, my Father
about this time hit on a plan from which he
hoped much, but from which little resulted.
He looked to George to supply what my
temperament seemed to require of congenial
juvenile companionship.
If I have not mentioned "George" until
now, it is not that be was a new acquaintance.
When we first came down into the country,
our sympathy had been called forth by an
accident to a little boy, who was knocked over
by a horse, and whose thigh was broken.
Somebody (I suppose Mary Grace, since my
Father could rarely bring himself to pay these
public visits) went to see the child in the
infirmary, and accidentally discovered that he
was exactly the same age that I was. This,
and the fact that he was a meditative and
sober little boy, attracted us all still further
285
PATHER AND SON
to George, who became converted under one
of my Father's sermons. He attended my
public baptism, and was so much moved by
this ceremony that he passionately desired to
be baptized also, and was in fact so immersed,
a few months later, slightly to my chagrin,
since I thereupon ceased to be the only infant
prodigy in communion. When we were both
in our thirteenth year, George became an outdoor servant to us, and did odd jobs under the
gardener. My Father, finding him, as he
said, " docile, obedient and engaging," petted
George a good deal, and taught him a little
botany. He called George, by a curious
contortion of thought, my '" spiritual fosterbrother," and anticipated for him, I think, a
career, like mine, in the Ministry.
Our garden suffered from an incursion of
slugs, which laid the verbenas in the dust, and
shore off the carnations as if with pairs of
scissors. To cope with this plague we invested
in a drake and a duck, who were christened
Philemon and Baucis. Every night large
cabbage-leaves, containing the lees of beer,
were spread about the flower-beds as traps,
and at dawn these had become green parlours
crammed with intoxicated slugs. One of
George's earliest morning duties was to free
286
FAITHER AND SON
Philemon and Baucis from their coop, and,
armed with a small wand, to guide their footsteps to the feast in one cabbage-leaf after
another. My Father used to watch this
performance from an upper window, and, in
moments of high facetiousness, he was wont
to parody the poet Gray:
How jocund doth George drive his team afield!
This is all, or almost all, that I remember
about George's occupations, but he was singularly blameless.
My Father's plan now was that I should
form a close intimacy with George, as a boy
of my own age, of my own faith, of my own
future. My stepmother, still in bondage
to the social conventions, was passionately
troubled at this, and urged the barrier of
class-differences. My Father replied that
such an intimacy would keep me " lowly,"
and that from so good a boy as George I
could learn nothing undesirable. "He will
encourage him not to wipe his boots when he
comes into the house," said my stepmother,
and my Father sighed to think how narrow
is the horizon of Woman's view of heavenly
things.
In this caprice, if I may call it so, I think
287
FATHER AND SON
that my Father had before him. the fine republican example of "1 Sandford and Merton," some
parts of which book he admired extremely.
Accordingly George and I were sent out to
take walks together, and as we started, my
Father, with an air of great benevolence,
would suggest some passage of Scripture,
"some aspect of God's bountiful scheme in
creation, on which you may profitably meditate
together." George and I never pursued the
discussion of the text with which my Father
started us for more than a minute or two;
then we fell into silence, or investigated
current scenes and rustic topics.
As is natural among the children of the poor,
George was precocious where I was infantile,
and undeveloped where I was elaborate. Our
minds could hardly find a point at which to
touch. He gave me, however, under crossexamination, interesting hints about rural
matters, and I liked him, although I felt his
company to be insipid. Sometimes he carried
my books by my side to the larger and more
distant school which I now attended, but I was
always in a fever of dread lest my schoolfellows should see him, and should accuse me
of having to be "brought" to school. To
explain to them that the companionship of
288
FATHER AND SON
this wholesome and rather blunt young peasant
was part of my spiritual discipline would have
been all beyond my powers.
It was soon after this that my stepmother
made her one vain effort to break through the
stillness of our lives. My Father's energy
seemed to decline, to become more fitful, to
take unseasonable directions. My mother
instinctively felt that his peculiarities were
growing upon him; he would scarcely stir
from his microscope, except to go to the
chapel, and he was visible to fewer and fewer
visitors. She had taken a pleasure in his
literary eminence, and she was aware that this,
too, would slip from him; that, so persistently
kept out of sight, he must soon be out of
mind. I know not how she gathered courage
for her tremendous effort, but she took me, I
recollect, into her counsels. We were to unite
to oblige my Father to start to his feet and
face the world. Alas! we might as well have
attempted to rouse the summit of Yes Tor
into volcanic action. To my mother's arguments, my Father-with that baffling smile of
his-replied: " I esteem the reproach of Christ
greater riches than the treasures of Egypt I "
and that this answer was indirect made it none
the less conclusive. My mother wished him
289
7
FATHER AND SON
to give lectures, to go to London, to read
papers before the Royal Society, to enter into
controversy with foreign savants, to conduct
classes of out-door zoology at fashionable
watering-places. I held my breath with admiration as she poured forth her scheme, so
daring, so brilliant, so sure to cover our great
man with glory. He listened to her with an
ambiguous smile, and shook his head at us,
and resumed the reading of his Bible.
At the date at which I write these pages,
the arts of illustration are so universally
diffused that it is difficult to realise the darkness in which a remote English village was
plunged half a century ago. No opportunity
was offered to us dwellers in remote places of
realising the outward appearances of unfamiliar
persons, scenes or things. Although ours was
perhaps the most cultivated household in the
parish, I had never seen so much as a representation of a work of sculpture till I was
thirteen. My mother then received from her
earlier home certain volumes, among which
was a gaudy gift-book of some kind, containing a few steel engravings of statues.
These attracted me violently, and here for
the first time I gazed on Apollo with his proud
gesture, Venus in her undulations, the kirtled
290
FATHER AND SON
shape of Diana, and Jupiter voluminously
bearded. Very little information, and that to
me not intelligible, was given in the text, but
these were said to be figures of the old Greek
gods. I asked my Father to tell me about these
" old Greek gods." His answer was direct and
disconcerting. He said-how I ^recollect the
place and time, early in the morning, as I stood
beside the window in our garish breakfastroom-he said that the so-called gods of the
Greeks were the shadows cast by the vices of
the heathen, and reflected their infamous lives;
"it was for such things as these that God
poured down brimstone and fire on the Cities
of the Plain, and there is nothing in the
legends of these gods, or rather devils, that it
is not better for a Christian not to know."?
His face blazed white with Puritan fury as he
said this-I see him now in my mind's eye, )
in his violent emotion. You might have
thought that he had himself escaped with
horror from some Hellenic hippodrome.
My Father's prestige was by this time eonsiderably lessened in my mind, and though I
loved and admired him, I had now long ceased
to hold him infallible. I did not accept his
condemnation of the Greeks, although I bowed
to it. In private I returned to examine my
291
FATHER AND SON
steel engravings of the statues, and I reflected
that they were too beautiful to be so wicked as
my Father thought they were. The dangerous
and pagan notion that beauty palliates evil
budded in my mind, without any external
suggestion, and by this reflection alone I was
still further sundered from the faith in which
I had been trained. I gathered very diligently
all I could pick up about the Greek gods and
their statues; it was not much, it was indeed
ludicrously little and false, but it was a germ.
And at this aEsthetic juncture I was drawn
into what was really rather an extraordinary
circle of incidents.
Among the Saints" in our village there
lived a shoemaker and his wife, who had one
daughter, Susan Flood. She was a flighty,
excited young creature, and lately, during the
passage of some itinerary revivalists, she had
been "converted" in the noisiest way, with
sobs, gasps and gurglings. When this crisis
passed, she came with her parents to our
meetings, and was received quietly enough to
the breaking of bread. But about the time I
speak of, Susan Flood went up to London to
pay a visit to an unconverted uncle and aunt.
It was first whispered amongst us, and then
openly stated, that these relatives had taken
292
FATHER AND SON
her to the Crystal Palace, where, in passing
through the Sculpture Gallery, Susan's sense
of decency had been so grievously affronted,
that she had smashed the naked figures with
the handle of her parasol, before her horrified
companions could stop her. She had, in fact,
run amok among the statuary, and had, to the
intense chagrin of her uncle and aunt, very
worthy persons, been arrested and brought
before a magistrate, who dismissed her with a
warning to her relations that she had better
be sent home to Devonshire and "looked
after." Susan Flood's return to us, however,
was a triumph; she had no sense of having
acted injudiciously or unbecomingly; she was
ready to recount to every one, in vague and
veiled language, how she had been able to
testify for the Lord "in the very temple of
Belial," for so she poetically described the
Crystal Palace. She was, of course, in a state
of unbridled hysteria, but such physical explanations were not encouraged amongst us,
and the case of Susan Flood awakened a great
deal of sympathy.
There was held a meeting of the elders in
our drawing-room to discuss it, and 1 contrived
to be present, though out of observation. My
Father, while he recognised the purity of Susan
298
FATHER AND SON
Flood's zeal, questioned its wisdom. He noted
that the statuary was not her property, but
that of the Crystal Palace. Of the other communicants, none, I think, had the very slightest
notion what the objects were that Susan had
smashed, or tried to smash, and frankly maintained that they thought her conduct magnificent. As for me, I had gathered by persistent
inquiry enough information to know that what
her sacrilegious parasol had attacked were
bodies of my mysterious friends, the Greek
gods, and if all the rest of the village applauded
iconoclastic Susan, I at least would be ardent
on the other side.
But I was conscious that there was nobody
in the world to whom I could go for sympathy.
If I had ever read "Hellas" I should have
murmured
Apollo, Pan and Love,
And even Olympian Jove,
Grew weak, when killing Susan glared on them.
On the day in question, I was unable to endure
the drawing-room meeting to its close, but,
clutching my volume of the Funereal Poets,
I made a dash for the garden. In the midst of
a mass of laurels, a clearing had been made,
where ferns were grown and a garden-seat was
placed. There was no regular path to this
294
FATHER AND SON
asylum; one dived under the snake-like boughs
of the laurel and came up again in absolute
seclusion.
Into this haunt I now fled to meditate about
the savage godliness of that vandal, Susan
Flood. So extremely ignorant was I that I supposed her to have destroyed the originals of the
statues, marble and unique. I knew nothing
about plaster casts, and I thought the damage
(it is possible that there had really been no
damage whatever) was of an irreparable character. I sank into the seat, with the great wall of
laurels whispering around me, and I burst into
tears. There was something, surely, quaint
and pathetic in the figure of a little Plymouth
Brother sitting in that advanced year of grace,
weeping bitterly for indignities done to
Hermes and to Aphrodite. Then I opened
my book for consolation, and read a great
block of pompous verse out of " The Deity,"
in the midst of which exercise, yielding to
the softness of the hot and aromatic air, I fell
fast asleep.
Among those who applauded the zeal of
Susan Flood's parasol, the Pagets were prominent. These were a retired Baptist minister and his wife, from Exmouth, who had
lately settled amongst us, and joined in the
295
FATHER AND SON
breaking of bread. Mr. Paget was a fat old
man, whose round pale face was clean-shaven,
and who carried a full crop of loose white hair
above it; his large lips were always moving,
whether he spoke or not. He resembled, as I
now perceive, the portraits of S. T. Coleridge
in age, but with all the intellect left out of
them. He lived in a sort of trance of solemn
religious despondency. He had thrown up his
cure of souls, because he became convinced
that he had committed the Sin against the Holy
Ghost. His wife was younger than he, very
small, very tight, very active, with black eyes
like pin-pricks at the base of an extremely
high and narrow forehead, bordered with glossy
ringlets. He was very cross to her, and it was
murmured that "dear Mrs. Paget had often
had to pass through the waters of affliction."
They were very poor, but rigidly genteel, and
she was careful, so far as she could, to conceal from the world the caprices of her poor
lunatic husband.
In our circle, it was never for a moment
admitted that Mr. Paget was a lunatic. It was
said that he had gravely sinned, and was
under the Lord's displeasure; prayers were
abundantly offered up that he might be
led back into the pathway of light, and that
296
FATHER AND SON
the Smiling Face might be drawn forth for
him from behind the Frowning Providence.
When the man had an epileptic seizure in the
High Street, he was not taken to a hospital,
but we repeated to one another, with shaken
heads, that Satan, that crooked Serpent, had
been unloosed for a season. Mr. Paget was
fond of talking in private and in public, of his
dreadful spiritual condition, and he would drop
his voice while he spoke of having committed
the Unpardonable Sin, with a sort of shuddering exultation, such as people sometimes feel
in the possession of a very unusual disease.
It might be thought that the position held
in any community by persons so afflicted and
eccentric as the Pagets would be very precarious. But it was not so with us; on the
contrary, they took a prominent place at once.
Mr. Paget, in spite of his spiritual bankruptcy, was only too anxious to help my
Father in his ministrations, and used to beg to
be allowed to pray and exhort. In the latter
case he took the tone of a wounded veteran,
who, though fallen on the bloody field himself,
could still encourage younger warriors to
march forward to victory. Everybody longed
to know what the exact nature had been of
that sin against the Holy Ghost which had
297
FATHER AND SON
deprived Mr. Paget of every glimmer of hope
for time or for eternity. It was whispered
that even my Father himself was not precisely
acquainted with the character of it.
This mysterious disability clothed Mr. Paget
for us with a kind of romance. We watched
him as the women watched Dante in Verona,
whispering:
Behold him, how Hell's reek
Has crisped his hair and singed his cheek!
His person lacked, it is true, something of the
dignity of Dante's, for it was his caprice to
walk up and down the High Street at noonday
with one of those cascades of coloured paper
which were known as " ornaments for your fireplace" slung over the back and another over
the front of his body. These he manufactured
for sale, and he adopted the quaint practice of
wearing the exuberant objects as a means for
their advertisement.
Mrs. Paget had been accustomed to rule
in the little ministry from which Mr. Paget's
celebrated Sin had banished them, and she was
inclined to clutch at the sceptre now. She was
the only person I ever met with whowas not
afraid of the displeasure of my Father. She
would fix her viper-coloured eyes on his, and
say with a kind of gimlet firmness, 6; I hardly
298
FATHER AND SON
think that is the true interpretation, Brother
G.", or, '" But let us turn to Colossians, and
see what the Holy Ghost says there upon this
matter." She fascinated my Father, who was
not accustomed to this kind of interruption,
and as she was not to be softened by any
flattery (such as:-" Marvellous indeed, Sister,
is your acquaintance with the means of
grace!") she becme almost a terror to him.
She abused her powers by taking great
liberties, which culminated in her drawing his
attention" to the fact that my poor stepmother
displayed "an overweening love of dress." The
accusation was perfectly false; my stepmother
was, if rather richly, always plainly dressed, in
the sober Quaker mode; almost her only ornament was a large carnelian brooch, set in
floweredflat gold. To this the envenomed Paget
drew my Father's attention as " likely to lead
'the little ones of the flock' into temptation."
My poor Father felt it his duty, thus directly
admonished, to speak to my mother. "Do you
not think, my Love, that you should, as one who
sets an example to others, discard the wearing
of that gaudy brooch?" "One must fasten one's
cpllar with something, I suppose? "Well,
but how does Sister Paget fasten her collar?."
"Sister Paget," replied my Mother, stung
299
FATHER AND SON
at last into rejoinder, "fastens her collar with
a pin,-and that is a thing which I would
rather die than do!
Nor did I escape the attentions of this zealous
reformer. Mrs. Paget was good enough to
take a great interest in me, and she was not
satisfied with the way in which I was being
brought up. Her presence seemed to pervade
the village, and I could neither come in nor
go out without seeing her hard bonnet and her
pursed-up lips. She would hasten to report to
my Father that she saw me laughing and
talking " with a lot of unconverted boys,"
these being the companions with whom I had
full permission to bathe and boat. She urged
my Father to complete my holy vocation by
some definite step, by which he would dedicate
me completely to the Lord's service. Further
schooling she thought needless, and merely
likely to foster intellectual pride. Mr. Paget,
she remarked, had troubled very little in his
youth about worldly knowledge, and yet how
blessed he had been in the conversion of
souls until he had incurred the displeasure
of the Holy Ghost!
1 do not know exactly what she wanted
my Father to do with me; perhaps she
did not know herself; she was meddlesome,
Soo
FATHER AND SON
ignorant and fanatical, and she liked to fancy
that she was exercising influence. But the
wonderful, the inexplicable thing is that my
Father,-who, with all his limitations, was
so distinguished and high-minded,-should
listen to her for a moment, and still more
wonderful is it that he really allowed her,
grim vixen that she was, to disturb his plans
and retard his purposes. I think the explanation lay in the perfectly logical position
she took up. My Father found himself
brought face to face at last, not with a disciple, but with a trained expert in his
own peculiar scheme of religion. At every
point she was armed with arguments the
source of which he knew and the validity of
which he recognised. He trembled before '
Mrs. Paget as a man in a dream may tremble
before a parody of his own central self, K
and he could not blame her without laying
himself open somewhere to censure.
But my stepmother's instincts were more
primitive and her actions less wire-drawn than '
my Father's. She disliked Mrs. Paget as much
as one earnest believer can bring herself to dis- i
like a sister in the Lord. My stepmother had
quietly devoted herself to what she thought the
best way of bringing me up, and she did not
301
FATHER AND SON
propose now to be thwarted by the wife of a
lunatic Baptist. At this time I was a mixture
of childishness and priggishness, of curious
knowledge and dense ignorance. Certain portions of my intellect were growing with unwholesome activity, while others were stunted,
or had never stirred at all. I was like a plant on
which a pot has been placed, with the effect
that the centre is crushed and arrested, while
shoots are straggling up to the light on all
sides. My Father himself was aware of this,
and in a spasmodic way he wished to regulate
my thoughts. But all he did was to try to
straighten the shoots, without removing the
pot which kept them resolutely down.
It was my mother who decided that I was
now old enough to go to boarding-school,
and my Father, having discovered that an
elderly couple of Plymouth Brethren kept an
" academy for young gentlemen" in a neighbouring sea-port town,-in the prospectus of
which the knowledge and love of the Lord
were mentioned as occupying the attention of
the head-master and his assistants far more
closely than any mere considerations of worldly
tuition,-was persuaded to entrust me to its
care. He stipulated, however, that I should
*always come home from Saturday night to
302
FATHER AND SON
Monday morning, not, as he said, that I might
receive any carnal indulgence, but that there
might be no cessation of my communion as a
believer with the Saints in our village on l
Sundays. To this school, therefore, I presently ~,
departed, gawky and homesick, and the rift \
between my soul and that of my Father /
widened a little more..
CHAPTER XII
LITTLE boys from quiet, pious households,
commonly found, in those days, a chasm yawning at the feet of their inexperience when they
arrived at Boarding-school. But the fact that
I still slept at home on Saturday and Sunday
nights preserved me, I fancy, from many surprises. There was a crisis, but it was broad
and slow for me. On the other hand, for my
Father I am inclined to think that it was
definite and sharp. Permission for me to
desert the parental hearth, even for five days
in certain weeks, was tantamount, in his mind,
to admitting that the great scheme, so long
caressed, so passionately fostered, must in its
primitive bigness be now dropped.
The Great Scheme (I cannot resist giving
it the mortuary honour of capital letters) had
been, as my readers know, that I should be
exclusively and consecutively dedicated,
through the whole of my life, to the manifest
304
FATHER AND SON
and uninterrupted and uncompromised "ser- I
vice of the Lord." That had been the aspiration of my Mother, and at her death she
had bequeathed that desire to my Father,
like a dream of the Promised Land. In
their ecstasy, my parents had taken me, as
Elkanah and Hannah had long ago taken
Samuel, from their mountain-home of Ramathaim-Zophim down to sacrifice to the Lord of
Hosts in Shiloh. They had girt me about with
a linen ephod, and had hoped to leave me
there; " as long as he liveth," they had said,
"he shall be lent unto the Lord."
Doubtless in the course of these fourteen
years it had occasionally flashed upon my
Father, as he overheard some speech of mine, or
detected some idiosyncrasy, that 1 was not one
of those whose temperament points them out
as ultimately fitted for an austere life of religion. What he hoped, however, was that
when the little roughnesses of childhood were
rubbed away, there would pass a deep mellowness over my soul. He had a touching
way of condoning my faults of conduct, directly
after reproving them, and he would softly deprecate my frailty, saying, in a tone of harrowing tenderness, " Are you not the child of many
prayers?" He continued to think that prayer,
305
U
FATHER AND SON
such passionate importunate prayer as his, must
prevail. Faith could move mountains; should
it not be able to mould the little ductile heart
of a child, since he was sure that his own faith
was unfaltering? He had yearned and waited
for a son who should be totally without human
audacities, who should be humble, pure, not
troubled by worldly agitations, a son whose
life should be cleansed and straightened from
above, in custodiendo sermones Dei; in whom
everything should be sacrificed except the one
thing needful to salvation.
How such a marvel of lowly piety was to
earn a living had never, I think, occurred to
him. My Father was singularly indifferent
about money. Perhaps his notion was that,
totally devoid of ambitions as I was to be, I
should quietly become adult, and continue his
ministrations among the poor of the Christian
flock. He had some dim dream, I think, of
there being just enough for us all without my
having to take up any business or trade. 1
believe it was immediately after my first term
at boarding-school, that I was a silent but indignant witness of a conversation between my
Father and Mr. Thomas Brightwen, my stepmother's brother, who was a banker in one of
the Eastern Counties.
306
FATHER AND SON
This question, " What is he to be?" 'in a
worldly sense, was being discussed, and I am
sure that it was for the first time, at all events
in my presence. Mr. Brightwen, I fancy,
had been worked upon by my stepmother,
whose affection for me was always on the
increase, to suggest, or faintly to stir the air
in the neighbourhood o~i suggesting, a query
about my future. He was childless and so
was she, and I think a kind impulse led
them to "feel the way," as it is called. I
believe he said that the banking business,
wisely and honourably conducted, sometimes
led, as we know that it is apt to lead, to
affluence. To my horror, my Father, with
rising emphasis, replied that "if there were
offered to his beloved child what is called 'an
opening' that Would lead to an income of
~10,000 a year, and that would divert his
thoughts and interest from the Lord's work,
he would reject it on his child's behalf." Mr.
Brightwen, a precise and polished gentleman,
who evidently never made an exaggerated
statement in his life, was, I think, faintly
scandalised; he soon left us, and I do not
recollect his paying us a second visit.
For my silent part, I felt very much like
Gehazi, and I would fain have followed after
307
FATHER AND SON
the banker if I had dared to do so, into
the night. I would have excused to him the
ardour of my Elisha, and I would have
reminded him of the sons of the prophets" Give me, I pray thee," I would have said,
""a talent of silver and two changes of garments." It seemed to me very hard that my
Father should dispose of my possibilities of
wealth in so summary a fashion, but the fact
that I did resent it, and regretted what I
supposed to be my " chance," shows how far
apart we had already swung. My Father, I
am convinced, thought that he gave words to
my inward instincts when he repudiated the
very mild and inconclusive benevolence of his
brother-in-law. But he certainly did not do
so. I was conscious of a sharp and instinctive
disappointment at having had, as I fancied,
wealth so near my grasp, and at seeing it all
cast violently into the sea of my Father's
scruples.
Not one of my village friends attended the
boarding-school to which I was now attached,
and I arrived there without an acquaintance.
I should soon, however, have found a corner
of my own if my Father had not unluckily
stipulated that I was not to sleep in the dormitory with boys of my own age, but in the room.308
FATHER AND SON
occupied by the two elder sons of a prominent
Plymouth Brother whom he knew. From a
social point of view, this was an unfortunate
arrangement, since these youths were some
years older and many years riper than I; the
eldest, in fact, was soon to leave; they had
enjoyed their independence, and they now
greatly resented being saddled with the presence of an unknown urchin. The supposition had been that they would protect
and foster my religious practices; would en- V
courage me, indeed, as my Father put it, to
approach the Throne of Grace with them
at morning and evening prayer. They made
no pretence, however, to be considered godly;
they looked upon me as an intruder; and
after a while the younger, and ruder, of them
openly let me know that they believed I had
been put into their room to " spy upon " them:
it had been a plot, they knew, between their
father and mine: and he darkly warned me
that I should suffer if "anything got out." I
had, however, no wish to trouble them, nor
any faint interest in their affairs. I soon discovered that they were absorbed in a silly kind
of amorous correspondence with the girls of
a neighbouring academy, but "what were all
such toys to me?"
309
FATHER AND SON
These young fellows, who ought long before
to have left the school, did nothing overtly unkind to me, but they condemned me to silence.
They ceased to address me except with an
occasional command. By reason of my youth,
I was in bed and asleep before my companions
arrived upstairs, and in the morning I was
always routed up and packed about my business while they still were drowsing. But the
fact that I had been cut off from my coevals
by night, cut me off from them also by dayso that I was nothing to them, neither a boarder
nor a day-scholar, neither flesh, fish nor
fowl. The loneliness of my life was extreme,
and that I always went home on Saturday
afternoon and returned on Monday morning
still further checked my companionships at
school. For a long time, round the outskirts
of that busy throng of opening lives, I " wandered lonely as a cloud," and sometimes I was
more unhappy than I had ever been before.
No one, however, bullied me, and though I was
dimly and indefinably witness to acts of uncleanness and cruelty, I was the victim of no
such acts and the recipient of no dangerous confidences. I suppose that my queer reputation
for sanctity, half dreadful, half ridiculous, surrounded me with a non-conducting atmosphere.
$10
FATHER AND SON
We are the victims of hallowed proverbs,
and one of the most classic of these tells us
that " the child is father of the man." But
in my case I cannot think that this was true.
In mature years I have always been gregarious, a lover of my kind, dependent upon
the company of friends for the very pulse of |
moral life. To be marooned, to be shut up
in a solitary cell, to inhabit a lighthouse, or to
camp alone in a forest, these have always
seemed to me afflictions too heavy to be borne,
even in imagination. A state in which conversation exists not, is for me an air too empty
of oxygen for my lungs to breathe it.
Yet when I look back upon my days at boarding school, I see myself unattracted by any of
the human beings around me. My grown-up
years are made luminous to me in memory by
the ardent faces of my friends, but I can
scarce recall so much as the names of more
than two or three of my schoolfellows.
There is not one of them whose mind or
whose character made any lasting impression
upon me. In later life, I have been im'patient of solitude, and afraid of it; at school,
I asked for no more than to slip out of the
hurly-burly and be alone with my reflections
and my fancies. That magnetism of humanity
311
FATHER AND SON
which has been the agony of mature years, of
this I had not a trace when I was a boy. Of
those fragile loves to which most men look
back with tenderness and passion, emotions to
be explained only as Montaigne explained
them, "parceque c'tlait lui, parceque c'etait
moi," I knew nothing. I, to whom friendship
has since been like sunlight and like sleep,
left school unbrightened and unrefreshed by
commerce with a single friend.
If I had been clever, I should doubtless
have attracted the jealousy of my fellows, but
I was spared this by the mediocrity of my
success in the classes. One little fact I may
mention, because it exemplifies the advance in
observation which has been made in forty
years. I was extremely nearsighted and in
consequence was placed at a gross disadvantage, by being unable to see the slate or
the black-board on which our tasks were explained. It seems almost incredible, when
one reflects upon it, but during the whole of
my school life, this fact was never commented
upon or taken into account by a single person,
until the Polish lady who taught us the elements of German and French drew some one's
attention to it in my sixteenth year. I was
not quick, but I passed for being denser than
S12
FATIIER AND SON
was because of the myopic haze that enveloped me. But this is not an autobiography,
and with the cold and shrouded details of my
uninteresting school life I will not fatigue the
reader.
I was not content, however, to be the cipher
that I found myself, and when 1 had been at
school for about a year, I " broke out," greatly,
I think, to my own surprise, in a popular act.
We had a young usher whom we disliked. I
suppose, poor half-starved phthisic lad, that he
was the most miserable of us all. He was, I
think, unfitted for the task which had been
forced upon him; he was fretful, unsympathetic, agitated. The school-house, an old ram
bling place, possessed a long cellar-like room
that opened from our general corridor and was
lighted by deep windows, carefully barred,
which looked into an inner garden. This vault
was devoted to us and to our play-boxes: by
a tacit law, no master entered it. One evening,
just at dusk, a great number of us were here
when the bell for night-school rang, and many
of us dawdled at the summons. Mr. B.,
tactless in his anger, bustled in among us,
scolding in a shrill voice, and proceeded to
drive us forth. I was the latest to emerge,
and as he turned away to see if any other truant
318
- FATHER AND SON
might not be hiding, I determined upon action.
With a quick movement, I drew the door
behind me and bolted it, just in time to hear
the imprisoned usher scream with vexation.
We boys all trooped upstairs, and it is characteristic of my isolation that I had not one
" chum" to whom I could confide my feat.
That Mr. B. had been shut in became,
however, almost instantly known, and the
night-class, usually so unruly, was awed by the
event into exemplary decorum. There, with
no master near us, in a silence rarely broken
by a giggle or a cat-call, we sat diligently
working, or pretending to work. Through my
brain, as I hung over my book, a thousand new
thoughts began to surge. I was the liberator,
the tyrannicide; I had freed all my fellows
from the odious oppressor. Surely, when they
learned that it was I, they would cluster round
me; surely, now, I should be somebody in the
school-life, no longer a mere trotting shadow
or invisible presence. The interval seemed
long; at length Mr. B. was released by a
servant, and he came up into the school-room
to find us in that ominous condition of suspense.
At first he said nothing. He sank upon
a chair in a half-fainting attitude, while
314
FATHER AND SON
he pressed his hand to his side; his distress
and silence redoubled the boys' surprise, and
filled me with something like remorse. For
the first time, I reflected that he was human,
that perhaps he suffered. He rose presently
and took a slate, upon which he wrote two
questions: "Did you do it?" "Do you
know who did?" and these he propounded to
each boy in rotation. The prompt, redoubled
"No" in every case seemed to pile up his
despair.
One of the last to whom he held, in silence,
the trembling slate was the perpetrator. As I
saw the moment approach, an unspeakable
timidity swept over me. I reflected that no
one had seen me, that no one could accuse
me. Nothing could be easier or safer than
to deny, nothing more perplexing to the
enemy, nothing less perilous for the culprit.
A flood of plausible reasons invaded my brain;
I seemed to see this to be a case in which to
tell the truth would be not merely foolish, it
would be wrong. Yet when the usher stood
before me, holding the slate out in his white
and shaking hand, I seized the pencil, and, ignoring the first question, 1 wrote " Yes " firmly
against the second. I suppose that the
ambiguity of this action puzzled Mr. B. He
315
FATHER AND SON
pressed me to answer: "Did you do it? " but to
that I was obstinately dumb; and away I was
hurried to an empty bed-room, where for the
whole of that night and the next day I was
held a prisoner, visited at intervals by the
head-master and other inquisitorial persons,
until I was gradually persuaded to make a full
confession and apology.
This absurd little incident had one effect,
it revealed me to my schoolfellows as an existence. From that time forth I lay no longer
under the stigma of invisibility; I had produced my material shape and had thrown my
shadow for a moment into a legend. But, in
other respects, things went on much as before:
curiously uninfluenced by my surroundings, I
in my turn failed to exercise influence, and my
practical isolation was no less than it had been
before. It was thus that it came about that
my social memories of my boarding-school life
are monotonous and vague. It was a period
during which, as it appears to me now on looking back, the stream of my spiritual nature
spread out into a shallow pool which was almost stagnant.I I was labouring to gain those
elements of conventional knowledge, which
had, in many cases, up to that time been singularly lacking. But my brain was starved,
s16
FATHER AND SON
and my intellectual perceptions were veiled.
Elder persons who in later years would speak
to me frankly of my school-days assured me
that, while I had often struck them as a smart
and quaint and even interesting child, all
promise seemed to fade out of me as a schoolboy, and that those who were most inclined to
be indulgent gave up the hope that I should
prove a man in a way remarkable. This was
particularly the case with the most indulgent
of my protectors, my refined and gentle stepmother.
As this record can, however, have no valueq
that is not based on its rigorous adhesion tof
the truth, I am bound to say that the dreariness and sterility of my school-life were more
apparent than real. I was pursuing certain
lines of moral and mental development all the
time, and since my schoolmasters and my
schoolfellows combined in thinking me so dull,
I will display a tardy touch of " proper spirit"
and ask whether it may not partly have been because they were themselves so commonplace.
I think that if some drops of sympathy, that
magic dew of Paradise, had fallen upon my
desert, it might have blossomed like the rose,
or, at all events, like that chimerical flower, the
Rose of Jericho. As it was, the convention-.317
FATHER AND SON
ality around me, the intellectual drought, gave
me no opportunity of outward growth. They
did not destroy, but they cooped up, and rendered slow and inefficient, that internal life
which continued, as I have said, to live on
unseen. This took the form of dreams and
speculations, in the course of which I went
through many tortuous processes of the
mind, the actual aims of which were futile,
although the movements themselves were
useful. If I may more minutely define my
meaning, I would say that in my schooldays, without possessing thoughts, I yet prepared my mind for thinking, and learned how
to think.
1 The great subject of my curiosity at this
time was words, as instruments of expression.
I was incessant in adding to my vocabulary,
and in finding accurate and individual terms
for things. Here, too, the exercise preceded
the employment, since I was busy providing
myself with words before I had any ideas to
express with them. When I read Shakespeare and came upon the passage in which
Prospero tells Caliban that he had no thoughts
till his master taught him words, I remember
starting with amazement at the poet's intuition, for such a Caliban had I been:
318
FATHER AND SON
I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other, when thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble, like
A thing most brutish; I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them know.
For my Prosperos I sought vaguely in such
books as I had access to, and I was conscious
that as the inevitable word seized hold of me,
with it out of the darkness into strong light
came the image and the idea.
My Father possessed a copy of Bailey's
"Etymological Dictionary," a book published
early in the eighteenth century. Over this I
would pore for hours, playing with the words
in a fashion which I can no longer reconstruct,
and delighting in the savour of the rich, oldfashioned country phrases. My Father finding
me thus employed, fell to wondering at the
nature of my pursuit, and I could offer him,
indeed, no very intelligible explanation of it.
He urged me to give up such idleness, and to
make practical use of language. For this
purpose he conceived an exercise which he
obliged me to adopt, although it was hateful
to me. He sent me forth, it might be, up the
lane to Warbury Hill and round home by the
copses; or else down one chine to the sea and
319
FATHER AND SON
along the shingle to the next cutting in the
cliff, and so back by way of the village; and
he desired me to put down, in language as full
as I could, all that I had seen in each excursion. As I have said, this practice was detestable and irksome to me, but, as I look back,
I am inclined to believe it to have been the
most salutary, the most practical piece of; training whioh my Father ever gave me. It. forced me to observe sharply and clearly, to
form visual impressions, to retain them in the
brain, and to clothe them in punctilious and
accurate language.
d It was in my fifteenth year that I became
< again, this time intelligently, acquainted with
I Shakespeare. I got hold of a single play,
The Tempest, in a school edition, prepared, I
suppose, for one of the university examinations
which were then being instituted in the provinces. This I read through and through, not
disdaining the help of the notes, and revelling
in the glossary. I studied The Tempest as I
had hitherto studied no classic work, and it
filled my whole being with music and romance.
This book was my own hoarded possession;
the rest of Shakespeare's works were beyond
my hopes. But gradually I contrived to
borrow a volume here and a volume there. I
320
FATHER AND SON
completed Thle Merchant of Venice, read
Cymbeline, Julius Cwesar and Much Ado;
most of the others, I think, remained closed
to me for a lorg time. But these were
enough to steep my horizon with all the
colours of sunrise. It was due, no doubt, to
my bringing up, that the plays never appealed
to me as bounded by the exigencies of a stage
or played by actors. The images they raised
in my mind were of real people moving in the
open air, and uttering, in the natural play of
life, sentiments that were clothed in the most
lovely, and yet, as it seemed to me, the most
obvious and the most inevitable language.
It was while I was thus under the full spell
of the Shakespearean necromancy that a significant event occurred. My Father took me
up to London for the first time since my
infancy. Our visit was one of a few days
only, and its purpose was that we might take
part in some enormous Evangelical conference.
We stayed in a dark hotel off the Strand,
where I found the noise by day and night
very afflicting. When we were not at the
conference, I spent long hours, among
crumbs and blue-bottle flies, in the coffeeroom of this hotel, my Father being busy at
the British Museum and the Royal Society.
321
x
FATHER AND SON
The conference was held in an immense hall,
somewhere in the north of London. I remember my short-sighted sense of the terrible
vastness of the crowd, with rings on rings of
dim white faces fading in the fog. My
Father, as a privileged visitor, was obliged
with seats on the platform, and we were in
the heart of the first really large assemblage of
persons that I had ever seen.
The interminable ritual of prayers, hymns
and addresses left no impression on my memory,
but my attention was suddenly stung into life
by a remark. An elderly man, fat and greasy,
with a voice like a bassoon, and an imperturbable assurance, was denouncing the spread of
infidelity, and the lukewarmness of professing
Christians, who refrained from battling the
wickedness at their doors. They were like the
Laodiceans, whom the Angel of the Apocalypse
spewed out of his mouth. For instance, who,
the orator asked, is now rising to cheek the
outburst of idolatry in our midst? "At this
very moment," he went on," there is proceeding, unreproved, a blasphemous celebration of
the birth of Shakespeare, a lost soul now
suffering for his sins in hell! " My sensation
was that of one who has suddenly been struck
on the head; stars and sparks beat round me.
322
'A.
FATHER AND SON
If some person I loved had been grossly insulted
in my presence, I could not have felt more
powerless in anguish. No one in that vast
audience raised a word of protest, and my spirits
fell to their nadir. This, be it remarked, was
the earliest intimation that had reached me of
the tercentenary of the Birth at Stratford,
and I had not the least idea what could have
provoked the outburst of outraged godliness.
But Shakespeare was certainly in the air.
When we returned to the hotel that noon, my
Father of his own accord reverted to the
subject. I held my breath, prepared to endure
fresh torment. What he said, however, surprised and relieved me. "Brother So-and-so,"
he remarked, " was not, in my judgment, justified in saying what he did. The uncovenanted
mercies of God are not revealed to us. Before
so rashly speaking of Shakespeare as ' a lost
soul in hell,' he should have remembered how
little we know of the poet's history. The light
of salvation was widely disseminated in the land
during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and we
cannot know that Shakespeare did not accept
the atonement of Christ in simple faith before
he came to die." The concession will to-day
seem meagre to gay and worldly spirits, but
words cannot express how comfortable it was
323
FATHER AND SON
to me. 1 gazed at my Father with loving
eyes across the cheese and celery, and if the
waiter had not been present 1 believe I might
have hugged him in my arms.
This anecdote may serve to illustrate the
attitude of my conscience, at this time, with
regard to theology. I was not consciously in
any revolt against the strict faith in which I
had been brought up, but I could not fail to
be aware of the fact that literature tempted
me to stray up innumerable paths which meandered in directions at right angles to that
direct strait way which leadeth to salvation.
I fancied, if I may pursue the image, that I
was still safe up these pleasant lanes if I did
not stray far enough to lose sight of the main
road. If, for instance, it had been quite certain
that Shakespeare had been irrecoverably
damnable and damned, it would scarcely have
been possible for me to have justified myself
in going on reading Cymbeline. One who
broke bread with the Saints every Sunday
morning, who '6 took a class " at Sunday school,
who made, as my Father loved to remind me,
a public weekly confession of his willingness
to bear the Cross of Christ, such an one could
hardly, however bewildering and torturing the
thought, continue to admire a lost soul. But
324
FATHER AND SON
that happy possibility of an ultimate repentance, how it eased me! I could always console
myself with the belief that when Shakespeare
wrote any passage of intoxicating beauty, it
was just then that he was beginning to breathe
the rapture that faith in Christ brings to the
anointed soul. And it was with a like casuistry
that I condoned my other intellectual and personal pleasures.
My Father continued 'to be under the impression that my boarding-school, which he
never again visited after originally leaving me
there, was conducted upo-o the same principles
as his own household. I was frequently
tempted to enlighten him, but I never found
the courage to do so. As a matter of fact the
piety of the establishment, which collected to
it the sons of a large number of evangelically
minded parents throughout that part of the
country, resided mainly in the prospectus. It
proceeded no further than the practice of reading the Bible aloud, each boy in successive order
one verse, in the early morning before breakfast.
There was no selection and no exposition;
where the last boy sat, there the day's reading
ended, even if it were in the middle of a
sentence, and there it began next morning.
Such reading of " the chapter " was followed
32Q
FATHER AND SON
by a long dry prayer. I do not know that this
morning service would appear more perfunctory than usual to other boys, but it astounded
and disgusted me, accustomed as I was to the
ministrations at home, where my Father read
"the word of God " in a loud passionate voice,
with dramatic emphasis, pausing for commentary and paraphrase, and treating every phrase
as if it were part of a personal message or of
thrilling family history. At school," morning
prayer" was a dreary, unintelligible exercise,
and with this piece of mumbo-jumbo, religion
for the day began and ended. The discretion
of little boys is extraordinary. I am quite
certain no one of us ever revealed this fact to
our godly parents at home.
If any one was to do this, it was of course I
who should first of all have " testified." But I
had grown cautious about making confidences.
One never knew how awkwardly they might
develop or to what disturbing excesses of zeal
they might precipitously lead. I was on my
guard against my Father, who was, all the
time, only too openly yearning that 1 should
approach him for help, for comfort, for ghostly
counsel. Still "delicate," though steadily
gaining in solidity of constitution, I was liable
to severe chills and to fugitive neuralgic pangs.
S326
FATHER AND SON
My Father was, almost maddeningly, desirous
that these afflictions should be sanctified to
me, and it was in my bed, often when I was
much bowed in spirit by indisposition, that he
used to triumph over me most pitilessly. He
retained the singular superstition, amazing in
a man of scientific knowledge and long human
experience, that all pains and ailments were
directly sent by the Lord in chastisement for
some definite fault, and not in relation to any
physical cause. The result was sometimes
quite startling, and in particular I recollect
that my stepmother and I exchanged impressions of astonishment at my Father's action
when Mrs. Goodyer, who was one of the
"Saints" and the wife of a young journeyman cobbler, broke her leg. My Father,
puzzled for an instant as to the meaning of
this accident, since Mrs. Goodyer was the
gentlest and most inoffensive of our church
members, decided that it must be because she
had made an idol of her husband, and he reduced the poor thing to tears by standing at
her bed-side and imploring the Holy Spirit
to bring this sin home to her conscience.. When, therefore, I was ill at home. with one
of my trifling disorders, the problem of my
spiritual state. always pressed violently upon
327
FATHER AND SON
my Father, and this caused me no little mental
uneasiness. He would appear at my bed-side,
with solemn solicitude, and sinking on his
knees would earnestly pray aloud that the purpose of the Lord in sending me this affliction
might graciously be made plain to me; and
then, rising, and standing by my pillow, he
would put me through a searching spiritual
inquiry as to the fault which was thus divinely
indicated to me as observed and reprobated
on high.
y It was not on points of moral behaviour
that he thus cross-examined me; I think
he disdainel such ignoble game as that.
But uncertainties of doctrine, relinquishment
of faith in the purity of this dogma or of that,
lukewarm zeal in "taking up the cross of
Christ," growth of intellectual pride,-such
were the insidious offences in consequence of
which, as he supposed, the cold in the head or
the toothache had been sent as heavenly
messengers to recall my straggling conscience
to its plain path of duty.
What made me very uncomfortable on these
occasions was my consciousness that confinement to bed was hardly an affliction at all. It
kept me from the boredom of school, in a firelit bed-room at home, with my pretty, smiling
328
FATHER AND SON
stepmother lavishing luxurious attendance
upon me, and it gave me long, unbroken days for
reading. I was awkwardly aware that I simply
had not the effrontery to " approach the Throne
of Grace " with a request to know for what sin
I was condemned to such a very pleasant disposition of my hours.
The current of my life ran, during my
school-days, most merrily and fully in the
holidays, when I resumed my out-door exercises with those friends in the village of
whom I have spoken earlier. I think they
were more refined and better bred than any of
my schoolfellows, at all events it was among
these homely companions alone that I continued to form congenial and sympathetic
relations. In one of these boys,-one of whom
I have heard or seen nothing now for nearly
a generation,-I found tastes singularly parallel
to my own, and we scoured the horizon in
search of books in prose and verse, but particulaly in verse.
As I grew stronger in muscle, I was capable
of adding considerably to my income by an
exercise of my legs. I was allowed money for
the railway ticket between the town where the
school lay and the station nearest to my home.
But, if I chose to walk six or seven miles along
329
FATHER AND SON
the coast, thus more than halving the distance
by rail from school house to home, I might
spend as pocket-money the railway fare I thus
saved. Such considerable sums 1 fostered in
order to buy with them editions of the poets.`
These were not in those days, as they are now,
at the beck and call of every purse, and the
attainment of each little masterpiece was a
separate triumph. In particular I shall never
forget the excitement of reaching at last the
exorbitant price the bookseller asked for the
only, although imperfect, edition of the poems
of S. T. Coleridge. At last I could meet his
demand, and my friend and I went down to
consummate the solemn purchase. Coming
away with our treasure, we read aloud from
the orange-coloured volume, in turns, as) we
strolled along, until at last we sat down on
the bulging root of an elm-tree in a secluded
lane. Here we stayed, in a sort of poetical
nirvana, reading, reading, forgetting the
passage of time, until the hour of our neglected
mid-day meal was a long while past, and we
had to hurry home to bread and cheese and
a scolding.
There was occasionally some trouble about
my reading, but now not much nor often. I
was rather adroit, and careful not to bring
330
FATHER AND SON
prominently into sight anything of a literary
kind which could become a stone of stumbling.
But, when I was nearly sixteen, I made a purchase which brought me into sad trouble, and
was the cause of a permanent wound to my selfrespect. I had long coveted in the book-shop
window a volume in which the poetical works
of Ben Jonson and Christopher Marlowe were
said to be combined. This I bought at length,
and I carried it with me to devour as I trod
the desolate road that brought me along the
edge of the cliff on Saturday afternoons. Ben
Jonson I could make nothing of, but when I
turned to " Hero and Leander," I was lifted
to a heaven of passion and music. It was a
marvellous revelation of romantic beauty to
me, and as I paced along that lonely and exquisite highway, with its immense command
of the sea, and its peeps every now and then,
through slanting thickets, far down to the
snow-white shingle, I lifted up my voice,
singing the verses, as I strolled along:
Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee,
Where sparrows perched, of hollow pearl and gold,
Such as the world would wonder to behold,-,
so it went on, and I thought I had never read
anything so lovely,331
FATHER AND SON
Amorous Leander, beautiful and young,
Whose tragedy divine Musaeus sung,it all seemed to my fancy intoxicating beyond
anything I had ever even dreamed of, since I
had not yet become acquainted with any of
the modern romanticists.
When I reached home, tired out with enthusiasm and exercise, 1 must needs, so soon as
I had eaten, search out my stepmother that she
might be a partner in my joys. It is remarkable
to me now, and a disconcerting proof of my still
almost infantile innocence, that, having induced
her to settle to her knitting, I began, without
hesitation, to read Marlowe's voluptuous poem
aloud to that blameless Christian gentlewoman.
We got on very well in the opening, but at
the episode of Cupid's pining, my stepmother's
needles began nervously to clash, and when
we launched on the description of Leander's
person, she interrupted me by saying, rather
sharply, " Give me that book, please, I should
like to read the rest to myself." I resigned
the reading in amazement, and was stupefied
to see her take the volume, shut it with a snap
and hide it under her needlework. Nor could
I extract from her another word on the
subject.
The matter passed from my mind, and I
332
FATHER AND SON
was therefore extremely alarmed when, soon
after my going to bed that night, my Father
came into my room with a pale face and burning eyes, the prey of violent perturbation. He
set down the candle and stood by the bed,
and it was some time before he could resolve
on a form of speech. Then he denounced me,
in unmeasured terms, for bringing into the
house, for possessing at all or reading, so
abominable a book. He explained that my
stepmother had shown it to him, and that he
had looked through it, and had burned it.
The sentence in his tirade which principally
affected me was this. Hle said, "You will
soon be leaving us, and going up to lodgings in
London, and if your landlady should come into
your room, and find such a book lying about,
she would immediately set you down as a profligate." I did not understand this at all, and
it seems to me now that the fact that 1 had so
very simply and childishly volunteered to read
the verses to my stepmother should have
proved to my Father that I connected it with
no ideas of an immoral nature.
I was greatly wounded and offended, but
my indignation was smothered up in the
alarm and excitement which followed the
news that I was to go up to live in lodgings,
333
FATHER AND SON
and, as it was evident, alone, in London.
Of this no hint or whisper had previously
reached me. On reflection, I can but admit
that my Father, who was little accustomed to
seventeenth-century literature, must have
come across some startling exposures in Ben
Jonson, and probably never reached " Hero
and Leander" at all. The artistic effect of
such poetry on an innocently pagan mind did
not come within the circle of his experience.
He judged the outspoken Elizabethan poets,
no doubt, very much in the spirit of the problematical landlady.
Of the world outside, of the dim wild
whirlpool of London, I was much afraid, but
I was now ready to be willing to leave the
narrow Devonshire circle, to see the last of
the red mud, of the dreary village street, of the
plethoric elders, to hear the last of the drawling voices of the " Saints." Yet I had a great
difficulty in persuading myself that I could
ever be happy away from home, and again I
compared my lot with that of one of the
speckled soldier-crabs that roamed about in
my Father's aquarium, dragging after them
great whorl-shells. They, if by chance they
were turned out of their whelk-habitations,
trailed about a pale soft body in search of
$34
FATHER AND SON
another house, visibly broken-hearted and the
victims of every ignominious accident.
My spirits were divided pathetically between
the wish to stay on, a guarded child, and to
proceed into the world, a budding man, and,
in my utter ignorance, I sought in vain to conjure up what my immediate future would be.
My Father threw no light upon the subject,
for he had not formed any definite idea of
what I could possibly do to earn an honest
living. As a matter of fact I was to stay
another year at school and home.
This last year of my boyish life passed
rapidly and pleasantly. My sluggish brain
waked up at last and I was able to study with
application. In the public examinations I did
pretty well, and may even have been thought
something of a credit to the school. Yet I
formed no close associations, and I even contrived to avoid, as I had afterwards occasion
to regret, such lessons as were distasteful to me,
and therefore particularly valuable. But I read
with unchecked voracity, and in several curious
directions. Shakespeare now passed into my
possession entire, in the shape of a reprint
more hideous and more offensive to the eyesight than would in these days appear conceivable. I made acquaintance with Keats,
335
FATHER AND SON
who entirely captivated me; with Shelley,
whose "Queen Mab" at first repelled me
from the threshold of his edifice; and with
Wordsworth, for the exercise of whose magic
I was still far too young. My Father presented me with the entire bulk of Southey's
stony verse, which I found it impossible to
penetrate, but my stepmother lent me " The
Golden Treasury,"' in which almost everything
seemed exquisite.
Upon this extension of my intellectual
powers, however, there did not follow any
spirit of doubt or hostility to the faith. On
the contrary, at first there came a considerable
quickening of fervour. My prayers became/
less frigid and mechanical; I no longer1
avoided as far as possible the contemplation
of religious ideas; I began to search the i
Scriptures for myself with interest and sympathy, if scarcely with ardour.' I began to
perceive, without animosity, the strange
narrowness of my Father's system, which
seemed to take into consideration only a
selected circle of persons, a group of disciples
peculiarly illuminated, and to have no message
whatever for the wider Christian community.
On this subject I had some instructive conversations with my Father, whom I found not
336
FATHER AND SON

reluctant to have his convictions pushed to

their logical extremity. He did not wish to

judge, he protested; but he could not admit

that a single Unitarian (or " Socinian," as he

preferred to say) could possibly be redeemed;

and he had no hope of eternal salvation for

the inhabitants of Catholic countries. I

recollect his speaking of Austria. He questioned whether a single Austrian subject,

except, as he said, here and there a pious and

extremely ignorant individual, who had not

comprehended the errors of the Papacy, but

had humbly studied his Bible, could hope to

find eternal life. He thought that the ordinary

Chinaman or savage native of Fiji had a better

chance of salvation than any cardinal in the

Vatican. And even in the priesthood of the

Church of England he believed that while

many were called, few indeed would be found

to have been chosen.

I could not sympathise, even in my then

state of ignorance, with so rigid a conception

of the Divine mercy. Little inclined as I was

to be sceptical, I still thought it impossible,

that a secret of such stupendous importance

should have been entrusted to a little group of

Plymouth Brethren, and have been hidden

from millions of disinterested and pious theo$37  Y
FATHER AND SON
logians. That the leaders of European
Christianity were sincere, my Father did not
attempt to question. But they were all of them
wrong, incorrect; and no matter how holy
their lives, how self-sacrificing their actions,
they would have to suffer for their inexactitude through eons of undefined torment.
He would speak with a solemn complacency
of the aged nun, who, after a long life of renunciation and devotion, died at last, "only
to discover her mistake."
He who was so tender-hearted that he could
not bear to witness the pain or distress of any
person, however disagreeable or undeserving,
was quite acquiescent in believing that God
would punish human beings, in millions, for
ever, for a purely intellectual error of comprehension. My Father's inconsistencies of
perception seem to me to have been the result
of a curious irregularity of equipment. Taking
for granted, as he did, the absolute integrity
of the Scriptures, and applying to them his
trained scientific spirit, he contrived to stifle
with a deplorable success alike the function of
the imagination, the sense of moral justice,
and his own deep and instinctive tenderness
of heart.
There presently came over me a strong desire
838
FATHER AND SON
to know what doctrine indeed it was that the
other Churches taught. 1 expressed a wish to
be made aware of the practices of Rome, or
at least of Canterbury, and I longed to attend
the Anglican and the Roman services. But
to do so was impossible. My Father did not,
indeed, forbid me to enter the fine parish
church of our village, or the stately Puginesque
cathedral which Rome had just erected at its
side, but I knew that I could not be seen at
either service without his immediately knowing it, or without his being deeply wounded.
Although I was sixteen years of age, and
although I was treated with indulgence and
affection, I was still but a bird fluttering in
the net-work of my Father's will, and incapable of the smallest independent action. I
resigned all thought of attending any other
services than those at our "Room," but I did
no longer regard this exclusion as a final one.
I bowed, but it was in the house of Rimmon,
from which I now knew that I must inevitably
escape. All the liberation, however, which I
desired or dreamed of was only just so much
as would bring me into communion with the
outer world of Christianity, without divesting
me of the pure and simple principles of faith.
Of so much emancipation, indeed, I now
339
FATHER AND SON
became ardently desirous, and in the contemplation of it I rose to a more considerable
degree of religous fervour than I had ever
reached before or was ever to experience later.
Our thoughts were at this time abundantly
exercised with the expectation of the immediate coming of the Lord, who, as my Father
and those who thought with him believed,
would suddenly appear, without the least
warning, and would catch up to be with Him
in everlasting glory all whom acceptance of
the Atonement had sealed for immortality.
These were, on the whole, not numerous, and
our belief was that the world, after a few days'
amazement at the total disappearance of these
persons, would revert to its customary habits
of life, merely sinking more rapidly into a moral
corruption due to the removal of these souls of
salt. This event an examination of prophecy
had led my Father to regard as absolutely imminent, and sometimes, when we parted for
the night, he would say with a sparkling
rapture in his eyes, " Who knows? We may
meet next in the air, with all the cohorts of
God's saints!"
This conviction I shared, without a doubt;
and, indeed,-in perfect innocency, I hope, but
perhaps with a touch of slyness too,-I pro340
FATHER AND SON
posed at the end of the summer holidays that
I should stay at home. " What is the use of
my going to school? Let me be with you
when we rise to meet the Lord in the air! "
To this my Father sharply and firmly replied
that it was our duty to carry on our usual
avocations to the last, for we knew not the
moment of His coming, and we should be
together in an instant on that day, how far
soever we might be parted upon earth. I was
ashamed, but his argument was logical, and,
as it proved, judicious. My Father lived for
nearly a quarter of a century more, never
losing the hope of "not tasting death," and
as the last moments of mortality approached,
he was bitterly disappointed at what he held
to be a scanty reward of his long faith and
patience. But if my own life's work had been,
as I proposed, shelved in expectation of the
Lord's imminent advent, I should have cumbered the ground until this day.
To school, therefore, I returned with a brain
full of strange discords, in a huddled mixture
of " Endymion " and the Book of Revelation,
John Wesley's hymns and ]lidsumnmer
Night's Dream. Few boys of my age, I
suppose, carried about with them such a confused throng of immature impressions and
341
FATHER AND SON
contradictory hopes. 1 was at one moment
devoutly pious, at the next haunted by visions
of material beauty and longing for sensuous
impressions. In my hot and silly brain, Jesus
and Pan held sway together, as in a wayside
chapel discordantly and impishly consecrated
to Pagan and to Christian rites. But for the
present, as in the great chorus which so marvellously portrays our double nature, "the
folding-star of Bethlehem " was still dominant.
I became more and more pietistic. Beginning now to versify, 1 wrote a tragedy in pale
imitation of Shakespeare, but on a Biblical
and evangelistic subject; and odes that were
imitations of those in " Prometheus Unbound,"
but dealt with the approaching advent of our
Lord and the rapture of His saints. My unwholesome excitement, bubbling up in this
violent way, reached at last a climax and
foamed over.
It was a summer afternoon, and, being
now left very free in my movements, I had
escaped from going out with the rest of my
schoolfellows in their formal walk in charge
of an usher. I had been reading a good deal
of poetry, but my heart had translated Apollo
and Bacchus into terms of exalted Christian
faith. I was alone, and I lay on a sofa, drawn
342
FATHER AND SON
across a large open window at the top of the
school-house, in a room which was used as a
study by the boys who were "going up for
examination." I gazed down on a labyrinth of
gardens sloping to the sea, which twinkled
faintly beyond the towers of the town. Each
of these gardens held a villa in it, but all the
near landscape below me was drowned in
foliage. A wonderful warm light of approaching sunset modelled the shadows and set the
broad summits of the trees in a rich glow.
There was an absolute silence below and
around me, a magic of suspense seemed to
keep every topmost twig from waving.
Over my soul there swept an immense
wave of emotion. Now, surely, now the
great final change must be approaching. I
gazed up into the faintly-coloured sky, and
I broke irresistibly into speech. "Come
now, Lord Jesus," I cried, "come now and
take me to be for ever with Thee in Thy
Paradise. I am ready to come. My heart
is purged from sin, there is nothing that
keeps me rooted to this wicked world. Oh,
come now, now, and take me before I have
known the temptations of life, before I have
to go to London and all the dreadful things
that happen there!" And I raised myself on
343
FATHER AND SON
the sofa, and leaned upon the window-sill, and
waited for the glorious apparition.
This was the highest moment of my
religious life, the apex of my striving after
holiness. I waited awhile, watching; and
then I had a little shame at the theatrical
attitude I had adopted, although I was alone.
Still I gazed and still I hoped. Then a little
breeze sprang up, and the branches danced.
Sounds began to rise from the road beneath
me. Presently the colour deepened, the
evening came on. From far below there rose
to me the chatter of the boys returning home.
The tea-bell rang,-last word of prose to
shatter my mystical poetry. " The Lord has
not come, the Lord will never come," I
muttered, and in my heart the artificial edifice
of extravagant faith began to totter and
crumble. From that moment forth my
Father and I, though the fact was long successfully concealed from him and even from
myself, walked in opposite hemispheres of
the soul, with "the thick o' the world between
us.
344
EPILOGUE
THIS narrative, however, must not be allowed
to close with the son in the foreground of the
piece. If it has a value, that value consists in
what light it may contrive to' throw upon the
unique and noble figure of the father. With
the advance of years, the characteristics of this
figure became more severely outlined, more
rigorously confined within settled limits. In
relation to the son-who presently departed
at a very immature age, for the new life in
London-the attitude of the father continued
to be one of extreme solicitude, deepening bye
degrees into disappointment and disenchant->
ment. He abated no jot or tittle of his
demands upon human frailty. He kept the
spiritual cord drawn tight; the Biblical bearing-rein was incessantly busy, jerking into
position the head of the dejected neophyte.
That young soul, removed from the father's
personal inspection, began to blossom forth;
345
FATHER AND SON
crudely and irregularly enough, into new
provinces of thought, through fresh layers of
experience. To the painful mentor at home
in the WAest, the centre of anxiety was still
the meek and docile heart, dedicated to the
Lord's service, which must, at all hazards and
with all defiance of the rules of life, be kept
unspotted from the world.
The torment of a postal inquisition began
directly I was settled in my London lodgings.
To my Father -- with his ample leisure,
his palpitating apprehension, his ready
pen-the flow of correspondence offered
no trouble at all; it was a grave but gratifying occupation. To me the almost daily
"letter of exhortation, with its string of
questions about conduct, its series of warnings, grew to be a burden which could
hardly be borne, particularly because it involved a reply as punctual and if possible as
full as itself. At the age of seventeen, the
metaphysics of the soul are shadowy, and it is
a dreadful thing to be forced to define the
exact outline of what is so undulating and so
shapeless. To my Father there seemed no
reason why I should hesitate to give answers
of full metallic ring to his hard and oft-repeated
questions; but to me this correspondence was
346
FATHER AND SON
torture. When I feebly expostulated, when
I begged to be left a little to myself, these
appeals of mine automatically stimulated, and
indeed blew up into fierce flames, the ardour
of my Father's alarm.
The letter, the only too-confidently expected
letter, would lie on the table as I descended
to breakfast. It would commonly be, of
course, my only letter, unless tempered by a
cosy and chatty note from my dear and comfortable stepmother, dealing with such perfectly tranquillising subjects as the harvest of
roses in the garden or the state of health of
various neighbours. But the other, the solitary
letter, in its threatening whiteness, with its
exquisitely penned address-there it would
lie awaiting me, destroying the taste of the
bacon, reducing the flavour of the tea to insipidity. I might fatuously dally with it,
I might pretend not to observe it, but there
it lay. Before the morning's exercise began,
I knew that it had to be read, and what
was worse, that it had to be answered. Useless the effort to conceal from myself what
it contained. Like all its precursors, like
all its followers, it would insist, with every
variety of appeal, on a reiterated declaration that I still fully intended, as in the
347
FATHER AND SON
days of my earliest childhood, " to be on the
Lord's side" in everything.
In my replies, I would sometimes answer
precisely as I was desired to answer; sometimes I would evade the queries, and write
about other things; sometimes I would turn
upon the tormentor, and urge that my tender
youth might be let alone. It little mattered
what form of weakness I put forth by way of
baffling my Father's direct, firm, unflinching
strength. To an appeal against the bondage of
a correspondence of such unbroken solemnity
I would receive-with what a paralysing
promptitude I-such a reply as this:"Let me say that the 'solemnity 'you complain of has only been the expression of tender
anxiousness of a father's heart, that his only
child, just turned out upon the world, and
very far out of his sight and hearing, should
be walking in God's way. Recollect that it is
not now as it was when you were at school,
when we had personal communication with
you at intervals of five days:-we now know
absolutely nothing of you, save from your
letters, and if they do not indicate your
spiritual prosperity, the deepest solicitudes of
our hearts have nothing to feed on. But I
348
FATHER AND SON
will try henceforth to trust you, and lay aside
my fears; for you are worthy of my confidence; and your own God and your father's
God will hold you with His right hand."
Over such letters as these I am not ashamed
to say that I sometimes wept; the old paper
I have just been copying shows traces of tears
shed upon it more than forty years ago, tears
commingled of despair at my own feebleness,
distraction at my want of will, pity for my
Father's manifest and pathetic distress. He
would " try henceforth to trust " me, he said.
Alas! the effort would be in vain; after a day
or two, after a hollow attempt to write of
other things, the importunate subject would
recur; there would intrude again the inevitable questions about the Atonement and the
Means of Grace, the old anxious fears lest I
was "yielding" my intimacy to agreeable
companions who were not "one with me in
Christ," fresh passionate entreaties to be
assured, in every letter, that I was walking in
the clear light of God's presence.
It seems to me now profoundly strange,
although I knew too little of the world to
remark it at the time, that these incessant
exhortations dealt, not with conduct, but with
349
FATHER AND SON
faith. Earlier in this narrative I have noted
how disdainfully, with what an austere pride,
my Father refused to entertain the subject of
personal shortcomings in my behaviour. There
were enough of them to blame, Heaven knows,
but he was too lofty-minded a gentleman
to dwell upon them, and, though by nature
deeply suspicious of the possibility of frequent
moral lapses, even in the very elect, he
refused to stoop to anything like espionage.
I owe him a deep debt of gratitude for his
beautiful faith in me in this respect, and now
that I was alone in London, at this tender
time of life, "exposed," as they say, to all
sorts of dangers, as defenseless as a fledgling
that has been turned out of its nest, yet my
Father did not, in his uplifted Quixotism,
allow himself to fancy me guilty of any moral
misbehaviour, but concentrated his fears
entirely upon my faith.
"Let me know more of your inner light.
Does the candle of the Lord shine on your
soul? This would be the ceaseless inquiry.
Or, again, "Do you get any spiritual companionship with young men? You passed
over last Sunday without even a word, yet
this day is the most interesting to me in your
whole week. Do you find the ministry of the
350
FATHER AND SON
Word pleasant, and, above all, profitable?
Does it bring your soul into exercise before
God? The Coming of Christ draweth nigh.
Watch, therefore and pray always, that you
may be counted worthy to stand before the
Son of Man."
If I quote such passages as this from my
Father's letters to me, it is not that I seek
entertainment in a contrast between his
earnestness and the casuistical inattention and
provoked distractedness of a young man to
whom the real world now offered its irritating and stimulating scenes of animal and
intellectual life, but to call out sympathy, and
perhaps wonder, at the spectacle of so blind a
Roman firmness as my Father's spiritual
attitude displayed.
His aspirations were individual and metaphysical. At the present hour, so complete
is the revolution which has overturned the
puritanism of which he was perhaps the latest
surviving type, that all classes of religious
persons combine in placing philanthropic
activity, the objective attitude, in the foreground. It is extraordinary how far-reaching
the change has been, so that nowadays a
religion which does not combine with its
subjective faith a strenuous labour for the
351
FATHER AND SON
good of others is hardly held to possess any
religious principle worth holding.
This propaganda of beneficence, this constant attention to the moral and physical improvement of persons who have been neglected,
is quite recent as a leading feature of
religion, though indeed it seems to have formed
some part of the Saviour's original design. It
was unknown to the great divines of the seventeenth century, whether Catholic or Protestant, and it offered but a shadowy attraction
to my Father, who was the last of their
disciples. When Bossuet desired his hearers to
listen to the " cri de m7isere a l'entour de nous,
qui devrait nous fondre le ceur," he started a
new thing in the world of theology. We
may search the famous " Rule and Exercises
of Holy Living" from cover to cover, and not
learn that Jeremy Taylor would have thought
that any activity of the district-visitor or the
Salvation lassie came within the category of
saintliness.
My Father, then, like an old divine, concentrated his thoughts upon the intellectual part
of faith. In his obsession about me, he
believed that if my brain could be kept
unaffected by any of the tempting errors of
the age, and my heart centred in the adoring
352
FATHER ANjD SON
love of God, all would be well with me in
perpetuity. He was still convinced that by
intensely directing my thoughts, he could
compel them to flow in a certain channel,
since he had not begun to learn the lesson, so
mournful for saintly men of his complexion,
that "virtue would not be virtue, could it be
given by one fellow creature to another." He
had recognised, with reluctance, that holiness
was not hereditary, but he continued to hope
that it might be compulsive. I was still " the
child of many prayers," and it was not to be
conceded that these prayers could remain
unanswered.
The great panacea was now, as always, the
study of the Bible, and this my Father never
ceased to urge upon me. He presented to
me a copy of Dean Alford's edition of the
Greek New Testament, in four great volumes,
and these he had had so magnificently bound
in full morocco that the work shone on my
poor shelf of sixpenny poets like a duchess
among dairy-maids. He extracted from me a
written promise that I would translate and
meditate upon a portion of the Greek text
* every morning before I started for business.
This promise I presently failed to keep, my
good intentions being undermined by an in
3253
z
FATHER AND SON
vincible ennui; I concealed the dereliction from
him, and the sense that I was deceiving my
Father ate into my conscience like a canker.
But the dilemma was now before me that I
must either deceive my Father in such things
or paralyse my own character.
My growing distaste for the Holy Scriptures
began to occupy my thoughts, and to surprise
as much as it scandalised me. My desire was
to continue to delight in those sacred pages,
for which I still had an instinctive veneration.
Yet I could not but observe the difference
between the zeal with which I snatched at a
volume of Carlyle or Ruskin-since these
magicians were now first revealing themselves
to me --and the increasing languor with which
I took up Alford for my daily "passage."
Of course, although I did not know it, and
believed my reluctance to be sinful, the real
reason why I now found the Bible so difficult
to read was my familiarity with its contents.
These had the colourless triteness of a story
retold a hundred times. I longed for something new, something that would gratify
curiosity and excite surprise. Whether the
facts and doctrines contained in the Bible were
true or false was not the question that appealed to me; it was rather that they had
354
FATHER AND SON
been presented to me so often and had sunken
into me so far that, as some one has said, they
"lay bedridden in the dormitory of the soul,"
and made no impression of any kind upon me.
It often amazed me, and I am still unable
to understand the fact, that my Father,
through his long life-or till nearly the close
of it-continued to take an eager pleasure in
the text of the Bible. As I think I have
already said, before he reached middle life, he
had committed practically the whole of it to
memory, and if started anywhere, even in a
Minor Prophet, he could go on without a
break as long as ever he was inclined for that
exercise. He, therefore, at no time can have
been assailed by the satiety of which I have
spoken, and that it came so soon to me I must
take simply as an indication of difference of
temperament. It was not possible, even
through the dark glass of correspondence, to
deceive his eagle eye in this matter, and his
suspicions accordingly took another turn. He
conceived me to have become, or to be becoming, a victim of " the infidelity of the age."
In this new difficulty, he appealed to forms
of modern literature by the side of which the
least attractive pages of Leviticus or Deuteronomy struck me as even thrilling. In
355
FATHER AND SON
particular, he urged upon me a work, then just
published, called " The Continuity of Scripture" by William Page Wood, afterwards
Lord Chancellor Hatherley. I do not know
why he supposed that the lucubrations of an
exemplary lawyer, delivered in a style that was
like the trickling of sawdust, would succeed
in rousing emotions which the glorious rhetoric of the Orient had failed to awaken; but
Page Wood had been a Sunday School teacher
for thirty years, and my Father was always
unduly impressed by the acumen of pious
barristers.
As time went on, and I grew older and
more independent in mind, my Father's
anxiety about what he called " the pitfalls and
snares which surround on every hand the
thoughtless giddy youth of London" became
extremely painful to himself. By harping in
private upon these " pitfalls "-which brought
to my imagination a funny rough woodcut in
an old edition of Bunyan, where a devil was
seen capering over a sort of box let neatly into
the ground-he worked himself up into a
frame of mind which was not a little irritating
to his hapless correspondent, who was now
"snared" indeed, limed by the pen like a bird
by the feet, and could not by any means
356
FATHER AND SON
escape. To a peck or a flutter from the bird
the implacable fowler would -reply:
"You charge me with being suspicious, and
I fear I cannot deny the charge. But I can
appeal to your own sensitive and thoughtful
mind for a considerable allowance. My deep
and tender love for you; your youth and
inexperience; the examples of other young
men; your distance from parental counsel;
our absolute and painful ignorance of all the
details of your daily life, except what you
yourself tell us:-try to throw yourself into
the standing of a parent, and say if my
suspiciousness is unreasonable. I rejoicingly
acknowledge that from all I see you are
pursuing a virtuous, steady, worthy course.
One good thing my suspiciousness does:-ever
and anon it brings out from you assurances,
which greatly refresh and comfort me. And
again, it carries me ever to God's Throne of
Grace on your behalf. Holy Job suspected
that his sons might have sinned, and cursed
God in their heart. Was not his suspicion
much like mine, grounded on the same.
reasons, and productive of the same results?
For it drove him to God in intercession.
I have adduced the example of this Patriarch
$57
FATHER AND SON
before, and he will endure being looked at
again."
In fact, Holy Job continued to be frequently looked at, and for this Patriarch I
came to experience a hatred which was as
venomous as it was undeserved. But what
youth of eighteen would willingly be compared
with the sons of Job? And indeed, for my
part, I felt much more like that justly
exasperated character, Elihu the Buzite, of
the kindred of Rain.
As time went on, the peculiar strain of
inquisition was relaxed, and I endured fewer
and fewer of the torments of religious correspondence. Nothing abides in one tense projection, and my Father, resolute as he was,
had other preoccupations. His orchids, his
microscope, his physiological researches, his
interpretations of prophecy, filled up the hours
of his active and strenuous life, and, out of his
sight, I became not indeed out of his mind,
but no longer ceaselessly in the painful foreground of it. Yet, although the reiteration of
his anxiety might weary him a little as it had
wearied me well nigh to groans of despair,
there was not the slightest change in his real
attitude towards the subject or towards me.
358
FATHER AND SON
I have already had occasion to say that he
had nothing of the mystic or the visionary
about him. At certain times and on certain
points, he greatly desired that signs and
wonders, such as had astonished and encouraged the infancy of the Christian Church,
might again be vouchsafed to it, but he did
not pretend to see such miracles himself, nor
give the slightest credence to others who
asserted that they did. He, often congratulated himself on the fact that although his
mind dwelt so constantly on spiritual matters
it was never betrayed into any suspension of
the rational functions.
Cross-examination by letter slackened, but
on occasion of my brief and usually summer
visits to Devonshire I suffered acutely from
my Father's dialectical appetites. Hie was
surrounded by peasants, on whom the teeth of
his arguments could find no purchase. To
him, in that intellectual Abdera, even an
unwilling youth from London offered opportunities of pleasant contest. He would declare himself ready, nay eager, for argument.
With his mental sleeves turned up, he would
adopt a fighting attitude, and challenge me to
a round on any portion of the Scheme of
Grace. His alacrity was dreadful to me, his
59
FATHER AND SON
well aimed blows fell on what was rather a
bladder or a pillow than a vivid antagonist.
He was, indeed most unfairly handicapped,
-I was naked, he in a suit of chain armour,for he had adopted a method which I thought,
and must still think, exceedingly unfair. He
assumed that he had private knowledge of
the Divine Will, and he would meet my temporising arguments by asseverations,-" So
sure as my God liveth!" or by appeals to a:
higher authority,-" But what does my Lord
tell me in Paul's Letter to the Philippians?"
It was the prerogative of his faith to know,
and of his character to overpower objection;
between these two millstones I was rapidly
ground to powder.
These " discussions," as they were rather
ironically called, invariably ended for me in
disaster. I was driven out of my papiermdche fastnesses, my canvas walls rocked at
the first peal from my Father's clarion, and
the foe pursued me across the plains of Jericho
until I lay down ignominiously and covered
my face. I seemed to be pushed with horns
of iron, such as those which Zedekiah the son
of Chenaanah prepared for the encouragement
of Ahab.
When I acknowledged defeat and cried for
s60
FATHER AND SON
quarter, my Father would become radiant,
and I still seem to hear the sound of his
full voice, so thrilling, so warm,- so painful
to my over-strained nerves, bursting forth in
a sort of benediction at the end of each of
these one-sided contentions, with " I bow my
knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that He would grant you, according to
the riches of his glory, to be strengthened
with might by His Spirit in the inner man;
that Christ may dwell in your heart by faith;
that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
may be able to comprehend with all saints
what is the breadth, and length, and depth,
and height, and to know the love of Christ
which passeth knowledge, that you might be
filled with the fullness of God."
Thus solemn and thus ceremonious was my
Father apt to become, without a moment's
warning, on plain and domestic occasions;
abruptly brimming over with emotion like a
basin which an unseen flow of water has filled
and over-filled.
I earnestly desire that no trace of that
absurd self-pity which is apt to taint recollections of this nature should give falsity to mine.
My Father, let me say once more, had other
interests than those of his religion. In par361
FATHER AND SON
ticular, at this time, he took to painting in
water-colours in the open air, and he resumed
the assiduous study of botany. He was no
fanatical monomaniac. Nevertheless, there
was, in everything he did and said, the central
purpose present. He acknowledged it plainly;
"with me," he confessed, " every question
assumes a Divine standpoint and is not adequately answered if the judgment-seat of
Christ is not kept in sight."
This was maintained whether the subject
under discussion was poetry, or society, or the
Prussian war with Austria, or the stamen of a
wild flower. Once, at least, he was himself conscious of the fatiguing effect on my temper of
this insistency, for, raising his great brown eyes
with a flash of laughter in them, he closed the
Bible suddenly after a very lengthy disquisition,
and quoted his Virgil to startling effect:Claudite jam rivos, pueri: sat prata biberunt.
The insistency of his religious conversation
was, probably, the less incomprehensible to me
on account of the evangelical training to
which I had been so systematically subjected.
It was, however, none the less intolerably irksome, and would have been exasperating, I
believe, even to a nature in which a powerful
362
FATHER AND SON
and genuine piety was inherent. To my own,
in which a feeble and imitative faith was expiring, it was deeply vexatious. It led, alas!
to a great deal of bowing in the house of
Rimmon, to much hypocritical ingenuity in
drawing my Father's attention away, if possible, as the terrible subject was seen to be looming and approaching. In this my stepmother
would aid and abet, sometimes producing
incongruous themes, likely to attract my
Father aside, with a skill worthy of a parlour
conjurer, and much to my admiration. If,
however, she was not unwilling to come, in
this way, to the support of my feebleness,
there was no open collusion between us. She
always described my Father, when she was
alone with me, admiringly, as one " whose
trumpet gave no uncertain sound." There was
not a tinge of infidelity upon her candid mind,
but she was human, and I think that now and
then she was extremely bored.
My Father was entirely devoid of the prudence which turns away its eyes and passes
as rapidly as possible in the opposite direction.
The peculiar kind of drama in which every
sort of social discomfort is welcomed rather
than that the characters should be happy when
guilty of " acting a lie," was not invented in
363
FATHER AND SON
those days, and there can hardly be imagined
a figure more remote from my Father than
Ibsen. Yet when I came, at a far later date,
to read " The Wild Duck," memories of the
embarrassing household of my infancy helped
me to realise Gregers Werle, with his determination to pull the veil of illusion away
from every compromise that makes life bearable.
I was docile, I was plausible, I was anything but combative; if my Father could
have persuaded himself to let me alone, if he
could merely have been willing to leave
my subterfuges and my explanations unanalysed, all would have been well. But he
refused to see any difference in temperament
between a lad of twenty and a sage of sixty.
He had no vital sympathy for youth, which in
itself had no charm for him. He had no compassion for the weaknesses of immaturity,
and his one and only anxiety was to be at
the end of his spiritual journey, safe with me
in the house where there are many mansions.
The incidents of human life upon the road to
glory were less than nothing to him.
My Father was very fond of defining what
was his own attitude at this time, and he was
never tired of urging the same ambition upon
364
FATHER AND SON
me. He regarded himself as the faithful
steward of a Master who might return at any
moment, and who would require to find everything ready for his convenience. That master
was God, with whom my Father seriously
believed himself to be in relations much more
confidential than those vouchsafed to ordinary
pious persons. He awaited, with anxious hope,
"the coming of the Lord," an event which
he still frequently believed to be imminent.
He would calculate, by reference to prophecies in the Old and New Testament, the
exact date of this event; the date would pass,
without the expected Advent, and he would
be more than disappointed,-he would be
incensed. Then he would understand that he
must have made some slight error in calculation, and the pleasures of anticipation would
recommence.
Me in all this he used as a kind of
inferior coadjutor, much as a responsible
and upper servant might use a footboy. I,
also, must be watching; it was not important
that I should be seriously engaged in any
affairs of my own. I must be ready for the
Master's coming; and my Father's incessant
cross-examination was made in the spirit of
a responsible servant who fidgets lest some
s65
FATHER AND SON
humble but essential piece of household work
has been neglected.
My holidays, however, and all my personal
relations with my Father were poisoned by
this insistency. I was never at my ease in his
company; I never knew when I might not be
subjected to a series of searching questions
which I should not be allowed to evade.
Meanwhile, on every other stage of experience
I was gaining the reliance upon self and the
respect for the opinion of others which come
naturally to a young man of sober habits who
earns his own living and lives his own life.
For this kind of independence my Father had
no respect or consideration, when questions of
religion were introduced, although he handsomely conceded it on other points. And
now first there occurred to me the reflection,
which in years to come I was to repeat over
and over, with an ever sadder emphasis,what a charming companion, what a delightful parent, what a courteous and engaging
friend my Father would have been, and
would pre-eminently have been to me, if it
had not been for this stringent piety which
ruined it all.
Let me speak plainly. After my long experience, after my patience and forbearance, I
366
FATHER AND SON
have surely the right to protest against the
untruth (would that I could apply to it any
other word!) that evangelical religion, or any
religion in a violent form, is a wholesome or
valuable or desirable adjunct to human life.
It divides heart from heart. It sets up a vain,
chimerical ideal, in the barren pursuit of which
all the tender, indulgent affections, all the
genial play of life, all the exquisite pleasures
and soft resignations of, the body, all that enlarges and calms the soul, are exchanged for
what is harsh and void and negative. It encourages a stern and ignorant spirit of condemnation; it throws altogether out of gear the
healthy movement of the conscience; it invents
virtues which are sterile and cruel; it invents
sins which are no sins at all, but which darken
the heaven of innocent joy with futile clouds
of remorse. There is something horrible, if
we will bring ourselves to face it, in the
fanaticism that can do nothing with this
pathetic and fugitive existence of ours but
treat it as if it were the uncomfortable antechamber to a palace which no one has explored
and of the plan of which we know absolutely
nothing. My Father, it is true, believed that
he was intimately acquainted with the form
and furniture of this habitation, and he wished
367
FATHER AND SON
me to think of nothing else but of the advantages of an eternal residence in it.
Then came a moment when my self-sufficiency revolted against the police-inspection to
which my " views " were incessantly subjected.
There was a morning, in the hot-house at
home, among - the gorgeous waxen orchids
which reminded my Father of the tropics in
his youth, when my forbearance or my timidity
gave way. The enervated air, soaked with the
intoxicating perfumes of all those voluptuous
flowers, may have been partly responsible for
my outburst. My Father had once more put
to me the customary interrogatory. Was I
"walking closely with God "? Was my sense
of the efficacy of the Atonement clear and
sound? Had the Holy Scriptures still their
full authority with me? My replies on this
occasion were violent and hysterical. I have
no clear recollection what it was that I said,I desire not to recall the whimpering sentences
in which I begged to be let alone, in which I
demanded the right to think for myself, in
which I repudiated the idea that my Fathei
was responsible to God for my secret thoughts
and my most intimate convictions.
He made no answer; I broke from the odor
ous furnace of the conservatory, and buried my
368
FATHER AND SON
face in the cold grass upon the lawn. My
visit to Devonshire, already near its close, was
hurried to an end. I had scarcely arrived in
London before the following letter, furiously
despatched in the track of the fugitive, buried
itself like an arrow in my heart:
"When your sainted Mother died, she not
only tenderly committed you to God, but left
you also as a solemn charge to me, to bring
you up in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord. That responsibility I have sought constantly to keep before me: I can truly aver
that it has been ever before me-in my choice
of a housekeeper, in my choice of a school, in
my ordering of your holidays, in my choice
of a second wife, in my choice of an occupation for you, in my choice of a residence for
you; and in multitudes of lesser thingsI have sought to act for you, not in the light
of this present world, but with a view to
Eternity.
"Before your childhood was past, there
seemed God's manifest blessing on our care;
for you seemed truly converted to Him; you
confessed, in solemn baptism, that you had
died and had been raised with Christ; and
you were received with joy into the bosom
69 2 A
FATHER AND SON
of the Church of God, as one alive from the
dead.
"All this filled my heart with thankfulness
and joy, whenever I thought of you:-how
could it do otherwise? And when I left you
in London, on that dreary winter evening, my
heart, full of sorrowing love, found its refuge
and its resource in this thought,-that you
were one of the lambs of Christ's flock; sealed
with the Holy Spirit as His; renewed in heart
to holiness, in the image of God.
"For a while, all appeared to go on fairly
well: we yearned, indeed, to discover more of
heart in your allusions to religious matters,
but your expressions towards us were filial and
affectionate; your conduct, so far as we could
see, was moral and becoming; you mingled
with the people of God, spoke of occasional
delight and profit in His ordinances; and
employed your talents in service to Him.
" But of late, and specially during the past
year, there has become manifest a rapid progress towards evil. (I must beg you here to
pause, and again to look to God for grace to
weigh what I am about to say; or else wrath
will rise.)
"When you came to us in the summer, the
heavy blow fell full upon me; and I dis370
FATHER AND SON
covered how very far you had departed from
God. It was not that you had yielded to the
strong tide of youthful blood, and had fallen a
victim to fleshly lusts; in that case, however
sad, your enlightened conscience would have
spoken loudly, and you would have found your
way back to the blood which cleanseth us from
all sin, to humble confession and self-abasement, to forgiveness and to re-communion with
God. It was not this; it was worse. It was
that horrid, insidious infidelity, which had
already worked in your mind and heart with
terrible energy. Far worse, I say, because
this was sapping the very foundations of faith,
on which all true godliness, all real religion,
must rest.
" Nothing seemed left to which I could
appeal. We had, I found, no common ground.
The Holy Scriptures had no longer any authority: you had taught yourself to evade their
inspiration. Any particular Oracle of God
which pressed you, you could easily explain
away; even the very character of God you
weighed in your balance of fallen reason, and
fashioned it accordingly. You were thus
sailing down the rapid tide of time towards
Eternity, without a single authoritative guide
(having cast your chart overboard), except
371
FATHER AND SON
what you might fashion and forge on your
own anvil,-except what you might guess, in
fact.
" Do not think I am speaking in passion,
and using unwarrantable strength of words., If the written Word is not absolutely authoTritative, what do we know of God? What
more than we can infer, that is, guess,-as the
thoughtful heathens guessed,-Plato, Socrates,
Cicero,-from dim and mute surrounding
phenomena? What do we know of Eternity?
Of our relations to God? Especially of the
relations of a sinner to God? What of reconciliation? What of the capital questionHow can a God of perfect spotless rectitude
deal with me, a corrupt sinner, who have
trampled on those of His laws which were
even written on my conscience?.
" This dreadful conduct of yours I had intended, after much prayer, to pass by in entire
silence; but your apparently sincere inquiries
after the cause of my sorrow have led me to
go to the root of the matter, and I could not
stop short of the development contained in this
letter. It is with pain, not in anger, that I
send it; hoping that you may be induced to
review the whole course, of which this is only
a stage, before God. If this grace were
372
FATHER AND SON
granted to you, oh! how joyfully should I
bury all the past, and again have sweet and
tender fellowship with my beloved Son, as
of old."
The reader who has done me the favour to
follow this record of the clash of two temperaments will not fail to perceive the crowning
importance of the letter from which I have
just made a long quotation. It sums up, with
the closest logic, the whole history of the
situation, and I may leave it to form the
epigraph of this little book.
All that I need further say is to point out
that when such defiance is offered to the
intelligence of a thoughtful and honest young
man with the normal impulses of his twentyone years, there are but two alternatives.
Either he must cease to think for himself; or
his individualism must be instantly confirmed,
and the necessity of religious independence
must be emphasised.
No compromise, it is seen, was offered; no
proposal of a truce would have been acceptable. It was a case of " Everything or
Nothing"; and thus desperately challenged,
the young man's conscience threw off once for
373
FATHER AND SON
all the yoke of his "dedication," and, as
respectfully as he could, without parade or
remonstrance, he took a human being's
privilege to fashion his inner life for himself.
