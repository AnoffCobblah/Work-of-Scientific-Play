            PREFACE.

IN offering to the Profession and to the Public these memoranda of

I Ithe life and labours of a hard-working physician, extending over a

period of upwards of sixty years, think that am performing a
duty, incumbent on all, to make known experiences, which have
been neither few nor unsuccessful, in relation to the science and
art of Medicine, and may not prove uninteresting in regard to its
history.

   IBut feel that some apology is due for the long delay which

has postponed the publication to so late a period of my life. My
excuse must be the state of my health. The narrative will show
how a constitution, never robust, yet endowed with great activity
of mind and body, suffered at times from overwork, especially during
the ten years' tenure of the Professorship at University College,
and that in the busy life which followed, there was no sufficient
recovery from that overstrain, to enable me to fulfil the literary
engagements which pressed upon me. Works called for and under-
taken, for which materials had been long accumulating, were not
completed ; editions out of print were unrenewed ; and during a
period of upwards of twenty years, all available time and strength
were devoted to the cares and responsibilities of a large consulting

Ipractice.
     One work was enabled to produce, through the welcome assist-

Iance of my son Dr. Charles Theodore Williams. 1 allude to that

on ' Pulmonary Consumption,' noticed in Chap. XXXVII. It also

has been for some time out of print.

   IAt the time of my retirement, nine years ago, was too much

wearied and worn to attempt any great work. But the rest and
refreshment which God has vouchsafed to me during the interval,

Iencouraged me a year ago to commence these Memoirs, which,

through His continued mercy, have been enabled so far to com-

Iplete. Whether or not may be spared to add a second volume

to contain more strictly professional matters, some of which have

     1 This son is now, through God's mercy, recovering from a severe and pro-
longed attack of typhoid fever, (contracted at Naples), under which he has
been laid up for the last two months. He had just visited his patients under
treatment in high altitude in the Engadin.
vi PREFACE.

Inever been published, and others only partially,  leave in His

hands.

   I IWhen began this task, was so much out of the habit of
Iwriting, that fear the language of the early chapters will be found
Icurt and constrained. Egotism was unavoidable ; but what had

to say was put into as few words as possible, with little regard to

elegance of composition.

   IIn the free and independent manner in which have thought it
Imy duty to criticise public institutions, have been actuated by no

censorious or hostile feeling, but only by a sincere desire to correct

.error and abuse, and to promote the 'honourable and efficient working
of these bodies for the ends for which they were established, for

their own cr,edit, and for the public good.

     Having lately been introduced to the eminent veteran chemist

Iand philosopher, M. J. B. Dumas, Member of the Institute, who was

interested in my observations on the Sun-spots, took the oppor-

tunity of showing him my pencil reminiscences of his contemporaries

in the Academy of Sciences and at the Sorbonne ; and he recognised

the likenesses as good in all but that of Thenard, which, he says,

wants the tete de lion brow of the great chemist ; to whom M.

Dumas acted as assistant at that time, 1825. There are few sur-

Ivivors of that remote period to supply such testimony ; and ana

fortunate in finding one so distinguished.

As the work is intended for the public, as well as for the pro-

fession, it may be objected that in some parts the subjects and

language are too technical to be interesting or intelligible to the
Ifgeneral reader.
                   it be so, these may be passed over, without much

impairing the general sense of the narrative. But in these days of

expanding intelligence, there is an increasing inclination, as well as

aptitude in the public mind, to get sound elementary views in every

branch of knowledge ; and in none would such diffusion of informa-

tion be more mutually beneficial between a profession and the

public than in that of Physiology and Medicine.

THE WRITER of these memoirs was the youngest, but one, of
nine children of the Rev. David Williams, who was upwards
of forty years perpetual Curate of the Collegiate Church of
Heytesbury, in Wiltshire, and also Gustos of the Hungerford

Almshouse (for 12 old men), in which he resided. It was an

old red-brick building, consisting of a long front with two
wings, surmounted by a heavy tiled roof, with a clock and

Icupola in the centre. This was my home, until went to the

University of Edinburgh.
     My father was of a Cardiganshire family, several members

of which were eminent scholars and teachers. His eldest
brother, the Rev. John Williams, was long known as the
master of the endowed school of Ystradmeirig, near Hafod,
in which many of the best educated men of the Principality
received their first classical instruction. His son, the late
Archdeacon of Cardigan, friend of Sir Walter Scott and John
Lockhart, and author of several well-known works in history

and philology, also attained high scholastic eminence, as the

founder, and for many years Kector, of the New Academy at

Edinburgh.

My father, likewise, was for many years engaged in tuition ;

and prepared for the universities several gentlemen, who have

since attained distinction as scholars. When he ceased to

receive pupils, he still conducted the education of his sons ;

until they were transferred to public schools. Three of the

brothers fulfilled the usual routine of scholastic discipline

by going to a public school, and afterwards to an English
University. In my case my father deviated from this rule ;

he did not send me to school at all ; but allowed me to pursue

my education at home, until my entry at the Edinburgh

IUniversity at the end of 1820. In this course feel sure
Ithat he did right ; and have ever felt thankful for the
Idecision.
            made fair progress in classical studies; going

through the usual elementary books in Latin and Greek ;
Caesar's ' Commentaries,' Ovid's ' Metamorphoses,' Virgil's

I' ^Eneid ' and ' Georgics,' some of the odes of Horace, and parts

of the works of Cicero and Sallust. In Greek, did not get
beyond the ' Analecta,' ' Diatessaron,' Homer's ' Iliad,' and
Xenophon's ' Cyropaedia.' In Latin translation and com-

Iposition got on well ; through my father's plan of writing

out, and repeating backivards ; that is, rendering the original

Ifrom the translation : but never could make much hand of

Latin versification. Perhaps a few floggings at school might

Ihave inspired me.                       took no delight : they

     But in all these classical studies

were always more or less irksome; and they occupied so much

time and mental effort, that there was little opportunity for

other reading or recreation. 1 It was quite different with other

departments of knowledge. Geography, History, Biography,

INatural History, and above all, Natural Science, always found
Iinteresting ; and when not overtired with lessons, often pre-
Iferred reading any book, that could get on these subjects, to

    1 That this distaste for Latin and Greek arose from no mental inaptitude

Ifor the study of these languages, is sufficiently evident from the fact that after-

wards found less difficulty, when the topic was more interesting ; and with

Iregard to Greek, much later in life, there are few studies from which derived

so much pleasure as well as profit, as that of the Greek Testament.

idleness or play. At that period hardly any of these were

taught in boys' schools ; and very few books upon them were

Iwithin the reach of school-boys. Had been sent to school,

it is most probabte that my mind would have been engrossed

with school teachings, such as they were, school games, and

school tricks, to the exclusion of much more congenial and
Iinstructive matter.
                      do not deny the beneficial influence

which the best regulated public schools have, in disciplining

boys' minds, in correcting habits of selfishness, rubbing off

angularities of character, and in promoting a generous rivalry

of intellect, and a gentlemanly standard of social conduct ;

and as a general rule these advantages m'ay preponderate

over objections; but there are many exceptional instances,

Iwhich are more suitable for home or private tuition ; and

believe mine to have been one.

My father had a considerable library; chiefly books of

Divinity and Classics, but not a few on Science, including the

works of Priestley, and Boyle, Smith's ' Optics/ Hooper's
' Eational Eecreations,' and twenty-four volumes of ' Philo-

sophical Transactions Abridged.' These were all ransacked

for their most intelligible and interesting matter : but the

greatest advance was made, on the acquisition of several ele-

mentary books on natural science which appeared about that

time ; especially Joyce's ' Scientific Dialogues,' Mrs. Marcet's
' Conversations on Chemistry and Natural Philosophy,'

Accum's ' Chemical Amusements,' and Bingley's ' Natural

History.' Instructed and inspired by these, it was not long

Ibefore began to bring to experiment and practice the know-
ledge which I had acquired by reading. Living in a small
Icountry town, and with very limited means, was truly

attempting the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties. But

Ihaving some natural dexterity, with fondness and aptitude for

carpentering, and other tool work, succeeded in making a

variety of instruments, and in performing a good number of

experiments in natural philosophy. Before the age of fourteen

Iyears, had constructed two electrifying machines, and a

battery of Leyden jars ; a voltaic pile ; several little telescopes,

microscopes, kaleidoscopes, and aeolian harps. Having fitted

up a little laboratory with bottles, Florence flasks and stands,

                                      Bi
4 PARENTAGE AND EARLY LIFE.

Iwine and ale glasses and jars, and a few retorts, which my

father procured from London, obtained practice in chemical

manipulation, and was able to demonstrate most of the strik-

Iing phenomena of elementary chemistry, without any instruc-
tion, beyond that derived from books.   was lent by a friend

the ' System of Chemistry,' by Professor Thomas Thomson of

IGlasgow, one of the most complete works of that time ; and

from this wrote a full analysis of its contents ; and thus

became familiar with most of the facts and principles of

chemistry, so far as they were then known. The knowledge

thus acquired, proved most helpful in the commencement of

my university career ; rendering my attendance on the simple,

but admirably illustrated lectures of Dr. Hope on chemistry,

an easy and agreeable pastime, rather than a work of

labour.

Hardly so much can be said of a turn at astronomy, to

which my desire for objective knowledge impelled me, after read-

ing in the family the astronomical discourses of Dr. Chalmers.

Brothers and sisters clubbed together, and with the liberal

assistance of an uncle, we got enough money to buy a good

achromatic telescope, with astronomical powers of sixty and

eighty. With this we were able to see the belts and satellites

of Jupiter, the ring and one satellite of Saturn, the phases of

Venus and Mars, the mountains and craters of the moon, the

spots on the sun, and the appearances of several of the double

stars and nebulae. 1 A neighbouring clergyman also lent me

the use of a larger instrument, a 3^- feet achromatic by
Dollond, with rackwork adjustments, which facilitated my

amateur observations. Thus began another of my favourite

occupations ; and if it did not supply any knowledge available

in my professional career, stargazing, together with the read-

ing necessarily connected with  it,   was salutary to the mind,

                                     a
it        have this instrument still and after lapse of upwards of sixty years,;
   has been brought into requisition in my retirement under the clear skies of
   I1the Mediterranean. This early familiarity with the aspect of the heavens, and

with the management of the telescope, has proved great source of interesta
and amusement and during the last winter, the great Comet, the transit of
Venus, and variations in the sun-spots, have supplied objects of unusual

import, on which have been able to make few original observations, which
have been published in Nature.'

in exercising it in habits of careful and patient observation, and
in supplying it with vast and noble objects of contemplation. 1

     My father, perceiving that my inclinations were in pursuit
of natural knowledge more than of classical learning, forebore
to press me with so many lessons. Although his bias had
been always in favour of educating his sons in an English
university for the Church, he had already made an exception
in the case of my second brother, who was placed under a
surgeon (Dr. Brabant of Devizes), but died in the second year
of his apprenticeship. My eldest brother, William Eosser,
went from Winchester School to Oxford, where he gained first-
class honours, and became scholar, and afterwards fellow, of
Queen's. Deciding in favour of law as a profession, he ob-
tained the Vinerian scholarship, became D.C.L., and took
chambers in Lincoln's Inn, where he resided until his death
in 1871. Distinguished as his course was both at school, and
at the university, he was not successful at the bar. He pub-
lished a volume of Vinerian lectures, which were well spoken
of; but his manners were not conciliatory, and his habits so
recluse, that in later years he was lost to society. My third
brother, Thomas, went from Marlborough School to St. John's

College, Cambridge, where he obtained some exhibitions and
prizes, but only junior honours, on taking his degree. He
was my favourite brother, and most constant companion

I Ibefore left home ; and on subsequent occasions, when

visited Heytesbury : for after he was in orders, he had succes-

          had a brother, David Theodore, six years my junior,

therefore too young for mental companionship. But my
father, as advancing age rendered him less apt at boy-teaching,

used often to devolve on me the office of hearing my brother's

lessons, until he was sent to school, shortly before my departure

for Edinburgh. This brother went to Oxford, and after taking

his degree, was appointed teacher of English Language and
Literature at the New Academy of Edinburgh, of which my
cousin, Archdeacon Williams, was Eector. Theodore married

his cousin, daughter of the Eev. David Williams, who suc-
ceeded his father in the Ystradmeirig school. Afterwards

Theodore emigrated with his family to New Zealand, where

he died.

To return to my own history. My obvious predilection

Ifor the pursuit of natural history and natural science, brought

my father to the conclusion, that must be another exception

to his favourite plan ; and that medicine ought to be my pro- ,

Ifession ; and instead of wasting several years in the drudgery

of an apprenticeship, should have a course of study, extended

beyond the usual curriculum, at several medical schools,

beginning with Edinburgh (which for some years had enjoyed
the highest reputation in medicine and in science), and carried

on in London, and if possible, in one or more of the schools

Ion the Continent. My own opinion, as that of a mere boy, was

not worth much ; but need hardly say how much my incli-

nation was in favour of this plan, which held out the prospect

of escaping the distasteful thraldom of school life, and of

entering, at no distant period, on the higher career of a uni-

Iversity student, for a course of studies, of which had already

had some foretaste and enjoyment. These anticipations were
incentives to perseverance in study, and tended to deter from

frivolous pursuits and idleness.

   IBut it must not be supposed that was indifferent to the

sports and amusements of boyhood. Although diminutive in

Isize, was strong and active, and excelled all the boys of the

village in leaping and running. When my brothers returned

Ifor the holidays, enjoyed their games as much as anyone :

and during the term time, when only two of us remained at

home, we had to invent means of increasing the amusement

of our rambles in a not very interesting country. One device

which we adopted and carried to great perfection, was walking

on stilts. We always made our own stilts, and were generally

content with a height of two or three feet, which carried us

dry and clean through dirty roads, streams, and shallow

rivers ; whilst the skill required in walking, added zest to an

active and healthy exercise. My ambition prompted me to

higher attempts in this line, which were not equally commend-

Iable : made one pair of stilts with a footing twelve feet ffom the
Iground ; and mounted on these, was quite able to walk, and

to look into the upper windows of the house : but my father

very properly discouraged these presumptuous pranks. Our

walks were often rendered interesting by particular pursuits,

such as botanising and nutting in the woods : mushrooming

on the downs : fossil-hunting in the chalk and flints of the

quarries : fishing for minnows and such small fry in the

streams. The manor was too strictly preserved to allow of

superior fishing ; and for the same reason we were forbidden

shooting and other field sports ; but of course, like other

children, we had our pets of birds and animals, which it would

be too trivial to dwell on. But we also kept poultry ; and a

Ifew particulars connected therewith are worth recording.
Iused to spend a good deal of time in the poultry yard ; and

made a special study of the language of cocks, hens, and

chickens, of ducks and drakes, turkeys, geese, and, in short, of

all domestic birds and animals. Having a nice ear, and a

Iconsiderable power of mimicry, got to learn their different

notes and cries, and to imitate them well enough to influence the

creatures towards me, just as if I were one of themselves.

These brute utterances have all their meanings, and are ex-

pressive of various feelings ; whether pain or pleasure, anger

or love, fear or confidence, defiance or submission ; and are

mutually intelligible among individual animals, as words are

Iamong human beings. Well, found that by closely observing

and imitating this brute speech, with corresponding gestures
Ior movements, could get to a sort of mutual understanding
Iwith animals, and thereby influence their behaviour.

     My mother was the eldest daughter of a respectable
surgeon (whose name also was Williams), who practised
many years at Chepstow, and left other daughters and sons
who were long well known in that neighbourhood. My mother

and her sisters were educated at the school of Barleywood,
near Bristol, under the tuition of the sisters of Mrs. Hannah
More, and received instructions in reading from that excellent

lady herself ; who, strictly religious as she was, used to take
her pupils, whenever opportunity offered, to witness the acting
of Garrick, which she considered an important aid in educa-

tion. My mother was long afflicted with deafness ; even before

Iher marriage. So long as can remember, her health was

delicate ; but she bore her ailments, and the cares of a large

family, with exemplary piety and patience, and was much
endeared to us all by her tenderness and devotion to our
interests. She died in 1820, shortly before my departure for
Edinburgh, of a very painful form of ovarian dropsy ; and it

Iwas in taking my turn at her bedside, that had my first

Ielementary instruction owed to them ; especially in English

Grammar, History, French and Drawing. Later, they all took

interest in my scientific pursuits ; and when I was separated

from them, we kept up a regular correspondence in the long

letters of those days of dear postage. Two of my sisters died

early ; one shortly before, the other just after, I settled in

London. The youngest died ten years ago. The eldest was
married ; and died eight years ago at the age of eighty-six.

ILATE in the autumn of 1820, started for the long journey to

Edinburgh. Except in visits to relatives at Bath, and at
I IChepstow, had never left my home before.
                                             went first to an

uncle in London, with the intention of proceeding thence by

ship, or smack, which sailed between London and Leith : but

Iit was found that these were discontinued ; and had to get
Ias could through the long land journey, by coach, which

occupied five days ; sleeping at York, and Newcastle-on-Tyne.

At Edinburgh, I resided in the house of Dr. John Thomson ;

in the first year in John Street, Canongate ; afterwards at

Minto House, Argyll Square. He received from six to eight

I Iother pupils. We were well fed, and generally made comfort-

able ; and must say that was always treated with kindness,

by both Dr. and Mrs. Thomson, and during the whole of my

stay of four years, we never had any disagreement. It was

not so with some of the other students ; and there were many

changes of companions during my sojourn.

Dr. Thomson's aid in our studies consisted principally of

selecting the courses of lectures for our attendance, and in

private instruction in Latin and Greek. He was a fair classic ;
CLASSICS CHEMISTR Y-ANA TOMY.          ir

and had been tutor in the family of Dr. Gregory, Professor of

Medicine, and author of the ' Conspectus Medicinae.' This was

one of our books of study ; alternated with Cullen's ' Nosology,'

Celsus ' De Medicina,' and some of the works of Sydenham and

IHippocrates. My father's teaching had given me an advan-

tage over my fellow pupils in Latin ; and was glad of the

opportunity of further improvement in the knowledge of the

language, especially as the chief examinations of the University

were at that time conducted in Latin.

The subjects of the first year's study in the College, were,

Chemistry, Institutes of Medicine, Anatomy and Dissections.

Attendance on Dr. Hope's lectures on Chemistry was to me a

cause of great delight. The chief facts and principles were

almost all familiar to me from previous reading, and my own

experimentation ; but to see them illustrated on so grand a

scale, by experiments, so well devised and successful, was both

gratifying and inspiring. The lectures on Anatomy, on the

contrary, were by no means agreeable. The subject was new,

and at first disgusting ; and the lecturer, Professor Monro,

tcrfiits, drawled forth his descriptions in a manner as dry as

the bones he was demonstrating. Dr. Thomson, aware of the

unpopularity of the College professor, entered us also to an

extra-academical lecturer, Dr. Barclay, famous for his treatise

on ' Muscular Motion.' His manner was emphatic and lively

enough ; but the students, who attended his class, were such

a noisy and disorderly set, that it was difficult to study quietly
Iand profitably among them. Nor was much more successful
Iin the College dissecting room.
                                  was given a head to dissect
  Ithe most difficult part; and although I tried hard, with

little assistance from the demonstrator, made poor work of
it. In fact, I was a very little fellow ; and although alive and
Iprecocious in some things, often found myself slighted and

snubbed in the struggles of life. My progress during the first

year was quite satisfactory in all respects, except anatomy ;

and I had to make up my deficiency in subsequent years, by

a course of practical anatomy under John Lizars ; and by

making anatomical drawings myself. Since that time the

study of anatomy has been so much facilitated by admirable

plates and manuals, and by more careful and accurate methods
12 LIFE AND STUDIES IN EDINBURGH.

of teaching, that it may seem hard to understand the diffi-

culties of sixty years ago.

During the summer session, we had the lectures on Botany,

Iand Botanical excursions, which made a pleasing variation in

our studies. Then, also, began to attend hospital practice

at the Infirmary, and clinical lectures ; to which, by an
Iarrangement between my father and Dr. Thomson,
                                                 was

to have free access during my whole residence in Edinburgh.

Nor were these opportunities neglected. My visits to the

Ihospital were constant, and never missed a clinical lecture,

always taking careful notes of interesting cases and remarks.

Much has been said against teaching by lectures : some

declare that they learn better from their own reading, than

from any ex cathedra address. My experience is different.

In the case of subjects admitting of demonstration, by experi-

ments, or by appeals to the senses, in drawings, black-board

illustrations, and such objective aids, it can hardly be dis-

puted, that lectures teach better than books. But even in

Imore didactic topics have always been able to learn more

readily from a well- delivered lecture, than from reading the

same matter in a book. The living words of a clear speaker

arrest the attention, and command the thoughts, more than

the same words read in a book. I found lectures useful, not

only in the amount of information, which they conveyed, but

also as a mental exercise, suggestive of thoughts, beyond the

words of the lecturer, and not always in accordance with
Ithem.
        was, therefore, more assiduous than most students

in attendance on lectures, even beyond those prescribed in the

usual curriculum.

The system of teaching in Edinburgh is based chiefly on

full courses of lectures, delivered by the respective Professors ;

each giving four or five a week during the winter session of

five months. Attendance in my time was not compulsory,

and therefore varied with the attractive capacities of the

several lecturers. Those best attended were, on Materia

Medica (Dr. Andrew Duncan, junior) ; on Chemistry (Dr.
Hope) ; and Midwifery (Dr. James Hamilton). The lectures

on Practice of Medicine (Dr. Home) ; Anatomy and Surgery

(Dr. Monro, tertius) ; and Institutes of Medicines (Dr. Duncan,
LECTURES PROFESSORS DR. BRABANT.  13

senior), were very ill attended ; but the class-room of the

latter was always crowded, when the new assistant Professor,
Dr. W. P. Alison, took the place of Dr. Duncan (old Duncan,

Ias he was always called). Dr. Alison was always my favourite

Professor ; and not only attended, and took copious notes

of every lecture delivered by him, both on General Pathology

Iand on Clinical Medicine, but also became his pupil at the

New-town Dispensary, and with him visited patients at their
own homes in the wynds and closes of the Cowgate and

ICanongate. Thus had the advantage of the personal as

well as public instructions of the most enlightened physiologist

and physician of the Edinburgh school, who was not slow to

appreciate and encourage the zeal and devotion of his pupils.
     Having both home and companionship in Dr. Thomson's

Ihouse, had little need of visiting ; and had few acquaint-

ances out of the house. One friend, Dr. Brabant of Devizes,

was of great use to me. He had retired from an extensive
country practice, which he had carried on with great ability

and success for many years ; and he had come to Edinburgh to
take the degree of M.D., with the intention of practising only
as physician. He was a man of highly cultivated mind, and

Iagreeable manners : found his companionship and counsel

most improving ; and he became one. of my most valued
and intimate friends. He advised me most judiciously with

respect to my studies ; encouraged me by entering into my
favourite scientific occupations, and gave me judicious warn-
ings against youthful frivolities, especially in dress, to which

I Iwas too much inclined. Happily, however, was too much
Iinterested in the various studies, which was pursuing, to be

led far astray by gaiety or idleness.

    At the end of the summer of my first year, I returned

home to my family in Wiltshire for three months ; and this

Iwas my only holiday. During the remaining three years,

remained in Edinburgh continuously ; except one excursion

with an aunt and cousin to the Highlands, which I enjoyed
Iimmensely. Never having been at school, felt less need of

regular holidays. Mental occupation was my chief delight ;
and by varying the subjects, it afforded sufficient recreation

 and amusement, without much need of the diversions of
14 LIFE AND STUDIES IN EDINBURGH.

holidays. But we were not without more amusing resources.

II was fond of music ; played a little on the flute ; and when

could, practised part-singing with fellow students. Occasion-
ally we were gratified by a visit to the theatre ; and at
different times witnessed the performances of Edmund Kean,

Charles Young, Macready, Charles Kemble, the eldest
Matthews, Mrs. Henry Siddons, Misses Stephens and Paton.

These were occasions of great enjoyment ; but too expensive
to be indulged in often, and too fascinating to be compatible
with steady habits of study. Yet in moderation, theatrical

entertainments of the higher kind, are not without utility, as
affording lessons in elocution, and in the study of human
nature and of the power of dramatic art.

    IIn conformity with habits inculcated at home, was

regular in attendance on Sunday duties ; worshipping usually
at St. Paul's Episcopal Chapel ; the esteemed ministers of
which were the Kev. Archibald Alison, and the Eev. Eobert

Morehead. The former was the author of the well-known

' Essay on Taste,' and was accounted a pleasing writer. In the
pulpit he was less remarkable for the depth of his doctrines,
than for the elegance of his composition ; and especially for
the emphatic, almost theatrical, manner, in which on mount-
ing the pulpit, he recited the Lord's Prayer. Venerable in
aspect, with smooth, very white, hair, kneeling low, with up-
ward gaze, in deep-toned voice he would slowly pronounce the
words, ' Our Father ! ' then after a pause between each,

solemnly continue the petitions impressively to the end ; when
with altered voice and tone he would give out his text and go

Ithrough the sermon. Two or three times in Edinburgh, and

several times later in London, heard Dr. Chalmers, and was
much struck with the contrast of both his manner and his
delivery, with those of Mr. Alison. A man, plain in appear-
ance, and except the size of his ample forehead, inexpressive
in feature, he begins his discourse in a low tone, and with

words, more Scotch than emphatic, and with action, if any,

quite destitute of grace. Yet as the ideas flow forth, the
words swell out in significance and strength ; the features
light up ; the body and limbs are thrown into action, and
although the movements may be more forcible than grace-

ful, they all seem subordinated to the torrent of eloquence,

with which a mighty mind delivers its thoughts on the loftiest

Iof themes. Impressions from such preaching are abiding.

The liveliest recollections that have in connection with my

pastors, Mr. Alison, and his more evangelical colleague, Mr.

Morehead, are that they were the respective fathers of my most

esteemed teacher, Professor Alison ; and my dear and valued

friend, Dr. Charles Morehead.

   IIn my second year was left very much to my own discre-

tion in the choice of lectures, and in the employment of my
time; as Dr. Thomson discontinued his private lessons. In addi-

tion to attendance on the usual lectures, and at the Infirmary,

I pursued a plan of private study of subjects not professional.
I had a course of private lessons in Mathematics. After
I Ithis took up the study of Logic (Duncan's). Then went

in for Metaphysics, in the works of Locke, Brown and Stewart,
and took a glance at the ancient systems in Enfield's ' History

of Philosophy.' The Encyclopaedia Britannica, and that of

Edinburgh, supplied me with much good reading on his-

torical and other subjects. These readings were continued

through the vacations of three months in the autumn.

The library of the Eoyal Medical Society supplied me with

books ; and also with apparatus for carrying on investiga-
Itions.
         joined this society in my second year ; and found it

of great utility ; not only for the use of its valuable and

extensive library, but also in its debates, which were carried

on every week during the session ; giving its members

opportunity of public speaking and discussion. I soon took

an active part in these meetings and became intimate with

Imany of the fellows.                wras extremely nervous.

difficulty : perhaps it might have been diminished and the

weak faculty strengthened by the enforced discipline of school.

My memory for facts and events was, on the other hand, very
strong and retentive ; and the consciousness of this difference

in the functions of memory, inclined me much in favour of
phrenology, at least in its metaphysical part, which assigns
different powers of comprehension and memory for different

classes of subjects. Another cause of difficulty in public

arose a good deal from conceit, and an attempt at fine,

rather than plain, speaking ; and that for beginners, at least,

it was better to be content with simple words of conversa-

tional speech, and to devote the main attention to the subject-
matter of the discourse. This should be well considered

beforehand, and if at all complex, it should be arranged un-

der a few heads written on a card, with the addition of any

names or particular words, which may be required to assist the

memory.

The corrections and practice obtained at the meetings of

the Edinburgh Medical Society were of lasting use to me ; and

I Ialthough never succeeded much in speech-making, yet

acquired fluency and clearness in delivery, which qualified me

for the office of Lecturer in after life.

      The recollections of this Society especially call to mind the

Imany friends with whom was intimate at Edinburgh, none
Iof whom, so far as know, now survives, except Dr. Henri

Clermont Lombard of Geneva. He, with his German asso-

ciate, Ferdinand Becker, was among those, who took the most

prominent part in the debates, although they had to speak in

a foreign language. Becker died early ; but with Lombard
my intimacy was renewed in Paris in 1825-6 ; and it has
been my happiness several times since to visit my dear old
friend at his home at Geneva, where he has achieved a long

Icareer of the highest usefulness and honour. Of my contem-

poraries and friends who have passed away, may mention the
names James Lomax Bardsley of Manchester, Alexander
Hannay of Glasgow, James Hope of London, Charles Holland

                      was also intimate with Alexander

Urquhart, and John Booth James. The former died in India ;

I do not know what became of the latter.
    Of the professors under whom I studied not one now sur-

vives. Sir Robert Christison was the last to depart, full of

years and good works. He had just begun his career in my

time, as professor of Medical Jurisprudence ; and I was one of

three, who formed his whole class in 1823, which was before

attendance on that chair was made compulsory. He was then

laying the foundation of his knowledge in toxicology, which he

had lately been studying under Orfila. He was an industrious

and careful compiler, and made his lectures useful by the

amount of information which they contained : but he seemed

to me to have little capacity for original research, or to be

profound hi either physiology, or medicine. Yet he held his

ground steadily, among colleagues more talented and turbulent

than himself, and fulfilled a long and honourable career.

     The inefficiency of the Chair of the Practice of Medicine
in the College drove many students to the lectures of Dr. John

Thomson, in the extra- academical school of Surgeon's Square.

He had been Professor of Military Surgery ; and had dis-

tinguished himself by several publications, especially that on

Inflammation, in which he developed the views of John
Hunter, with additional observations of his- own. He was

one of the first to point out the share which obstruction of the

Iminute blood-vessels has in the process of inflammation ; a

point which twenty years later, was led to trace to its chief

cause, increased production and adhesive action of the white

corpuscles of the blood. (Gulstonian Lectures, 1841.) His

lectures were attractive, not only by their scientific tone, and

from his earnestness and eloquence, but also through the
illustrations of disease which they exhibited, in numerous

coloured drawings of morbid anatomy, from the pencil of Dr.

Carswell (originally an artist), whom Dr. Thomson sent to

Paris for this express purpose. These gave me the first insight
into the appearances presented by the results of disease ; and

further encouraged my turn for drawing, which I had already

found most useful in my studies, not only of healthy anatomy ;

but also of diseases of the skin ; having endeavoured to copy

several of Willan and Bateman's coloured plates. But in-

teresting as these lectures undoubtedly were, and enlivened by

his vehement denunciations against the abuses of medicine

Ithrough drugging and over-dosing, gained from them very

little knowledge of what the practice of medicine ought to be.

In fact, Dr. Thomson was not a believer in the efficacy of medi-

cine, as then practised. He is reported to have said to a

homo3opath who was introduced to him : ' My dear sir, we

I Ishall not disagree much in our practice : you give very little

medicine, and give none at all ! ' But believe that such

expressions of incredulity were rather protests against the

wards took in promoting the establishment of a Professorship

of General Pathology in the University, and the success with

which he performed its duties, showed that he had hopes of the

future of medicine, however sceptical he may have been of its

present efficiency.

     A remarkable contrast in this respect was Dr. James
Hamilton, Jun., Professor of Gynaecological Medicine, (as it
is now called.) He had a remedy for every disease ; and a
rationale for every remedy. He was very popular as a teacher ;

and was said to be remarkably successful in practice. But he

was not a favourite with his colleagues. On my mentioning

It was currently reported that Professor Duncan, Jun., ex-

pected to succeed his father in the Chair of Institutes of
Medicine, and had been working up this subject ; but the old

Professor lived on, reading lectures written fifty years before,

discussing ' the views of Professor Gaubius, and the recent
experiments of Baron Haller.' So that when Young Duncan
was appointed Professor of Materia Medica, he introduced

much of the matter prepared for the other course. No doubt

the lectures were enriched thereby ; but it was an embarras de

richesses ; and he was unable to get through the subjects
announced hi his prospectus. He was an earnest, consci-

entious man, and with much emotion expressed his regret in

Ithe last lecture, at not having completed his course to his own

satisfaction. Nevertheless profited much by his teaching,
and by the spirit of progress, which he encouraged. He was
one of the first in this country to study and practise auscul-

tation ; and hi his lectures on the medical uses of plants he
adopted the natural classification of Jussieu, of which we learnt
nothing from Dr. Graham, the Professor of Botany, who con-
fined his teaching to the artificial system of Linnaeus.

     Dr. Hope's lectures were very popular ; although delivered

in rather a pompous manner, they were rendered attractive

by the grand scale and successful performance of their experi-
mental demonstrations. But they were very elementary, and
chiefly confined to inorganic chemistry. Even in this, he

was slow to adopt the innovations of modern science. For

Iinstance, he continued to uphold the compound nature of

chlorine. When attempted to interest him in the investi-

Igations which had been making on respiration and animal

heat, he returned my paper with the remark, that the subject
was quite proper for a young gentleman's thesis, but that he
declined to enter into the subject. Very different was the
conduct of Dr. Alison, when the same matter came into his

hands, as my inaugural dissertation, before my examination
for the degree. Undeterred by its unusual length (upwards

of 100 pages) he carefully read it ; and after I had passed my

chief examination, he sent for me, to discuss some of the
details, and expressed his entire concurrence in its conclu-

sions.

     Permeability of Membranes to Gases Action of Oxygen on Blood and
     Tissues Origin of Animal Heat Correction of Brodie's Experiments.

I HAD not proceeded far in my medical studies before chemical

physiology became my favourite pursuit. The analogies which
the observations of Priestley and Lavoisier had discovered be-
tween combustion and respiration ; and the hypotheses framed
by Black and Crawford to explain the relation of the two
processes to the production of animal heat, seemed inviting
advances towards the understanding of -a subject, which had
hitherto been mysterious and unintelligible. But difficulties
arose in the application of this chemical view of the origin of

animal heat. If, as Black supposed, it was caused by the
union of oxygen with carbon in the lungs, these organs ought

to be the seat of the highest temperature, whereas observation
proves that animal heat is evolved wherever the blood circu-

lates, and that if the lungs are warmer than other parts of the
body, it is only to the amount of one or two degrees. Then
came the proposition of Dr. Crawford founded on experiment,

that arterial blood has a greater capacity for heat than venous ;
so that the heat becomes latent in the lungs, to be evolved in
the course of the circulation, as the blood changes to venous.
The accuracy of Dr. Crawford's estimate (' On Animal Heat ')
of the respective specific heats of arterial and venous blood, was
questioned by Legallois, who computed that were Dr. C.'s
figures correct, there would be intense cold, instead of heat,

produced by arterialisation. Careful experiments made by

Dr. John Davy (' Phil. Trans.' 1814) proved that Dr. Crawford

had greatly over-estimated the differences ; and that the

capacity of arterial blood was so little above that of venous, as

to afford no explanation of the little increase of temperature

in the lungs, if union of the oxygen with carbon takes place in

Ithe very act of respiration.

     But had to point out several other objections to the

Black-Crawford view of the relation of respiration to animal

heat. That view had been adopted and defended with much
ingenuity by Mr. W. Ellis, whose treatise on Eespiration was

then the most recent. My essay, first read and discussed at

the Eoyal Medical Society, and afterwards published as a

thesis, was entitled, ' On the Blood, and its Changes by Eespi-

ration and Secretion.' l It will suffice here to give a brief
analysis of the parts which relate to respiration. Mr. Ellis

maintained, that one function of the lungs is to exhale or

secrete carbon from the blood, by a vital process, whilst their

Imechanical action supplies air to carry it off in the form of

carbonic acid. Against this view opposed, not only the

objection above referred to 1, that the lungs would be then

the seat of calorification but, 2, that it is contrary to all

physiological analogy of secreting organs, to suppose that they

can separate from the blood an elementary matter, like carbon ;

and 3, it is equally opposed to chemical analogy, that the

Icarbon, so secreted and separated, could combine with oxygen
at the temperature of the body.  stated several other objec-

tions to this view ; and showed how it failed to account for the

many well-ascertained facts in relation to blood and air out of

the body.

   IThe view which found to be most in conformity with the

chemical and physiological knowledge of the day, was that of

the absorption of oxygen by the blood, originally proposed by

Lagrange, and advocated by Hassenfratz, but receiving no

countenance from any recent authors, either in this country or

abroad. It required, in fact, further investigation and exten-

sion to make it equal to the wide and important problem in

Ihand. Availing myself of such additional knowledge, shaped

the statement of the theory in the following propositions.

1. The difference in composition between arterial and

venous blood consists chiefly in this, that the former contains

an additional quantity of oxygen, and the latter of carbonic

acid, chemically united with it ; the affinity subsisting between

the blood and oxygen, being more powerful than that between

blood and carbonic acid.

2. The oxygen gas of the respired air, pervading the walls

of the pulmonary vessels, displaces, by virtue of its superior

affinity, an equal bulk of carbonic acid gas, and thus converts

venous into arterial blood.

3. In the course of the circulation, the oxygen thus ab-

sorbed, gradually attracts carbon from the proximate principles

of the blood, and uniting with produces heat and by thus;

                                 the change, by which venous is converted into arterial blood ;
                                 and a leading argument in its favour, is that it can be imitated,

                                 by exposing venous blood to oxygen, or to air, out of the body ;
                                 which produces the same change of colour, from dark red to

                                 bright crimson, which takes place when venous blood becomes

                                 arterial. By reference to my own and the experiments of

                                 Iothers, was enabled to prove that this change of colour,

                                 although affecting chiefly the red corpuscles, requires the pre-
                                 sence of serum, or of some analogous liquid, such as milk,
                                 or diluted white of egg, for its production ; this being the

                                 medium through which the absorbed oxygen is transferred
                                 to the red particles. Further, in opposition to the asser-

                                 tion of Mr. Ellis to the contrary, I proved by experiment,

                                 that the changes take place both in the colour of the blood,
                                 and in the composition of the air around when the blood

                                     enclosed within an animal membrane, such as rabbit's

                                 bladder. The most conclusive experiment was the following
                                 1,200 grains of venous blood in rabbit's bladder (which,
                                 when dry, weighed 5-5 grains) was suspended in receiver
                                 containing 100 cubic inches of atmospheric air, standing over
                                 mercury. The blood within the bladder soon assumed florid
                                 hue. After two days the air was analysed, and had acquired

the bladder. The change in the colour of the blood, by the

air acting through a membrane, had long before been proved,
by the observations of Priestley, John Hunter, and Goodwyn :

but this was the first decisive proof of a corresponding change,

in the air outside the membrane.

No part of these early observations has been so amply

confirmed by researches subsequently made, as these, in which

I endeavoured to establish the permeability of animal mem-
Ibranes to gases. In fact this gaseous pervasion, which had

here proved to take place with regard to cases immediately

bearing on the subject, was afterwards shown by Dr. Mitchell

of Philadelphia, to be the result of a general power of pene-

trativeness, which both gases and liquids possess towards

solids, and towards each other ; and which seems to be allied

with some of the simplest and most essential properties of

matter. The further development of the law of diffusion of

gases through the intervention of a membrane or diaphragm,

which we owe to the researches of Professor Graham, has

removed all remaining difficulties connected with the subject :

but this was a later discovery, and is beyond the matter in hand,

ago, in supporting views on the chemistry of respiration,

have imagined. It may be derived from the decomposition of

some of the proximate constituents of the blood to effect

which, two chemical affinities would assist one between the

oxygen and a portion of the carbon of one of the animal

principles of the blood, and the other between the remaining

constituents of this principle, to form a new one, containing

exposed to each other's action in proximate contact, with no

influence, mechanical or chemical, to prevent then* union.'
When it is considered that the preceding passage was written
in 1823, it may be allowed to have anticipated by many years
some of the views of Dumas and Liebig with regard to the
changes in the blood through respiration. But annual
chemistry had not sufficiently advanced to suggest the later
bold generalisation of Liebig, that the fuel for respiration is
supplied, rather from the hydrocarbon of the food and of the

blood, than from the higher animal constituents.
     The essay, in its second part, discusses the subject of the

origin of animal heat. Heat must be generated by the union
of oxygen and carbon known to take place in the body ;
whether enough to account for all the heat is further con-

sidered ; and the writer suggests that heat may be generated
also from other changes taking place in the body, such as the
conversion of blood- constituents into urea, uric acid, and car-

bonate of ammonia, decaying or consuming processes like
that of combustion, as in the heating in putrefaction and

fermentation.

      Then follow remarks on Brodie's experiments, supposed to
prove that artificial respiration will not maintain the heat of
an animal killed by decapitation : but it is shown that the
animal heat was not observed closely enough in these experi-
ments; for on more accurate trials it was raised again and

again, by carefully conducted artificial respiration : which is

contrary to the results obtained by Brodie. Further I proved

by experiments, that the animal heat could be raised by using
galvanism, in addition to artificial respiration. The matter
is too technical for further details here ; but it may be referred
to in another volume.

IN the autumn of 1824, my fourth year in Edinburgh, I

received my degree of M.D. At that time there were no such

honorary distinctions, to mark the merits of the graduates,

as are common in other universities, and have more recently

been properly introduced at Edinburgh : so we were fain to

be content with the verbal compliments of our examiners, as

we passed to be ' capped ' by the Principal. After an affec-
Itionate parting with the friends in whose house had so long
Iresided,
           started, in company with two fellow-graduates,

Dr. Chaffey and Dr. James, for a pedestrian tour through

Ithe Perthshire Highlands. After three years of pretty

constant study, very thoroughly enjoyed the holiday ; and

began to try my hand at sketching the scenery of Loch

Katrine. IAt Glasgow, called on Dr. T. Thomson, Professor of

Chemistry ; who had been long my Magnus Apollo in chemistry.

I presented him my thesis, expressing my obligations for the
Iaid which his works had afforded me ; and received as

much civility as could be expected by a raw young graduate,

without introduction.

     On my return to my home at Heytesbury, although

Ilegally qualified, had no intention of practising, except gra-

tuitously among the poor ; but hoped to continue my studies

at other schools, for at least two years longer : this my Father

liberally enabled me to do ; 'although the claims of his large

family made economy an essential consideration.

My family had been intimate with Dr. Fowler of Salisbury,

an eminent provincial physician ; and he introduced me

Ito Mr. (afterwards Sir Benjamin) Brodie, and Dr. Maton,

both Wiltshire men, from whom received much kindness

and encouragement. Brodie was particularly interested in

my experiments on respiration and animal heat, although

in them I had ventured to criticise and correct his prior
Iexperiments on the same subjects. Finding that was well

acquainted with his researches on the action of poisons,

of that advantageous proposal ; and by entering at once at

St. George's Hospital secured a standing and connection which

might have greatly forwarded my prospects in life. But the

fees of the London Hospitals were very high ; and what I had

seen of their medical practice and teaching, did not compare

Ifavourably with the fuller clinical instruction, that had been

in the habit of receiving in Edinburgh : but above all, the

greater attraction of the Parisian Hospitals and Schools of

beyond the present season.  therefore merely visited the

different hospitals at times ; and had the opportunity of

observing the personal and professional characteristics of

eminence to prove attractive.

used to meet together for the purpose, not only of discuss-

ing professional topics, but also, and especially, for self-

defence and protection against the restrictions and usurpa-

admitted them to practice, only under the designation of

Licentiates (Permissi). It would take too much space to

explain this matter fully ; but there is reason to think that
their proceedings were instrumental in leading to reforms
in the by-laws and proceedings of the College, by which

its partial and exclusive character became modified and

better suited to fulfil the intentions of its establishment and

Ithe wants of society. Among those whom met at these

gatherings, I remember Dr. Birkbeck, Dr. Mann Burrows, Dr.

Uwins, Dr. Clutterbuck, Dr. A. T. Thomson, and Dr. Eoberts.

Somerville, Dr. George Gregory, Dr. Neil Arnott, joined the

enjoyment, from their novelty, as well as their superiority to
anything of the kind which had come in my way before.

too had their charm ; and my fondness for them might have

tempted me too far, had not my limited means, as well as the
Iclaim of more serious pursuits, held me back.

Iguide my conduct ; for although outwardly conformed to
Ithe church observances, in which had been brought up, and

avoided vicious habits, yet my heart was still worldly and not

under the Divine influence of the Light of Life. It was not

until some years later, that it pleased God to reveal Himself
to me in Christ, as The Way, The Truth, and The Life, and

as The Preciousness, ('H T /////;) ' far above all that the world

and its sensuous, or even its intellectual, enjoyments, can

IAT Midsummer, 1825, went to Paris, by way of South-

ampton and Havre ; halting a few days at the latter town to
explore the scenery and quaint architecture of Honfleur,
Harfleur, and other places in the neighbourhood. To me who
had never before been abroad, the novelties of the Normandy
dresses with high caps and gay cotton prints, men's coloured
blouses, and great sabots, were amusing, and not less so the
wonderful jabber of patois in the markets, and the strange
look of the parti-coloured houses, with their high roofs and
 stuck-up gables. But my ignorance of the colloquial language
 marred my enjoyment, and my want of companionship drove
 me into venting my descriptions and impressions in letters to
 my friends at home.

      From Havre to Eouen was a pleasant and refreshing trip
 in a steamer : but such a contrast was the journey from
 Rouen to Paris by diligence ! as much a contrast as it would
 be with the present quick and clean transport by rail.
 The high-roads in France at that time were of great width,
 with an elevated road of rough pavement in the centre.
 On either side was a space of bare ground, hardly ever re-
30 LIFE AND STUDIES IN PARIS.

paired ; and therefore full of mud and holes in wet weather,

and of dust, from six to twelve inches thick, in dry. In wet

weather these were impassable, and the diligence was com-

pelled to go on the rough pavement ; but in dry weather the

dust was less of an impediment, and heavy as it must have

been, the drivers generally preferred the soft road to the hard.

The dust seemed never to be thought of, but to be accepted

as a necessary part of travelling. So when the lumbering van,

called a diligence, with three compartments below, and the high

driving seat, the banquette, and a mountain of luggage above,

was dragged through this dust by from six to eight horses all

jingling with bells, at no very slow pace either, it can be

imagined in what a cloud we travelled from one end of the

journey to the other. Coming from England as I was, where

the stage coaches were so trim and bright in their equipments,

cleaned up and polished every day, this total disregard of

dust and dirt on both harness and vehicles did astonish me

not a little. In fact in those times, no one ever thought of
cleaning public diligences or harness ; and if the postilions

made an upper show of smartness in their laced hats and

livery jackets, their huge jack boots below, were generally

assimilated to the dingy hue of the dirty equipage.

   IAloft on the banquette of this diligence, made my entrance
I Iinto Paris ; and, fatigued as was with dust and heat, have

not forgotten the impression produced on first viewing from

the Barriere de 1'Etoile, the chateau of the Tuileries, with its

gilded domes above its gardens, at the end of the grand avenue

of the Champs-Elysees, all lighted up by the setting sun. After

I Ihaving seen the entrance to other capitals and great cities of

Europe, must say still, that have seen none to equal in

effect, that of Paris at that time. Now, alas ! the Tuileries

is dismantled ; but still when seen from the west, the domes

and great buildings of Paris form  a finer spectacle  to  approach
than those of any other city that
                                   I know.

But the grandeur of the Paris of that time was more

limited to the first approach, and to its great palaces and

public buildings, than that of Paris of the present day. The
Tuileries, Louvre, and Palais Eoyal, the quays of the Seine,

with the Chamber of Deputies on the other side, and the
PARIS UNDER CHARLES X.  31

dome of the Invalides behind and the picturesque towers of

Notre Dame rising above the vista of the river ; the streets of
Eivoli, Castiglione, and De la Paix with the Place Vendome,
constituted the sole glory of the city. With the exception of

the Palace of Luxembourg, and a few other fine buildings
scattered here and there, the rest of Paris remained much in
the dirt and darkness of past ages. The streets were narrow

without trottoir, all roughly pitched, and sloping to the centre,

along which ran a foul gutter, and dimly lighted with oil

lamps, hung aloft by cords ; consequently very dark at night,

except where there were shops, which were adopting the
modern illumination of gas. The bad smells, encountered
everywhere, indicated the absence of all effective drainage :
and the constant prevalence of diarrhoea and fever, especially

among new-comers, may now be fairly referred to that cause ;
although at that time none of the doctors recognised it as a

source of disease. The houses of the old streets were generally
lofty, but irregularly built, with many storeys and numerous
small apartments. The better class of houses had a courtyard
and sometimes a little garden, .with blank walls to the street,

which did not improve their cheerfulness. In strong contrast
to all this, the gay part of Paris, the boulevards, the Palais
Royal, and a few principal streets and passages, were full of
life and bustle; and such displays of finery and fashion, of in-
genuity and cleverness, of taste and elegance, of cheapness and
extravagance, and of sensuality and licentiousness, as were
probably unequalled in any other city. This was under the
dynasty of the Bourbons, the reigning king being Charles X.

ISeveral times saw him, parading the streets in religious pro-

cessions, with his remarkably vacant expression of counte-
nance, showing his teeth, as if to look pleased, but turning

 his head neither to the right nor to the left, to manifest any
.sympathy with his subjects on either side. There was no
 cheering : perhaps that would have been contrary to etiquette

 towards one who was king by Divine Right : but his unpopu-
 larity was obvious ; and it was no surprise to me a few years
 after to hear of his deposition.

      The transformation which Paris has undergone since that
 time is quite marvellous. Not only in the perfect paving, cleans-

ing, and brilliant lighting of its streets, the extension of hand-

some boulevards, in place of the close and filthy tenements of

the old town, the placing of beautiful and well-kept gardens in

every available space, but also in the greater decency and out-

ward morality of places of public resort, which used to be open

marts of unblushing depravity. At my first visit, the Champs-

Ely sees in the summer were the scene of a perpetual fair ; for

the French must have gaiety and amusement : but like in the

country roads, the dust lay many inches thick on the ground,

and no one ever thought of watering or removing it. Conse-

quently the colour of the trees in the Champs-Elysees, was

rarely discernible ; and garments and wares got a liberal coat-

ing. Now, all this ground is converted into beautiful gardens,

well watered and kept in the highest order.

     My first study on arriving in Paris was to master the

Ilanguage ; and came thus early, long before the schools and
hospitals were open, to accomplish that object. I could read

and cheaper quarters in the Faubourg St. Germain No.

well taken care of by an old soldier and his wife and step-

daughter, who used to call me 'L'enfant dela maison.'                                   had

a  good-sized bedroom on the rez de chaussee, for which paid

forty francs a month. They supplied me with breakfast, ex-

cellent cafe au lait, and three flutes (like the croissants of the

present day, but straight) for twelve sous.  usually dined at

mitting the yellow and red, just as opal glass does. The

pearly iridescence of a tendinous expansion on a muscle

depends on the power of minute fibrils to decompose light, in

a way that it is the province of optics to explain. On a late

occasion, my old friend of this period, Dr. Leighton, intro-

duced me to his son, the present distinguished President of

Ithe Royal Academy ot Arts, Sir Frederick Leighton ; and

endeavoured to persuade him that there ought to be a pro-

fessor of Natural Philosophy in that Institution to teach the

students of painting something of the laws of light and colour,

in relation both to the objects, which they have to study, and

also to the materials, and the manipulation, by which they

have to represent them. The Academy admits the need of

having a Professor of Perspective, which relates to size, form,

and distance, one department of optics ; but with regard to

light and shade, reflection, transmission, refraction, aberra-

tion, absorption, and decomposition of light, and production,

combination, harmony, discord, and contrast of colours each

and all of which are factors in the art and practice of painting

the student, if he is taught anything, is taught only empiri-

cally, as a matter of custom or authority, rather than on any

scientific basis. And when we come to closely examine the

paintings of different artists, even the most eminent, we find

not only various modes of treating the same subject, but often

more or less traces of uncertain or ineffective work, vitiating

the effect which they intend to produce, and marring the
Iperfectness of the imitation of Nature.
                                          could add much
more on this subject : but this is not the place ; and I must

apologise for so long a digression from what belongs to the

Ihistory of my youth.          was joined by several of my

former fellow-students at Edinburgh; and we often had

pleasant companionship in visiting the Jardin des Plantes,

Pere la Cflaise, St. Cloud, Versailles, and other objects of

interest in or near Paris. They, and others afterwards, made

up a pretty numerous British party of advanced students,

who attended the hospitals and classes together, when the

season began. It is pleasant to record their names, although

very few survive to the present day. Robert Young, after-

(nephew of Sir Humphry Davy) ; Charles Foster Barham of

George's Hospital, and his friend, A. Fisher ; Frederick

Leighton ; Thomas Wise ; Henri Lombard of Geneva ; Edwin

Harrison ; and James Crawfurd Gregory, son of the celebrated

Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh. The last three were my

most constant companions in the hospitals, remaining after

the others had left Paris.

   I had letters of introduction to professors and other per-

sons of consideration ; but of these, two only produced any

result worthy of record. One was to Professor Majendie,

whose reputation, in connection with Experimental Physiology,

was then in its zenith. He received me affably, speaking in

English, and invited me to attend his matinees for physio-

logical observation and discussion. But they were held on

ISundays, and at the time of the morning service ; and as
Irespected the observance of the Sabbath, as had been taught
Ifrom childhood, did not avail myself of the invitation. 1 The

temptation was great, as it would have given me the oppor-

tunity of taking part in work, and with men, in which my
Ireading had especially interested me : but later
Iregret my decision.                                                did not

                      afterwards attended M. Majendie's

course of Experimental Physiology; and found it very

instructive, and for the most part not deserving of the impu-

1 Although it is a question among Christians whether the literal observance

of a sabbath is enjoined by the New Testament, there seems to me to be no

doubt that the appropriation of a day of rest to the spiritual service of God,

and to the refreshment of the bodies and souls of men, is a blessed privilege,
Iinculcated in the law of Divine love too plainly to be set aside.

another opportunity to recur to this subject : but lest it should seem that I
Imake a merit of my conduct in this instance, would record another, later
in life, in which I was a delinquent. I was travelling on a Sunday from

London to my wife's cottage near Chepstow. My fellow-traveller in the train

was a former pupil ; and he set to work to interest me in a railway in the

Forest of Dean, in which he was concerned, and induced me to take a large
Inumber of shares. The undertaking, although promising, did not prosper :

yet under the advice of an eminent firm of solicitors, was persuaded to in-

crease my holdings, which I did eventually to the amount of upwards of

12,0001. It was all lost. Such was the end of a worldly transaction undertaken

on a Sunday.          P2

tations of wanton cruelty which have been brought against
Ihim; yet
           did feel that there was, on the part of the

operators, a want of that humane anxiety to spare all

unnecessary animal suffering, which has guided, and I feel

sure, ever will guide, British physiologists in their investi-

gations.

     Another introductory letter was more successful in its
results, by making me acquainted with Dr. W. F. Edwards,

author of one of the most important physiological works of
that day : ' De 1'Influence des Agens Physiques sur la Vie.'

He was of English family, a native of one of the Oceanic

Islands, but became naturalised in France. He read my

thesis with discriminative appreciation ; and gave me encour-
agement and useful advice in many matters. He introduced

me to the Institute of France, where the Academy of Sciences
held its meetings. To these we used frequently to resort ;
and it was most interesting to see the great men of science,

whose names were so familiar ; and later, when the language

became more familiar, to listen to their discourses. Among

these, the following recur to my recollection: La Place,
Alex. Von Humboldt, Cuvier, Gay-Lussac, Arago, Ampere,
Vauquelin, Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, Thenard, De Blainville,

Dupin.
    In my early visits to the salle of the Institute, not under-

Istanding enough of the language to profit by listening, had

the audacity to take the opportunity of improving my drawing

Ifaculty, by sketching likenesses of these savans ; and rude

though these attempts were, succeeded in some instances

sufficiently to render them quite recognisable by my friends.

Made at a time, long before photographs were thought of,

and when outline and profile drawing was seldom applied to
portraits, these original pencillings may not be altogether

worthless, and may help to relieve the monotony of verbal

narration.

   IAt the end of this summer, attended a popular course of

Lectures on Astronomy, by Professor Arago, at the Obser-

vatoire, beyond the garden of the Luxembourg. They were
delivered in the open air, and were made attractive by his

Gascon vivacity and clever illustrations.

    IBefore the summer was over, began to take lessons in

Italian, which my knowledge of Latin rendered much easier
than French : but when the studies of the winter session

I Ibegan, had no time to prepare for my Italian master : so

got him to give me instead, instructions on the guitar, which
were a mere recreation for the hour, without occupying further
time.

     With the hope of improving my knowledge of the language,

I paid several visits to theatres at this time ; and at the Theatre
IFran9ais witnessed the acting of the most famous tragedians,

Talma and Madame Duchesnois. Talma's articulation was so

Idistinct, and his voice so sonorous, that had little difficulty in

understanding him, and appreciating the power of his acting :

Ialmost swore at me, because objected to be called Blaise,

instead of Blasius, 1 when he asked my name : so much for
his temper. But he was most courteous to Sir Astley Cooper,
who visited, him about that time. Eoux and Boyer, the sur-

geons of La Charite, were remarkable contrasts to one another.

IKoux, tall, spare, very quick in his movements, and rapid in

his utterance; Boyer, very stout, and think short, and
slow and drawling in his speech. They were both spoken
of by the French as first-rate surgeons ; but the opinion
of the disciples of Abernethy and Lawrence was not so
favourable.

    I accompanied Baron Larry (the celebrated surgeon of

Napoleon) in one of his visits at the Val de Grace Hospital ;

    I1 was called Charles and James after uncles ; and my Father, who was a
Istaunch Tory, to avoid the supposition that was named after Charles James
IFox, who was the foremost Whig when came into the world, added the name
Blasius, after the saint on whose day I was born.

and have a painful recollection of the mode in which he exhi-

bited his method of cupping. After exhausting the glass with
burning cotton, the incisions were made by drawing a razor
deliberately, and artistically, in a cross-bar pattern, across the
flesh, on which the exhausted cup was again applied. The
patient endurance of the soldier equalled the cruel sangfroid of
the operator.

THE commencement of the session of the Schools and Hospitals
inaugurated our systematic winter work. After due considera-

Ition, resolved to make the hospital of La Charite and the

clinique of Laennec, the chief field of my work. His visit
was from ten to twelve in the forenoon, giving ample time for
the examination of patients, and the demonstration of the
signs of auscultation to the students. M. Laennec at the
bedside always spoke in Latin, to avoid alarming the patients
by the description of their maladies ; and also for the benefit
of many foreigners attending the clinique, who might not
understand French. The visit was terminated by a clinical
lecture in French ; unless there was a post-mortem examina-
tion, which he superintended, with the safeguard of a long
pair of forceps in his hand, and the free use of chloride of lime
in the room. He was always fearful of infection, and was not
aware that he was already consumptive. He died of phthisis
little more than a year after. Yet although very thin, and
sometimes becoming exhausted with long exertion, his vivacity

and quickness of perception and intelligence were unimpaired,
and showed the integrity of those wonderful powers of observa-

tion and reflection, by which he had become the discoverer of

a new system and a new art.
      We counted ourselves fortunate in thus having the personal

instructions of the great master, when most matured by the

latest observations and practice. It was surprising how little

he was valued by French students. Those who attended his
cliniquo were chiefly foreigners ; and at his lectures on Medi-

cine at the College of France, there was only a sprinkling of
his own countrymen. They were attracted more by the im-

petuous Broussais, who captivated them by a grand idea a

sweeping hypothesis, without troubling them with the details
of objective facts, or careful observation. Broussais generally
ascribed diseases to inflammation; and his treatment lay
chiefly in different modes of blood-letting and starvation.

I soon found that Laennec had a bias, from his opposition of

these views, to go to the other extreme, and deny the existence
of inflammation, where it really exists. Andral took an

eclectic view of the question ; and guided by Laennec's aus-

cultation, (only without the stethoscope), compared with the
investigations of pathological anatomy, succeeded in giving a

more rational and complete view of the processes of disease,

than had been attained by either Broussais or Laennec before

him. It was my good fortune -to be in a position to profit

also by his labours, at the same time that I was attending the

wards of Laennec.
     M. G. Andral (or as he was commonly called, Andral, Fils)

was not at that time physician to the hospital ; he was, like
myself, a student attending the clinique of M. Lerminier, one
of the physicians who had the largest number of patients, and
who made his visit at seven A.M., without, as may be supposed
at that hour, any large following of students. But this was
the field, from which Andral collected the materials of his
' Clinique Medicale ; ' and as M. Lerminier left to him the
entire management of the post-mortem examinations, he was
enabled to conduct his observations in the most conclusive
manner. This was my great school of pathological anatomy ;

and in the eight or nine months of my attendance, I gained

more knowledge than could have been obtained by the same
number of years in the hospitals of our own country. But it
required no little zeal and resolution to persevere in this
work. We had to rise long before daylight ; and endure the
winter cold, in wards and offices without fire ; and then return
shivering to breakfast between eight and nine. My friends,

                M. G. ANDKAL, Professeur de 1' Anatomic Pathologique, &c.

Lombard of Geneva, and Edwin Harrison, were my most
constant companions in this arduous work ; with only two or
three French students in addition.

     When M. Andral completed his work, and ceased to attend,

I used to go round with Dr. Chomel at the same early hour.

IHe was a fair auscultator ; and a sensible physician ; and

found his clinical remarks and lectures very instructive.

In the same ward, we often saw a tall solemn man with

spectacles, diligently taking notes alone, not accompanying
the physician. This was M. Louis, collecting materials for his

elaborate work on Phthisis, which established his reputation

for statistics ; these he held to be the only proper basis of

medicine. In that line he became famous ; but he was equally

remarkable for the gloominess of his predictions, and the

inefficiency of his practice.

Although Andral was not yet appointed to any hospital,

he was Professeur agrege, and gave lectures at the Eco& de

Perfectionnement on Pathological Anatomy, which were well

attended and highly interesting. They took place in the

evening, and we went to them after dinner to finish the day's

work.

    Besides his clinique at La Charite, Laennec held the pro-

Ifessorship of Systematic Medicine in the College of France.

attended his lectures there also ; and although they were not
Ifirst-rate, took notes of them in Latin : for finding the study of
IFrench and Italian was making me forget my Latin, I resorted
to this expedient to regain it.  have lately found a book of

these notes, containing also some of the pencil sketches in

Iwhich endeavoured to preserve likenesses of my old teachers.

The most distinguished of these were professors at the Sor-

Ibonne ; and in the afternoons found time to attend several

during this winter.

The Lectures on Chemistry were delivered by M. Thenard

(well known by long association with Gay-Lussac) red-faced

and uncouth not attractive enough to retain me long. It

was otherwise with the course on Physique, by Messrs. Gay-

Lussac and Pouillet. The former gave the impression of

knowledge and ability ; but as a lecturer, he was far surpassed
by his colleague, M. Pouillet, who was eloquent and clear, and

made both his demonstrations and his explanations delightful

to his large audience.

Another admirable lecturer at the Sorbonne, was M. de

Blainville, Professor of Comparative Anatomy, whose course
I Icame on during the spring.

of him : but really his vivid descriptions and rapid illustrations

Ion the black board, kept pens and pencils so busy, that we had
no time for anything else.    never knew a lecturer so clever

at the black board. Sir Charles Bell showed his artistic skill

in this way ; but then he did it in a deliberate, and rather

pompous manner ; as if pausing, in admiration of his work.

But De Blainville drew as fast as he uttered his words ; and

on the completion of the last sentence and the finishing
stroke, he would deliver himself of a concluding ' agh ' of

satisfaction, which was fully shared by his admiring audience.

It was surprising how successfully he thus gave expression

to his views of homology of development, which were then
Iattracting general interest.
                               took great delight in enriching

the margins of his book on ' Comparative Anatomy,' with

illustrations copied from these chalkings on the board.

   IIt may be concluded from the preceding sketch that

profited largely by the facilities which Paris offered for improve-

ment in various departments of scientific and professional

knowledge. But the clinique of Laennec, and the study of

auscultation under him, were my foremost objects ; and by
Iclose attention
                  succeeded in fairly understanding and

practising what he taught. Laennec was somewhat partial
in his attentions to pupils. His favourite was Dr. James

Gregory, son of the professor at Edinburgh, and my particular

friend. To him he made a point of showing everything, and

often called on him to explain matters to the other English

pupils much to the annoyance of the few French in

attendance. On Dr. Gregory's leaving Paris, Laennec wrote

a very high testimonial in his favour. On my departure,

somewhat later, he told Dr. Edwin Harrison and myself that

he should mention our names in the preface of the forthcoming

edition of his work, among those who had become proficient

in the art of auscultation. This we considered as a more

complimentary testimonial than any written merely for our-

selves. At the same time he asked us to tell him of any others,

whom we might know, as having attended his clinique and

Iobtained a good knowledge of auscultation ; as he was anxious
to do them the same justice.   mentioned the names of Dr.
Thomas Hodgkin and Dr. Alexander Urquhart, whom I knew

to have studied successfully under him ; accordingly their
names, with ours, appeared in his preface.

   IIt is with no little satisfaction that am able to present to

my readers a real likeness of Laennec, just as he appeared in
making his visit at the clinique of La Charite. As might be
expected, the drawing is faulty ; but still it has succeeded in
giving somewhat of his fine sharp intelligent features and

amiable expression of countenance ; and, with his ordinary
costume of straight cut grey frieze coat, and embroidered

decoration, it may be acceptable, as a reminiscence of the cele-

brated inventor and teacher of auscultation. 1 It was in this
capacity that he was best known in the clinique of La Charite.

He had been a great worker and writer in Pathological
Anatomy : but little of this came out in his clinique. There,
he was full of the art of auscultation in Diagnosis, which

by his own experience he had worked out and clothed in a
new phraseology, and taught on the authority of his own ex-

perience and knowledge. These were marvellously large, and
reflected great credit on his industry and powers of observation,

as well as on his intelligence and inventive genius : bu^ it is
another question whether they quite, warranted the dogmatic

precision, which he tried to give to the rules of his new art,

as if it were complete and decisive, instead of tentative and

progressive. Yet the chief discoveries of auscultation, and

its large development, were undoubtedly his, and have placed
him in the foremost rank among the benefactors of mankind.

ITo these, as well as to his personal teaching, owe not only
some of the most valuable knowledge that I have ever acquired ;

but also the opening up of new avenues of knowledge, which

will be inexhaustible till the end of time. It was the new

idea of bringing another sense the sense of hearing to aid
us in investigating the organs in health and in disease, and,
through studying its indications, learning as it were a new

     1 The lithographed medallion profile, which appeared in some editions of

ILaennec's wor^ks, was, in my opinion, quite a failure. He showed it to Gregory

and myself at one of our last visits ; and could not compliment him on the
likeness. The able engraver, who has taken the trouble of reproducing my
rough sketches, has fairly succeeded in preserving the likenesses ; but he has
not materially mitigated their faults, which are those of an unpractised

amateur.

language, which would tell us of their changes in condition

or motion, that gave vastness to the discoveries of Laennec,

and would render them fruitful far beyond his own share in

them.

But of the many who followed the clinique of Laennec,

those only, who were constant in their attendance, attained

any proficiency in auscultation. The power of listening to,

and distinguishing, the various sounds, and of interpreting

them as signs of disease, is not easily gained : it is to be

acquired only by long and careful practice; and by a due

exercise of common sense as well : which helps to a better

understanding of the object of study. The management of

the stethoscope was a stumbling-block to not a few : the

French generally disregarded and applied the unassisted

others  less distinct in its results, as well as being often     ;

impracticable. There no doubt that Laennec exaggerated

the superiority of mediate over immediate auscultation and

his notions on the construction and form of the stethoscope

were quite crude. In general he maintained the sufficiency

of his simple cylinder of wood, perforated and hollowed out at

the pectoral end whether conically or parabolically did not

purposes. On one occasion, during my attendance, he found

necessary to modify his instrument. This was when Sir

Charles Scudamore visited the hospital to take lessons on the

new instrument. Laennec was assiduous in his demonstra-

tions but for some days, the worthy knight could hear

nothing. On further scrutiny, was found that the tragus

of his ear was uncommonly large, and by the pressure of the

flat end of the stethoscope, completely stopped his ear.

Laennec suggested the obvious remedy of slightly hollowing

the flat end. Sir Charles's ear was thus opened he returned

thus made portable, it was found to convey the sounds quite
as well as the solid cylinder. 1

    It was not only respecting the stethoscope, that the followers

of Laennec began to exercise their reasoning powers on the

matters that he had taught them ; but also on the true nature
and meaning of the physical signs, and on their relation to

the pathological changes which produce them. In hearing
his attempted explanation of several of the phenomena of

Iauscultation, soon found that his knowledge of acoustics

was by no means profound ; and, clever as he had been in
tracing the signs empirically, he was not equally successful in

explaining them rationally ; so that the practice of ausculta-
tion was a matter of memory more than of reasoning. Yet it

appeared to me that physical signs must be amenable to phy-
sical laws, and that a knowledge of those laws, so far as attain-

able, would be the best guide to a knowledge and understand-
ing of the signs, and of the causes, which produce them.
This train of thought led me to attempt something which

might serve as a guide to the better understanding of the
works of Laennec, and as an aid to students of auscultation and

as liable to break, as wood. Metal would be convenient for its strength and

portability ; but it is unpleasantly cold for application to the bare chest, and

not altogether free from the ringing noise of its material. If we could get ifc

addition of the india-rubber spring. The binaural instrument has some

Iadvantages in facility of application ; but it by no means transmits the chest

self of its use ; for during the last twenty or thirty years, the hearing of one

ear has been defective. I have found the same to be the case, with many of my

pathology ; and the result appeared in the year 1828, in the
' Eational Exposition of the Physical Signs of Diseases of the

Chest.'

   IAfter the termination of the clinique at La Charite, paid
Ivisits to other hospitals, but for no continuance.
                                                                             saw

M. Esquirol in charge of mad women at the Salpetriere ; and

M. Guersent at the Hopital des Enfants Malades. Making the

visit to the latter in the early morning, with an empty stomach,

I Icaught whooping cough (although had it in childhood) and

did not get rid of it for two months. The paroxysms were

Ivery severe ; sometimes attacking me in the street, and oblig-

ing me to hold by a lamppost. No doubt was in a state of

exhaustion and nervous susceptibility, from a long season of

very hard work. 1

1 As in all probability this is the last work that I shall ever publish, I do

not like to lose the opportunity  of putting on record the unusual  success  which
                                                                    taught   in my
I have had in the treatment of    whooping cough. As I always
Ilectures, consider the disease to consist in a specific inflammation of the
mucous follicles of the trachea, which throw out a peculiar infectious matter

(probably microbic), which excites the nerves and muscles to convulsive par-
oxysms to expel it. At the onset, there may be catarrhal inflammation as

well, with more or less fever, requiring antimony and other antiphlogistic

remedies ; but with them, and after them, so long as the convulsive cough

lasts, it is most effectually treated by applications, or inhalations, reaching to

the seat of the disease itself. Dr. Horace Green told me that he succeeded in

curing whooping cough at once, by sponging the interior of the trachea with
strong solution of nitrate of silver ; and it is quite intelligible how an agent so
potent would succeed in destroying the specific poison of the disease. But my
trials of that mode of treatment convinced me that it is too violent to be safe.

We have gentler means of obtaining the same end, and of at the same time calm-

ing the morbid nervous excitement. The chief of these is chloroform. From
20 to 60 drops (according to the age of the child) held for inhalation to the
nose and mouth, at the first onset of the coughing fit, and repeated if necessary

two or three times, usually stop the cough, and produce sleep : and whatever

Ichecks the paroxysms, tends to cure the disease : as they become less frequent,

they soon cease altogether ; and have known several instances in which
whooping cough has thus been cured in a few days. The chloroform would
seem to have not only its soothing influence on the nerves and muscles, but an
alterative action on the morbid follicles. And where the disease does not yield
to the chloroform alone, inhalations containing carbolic acid, creasote, or
liquor carbonis detergens, should be used several times a day, with a view to
Idestroy the specific matter, which is the root of the malady.
                                                                    shall not

lengthen this note further than by remarking that the modes of treatment

which have the common reputation of being successful in whooping cough, would

seem to act in a similar manner. Such is that by large doses of nitric acid,

or of alum ; and by the breathing the air of gasworks.
ST. LOUIS. BIETT. LEAVE PARIS.  51

     The only other hospital visited during the summer was
that of St. Louis, for the clinique of M. Biett on diseases of the
skin. His lectures were good and very practical; following
Willan and Bateman's arrangement ; and always speaking in
high terms of the general eligibility and success of English
modes of treatment.

     After the termination of my studies in Paris, a few weeks

were devoted to recreation and amusement among the sights
and objects of interest in the gay city and its suburbs ; and
the enjoyment of these was greatly enhanced by the society
of two sisters, a brother, and other members of my family,
who joined me before my return home, after a sojourn of

fourteen months.

   Since the above note was written, I have seen in the British Medical Journal

of January 27, 1883, the following paragraph : -
     ' Dr. C. Burger, of Bonn, in the first number of the Berliner Klinische

Wochenschrift for this year, describes at length the special micro-organisms of
pertussis, which he states can be found in any specimen of whooping-cough

sputum. They appear under an immersion lens, as small elongated elliptical

bodies of unequal length, the smallest being double as long as broad. Under a
very strong power, transverse subdivision can be detected in the longest specimen.

They may form chains or groups, but are generally isolated and scattered
singly all over the field. Dr. Burger concludes that this bacillus is the actual
producer of pertussis, because it is not found in any other kind of sputum ;
because it is so abundantly produced in whooping cough that its influence
cannot be doubted ; because its abundance increases in direct proportion with

the severity of the disease ; and because the course and symptoms of the whole

disease are best explained by the development of this fungus.'

Ime ; and became endeared for ever in the family of an uncle,
Iwhose daughter watched, and by God's blessing brought

through a dangerous illness, after the practitioner in attend-

ance had given up hope. But this is no more than what

I suppose most doctors have to tell of their early successes :
I Ionly mention it to prove that was sometimes making my-
Iself useful at a time, when generally seemed to be enjoying

a holiday. These initial experiences also gave a foretaste of
the anxieties, which a conscientious man must feel in under-

taking the responsibilities of his profession ; and which, with-
out disturbing his equanimity, should render him earnest and
painstaking in the performance of his momentous duties. A

hopeful temperament helped me under some discouragements ;

Ibut had to learn that, even with the most skilful and diligent

use of means, an absolute reliance on the overruling Providence

of God is the only true source of confidence and peace.
     After my long absence, it was very agreeable, as well as

useful, to renew acquaintance with my father's numerous

friends in Wiltshire. It is unnecessary to mention more than

a few of these. With the family of Lord Heytesbury at the
Manor House, we were always on intimate terms. Lord
H. himself was generally absent on his various diplomatic

missions : but his brothers, Captain and Colonel a Court, were
at home and always friendly, taking much interest in my
prospects. The daughter of the latter, then a little child, long
after married the Hon. Sidney Herbert, afterwards Lord

Herbert of Lea. Many years after, he and his mother, the
Countess of Pembroke, and many members of their families,
were long my patients in London. The Hon. Philip Pleydell
Bouverie, brother of the Earl of Eadnor, married a sister of

ILord Heytesbury : he was a banker in London ; and banked

with him and his firm through three generations, to the present

day.

     Dr. Eichard Fowler, F.E.S., of Salisbury, was a much
valued friend. For many years he was the most eminent

consulting physician of the county ; and having formerly de-
voted much time to scientific pursuits, (especially in connec-
tion with animal electricity) he was particularly interested in
my work and progress. The failure of his sight obliged him

Ito retire from practice : but for many years used to see him

at the meetings of the British Association, quite alive to the

discoveries of the day, when he was long past ninety years of

Iage ; always faithfully accompanied by his clever wife (sister

of the poet Bowles), who, have heard, has only recently died

Iat a very advanced age.

     Dr. Brabant have already had occasion to mention. He

was now practising at Devizes as physician, after a prolonged

continental tour, in attendance on Lord Bruce, son of the

Earl of Elgin. It may be imagined that after his long travels,

and my enlarged field of study, we had much to say to each

other, and that our intercourse was most pleasant. He intro-

duced me to Thomas Moore, the poet, who was living in his

Ineighbourhood ; and heard him sing some of his own songs.

He had an argument with me about some realistic paintings

of interiors at Paris, which had struck me with admiration.

He expressed utter contempt for that style, and said that

Sir Thomas Lawrence agreed with him. There seems to be

Ia concord among connoisseurs of high art, to condemn every-
thing that is too natural.  was indebted to Dr. Brabant for

an introduction to Dr. (afterwards Sir James) Clark, who after
long residence in Eome, had just settled in London ; and was

likely to help me in my quest of employment as travelling

Iphysician.                 went again to London and took

    In the spring of 1827

lodgings in Golden Square, with a view to revisit the hospitals,

and increase my acquaintance within and without the pro-

fession ; and to be on the look-out for any eligible employment

that might offer. My knowledge of French made me an

acceptable guest in the houses of Dr. Maton, Mr. Aylmer

Bourke Lambert, and others, who often had foreigners at their

receptions. The introduction to Dr. James Clark was most

Iopportune. He was most friendly, and took the greatest

interest in all that told him of my studies in Paris, and

expressed his regret that he had not been able to pursue a

similar course. He was full of the forthcoming new edition

of his work on Climate, and was glad of assistance in its com-

position ; for he was not a ready writer. He very much

approved of my intention of writing a little work on Ausculta-
CRITICISMS OF DRS. CLARK AND FORBES.                     55

tion, to make that of Laennec more intelligible ; and he very

soon introduced me to his great friend and ally, Dr. J. Forbes,

the translator of Laennec. He presented almost a contrast to

Clark in energy and industry, and in the cheerful bonhomie

Iof his character ; and think the influence which they exerted

on each other, was mutually beneficial. In one matter, how-

ever, they were thoroughly agreed : in the low estimate which

they formed of the state of medicine and medical practice in

London. No doubt there was much ground of truth in their

adverse criticisms. The chief practice was in the hands of

the apothecaries and of a few fashionable physicians, whose

knowledge and scientific skill did not rise much above that of

the apothecaries, however adorned they may have been with

the graces of literature and the polite arts. And the pre-

dominant evil in the medical practice of that day, lay in the

system of over-drugging and over-feeding which generally

prevailed. Against this the censures of Clark, Forbes, and

others were forcibly and rightly directed ; and it was not long

before the profession, and the more enlightened part of the

public, began to acquiesce in the necessity of reforms.

But neither Dr. Clark nor Dr. Forbes was qualified by

their antecedents to become leaders of reform in the practice

or profession of medicine. After a short college career, they

both became engaged as naval surgeons, with few oppor-

tunities for either study, or experience ; and in their subse-

quent spheres of action Dr. Clark among the English visitors
at Rome ; and Dr. Forbes in small country practices in

Cornwall and in Sussex there could be little scope for a

broad foundation of knowledge. Dr. Clark, in his residence at

Rome, had contracted some Broussaian notions as to the pre-

dominance of inflammation in disease ; in opposition to the
Brunonian views advocated by the Italians ; and in his

Ipractice he was therefore inclined to depleting and lowering
measures.  have reason to know that London experience

led him much to modify these views ; and although always

insisting on the necessity of limitation and regulation of diet,

he soon came to see the necessity of sustaining the powers of

life, even in inflammations. Finding his want of hospit.-il

experience, he obtained the appointment of Physician to the
56 VOYAGE WITH A PATIENT.

Parochial Infirmary of St. George, Hanover Square ; in the

duties of which he often asked me to assist him ; as he did

sometimes also in his private practice. This, although never

extensive, was increasing, especially in connection with ques-

tions on Climate ; the subject with which his name had become
identified. His adoption of the practice of auscultation, then

little known, was also in his favour ; and his plain but gentle

manners, and earnestness in inculcating his advice, attached

his patients strongly to him. Although my introduction to

him was through a letter from our mutual friend Dr. Brabant,

he and Mrs. Clark had long been intimate with an aunt of

mine, Mrs. H. M. Williams of Tidenham, in whose apartments

in Eome (as she told me) Dr. Clark was   first introduced to
Prince Leopold, then a visitor at Eome.
                                         If this was correct,

the event may be counted as the first link in the chain, which

eventually attached Sir James Clark to the Eoyal Family of
England.

Dr. Clark soon succeeded in getting me an engagement as

travelling physician to a gentleman, who was recommended a
sea voyage, on account of ' delicacy of the throat.' He was

not a patient of Dr. Clark's ; but was attended by two of the

Ileading physicians of the day, whom was to meet in consul-

tation, to hear their views and instructions respecting the

patient. They pronounced him to be free from disease of the

lungs, and to be suffering only from chronic inflammation of

the trachea, and weakness ; which, they fully expected, con-

tinued careful treatment, with the aid of sea-air, would be

able to remove. My duty was only to receive instructions,

Iwithout further question : but did presume to ask whether

the chest had been examined with the stethoscope ? The

reply was in the negative, with as much contempt of manner

as politeness would allow. The senior consultant in this

case died soon after, utterly incredulous of the value of auscul-

tation. The junior, one of the most fashionable physicians of

this century, wiser in his generation, became a believer, when

belief in it came into fashion.

   I was not to take charge of my patient until he should be

Iabout to commence his voyage ; so joined him and his wife at

Falmouth, before the end of July. They were an interesting

and were leaving their little girl in England. Mr.  was

heir presumptive of an historical Yorkshire family ; and had

been a short time in the army, but his health obliged him
Ito retire.

with one of my brothers ; at the time also when my cousin

wife amiable and refined. But now began my anxieties about

had received the instructions from his doctors :
Inow had to examine him, for myself, and was grieved to

find that he not only had disease in both lungs, but that it

war: considerably advanced ; there being a cavity in one lung,

and signs of active disease in the other, whilst his loss of

flesh and strength, fever, night sweats, and other symptoms,

plainly showed the progress of the constitutional disorder.

And in this state he was to ' try a sea voyage,' first to Madeira ;

and if he bore it well, to go on to Brazil, or other South

American port, and this in the hot month of August ! On

thinking back on this extraordinary advice, one is lost in

astonishment how it ever could have been offered : still, at

that time, coming as it did from the highest authorities, who

Iwas I, to presume to question it ? But this course did take.
I wrote to the physician, who usually attended him, a state-

ment of the result of my examination ; and left it for him to

decide whether any change should now be made in the plans.

There was ample time to reconsider the matter, as the packet

I\\:is not to sail for ten days. The only reply that got, was

through Mr.  who told me that Dr.  desired him to
Ithank me for my letter. So was constrained to conceal my

misgivings, and acquiesce in the arrangements that had been

previously settled. But I was obliged to modify the treat-

ment, by diminishing the quantity of wine, and omitting the

strong tonics, which he had been taking : the result was a

great mitigation of cough arid of other symptoms from which

he had been much suffering. This improvement increased

their confidence in me; and we seemed to go on most

pleasantly. They had an abundant assortment of books ;

and they took an interest in my drawings, and studies in

                                                        told

me that, although she found me agreeable, &c., she never

Icould ' get on with me,' because was so reserved : and no
Iwonder ! Under the control of professional etiquette, could

not be frank and open ; until the pressure of circumstances

Ishould break through all concealment; therefore had to

remain reticent, and to refer back to the opinions and

authority of the London doctors, rather than obtrude those of

my own.

Then came the voyage ; at that time performed by the

mail sailing packets, mostly brigs, or barques, taking from

ten to twenty days for the transit. In our case speed was no

Iobject. In fact feared more the heat of the island, than

that of the ocean. We had a fine passage of fourteen days ;

and except the few first hours of sea-sickness, and a few days

becalmed in the Bay of Biscay, the voyage was very enjoyable.

We had the usual ocean sights, of an occasional shark pursuing

flying-fish or Bonitoes ; a few pairs of blowing grampus-

whales ; and at night the beautiful phosphorescence of the

Isea, which was delighted to trace for myself to certain
Igelatinous bodies which found in a bucket of sea-water.
IThe phosphorescence observed to occur chiefly after a day

of sunny brightness and calm ; and very little after a cloudy

day or disturbed sea the light being derived from the sun,

and given out again at night by the phosphorescent body, as

in other instances of true phosphorescence. The rugged conical

heights of Porto Santo, and the tabular and needle forms of

the Deserta Islands were interesting objects for my pencil on

the approach to Madeira ; and early on a following morning,
we found ourselves in the not very safe harbour of Funchal,

with its dark sloping shore, and brown rocky cliffs, and the

irregular motley town rising above, backed by a succession of

dark mountain heights, showing more dingy ground than

lively verdure, but bespeckled with numerous quintas or

country houses, surmounted by the two-towered church of

Nossa Senhora da Monte high up above. This is often in the

clouds : but now there were no clouds. We had arrived before

the hot season was over ; when there had been no rain, and
MADEIRA IN SUMMER.  59

hardly a cloud for many months ; and all grass and most
herbage were burnt up and barren.

     As might be expected, the heat in the town of Funchal
was intense ; and it was necessary that the invalid should be

taken up to the high country as soon as possible. The well-

known hospitality of the Madeira merchants provided for this ;
and the day after our arrival, he was carried up in a ham-
mock, the easiest method of conveyance available in the

island. There are no carriages, or roads available for them.

The usual mode of conveyance is on horseback ; and for heavy
goods, sledges drawn by oxen. The streets are paved with
volcanic stone, which becomes polished by the friction of the

sledges. The country roads are very rough and rocky : but
it is wonderful how safely the horses tear along them, often
with their drivers holding by their tail. We were most

kindly received into a merchant's house at Camacha, to the
north-east of Funchal, at a height of about 3,000 feet above

the sea. The road wras up and down a succession of rocky
hills, with some large trees, chiefly Spanish chestnut, and no

other verdure ; for the fields were quite dried by the heat ;

Iexcept along the water-courses, where constant irrigation

was kept up. Here was surprised to see growing into high
hedges, geraniums, fuchsias, and other flowering shrubs, which
in England require the protection of a conservatory. The
country house in which we were received had the advantage
of one of these streamlets, which our host had utilised, not

only for watering a large garden, but also by making a pool,
which served as a plunge bath, a great refreshment and

luxury in that parched season. It was overshadowed by a

weeping willow and some fragrant shrubs; and many an

hour did I spend in this comparatively cool retreat.

     My patient had borne the voyage well, and was altogether
easier than before leaving England : but he felt the heat
trying, and was obviously not gaining strength. Still nothing
alarming occurred till, about a week after his arrival, he was
suddenly attacked with sharp pain in the side, which was

Iobviously pleuritic ; and not many hours elapsed before was

forced to the conclusion, that it was from perforation of the

lung and the supervention of pneurnothorax ; that is, air

escaping from a hole in the lung into the cavity of the chest.

Here then, was a catastrophe, involving, 1 ; immediate danger

to life from the sudden collapse of the lung, and the painful

spasm of the muscles of the chest excited by the injury ; and

2 ; a serious complication, added to the previously existing
disease in the lung. In all my anxiety and trepidation for the
Iresult, had no doubt as to the course of treatment which the
Ioccasion demanded.
                     gave large and repeated doses of opium
I(the first combined with calomel), applied a large blister to
Ithe affected side : and endeavoured to do what was possible, by

posture and pressure, to aid the embarrassed breathing. Of

Icourse further advice was sought for ; was most anxious for

some one to share the responsibility with me : but before the

doctor could come from Funchal, the patient was considerably

relieved. And now the time was come, when the real nature

of the case must be made known. That which had just

Ioccurred, confirmed the conclusion at which had arrived,

that serious disease existed in the lung ; and no deference to

authority, however eminent, could justify any further conceal-

ment of the truth. The patient and his wife received the

intimation with the resignation becoming their religious pro-

fession ; and they were encouraged still to hope that present

danger might be averted ; and that much could yet be done

to retard the progress of the disease. In a week's time, such

improvement did take place, so as to surprise Dr. Heineken,

the Funchal doctor, himself also a poor consumptive. Mr.

, so far from being frightened at what he had been told,

wished to know further particulars of his malady ; and would

get me to make drawings to explain them : but he could not

-help often ejaculating his surprise ' that the great Dr.
                                     '
should  have made  such a mistake  !

Grievous as was this aggravation in my patient's condition,

Iit was the means of relieving me from the false position in

which had been placed, and from the embarrassment of

concealing the truth. It is not to be denied that there are

circumstances, arising from the ignorance or timidity of

patients, which make it expedient in some cases to minimise

or mitigate our announcement of serious truths regarding

their health ; but to conceal them altogether, and still more
TEMPORARY RELIEF. DEATH.  61

to flatter false hope by denying their existence, is as unwise

and unfeeling, as it is immoral. It now became necessary to

apprise the relatives in England of the patient's condition,
and of the danger, present and future, connected with it. To

the family physician I wrote a full report of the attack ; and

of the subsequent signs and symptoms, which left no doubt

in my mind as to its nature ; and although there were hopes
of getting over the shock of the accident ; yet with so much
disease hi the lungs, there could be no expectation of per-
manent improvement ; and so it proved. The patient rallied

considerably ; lost all the most distressing symptoms, and

ivtained his faculties for reading and social converse for three

or four weeks : but he never left his bed ; he suffered from the

heat and confinement, and the appetite failed. An aphthous

state of the mouth announced the approach of sinking ; and
he died peacefully, six weeks after his arrival in the island.

     This was, then, a clear case of rapid hopeless consumption,
proving fatal in a few months, in which treatment was, at that
time, supposed to be of none or little avail. Yet such has since
been the progress of medicine, that there is now ground for
hope, that, even in such a case, the progress of disease may be
more or less checked, and life prolonged, for several years.

Even the severe complication which occurred here, perforation

of the pleura and pneumothorax, is not always fatal. In our

work on Consumption, published in 1871, 1 have described four

cases of pneumothorax from perforation of the pleura, which

entirely recovered. (' On Consumption.' By Drs. C. J. B. and

C. T. Williams, p. 279.)
     During the pressing necessities of such an illness, my time

was so much taken up with the patient (having in a measure

Ito fulfil the part of nurse, as well as physician), had little

opportunity of seeing the island. My walks were mostly con-
fined to an hour or two's scramble up or down the mountain

torrent. The water was too scanty to bar my steps. In fact,

every drop of water is exhausted, for the purpose of irrigation,
by the proprietors, who have their supply by rotation ; and

Itheir eager claims are continual subjects of litigation among

them. From all the great heights that could reach, none

many hundred feet above Camacha, there were various beauti-

ful views of the wide expanse of the blue ocean below. I had

not time to get to the Grand Curral, the deepest valley

Itraversing the island. Perhaps the finest scenes which

witnessed were those of moonlight nights. The moon and
stars shone with dazzling brilliancy, and seemed to give more

colour and form to the landscape, than the tawny blanks of

daylight : the sparkling specular reflection of the Spanish

chestnuts and laurels enlivening the dark masses ; whilst the
warm air resounded with the never-ceasing thrills of innu-

merable cicadas. Clouds were hardly ever seen, until a week
before our departure in the middle of September ; when the

approach of the rainy season was announced by wreaths of
cloudy masses forming around the mountains above Funchal,

to which we had descended after the death of the sufferer, to

be ready for departure.

Sad indeed was this early extinction of the earthly hopes

of a young and promising life, and the breaking of fond ties,

which amiability of disposition and a brightness of intelligence

had so deeply endeared. No human comfort could avail in
such a trial ; but duty, . no less than sympathetic feelings,
prompted me to do all in my power to help the afflicted widow

in her bereavement. It is unnecessary to dwell on the further

details of this engagement. We had a quick passage of ten
days to England ; with some gales and stormy weather in its

course ; which gave me the opportunity of witnessing, not

without enjoyment, the wondrous sight of the gigantic waves
of the Atlantic in the Bay of Biscay, now up in a mountain

threatening to overwhelm us then sinking into a vast abyss,
with the little ship riding bravely before the wind; while

Mother Carey's chickens walked on the stormy waters, and the
screaming sea-gulls circled in the leaden sky. We landed at

IPlymouth ; whence, after placing the widow in charge of her

brother, who had come to meet her, returned to my family
at Heytesbury, who had received no intelligence of us since-

our departure, more than two months before ; so irregular

the calamity occurred ; and this rendering such presents ill-

Itimed, she insisted on my accepting them. did not lose the

opportunity which the merchant, our host, gave me, of ordering
a supply of wine from Madeira, which then enjoyed its full

reputation ; and a cask of London particular, and another of
Malmsey, came in the ship with us. To mature the former,

Iit is usual to send it two or three voyages to the East or West

Indies and back : but had been advised an expedient at

home, which would answer as well : that is, to keep it for
twelve months in the roof of the house, exposed to the heat of
summer and the cold of the winter : this was done, and it

succeeded perfectly.

   I shortly after repaired to London to visit the widow and

family of the deceased, and render a full account of events.

            fear cannot say as much of

the physician, who with his senior consultant, had decided on

sending the patient to Madeira. He was very courteous and

Iacquiescent ; not even hinting at any dissent from my con-

clusions : but about a year after, when was proposed for

the Athenaeum Club, on the occasion of an increase in the

number of members by postponing my name, he succeeded
in preventing my election. Many years after, when my posi-
tion in the profession made it inconvenient to be on doubtful

terms with me, he seemed to try to make amends by sending

Ime his works : but he had a wonderful memory ; and do

not think that he ever forgot my discovery of his error in

diagnosis.

AFTER this sad episode, neither spirits, nor health, were in a

Icondition to make me anxious for any fresh engagement.

therefore passed the following winter among friends, with
occasional visits to London ; and then began to put into execu-
tion my design of writing an elementary work on Auscultation.

I hoped to render the subject more intelligible and instructive,

by studying its phenomena through a correct knowledge of
structures and functions in health and in disease, and of their
relation to what was known of the properties of sound. To a
certain extent Laennec had endeavoured to do this : but his
knowledge was rather practical than scientific ; and although
his great tact and experience had enabled him to make much
progress in his art, his rules were more empirical than
rational, and were sometimes pressed with the dogmatism of
an inventor, rather than in the spirit of philosophical investi-

gation. It was my aim, therefore, to explain the physical

signs of diseases of the chest, so as to make them instruc-

tive in pathology, as well as in diagnosis. In doing this even

in an elementary manner, although the work of Laennec

Iwas my chief text-book, I made use of what had learnt from
               FIRST WORK ON AUSCULTATION                               65

Iothers, especially Andral ; and in pathology, found reason in

many instances to prefer the views of the latter, agreeing, as
they in some respects did, with the teachings of my favourite
professor, Alison.

     And in thus endeavouring to make the study of ausculta-

tion easier and more instructive, my leading idea was to teach
its phenomena by a reference to the laws of acoustics. But,

Ias state in my first chapter, ' Unfortunately acoustics is

a branch of natural philosophy that has been neglected to

Ian unaccountable degree ; and when refer to the works of

authors, it is but to a scanty source, and supplying little in-
formation applicable to our subject.' l In fact what was to be
found in the books of the period referred chiefly to the rate of

     1 Rational Exposition of the Physical Signs, d'c., 1828, p. 4. At this
period none of those works had appeared, which afterwards threw much light

on the nature and properties of sound : those of Chladni, Savart, Wheatstone,

ISir J. Herschel, and Arnott. Dr. Thomas Young's lectures were considered

the most authoritative : yet found reason to criticise even his definition of

sound : ' It appears that the only condition necessary for the production of

a simple sound is a sufficient degree of velocity in the motion or impulse

which occasions it.' Dr. Young's Lectures, vol. i. p. 378. My remark is :
' It is not simply this, for the velocity of wind, which is much greater than

that of most initial soniferous influences, does not suffice to produce sound,

unless it meets with an obstacle : and certainly the movements of the earth

and heavenly bodies, should, according to this definition, develop sound, and
realize the poetic idea of the music of the spheres. A more exact physical

definition would be, motion of a certain velocity, resisted with a certain force.
The moving and the resisting forces, acting alternately in opposite ways, con-

stitute the vibrations of sound.'     (Observations on  the Production  and Propaga-

vibrations of sound in matter, whether solid, liquid, or aereal. We might call

sound, vibratory motion, or undulatory motion ; but these terms do not dis-

tinguish it from light and heat, which are likewise, in all probability, modes of

vibratory or undulatory motion ; but of a totally different nature, subtle and

ethereal, and not to be confounded with the more material and mechanical vibra-

tions of sound, which are also to be felt and seen, as well as heard, and represent

the coarsest mode of the vibratory movement of matter. The reversal of

the modes of vibration, by the conversion of sonorous vibrations into an

electro-motor force and current in the telephone, with all the marvellous

velocity and subtlety of electricity, to be reconverted into the identical

mechanical vibrations of sound, marks one of those mighty strides of science

by which man is permitted to fulfil the primeval command, to subdue (by

his intellect) the earth which he occupies.

and some of the relations of sound to music and to musical

Iinstruments. In the few pages which devoted to a descrip-
Ition of the properties of sound, endeavoured to point out

its relation to the molecular elasticity of different kinds of

matter, so as to explain their powers of producing, conducting,

but also the various noises, and material sounds, which, thus

studied, may become signs of the physical conditions and

   IIn treating of the motions which constitute sound,

posely described them as vibrations, like those of elastic

spheres, or of pendula ; and not as undulations, or waves ; for
although the propagation of sound may in some degree

resemble wave-motion, the analogy is imperfect, and tends to

mislead. Wave-motion affects surfaces, without pervading

the whole material : sonorous vibration pervades the sub-

stance, spreading its motions throughout the mass, by virtue

of its molecular elasticity, variations in which render bodies

only in viscid bubbles, the breaking of which causes, close

under the applied ear, fine crepitation, declaring its seat

in the parenchyma itself. The same consideration renders

evident that this crepitation differs in its seat, and in its

significance, from any bronchial or catarrhal rhonchi.

Another remarkable and important sign discovered by
AUSCULTATION. ILLUSTRATIONS.  67

Laennec, was the tintement metallique, or metallic tinkling.
Without attempting to give any explanation of the phe-
nomenon, Laennec described it as a pathognomonic sign of
pneumothorax with liquid effusion from perforation of the

Ipleura. But on investigating the acoustic nature of metallic

tinkling, found that it is nothing more than a high-pitched

echo, produced by the rapid reflections of sound from side to
side within a cavity, as in a bottle, or an india-rubber ball,
containing air ; and that such a cavity occurs also in an
inflated stomach, an excavated lung, or a pneumothorax with-

out perforation. No doubt the most common pathological
cause of the occurrence of metallic tinkling is perforation of
the pleura from disease in the lung ; and this lesion includes
factors, which make the sign more evident ; such as the bub-
bling passage of air and liquid through the fistulous opening
in coughing ; transmission of the voice ; the dropping of
liquid in the cavity, &c. But the only essential cause of the
tinkling is the cavity, together with a noise to call forth the
echo. Amphoric resonance is the same tinkling reverberation,

accompanying breathing, or cough, equally indicative of a

cavity. These and other acoustic explanations of physical
signs, first published in my little book in 1828, have been

generally adopted by subsequent writers up to the present

day, hardly ever with any acknowledgment, and not always

with evidence that the writer has mastered the subject. It is

very surprising, after the great improvements that have been
made in education, that medical men, even authors, should

Isometimes manifest such ignorance of physical science.

Itelligible in their causes, as those which have hitherto de-

observation and study shall have supplied the desired intel-

Iligence.' Yet in the brief summary which follows, suggest

edition which appeared in 1835.

     Mr. (afterwards Sir) David Davies, who was married to my
cousin, was at that time in constant attendance on the Duke of

Clarence and other members of the Koyal Family, and he per-
suaded me to dedicate my book to Sir H. Halford, with whom
he was intimate. That celebrated court physician received me
graciously, and seemed pleased with the compliment, although
the work was not in his line : but he was still more pleased with
my listening to his recitations of his ' Nugae Canorae ; ' Latin
verses which he had been lately composing. He complimented

I Ime on my style of writing, more than deserved ; for came

to think the language of that juvenile production somewhat

Ipedantic, and too much inflated with Latin quotations.

soon learnt to write more naturally and simply.
      The publication of a first work is always a matter of

anxiety to a young author. Publishers are not encouraging
to the unknown. Happily my father, knowing what my
wishes were, undertook to pay the printer : then publishers
were ready enough to sell the book ' on the usual terms.' An
old firm of medical publishers, recommended by friends,
undertook the work, but did not forward it much ; for they

got into difficulties, and failed a year or two after. In the

meantime, without any interest on my part, the book was
favourably noticed in the journals, and highly recommended
by Dr. Forbes in the new edition of his translation of Laennec.

Thus it gradually made its way. In four years another edition

was called for, which will be noticed in its place.

I IAs soon as had completed this affair of publication, was

engaged as travelling physician to accompany the Earl of
Minto and his family on a tour in Switzerland. We were a
large party : Lord and Lady Minto, and ten children, with

governess, tutor, and seven servants, and formed a great
cavalcade in five carriages, travelling post, by easy stages
through the old roads of France. Happily all were in good
health ; and during the three months my professional skill
was not often called in requisition. They had lost a son in
a former sojourn in Switzerland, from want of prompt medical
aid ; and this determined Lord Minto not to travel in future
without a physician.

    It proved to me a time of most agreeable rest and recrea-

tion ; and although we passed the greater part of it at the
Hotel des Trois Couronnes at Vevey, the beauty of the sur-
rounding scenery, with my passion for sketching, supplied

inexhaustible occupation. It was my first sight of Switzer-

land; and although I have made more varied tours nearly

twenty times since, two or three scenes of that first visit
have left a more vivid impression on my mind than anything
70 ALPINE VIEWS ST. CERGUES CHAMONIX.

Ithat have subsequently seen. One was the view of the Mont

Blanc and the Pennine Alps, from St. Cergues, on the Jura.

After many hot and dusty days' journey through the plains of

France, and three more through the more agreeable pineclad

and rocky ranges of the Jura, the ethereal fairyland of the

distant snow-topped mountains bursts on the view, with the

lovely azure of Lake Leman, stretched afar, like a hazy mirror

Ibeneath our feet. More than fifty years have passed, since

was first enchanted with that scene ; yet so lively is my re-

there gleams of the golden light. The excursion from St.

Cergues was on foot and well remember the effect of the

heavy dews on the high mountain pastures we were as much

wetted, up to the knees, as we had waded through river.

   Another event worth mentioning, was an excursion to

Charnonix. The family had gone thither before me, as was

detained by the illness of one of the children.                                  therefore

made my way alone, taking horse and guide at Martigny.

magic apparition of the long vista of the Chamonix valley, with

its gigantic ranges of lofty aiguilles, stupendous snow-topped

mountains, and succession of descending glaciers. The first

sight of these wonderful Alpine visions not easily forgotten
                  is

                                                                 ;
and although often witnessing such scenes since, have never

been impressed as at that first time. The gleam was but

transient, for clouds soon gathered again ; and first rain,

Ithen snow, closed the night at Chamonix. The next morning

was fine ; and on looking up, could hardly believe that the

dazzling white dome over our heads, which seemed so near,

Iwas the summit of the Mont Blanc itself. Eeturning by the

Tete Noire, called in the valley of the Trient to inquire for a

Iman whom had seen the day before and bled for an attack

of pleurisy : he was much relieved. This was a pendant with

Ithe case of the poor lady on the Col de Balme, of whom, on

my return to Vevay, heard that she died a day or two after

she refused to see me.

   IOf course made plenty of sketches in this excursion : the

last was from the descent of the Forclaz, of Martigny and the

upper valley of the Ehone, with the windings of the river, con-

trasted with the engineering straightness of Napoleon's road
Ito the Simplon : this afterwards painted in oils.
IThe whiter that year set in early.
                                     think it was early in
October, that we crossed the Jura, leaving the whole valley of

the lake of Geneva covered with snow. One more incident on

taking leave of Switzerland is worth recording. We had been

four days travelling from Vevay, and as we approached Dole

I(town) on an unusually clear autumnal evening, remarked,

* Now is the time to see the Mont Blanc, if it is ever visible from

hence, as it is said to be.' (Lord Minto had travelled often by

that route, and expressed his utter disbelief at the possibility of

seeing it.) On looking back there it was plain enough, above

Ithe Jura, with its snowy tops reddened with the setting sun,

at a distance, suppose, of nearly 150 miles. The atmo-

sphere was in that peculiarly transparent state, which precedes

rain.

   IDuring my absence in Switzerland, heard of the death
Iof my aunt, Mrs. Williams of Tidenham, whose name have

before had occasion to mention. She was a woman of piety,

intelligence, and refinement, had travelled much, and was
Ifond of intellectual society.
                                had often visited her from my
Ichildhood ; and accompanied her hi a visit to Paris after

my return from Madeira. She bequeathed to me her library,

including a fine collection of engravings, telescope, micro-

scope, &c. ; also plate, linen, and china. These were opportune

Icontributions to an establishment in housekeeping, which
Iwas now contemplating ; as had nearly completed the ten

Iyears of study in universities and hospitals and travelling,

with which, with my Father's approval, had desired to pre-

pare myself, before settling down to practice in London.
ISoon after my return,
                        became engaged to my cousin

Harriett Williams Jenkins, eldest daughter of Mr. James

Jenkins, merchant and landowner, of Chepstow ; he was D.L.

for Monmouthshire, and had lately been High Sheriff. His

wife was my mother's youngest sister : the families were

therefore intimate from childhood. My cousin had been well

educated, both in secular knowledge and accomplishments, and

in religious principles ; and as there was much community of

feelings and tastes between us, the attachment was natural.

One objection only was felt on the part of the parents, that

of relationship : but that eventually gave way to weightier

considerations ; and it was settled that we should be married

in the autumn of that year, 1830.

The serious illness of two of my sisters caused me great

anxiety and occupied much of my thoughts at this time. The

elder, Sophia, had long been the subject of ovarian disease,

and now became much worse, whilst on a visit with me at the

house of Mr. Jenkins, at Chepstow ; and there she yielded up

her gentle spirit to her Saviour, whom she loved and humbly

trusted through many years of suffering. The other sister,

Catharine, had become a helpless cripple from chronic gouty

arthritis, invading and distorting successively almost every

joint in the body ; near the last even the jaw, which became

fixed. Soon after, the heart was affected, and released the

sufferer about a year after the death of her sister. These two

sad cases give the opportunity of a remark on the improve-

ment which has taken place in the practice of medicine during

the last fifty years. The successes of ovariotomy, in the

achievement of which the name of my friend, Sir Spencer

Wells, stands, facile princeps, render it probable that through
its means one sister's life might have been prolonged for many

IIyears. With regard to the other sister's disease, can only

say that in my later experience, have never met with one so

intractable ; and although examples do occur, obstinate and

inveterate, there are few that do not benefit more or less under

the multiplied alternatives of alkalies, iodides of potassium or

iron, salicine or the salicylates, and cod liver oil, with proper

regulation of diet, and occasional aid from baths and warm

climate.

     In preparation for final settlement in London, it was

Inecessary that should be much there, or in its neighbour-

hood, to increase the sphere of my acquaintance, and to be on
the look-out for a suitable residence. My relative, Sir David

Davies, practising at Hampton, who had been the regular

attendant of the Duke of Clarence at Bushey, now succeeded

to the responsible ' office of personal physician of King
William IV. and Queen Adelaide ; and having much con-
fidence in me, was in the habit of consulting me on .various
important occasions. And a most grievous affliction, which
fell on him about this time, deeply increased his need of
sympathy and counsel from all his friends. His excellent wife,
my cousin, died suddenly, leaving him with four children,
bereaved, as it were, of the light of their eyes, just as they
were rising to a state of unexpected prosperity. Her brother,
Archdeacon Williams, was summoned, as well as myself, to

Ithe house of mourning, and we spent several days together.

        was glad of the opportunity of getting the opinion of so

practised a critic, and so profound a scholar, on the compo-
sition of my book. He was good-natured, but did not spare

Ime ; and profited by his corrections. He recommended me

to take Addison, rather than Johnson, as my model.

    After much searching and deliberation, I took a small

house in Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, with a pleasant view
of the Green Park and Westminster Abbey, and even of the
Surrey hills beyond, whenever the smoke and fog of London
permitted them to be seen. This street had long been a

favourite perch for young doctors, and now contained several :

the modest dimensions of the houses, and their fashionable
neighbourhood, rendering them attractive in a diverse sense.

    IThis was a momentous period of life ; and could not but

feel that the visitations with which it pleased God to afflict us

in the midst of blessings, were intended to solemnise our minds,

in the hopefulness and buoyancy of youth ; and raise our
thoughts above earthly things to the 'Love which abideth.'
We had the privilege of the intimacy and good counsel of several

serious and affectionate friends. Particularly would I mention

the Eev. John Hensman, of Clifton, and his excellent wife and

Idaughter, whom my wife and had known from childhood.
His praise was ' in all the churches,' and I never knew a more

perfect model of a Christian minister, whose whole life and
conversation, as well as his preaching, consistently bore
witness to the Truth that is in Jesus. We were indebted to
him for introductions to several valued friends in London.

which Michael Faraday was the inspiring genius ; and nothing

could be more congenial to my mind than his early morning

Ilectures in the laboratory ; where, through the introduction of

Dr. Charles Holland, one of the managers, had often the

privilege of private conversation with the admirable Director

Iof the laboratory, after the lecture.           was engaged

     Not long after my establishment in London,

by Drs. Forbes, Tweedie and Conolly, to write articles for

their ' Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine.' Those allotted to

me were Bronchitis, Catarrh, Coryza, Expectoration, Incubus,

Irritation and Counterirritation, Malformations of the Heart,
Obesity, Pneumonia, and Stethoscope ; and these appeared

successively, a year or two after. Dr. (afterwards Sir John)
Forbes was the most energetic of the editors ; and it was

mainly through his activity and industry, that the work was

brought out so promptly and regularly : but he himself under-

took to write more than he could accomplish, and had to ask

me and others to come to his aid. As may be supposed,

articles written fifty years ago must now be considered out of

I Idate, and superseded by more modern works ; yet think

can specify a few points in some of those early compositions,

which have not received due attention from subsequent writers,

and may be profitably recalled even at the present day.

    In the pathology of Bronchitis, stress is laid on different

forms and seat of the inflammation of the mucous membrane ;

whether superficial and catarrhal, with a mere excess and

saline quality of the natural mucous or epithelial secretion ;

or deep-seated and phlegmonous, with first more tumefac-

tion, from interstitial effusion of an albuminous or fibrinous

nature ; and afterwards external secretion and expectoration

of a more anirnalised matter, more changed from the natural
             ESTABLISHMENT IN LONDON.                   77

epithelial or mucous secretion ; and in form either fibrinous

and pellicular, or corpuscular and purulent. This pathological

distinction is truly fundamental, between forms of a disease

which is called by the same name, and yet differs so much in

nature and severity. The subject was more fully developed

in my later publications ; especially in Tweedie's * Library of

Medicine' (1840), in which all relating to diseases of the

organs of respiration, was written by myself: also it was

further considered in my ' Principles of Medicine,' the last

edition of which appeared in 1856.

out their frequent association with diseases affecting the circu-

blood, from gout, or similar causes of defective excretion : a

similar view has been taken by Dr. Copland, Dr. Greenhow,

and other experienced practitioners ; but it seems to be over-

looked by the most recent writers, who systematically ignore

Ithe works of their predecessors, without supplying their place

by anything better. As proof in point, will take the next
in order of my contributions to the ' Cyclopaedia,' Coryza.

Under this name, treating the whole subject of fresh cold or

catarrh, whether beginning in the head (nasal membrane), or

in the throat, and having a tendency to descend to the chest,

the question was discussed, as to the possibility of curing it

promptly of cutting it short, in fact ; instead of letting it run

its course, which is tedious enough, and often very trouble-

some, and may become serious, in spite of all help from pallia-
tives and nursing. In my original articles on Bronchitis,

fully in my lectures afterwards (' Lond. Med. Gaz.,' 1838), I
advert to the ' heroic ' cure by spirituous stimulants, mentioned
by Laennec, as a hazardous one ; likely to do harm, if it fails

to do good : and to the cure by opiates, practised by Dr. P.
M. Latham and others ; and made agreeable by Sir H. Halford

takes place at the decline of fever or inflammation : and this,

in truth, is what a day or two of abstinence from drink will

often effect. It brings it promptly to its termination. 1 It

reduces the fever and catarrhal inflammation, either altogether,

or to the mitigated form, in which they exist at the end of a

cold, with gelatinous, opaque, unirritating secretion, the dis-

charge of which completes the cure. The plan is most effective

when put in practice at the first onset of the cold, when some-

times twenty-four hours' abstinence will suffice. If the cold

has existed for two or three days, longer abstinence is required,

and the relief, though great, is less complete. Thirst there

But to the greater number of the many who catch cold, and

to whom the cold and its consequences are annoying, and often

much worse, two or three days' abstinence from liquids will be

found no penance. The discomfort from thirst outbalanced

that the plan may be mitigated by few indulgences, whicha

do not impair its efficacy. An effervescing saline of citrate

be allowed and any dryness of throat may be relieved at

from the circulating fluid all that can be spared for the sustentation of the

tissues, or for the natural evacuations, and there is nothing left to feed the
unnatural secretion from the inflamed mucous membrane. Its capillary
vessels cease to be congested the morbid flux diverted, and the inflamma-
tion starved away.' Lectures, 4th ed. vol. p. 21.

should be not only excluded during the cure, but taken only

sparingly for some time after. Nothing is more apt to bring

back a cured cold, than a premature indulgence in stimulants.

One of the great advantages of the dry method of cure is, that

it does not require the same amount of confinement, as is

necessary under ordinary treatment with warm slops and
means intended to promote perspiration and secretion ; for if

these are checked by chills, the matter is made worse. With

warmer clothing, and avoiding draughts and cold feet, exercise

in the open air seems rather to promote the efficacy of the dry

cure ; but it must be moderate, as there is a temporary reduc-

tion of muscular power. This plan of treatment commends

itself especially to the young and middle-aged, who are active

and busy, and cannot afford time to nurse their colds : but for

those feeble from age, or disease, it is not equally suitable : its

operation is to a certain degree depressing ; and although this

is quite transient, it may prove more than is expedient for a

weakly subject.

Another often effectual remedy for the immediate cure of

a cold, is opium or morphia ; but to render its operation safe,

as well as more lasting, it should be combined with means to

counteract the inhibitive influence of the opiate on the excre-

tions. From eight to fifteen drops of Liq. Morphiae Acetatis,

or Bimeconatis, in an effervescing draught of Bicarbonate of

Potass and Ammonia with Citric Acid, taken once or twice in

evening or night, and repeated if necessary, for two or three

days, will in most instances arrest an incipient cold. If the

cold has already existed for two or three days, and especially

if it affects also the throat and chest, the remedy is less effec-
tual ; but it mitigates if it does not cure. Constipation, if it

occurs, must be counteracted by an aperient draught in the

comparing notes with my dear friend, the late Dr. J. A.

Symonds of Clifton, one of the ablest physicians of this

Icountry, found that he was in the habit of curing colds with
Iopium, exactly as did.

There is also a method of curing a cold by the insufflation

into the nostrils, or the inhalation, of various powders, liquids,

or vapours, of pungent or stimulant quality. To those unused

to snuff, a very large pinch, causing violent sneezing, was

formerly recommended as a remedy for an incipient cold ; in

my experience, it was not successful. Strong solution of

chronic diseases of the air-passages attended with foetid, or

otherwise depraved, secretions ; but not with much success in

tained better results, from a modification of this practice, first

recommended by Dr. W. Eoberts of Manchester, by the aid of

the ' Eespirator-inhaler.' 2 Dispensing altogether with water

by the usual treatment with opium and salines. My age and

feeling of weakness deterred me from resorting to my old

drying up plan. Sore-throat and irritating cough followed ;

and sleep was further disturbed by attacks of difficult breath-

ing, coming on like nightmare, and compelling me to sit up.

Some relief was obtained by steam-inhalation and the appli-

cation of a hot poultice to the throat, prescribed by my friend

Dr. Bright, who kindly came to my aid, and found on exami-

nation no obstruction in the lungs or air-passages. But what

gave me most complete and permanent relief, was the inhala-

tion of the vapour of carbolic acid in a respirator in the

manner just described. The acid was Calvert's crystallised,

No. 1, with only sufficient water to liquefy it. A few drops of

this on the tow of the respirator, renewed from time to time,

and the inhalation continued for an hour, and repeated three

or four times, had the effect of not only relieving the difficulty

of breathing and the cough, but took away the pain and sore-

ness of the throat in fact seemed to clear up the cold in a

Imarvellous manner ; and afterwards had only to resort to

cod-liver oil and tonics to restore strength. There was a

strong nervous constituent in that attack ; and carbolic acid,

besides its antiseptic properties, has a powerful calming in-
Ifluence on the nerves.
                         have heard of other instances of

incipient colds being cured by these inhaling respirators,

Icharged with various mixtures of carbolic acid, creasote, thy-

mol, and other essential oils ; and think they deserve further

trials, especially in epidemic catarrh and hay asthma. Further,

the recent discovery of the share which the low organisms,

called bacteria or bacilli, have in the causation of tubercle

and phthisis, increases our interest in any means by which

we may destroy or counteract these parasites ; and none seem

more promising to this end than agents which may be directly

conveyed to their seat and breeding-ground. But it must be

a subject of careful study to find out what agents are truly

bacillicidc, without being injurious to the living tissues which
Ithey invade.
               shall have further opportunities of reverting

to this subject, which is becoming one of paramount interest

THE article in the ' Cyclopaedia ' on Counterirritation is chiefly
practical, for although allusion is made to the fact that nature
sometimes suggests the use of this therapeutic agent, in the
cure of internal disorders, by the spontaneous appearance of
an eruption on the skin ; and the modus operandi of counter-
irritants is briefly discussed, attention is principally directed
to forms and modes of Counterirritation ; and to the manner
in which these may be made most effectual in the treatment
of disease. Much of the utility of Counterirritation, as a
remedial agent, depends on the judgment and care with which

Iit is practised ; and now after the additional experience of

upwards of forty years, have no hesitation in declaring that
Counterirritation, judiciously employed, ranks among the
most beneficial means which we possess in the treatment of
disease. There has been a fashion of late to decry this mode
of practice as barbarous and irrational : but the adduced objec-
tors have neither sound pathological knowledge, nor clinical
experience, sufficient to set aside the general verdict of the
profession in its favour. When we know, from direct physio-
logical experiment, that we can so act on the tonicity of the
84 COVNTERIRRITATIONRA'llONAL AND USEFUL.

arteries of one part, as to increase the flow of blood through

them, and thus to diminish the flow to other neighbouring

parts, we gain some insight into the principle of derivation,

the first factor in the process of counterirritation. And when

further physiological observation teaches us that, by a con-

tinuance of the same interference, we can convert the artificial

determination of blood into inflammation, with its changes,

vascular infarctus, and corpuscular formation and effusion, we

gain a further glimpse of the process by which counterirrita-

Ition countervails a previously existing inflammation. If my

space admitted could add much more to prove that the

practice of counterirritation is not irrational. Neither is it

barbarous, if carefully carried out. The instructions for the

proper choice, and use of counterirritants, given in that article

Iin the ' Cyclopaedia ' written fifty years ago, include particulars

not to be found in recent works : and will add a few practical

suggestions arising out of my further experience.

Among rubefacient counterirritants, a useful and conve-

nient kind has been introduced in the form of the ' mustard

leaves ' of Eigollot : but when used alone, they are too strong :

they cause so much pain, that few can bear them on long

enough to obtain permanent good. But they may be rendered

tolerable and far more effectual, by interposing two or three

folds of wet linen between the mustard surface and the skin ;
as by wrapping the leaf in a linen handkerchief, or napkin,

wetted with hot water. By this dilution, its burning effect is

so much mitigated that it may be kept applied without dis-

comfort for hours even all night : yet in the morning the

vivid redness proves how effectual it has been. In fact its

effect thus becomes more permanent and beneficial, as well as

less painful. The erythema may continue till the next night ;

Iand if so, a wet compress will suffice, instead of another leaf.

    In the ' Cyclopaedia ' recommended that blisters should

not be kept on for more than six hours, (instead of the twelve

or twenty-four, which was the usual custom), but that the

efficacy of the blister was to be ensured by moistening its

surface with  oil (which  renders  Ifthe cantharidine more active) ;
interposing,              a thin   gauze.  at the end of six
              if needed,

hours the blister have not risen, a linseed meal poultice is to
' CYCLOPAEDIA' ARTICLES DYSPNCEA CAUSES. 85

be applied, under which the vesication pretty surely takes
place. If the blister has risen, the vesications are to be
Isnipped, and then the poultice applied.
                                          recite these direc-

tions here to confirm them, as very effectual in securing the

safe operation of blisters, in diminishing the irritation which

they cause, and in increasing their beneficial effects. This

treatment with a large blister, is especially suitable for acute

pleurisy, (the poultices being renewed twice daily) ; in conjunc-
tion with calomel and opium, digitalis, and salines. In

slighter pectoral inflammations, and those intercurrent in

phthisis, the stronger form of Acetum Cantharidis, with

Camphor Spirit, acts more mildly than a blister, and causes

less pain than the ethereal solution.

    For the tartar emetic ointment and solution, which I used

Imany years with great success, as a pustulating counterirri-

tant, more recently substituted croton oil, as more prompt

in action, and less troublesome to manage in its after effects.

One part of croton oil with two of cerate, rubbed on the chest,

often without repetition, excites an eruption in a few hours ;

which has proved very effectual in curing severe bronchitic

coughs, which had resisted milder remedies. The eruption

requires only to be anointed with vaseline, and covered with a

silk handkerchief or cotton wool, and gets well in a few days :

but the hands should be washed after using the ointment, and

care taken that its fumes do not affect the face.

Under the head Dyspnoea, difficult or distressed breathing,

the symptom is analysed and described in its several degrees

and phenomena ; and then traced to its cause in one of the

three factors in the function of respiration 1. the blood; 2.

the respiratory machine ; and 8. the air. 1. As the condition

of the blood, which is called venous, is the immediate cause of

the sensation of dyspnoea, so the blood being (so to speak)
more venous than usual may give rise to the feeling of

dyspnoea, without any fault of the respiratory machine. Of

this nature is the dyspnoea from violent exercise, hurried or

laboured breathing, which ceases as the excess of venous blood

becomes reduced by rest. In a similar way diseases of the

heart cause dyspnoea by the accumulation of venous blood in

the lungs : and in some other states an increased besoin de

respirer (Laennec), amounting to dyspno3a, seems to be caused
by changes in the blood, from morbid poisons affecting it. 2.
Changes in the respiratory machine may cause dyspno3a a. by
interference with the motory power ; b. by obstructing the

passage of air to and from the pulmonary cells ; c. by de-
rangements in the pulmonary tissue, obstructing the action of

.-air on the blood. 3. Insufficiency, or impurity, of the air

of the blood, by the administration through the stomach, of

do think probable that some of the good effects of the

hypophosphites, in phthisis, and other diseases of the lungs,

due to their supplying the blood with something hungry for

oxygen, and apt to absorb from the scanty supplies of feeble
aeration. The inhalation of air with an increased proportion
of oxygen, and of condensed air in compressed air bath,

are other means of attaining the same object, which deserve
further trial.

The article Expectoration,' which contributed to the

Cyclopaedia,' hardly deserves mention as in many respects

has been superseded by the more exact information of sub-

sequent publications, by others, as well as by myself. Some

remarks on the process of Expectoration, however, were

original, and hold good to the present time.

which it is dismissed in a few words, as a mere form of in-

digestion disturbing sleep, or a symptom of the disorder

of an overworked brain. 1 A few extracts will suffice to show

my view of the subject, concerning which personal experience
has supplied some additional information.

' The usual and severe form is that, in which the patient, in the

midst of his sleep, becomes conscious of a huge weight on his

breast, which oppresses and impedes his breathing. This is accom-

panied by a feeling of inability to move, or to speak, which greatly in-

creases the discomfort : and the fancy, ever active, embodies these

feelings into an imaginary monster, overpowering and oppress-

ing the body. Hence the superstitious names nightmare, incubus,
&c. In many instances, the sense of weight or pressure is less

defined ; but there is general uneasiness, which the dreaming mind

shapes into an impending danger, such as falling down a precipice,

being pursued by an armed enemy, or savage beast, and the like ;

with a feeling of weight on the limbs, and inability to escape ; and

this becoming so intense as at last to break the remaining tie of

sleep, the person awakes in a fright, often with hard breathing and

palpitation of the heart. Nightmare, in all its varieties, is a dis-

order of the function of sleep. The power of volition, both in

mind and body, is more or less completely suspended during natural

sleep. Other mental functions may be equally so : but more gene-

rally trains of thought, dreams, go on ; and simple sensation, al-

though blunted, is not entirely suspended. Dr. Alison has well

established the opinion, long ago entertained by Whytt, that re-

spiration is an instinctive motion, excited by the sensation of black

blood in the lungs ; and the movements and changes of posture,

unconsciously made during sleep, seem to be of the same kind, in-

stinctive movements, and can hardly be called acts of volition. But

if,from any cause, respirationimperfect, the instinctive or in-
                  a          is
                                   a

                                                                              a
voluntary motions are insufficient, and voluntary effort required to

supplement it. The breathing during sleep may be rendered im-

perfect by constrained posture with some persons even supine

posture by too hollow, or too soft, bed by distension of stomach

palpitation, or faint action of the heart by slight attack of

asthma, or any other form of dyspnoaa. During our waking hours,

such impediments to the breathing are obviated by the supplementary

aid which voluntary efforts can give to the respiratory process we
                                               of

                                                                                                            :

eructation, or the air-passages by cough and expectoration, &c., and
this, with hardly a consciousness of the ailment, or of the act which
relieves it. But during sleep these voluntary movements are not
at our command ; the respiratory act is more limited ; and although
sufficient for the ordinary rate of the function, becomes inadequate,
when an embarrassment renders necessary increased exertion, or

new movement. In the event of this, therefore, black blood gradually
accumulates in the lungs, with its consequent effects of congestion
in the right cavities of the heart, and a feeling of oppression and
suffocation ; which after tormenting the mind for a time in some

demoniacal form, at length reaches such an acme, as to break the
spell of sleep, and awake the sufferer to the possession of those
voluntary powers, by the exercise of which, in hard breathing, the
bodily function is relieved of its embarrassment. No sooner is he
fully awake, than the bodily uneasiness is removed, and he is
sensible only of the mental disquietude which his frightful dream
has occasioned : but this, together with the excitement of the
restored circulation, may prevent him from readily composing him-
self to sleep again. This we conceive to be a sufficient explanation
of the phenomena of nightmare ; without resorting to hypothetical
notions of pressure on the solar plexus or nerves of the stomach,

which if capable of producing an effect at all, should do so equally

beyond the period of sleep. Incubus may be contrasted with som-
nambulism, in which the power of voluntary motion continues,
whilst the external senses are either suspended, or their impressions
are superseded by some train of ideas that engrosses the mind.
Other causes of disturbed sleep are pains of any kind ; as toothache,
earache, cold feet, &c., which when insufficient to prevent sleep,
become the demon of a dream, tormenting the sufferer in all sorts
of distressing forms. There is, however, between these causes and
those which produce nightmare, this difference ; with these, the
person awakes to a consciousness of the real cause, whereas the
sensation of nightmare ceases with the return of voluntary move-

ment.'

    If we are correct in associating nightmare with imperfect

breathing during sleep, it is obvious that the proper treatment
will be by means directed to remove the cause of the imperfect
breathing, whatever it may be ; and not by means calculated
to increase the soundness of the sleep. This consideration
excludes generally hypnotics or narcotics ; except in those
cases in which these may also relieve the breathing as in

spasmodic asthma. Here choral hydrate is sometimes bene-
ficial : but in other cases bromide of ammonium, with ether,

and other diffusible stimulants, are the most useful additions

to the various means to be addressed to the cause of the dis-

order (1888).
     The article ' Malformations of the Heart ' was chiefly com-

piled, with a few original suggestions on the mode in which
the most frequent forms of malformation, open ductus arteri-

osus, and foramen ovale, may take their origin from the imper-
fect performance of respiration at and after birth.

     ' Irritation,' (1833) was a more elaborate production,
called for rather by the wide and frequent use of the term by
previous writers, than by any claim, which it had for a place
in nosological classification. After denouncing the vague

Iand totally unscientific use of the word, as generally applied,

   proceed, to examine critically the views on irritation put
forward by two of the most distinguished writers of the time,
M. Broussais, and Mr. Benjamin Travers ; and conclude with an

attempt to define and exemplify, so far as the existing know-
ledge of physiology and pathology permitted, the general
nature of morbid irritation. The kinds of irritation are con-

sidered under three heads : 1. Those caused by direct irritants
or stimuli, whether acting immediately on the part, or

mediately through the nerves. 2. Those caused by a
preternatural irritability, which, independent of any new existing
influence, renders the relation of ordinary circumstances a
source of irritation : and 3. Those caused by indirect irritants,
or those influences, which although in themselves, prostrating
or sedative, become irritant through the reaction of the vital
powers against them. The discussion of these several heads

opens up a pretty extensive chapter of general pathology ; and
is followed by an equally copious description of the treatment
of irritation, which brings in review the chief therapeutic
agents, by which this manifold form of disorder, is to be con-

trolled or counteracted. The article is too long for republica-

tion, and -will not admit of abridgment. It met with the

Iespecial approval of Dr. Conolly, the most philosophical of

the editors; and considered it to be the most original
and successful of my contributions to the ' Cyclopaedia.' In
90 ' CYCLOPAEDIA^ OBESITY.

     fe

Quain's ' Dictionary of Medicine ' there is not a word on the
subject : but only a short able article on Spinal Irritation,

by Dr. Brown- Sequard.

The article  ' Obesity,'  in the ' Cyclopaedia  '         was com-

                                                  (1833)

piled without much personal experience on the subject : but the

pathological views and the plan of treatment were grounded on

the most recent knowledge of animal chemistry ; and antici-

pated in several points the notions and directions of subsequent

authors. Abstinence from all excess in food, both solid and

liquid, especially those containing fat, sugar, or starch, is en-

joined on all fat subjects ; but the degree to which this is to be

carried, how far active exercise is to be enjoined, and how

medicinal treatment is to be directed, is suggested by an im-

portant practical division of cases of obesity, into two classes,

sthenic, and asthenic.

     4 Pneumonia ' in the ' Cyclopaedia,' (1833) was the largest
of my contributions, occupying nearly fifty pages. This is

too extensive a subject to admit of analysis here : but it may

Icome under consideration in a future volume, (if am spared
Ito produce it ;) when may have occasion to review the results

of my experience in this and other important diseases.

IALTHOUGH found no want of occupation during the first

years of waiting for practice, the practice itself came but

Islowly. In the first year, through the kindness of friends,
Ihad more than expected, getting on an average two or three

fees a week : but in the second year there was a falling off ;

and the receipts hardly reached 1007. at the year's end. But

there was ground for encouragement, in that more came

J. Byam and Mr. A. B. Chisholm ; who carried it on successfully

many years. Although these, together with the Medical

Writings before mentioned, occupied much time, there was

still enough left for domestic and social , relations, and for a

little recreation in art and science.

My favourite pursuit of drawing was not neglected ; and,

in conjunction with the congenial tastes of my wife, we

generally had some work in water colours or oils going on, to

Ivary the employments of London life. My usual subjects

were landscapes, for which had numerous studies in the

sketches taken in my travels : but I had made one attempt at

a portrait, that of my dear Father. We were all desirous to

have his portrait taken ; but he was averse, at his advanced

Iage, to go to London for the purpose ; and before left the
Icountry, had the audacity to try to paint him in oils. The

result was, as might be expected, an indifferent painting, but

it was a very striking likeness, which was quite satisfactory to
Ithe family.
              bestowed more care and time on it than on any
Ipainting that ever accomplished, and heavily taxed my poor

sire's patience in thirty or forty sittings. The great difficulty

was with the mouth ; which in my opinion, is always the most

characteristic feature in the face ; requiring the most truthful

accuracy in every line and shade, especially at the commissure

of the lips, to give the full likeness and expression. A litho-

Igraph was afterwards taken from the picture, but could not

get the artist to bestow care enough on the mouth to preserve

the identity of the original.

The lectures at the Eoyal Institution were a source of

never-failing interest and gratification ; especially those in

the laboratory by Michael Faraday himself; then Director

of the laboratory, and pursuing his researches in electricity

and magnetism ; the results of which were made known from

time to time on the Friday Evening Meetings. After one of

Ithe laboratory lectures, mentioned to him some observations
Iwhich had made on the low combustion of a candle, visible in
Ithe dark, which had communicated to the ' Annals of Philo-
sophy ' of July 1823 ; which was my earliest publication.

The chief facts were, that wax, tallow, oil, resin, and many

other compound inflammables are luminous in the dark when

heated to a point much below redness. Faraday's reply was,
' This is very interesting ; and you must work it out, to

ascertain whether this light is from combustion, or phosphor-

Iescence,' like that of fluorspar when heated. This did by

the following experiments.

     A metallic ladle, containing the wax or oil, is heated over
a spirit lamp till it begins to smoke. It is then luminous in
the dark ; and if plunged into a vessel containing oxygen gas,

the faint light brightens, and instantly after bursts into a

vivid flame of full combustion. If instead of oxygen, it is put

into carbonic acid gas, the light is extinguished : but, if again

raised into the air, before it has time to cool, the light re-

appears. Wax or tallow was heated in close tubes in the

dark : they gave out no light : but on being opened, the light
appeared. These and other similar experiments sufficed to

prove that the light was due to low combustion, and not to

Iphosphorescence .     found that other animal and vegetable

     On further trial

matters, paper, cotton, linen, wood, straw, gum, cornflour,

wool, silk, leather, horn, bone, ivory, &c., also exhibited the
light of low combustion in the dark, on being heated to what

may be called the lowest charring point ; that is, when they

begin to change colour, and to smoke ; which is far below the
lowest red heat of incandescence. 1 An easy mode of doing
this, is to heat a mass of iron (a laundry flat iron for instance)

to low redness : take it to a dark room, and wait till after it

has lost all trace of incandescence ; or power of raising a spark :

then lay on it the object to be tried. If it is wax or tallow, it

melts and spreads ; and first the margin, soon the whole

surface exhibits a soft and wavering light, which accompanies

the giving off of smoke from the burning matter. If the

object is solid, as paper, wood, or wool, the light is more still,
and continues till the iron cools, or the more combustible

matter is consumed. The charred residue does not show the

combustion ; neither does charcoal.

     1 Any one can make this experiment. Heat the end of a common fire-

poker to redness : pass a sheet of paper around the cool part, holding it tight
by its free edges ; then take it to a dark room, and gradually draw the paper
towards the hot end : before it reaches this, the paper will show the pale light

of low combustion.
 94 RECREATIONS LOW COMBUSTION.

       This low combustion is not limited to vegetable and animal

 combustibles. It occurs with the more oxidisable metals,

 zinc, antimony, lead, and some others.
       When fine fresh filings of these are thrown on the hot

 iron in the dark, they also show the pale light of low com-
 bustion.

       The low combustion of sulphur and of arsenic is already

 Iwell known : but it differs from the examples, which have

 been adducing, in its occurring at a lower temperature : that,
 in fact, at which these bodies are volatilised ; and consequently
 their low combustion is in the form of a lambent flame on
 the surface of the vapour, as it rises from the heated matter.
 Sulphur melts before it sublimes. Arsenic passes from the
 solid state into that of vapour. But both, in contact with air,
 burn in this low combustion at the temperature which sublimes

 them.
      The most familiar example of low combustion is that of

phosphorus, which goes on at ordinary temperatures. It is

 commonly supposed that the spontaneous combustion of phos-
phorus is aided by the nitrogen in the air ; because its light is

diminished in oxygen gas. But this is what I have observed :

On first introducing, in the dark, a bit of phosphorus into a
vessel containing oxygen gas, its light is generally lessened ;
but in a few points, brightens up, and in a few seconds these
points move in bright coruscations, and soon burst out in
open vivid combustion. A like spontaneous open combustion
will take place in common air, if the phosphorus is placed,
not on metal or glass, but on cotton wool, woollen cloth, or
any other non-conducting substance, which permits the heat
of its low combustion to accumulate, and so to bring it up to
the point of full combustion.

     Another highly combustible matter likely to exhibit low
combustion, like phosphorus, at ordinary temperatures, is

Ipotassium, and this ascertained to be the case. When a bit

of potassium is taken out of the mineral oil in which it is
kept, and, after being wiped, is cut with a knife, its bright
metallic surface quickly becomes tarnished by oxidation ; this
is accompanied by the light of low combustion, visible in the

dark.
               A GENERAL LAW PHENOMENA.                    95

It appears, then, to be a general fact, with some excep-

tions, that combustible matters, ichether simple or compound, are

capable of low combustion, that is, of combining with oxygen,
with evolution of light and heat, at temperatures consider-

ably below those of ordinary combustion. The exceptional

Imatters, which have not found to exhibit the light of low

combustion, are charcoal and coal, alcohol and ethers, volatile

oils, camphor, and sugar. With regard to the greater number

of these, it is probable that their volatility reduces their

temperature too quickly for the combustion to take place

under ordinary circumstances : but with regard to alcohol and

the ethers, we seem to have evidence of the low combustion of

their vapours in contact with spongy platinum ; and this helps

to explain one step in the process of this curious phenomenon.
If, on further inquiry, charcoal be still found among the excep-

tions, it may be classed with iron, and other metals, which have

only a high burning point.

    If the general fact of low combustion be admitted, two

further questions arise with regard to which call for furthera

in the spectrum and the nature of the products of this

low combustion.

duced by the incandescence of particles of the burning matter

or of its product, the lowest grade of flame ought to exhibit

the lowest degree of incandescence. But this      commonly

described to be red cherry red being the lowest visible heat
       is ;
                                      ;

yet very little red appears in subdued flames of ordinary com-

bustion and still less, any, in the light of low combustion,

which  generally pale and colourless, in some cases with   a

tinge of blue or yellow. It hardly seems possible to explain

the colours of ordinary flames by reference to degrees of

incandescence of the particles of the burning matter; and

still less does the pale light of low combustion seem to belong to

the same class of phenomena as the red heat of common com-

bustion. Is certain that the lowest visible incandescence  is

ous, and much practised in observations in the dark, connected
96 PRODUCTS OF LOW COMBUSTION.

Iwith this subject, almost came to the conclusion, that there

is a pale colourless light below red heat, that is, a white heat

below red heat. On attentively watching, in perfect darkness,

a heated mass of iron, such as a laundry iron or cannon ball,

as it cools from red heat, its form remains visible from ten

to twenty seconds (according to size), after all red colour has

vanished, in a faint pale white, or yellowish white, which

gradually disappears as the iron cools. 1 If there is doubt as
I Ito the correctness of the observation (and confess that have

less confidence in it than when my sight was younger) it is

connected with the difficulty of distinguishing colours in

objects which are only just within the range of visibility :

Ithere is therefore need of concurrence of many observers on
such a point.  would add that this is not an essential part

of my principal subject, low combustion ; but if substantiated,

it would assist in explaining some of its phenomena.

2. The nature of the products of this low combustion
Ipoints to a wide field of investigation, on which cannot
Iattempt even to enter.
                           do not know that the products of

the low combustion of phosphorus, sulphur, arsenic, and other

elementary matters have been experimentally determined

with precision : and those of compound combustibles, oil, wax,

wood, paper, wool, and other vegetable and animal matters,

are little known. For the most part they are not like those

of complete combustion, water, carbonic acid, and ammonia ;

but sundry proximate elements, among which may be men-

tioned acetic and pyroligneous acids, and other matters,

called empyreumatic. They may somewhat resemble the

products of destructive distillation, but they are not identical ;
as in the latter process the air is too much excluded for low

combustion to take place.

Exclusive of the interest arising out of the establishment

of a law, or general fact of low combustion, the subject is of
practical importance, as bearing on that of spontaneous com-

     1 This is no ocular illusion from fatigue of the retina, like the patch in the
vision after looking at a bright light or vivid colours : such patch could only be

dark after a white light, or of the complementary colours, if coloured. If any

patch appeared after watching the red-hot iron, it would be green, the colour

bastion of hayricks, of oiled rag-heaps in factories, of coal-

stores on board ship, and of the human body. The self-igni-
tion of newly made hay, insufficiently dried, probably has its
origin in the vinous fermentation of the sugar of the new hay,
causing heat in the centre of the rick, which accumulating,
gradually rises to the point of low combustion ; which under

favourable circumstances may increase till it reaches the

charring point, and then burst into an open flame. The

spontaneous combustion of oily tow, or rags, occurs where
such matters have accumulated in large heaps : the oil in the

interstices absorbing oxygen at ordinary temperatures suffi-
cient to generate heat in the mass, first to low combustion,

and eventually to open ignition. The spontaneous ignition of
coals occurring on board ship, is probably connected with the
presence of pyrites in the coal ; but, no doubt, the proneness
of their sulphur to low combustion, is a chief factor in the

process. 1

     Mr. Faraday became so much interested in this inquiry,
that he suggested to me to give an experimental demonstration

Iof the subject at one of the evening meetings of the Royal

Institution. This did in the spring of 1834 ; not without
trepidation, for it was my first attempt at a public lecture.

I had often spoken at Society meetings ; but it was a much

more formidable affair to address such an audience, and con-
duct a number of experiments requiring nerve and steadiness.

IHowever, with the kind aid of Faraday and his assistant,

Anderson, got through well enough to satisfy my audience
of the reality of the facts and phenomena of Low Combustion.

     By the advice of my friend Dr. Maton prepared paper
on the same subject for the Eoyal Society and was much
gratified by the manner in which was spoken of by Mr.
Children, the secretary. Nevertheless was not considered

were very imperfectly recorded at that time. This was a dis-

appointment to me ; and a matter of surprise to my scientific

Ifriends, who thought that the facts which had discovered,

sufficient to establish a new law in combustion a process of

everyday and everywhere importance were at least as de-
serving of a place in the ' Philosophical Transactions,' as the

discovery of a remote telescopic comet, or of a rare and

obscure new metal, the claim of which would be considered

irresistible.

But the British Association for the Advancement of Science

had then just come into existence, and afforded to workers in

science the much needed opportunity of making known the
Iresults of their labours.
                            had already attended its third

meeting, which took place in Cambridge in 1833 ; and wit-

nessed with delight the enthusiasm of Professors Sedgwick,

Buckland, Whewell, and Phillips, in inspiring and carrying on

Ithe proceedings. In the section of Medicine joined in the

discussion of a paper on the ' Sounds of the Heart,' by Mr.

Carlile ; and there first publicly stated my opinions of their

causes, which subsequent experiments proved to be correct. At

Ithe meeting in the following year, 1834, at Edinburgh, read

my paper on ' Low Combustion,' and exhibited the experiments
in the Chemical section before Dr. Dalton, Professors Thomas
Thomson, Johnston, Thomas Clark, Thomas Graham, and

others, who all appeared satisfied with the results. The

Ivenerable Dalton, and Thomson of Glasgow, whose works

had studied from my youth, expressed much interest in them.

The Committee of Eecommendations subsequently recom-
mended ' that Professor Graham and Dr. Williams be re-

quested to investigate further the phenomena of Low Combus-

tion.' *

     This recommendation was never carried into effect. Pro-

Ifessor Graham was living in Glasgow ; and had no oppor-

tunity of meeting him, until a few years after, when he
was appointed professor of Chemistry in University College,

London. He then called on me, proposing to take up the

Isubject. But it so happened, that at this time had succeeded

short notice ; and was utterly unable to undertake any
additional work. And afterwards, although colleagues, we

were each so much engrossed in his own particular depart-

ment, that no opportunity occurred of our working out this

Iinteresting problem. This much regret ; for it cannot be

doubted that the profound knowledge and skill of this greatest

portant results from the investigation.  was long intimate

with him : for a time attended him professionally ; and always

was deeply interested in the early communications which he

made to me of some of his profound researches in physico-

chemical science.

     So ' Low Combustion ' has been shelved until the present

Itime ; and no chemist that meet with seems to know any-

thing about it. Professor Graham always noticed my experi-

ments in his lectures : but the only published report of them
is in the brief notice in the fourth volume of the 'British

Association Reports,' before alluded to : no one else seems to

have written on the subject.

   At the same meeting at Edinburgh, I read a paper in the

Mathematical and Physical section ' On the Physical Explana-

tion of the Production and Propagation of Sound.' This was

published in the 'London and Edinburgh Philosophical
Magazine ' for January 1835 ; and has been already referred

certain physiological experiments to determine the physical
causes of the sounds of the heart, in compliance with an in-

Ivitation for that object which had received from Dr. Mac-

intosh. But he was absent from Edinburgh; and Dr.

ISharpey and Mr. Dick, to whom was introduced for the

same purpose, did not succeed in getting subjects for the

experiments.

      The meeting was altogether a most interesting one. The
lecture of Sir Charles Bell on his ' Discoveries in the Nervous
System ' was a great attraction ; but was not so successful as

was expected. My friend, Dr. Brabant, who accompanied me,

applied to it the term magniloquent, in comparison with may-

nificent, the fitting epithet which he used with regard to the

FOR a year or two after the publication of the * Eational Ex-
position of Physical Signs,' &c., in 1828, its sale was impeded
by the bankruptcy of the publishers. Mr. Churchill then took
it in hand, sold off the remaining copies, and called for a second
edition in 1833. The chief additions in this, related to the
sounds of the heart in health and in disease. In the first

Iedition expressed my doubts respecting Laennec's opinions

on these subjects ; and especially, his ascribing cardiac and

arterial murmurs to a fancied spasm of arterial muscles. In

1829, Professor Turner of Edinburgh proved by experiment, as
well as by reference to observations of Harvey and Haller,
that the auricles of the heart contract before the ventricles,
and cannot therefore be the cause of the second sound, as

supposed by Laennec. In allusion to this, Dr. Forbes l con-

Icludes thus : ' recommend this subject to the especial notice
of Dr. Williams.' IBut at this time found that Dr. Hope,
Iwith whom had long been intimate, was devoting his atten-
Ition to diseases of the heart : and not to interfere with him,

did not take up the subject, except in clinical study. But at

physical causes of the sounds. Dr. Hope and were then on

      ' Although it seems fairly established that the first or dull
sound is produced by the systole of the ventricles, and the second
or quick one by their diastole, it is by no means clearly explained
in what way these actions generate these sounds. The following
causes have been severally assigned as physically capable of
generating the first sound during the systole of the ventricles.

      ' 1. The collision of the particles of fluid in the ventricles.

(Dr. Hope.)
      ' 2. The rush of blood into the great arteries. (Mr. Carlile.)
      ' 3. The closing of the mitral and tricuspid valves. (M. Rouanet,

Dr. Billing.)
      ' 4. The muscular contraction itself.
      1. The first of these explanations is ingeniously proposed by

IDr. Hope ; but he advances no facts in direct proof of the hypo-

thesis. In a number of experiments which have made on the

Igeneration of sound, have found liquids, of all bodies, the most

difficult to excite to sonorous vibration. Although they readily
transmit vibrations already produced in solids, it requires a combi-
nation of circumstances to make them produce sound (as with the

syren). In making an experiment with a gum-elastic bottle, by

filling it with water, and then forcibly compressing it by the end of

Ithe stethoscope (avoiding the use of the hand, for that produces its

own muscular sound), have failed in producing any sound at all
approaching to that of the heart's contraction.

    ' 2. If this were true, the large arteries rather than the heart

would be the principal seat of the sound. . . .
     ' 3. The chief objection to the closing of the auricular valves

being the sole cause of the sound is, that it must be instantaneous,
and confined to the first part of the ventricular systole, whereas the
first sound is prolonged through the whole period of its action.

   I' 4. In my first edition suggested the muscular contraction

itself as a sufficient cause of the first sound.'

     After adverting to Dr. Wollaston's original observations on
muscular sound, 1 and how in its more forcible and sudden

Ivarieties, it is quite adequate to produce the sound of ventricu-

lar systole, conclude,

   I I' shall not pursue this explanation further ; for introduce it

here only interrogatively, as deserving a place among other views,
on the claims of which future observation and experiment must
decide,' p. 200.

      ' We now come to the subject of the second sound, which although

certainly occurring at the moment of the diastole of the ventricles,

has received several different explanations as to its physical cause.

The only two, which appear tenable in the present state of our

knowledge, are: 1. The reaction of the arterial columns against the

semilunar valves ; 2. The impulse of blood from the auricles refilling

the ventricles at their diastole.

'1. The first of these bears a very inviting aspect ; for the second

sound is just of that abrupt flapping character, that might be sup-

posed to result from the action of a thin valve. But it may be

objected to this view that the arteries more than the heart should

be the seat of the sound. The tense column which throws these

valves into play, should receive their shock more forcibly than the

heart, which at that moment has become flaccid, and ill adapted to

Itransmit sound through the whole of its substance. . . . Still do

not consider this view entirely disproved, and it should claim atten-

tion in future investigations.
     ' 2. This is Dr. Hope's explanation of the second sound ' ; and

                 I                    conclude, Although for
                         iIt,
after considering his arguments for   '

acoustic reasons before stated, should be inclined to place the seata

of the sound in the parietes of the ventricles, rendered momentarily

tense by the sudden influx of blood, rather than in the motions of

the fluid (Hope), incline to this cause of the second sound. It

object, these remarks should induce Dr. Hope, who has already

thrown so much light on it, to follow up the investigation until he

shall have cleared away the difficulties and doubts that at present

beset it.' Appendix to 2nd ed. 1883.

    In the publication of this second edition had number

of extra copies of the appendix on the sounds of the heart
printed for distribution among friends, to interest them in the
subject, and in the experiments which were, sooner or later,
to be performed to settle the doubtful points. But still
wished Dr. Hope to take the lead in this work, and frequently
urged him to do so, before my visit to Edinburgh. On my
return from thence, told him of my endeavour there and
again recommended him to take up the matter, offering my

assistance. In October and November following, he did make

two attempts at one of which was present but neither of

these led to any results. After further delay of two months,

it became more apparent to me that the experiments would

Inot be efficiently performed, unless took on myself the task
Iof arranging and conducting them ; and as had to prepare

a third edition of my book, which was now called for, and as

I felt bound to complete the inquiry which I had before started,
Iin February of the following year, made arrangements for

performing the experiments myself. My first step was to get

from Sir B. Brodie some woorara poison, which he had long

ago (before he knew Dr. Hope) promised me for experiments,
where it is wanted to destroy sensibility, without stopping the

heart's action ; which, by artificial respiration, may be kept up

Ifor an hour or more after death. Then obtained from the

lecturers in Kinnerton Street the use of their dissecting room ;

and explained to them the nature of the inquiry, and requested

Itheir presence and aid. Several others were also invited,
including Dr. Hope.          had several times conversed with him

on the objects and methods of the experiments ; and the

practice afterwards adopted by me was partly, but not entirely,

Isuggested by those conversations. Although availed myself

of his assistance, and that of others, the experiments were

performed entirely under my direction, and at my sole expense,

as the letters below will fully attest. l

Dear Sir, In reply to your note, I have much pleasure in stating that I

remember perfectly well your calling on me, and saying that as Dr. Hope

would not proceed with the experimental investigation of the sounds of the

heart, you intended to do so yourself : at the same time you asked me where

Iyou could procure animals, and invited me to be present at the experiments.

This was, believe, in the early part of 1835, certainly prior to the perform-
Iance of your experiments at the Kinnerton Street School.

     IIt may seem strange that should revert with so much

minuteness to a personal controversy that very little concerns

any but those immediately engaged in it : but the extra-

ordinary misrepresentation of Dr. Hope in the successive

editions of his work on ' Diseases of the Heart,' in 1835 and

1839, and reiterated after his death in a memoir published

Iby his widow, have forced upon me the duty of reply. As
already stated,              did publish in 1842 a small pamphlet

on the Sounds of the Heart, &c., and you afterwards asked me to be present

to witness certain experiments on the motions and sounds of the heart which

Iyou purposed performing on asses at the Anatomical Theatre in Kinnerton
Street.   was consequently present during the performance of the majority of

these experiments ; and on several occasions you consulted me as to the best

I Imode of performing them, and requested me to assist you, which did.

certainly considered all the experiments performed at your suggestion, and

that they were under your entire direction. Yours very faithfully,

                                                         W. H. GOOD.

     My dear Williams, IYou, remember, asked my permission to use the dis-

secting rooms in Kinnerton Street, and requested my assistance at the experi-

ments you were about to perform. You explained also to me the nature of the

Iinquiry, and desired me to peruse the appendix to which you have alluded.

certainly considered that the experiments were made under your direction, not

having had communication with any other person on the subject ; and it was

not until after their completion that I was made acquainted with Dr. Hope's

claim to participation in their arrangement. Believe me, dear Williams, yours

very faithfully,                              HENRY CHARLES JOHNSON.

   I recollect well that in February 1835, Mr. Tatum and Mr. Henry Charles

Johnson ordered me to get the room ready for Dr. Williams, that he might

Iperform some experiments. After these experiments were performed Dr.

Williams paid me for the animals, and received no order or payment from

any other person.                                      (Signed) HENRY HEMSON.

Ihad passed away from the scene of strife.  hoped that the

exact statement of the facts which appeared in my own succes-

sive editions of 1835 and 1840 would suffice to counteract past

misrepresentations ; and that truth would eventually prevail.

But all my works have now been for many years out of print ;

and in several recent allusions to these researches, impressions

arising from Dr. Hope's misstatements seem still to prevail, to
Imy discredit and disparagement.
                                         therefore feel bound to

again vindicate my character, by reproducing the narrative

with its corroborative testimony.                  will here

   IPreserving for another volume fuller details,

briefly mention the chief results obtained, which in most

respects satisfactorily decided the questions proposed in my

appendix ; and established with some precision what are the

true causes of the sounds of the heart.

That the first sound is not caused by the rush of blood into

the great arteries, is proved by several observations, in which

the first sound continued, although little or no blood could

have been thrown into the arteries. Also by the fact that the

sound is less audible over the large arteries, than over the

heart.

     That the first sound is not caused solely by the closing of
the auricular valves, is evident from its continuing when the
closure of these valves was partially or completely prevented.

     That the first sound is not produced by the collision of the
particles of fluid in the ventricles, appeared from several obser-
vations in which the sound continued, without blood in the

ventricles.

     That the first sound is produced by the muscular contrac-
tion itself, may be considered as proved by observations in
which it was heard in the heart with the valves cut, and

without blood.
     That the second sound is produced by the reaction of the

arterial columns of blood, tightening the semilunar valves at
the ventricular diastole, is clearly proved, not only by these
valves being the especial seat of the sound, but also by
numerous observations, in which the cessation, or the repro-
duction of the sound, was effected, respectively, by the suspen-
sion, or the restoration, of the action of these valves.
io8 SUCCESSFUL RESULTS. DR. HOPES CLAIM.

It being thus proved that the first sound is essentially pro-

duced by the tightening of the muscular walls of the ventricles

in their systole; and the second sound by the subsequent

sudden tightening of the semilunar valves at the ventricular

diastole, it is easy to perceive how various circumstances

regarding the blood, and regarding the respective valves, may

increase, or diminish the sounds, as they augment or impair

the degree or abruptness of the tightening or tension of these

Iparts. For further details must refer to the second volume.

And now about the ownership of these experiments. As

Dr. Hope had instituted experiments on several occasions, and

Ihad written a work on the Heart, for several years refrained
Ifrom taking up the subject ; but did what could to assist

him and to urge him to further complete his researches. But

when, after two attempts without results, he continued to leave

the matter in abeyance, and the demand of a new edition

compelled me to take the initiative, for which previous study

Iand publication on the points at issue had specially qualified me,
  then took possession of the field, by undertaking, managing,

Idirecting, carrying out the whole inquiry, and defraying all

expenses. After all this, was not a little astonished to find
that he claimed ' at least an equal share in the experiments,' on

the plea of his having ' invented the mode of performing them,'

and he disputed my right to publish them as my own. He

wished the matter to be settled by arbitration of two friends,
Inaming Sir B. Brodie as willing to act for him.
                                                  was so

convinced of the clearness of the case, that it seemed an un-

Inecessary formality to name another arbiter on my part ; and

  was quite willing to abide by Sir B. Brodie's decision, which

was as follows :

' My dear Sir,                                14 Saville Eow: March 19, 1835.

                  I understand from yours and Dr. Hope's state-

ments,

1st. That you and Dr. Hope have both been engaged for a con-

siderable time in researches respecting the pathology of the heart.
     2ndly. That Dr. Hope formerly instituted experiments with a

view to illustrate this subject, at which lie invited you to be present.
     Srdly. That since then, you and Dr. Hope have been in the habit

of discussing questions arising out of these experiments ; and that

you contemplated making others conjointly.
          S//? B. BRO DIE'S ARBITRATION.                               109

4thly. That you frequently urged Dr. Hope to proceed with the

projected experiments, but that his various engagements prevented

his doing so.
     Sthly. That at last you applied to Mr. Tatum for the use of the

new dissecting room ; procured animals for the purpose of the ex-
periments ; asked several gentlemen to assist you in making them ;

Iand invited Dr. Hope to them also.

    In addition to all this, am informed by some of the gentlemen

who assisted you, that the experiments were made almost entirely

I Iunder your direction.

    Now if these statements be correct,
                                            own that  do not see that

Dr. Hope can well complain of your making use of the experiments

in the new edition of your work now in the press; at the same time,

1 am of opinion that in doing so you should be careful to explain
what share Dr. Hope had in projecting and planning the experi-

ments in the first instance, and that you should acknowledge

whatever assistance you derived from his suggestions at the time of

Ithe experiments being made.                          B. C. BltODIE.'

views stated in my appendix.

     And the results of these experiments were more satisfactory
and decisive than any that preceded them ; and as they have
been generally confirmed by others that have been performed
since, 1 both in this country and in America, they may be con-
sidered as having laid the first foundation of a correct know-
ledge of the motions and sounds of the heart. But the
satisfaction arising out of this success was much marred by
the sad and unexpected misunderstanding and antagonism of
my former friend and fellow-collegian ; who, instead of abiding
by the decision of his own referee, whose impartiality and
competency were universally acknowledged, continued to
appropriate to himself the credit of the whole investigation,
and to deny to me even the least participation in it. But this

Hope, in August 1835, in which he had the advantage of the assistance of Drs.
Latham and Watson, and Mr. Herbert Mayo, a most able experimenter. The
results were satisfactory, and all in confirmation of the conclusions from my

experiments.

     5. Drs. Pennock and Moore, in 1839, conducted a series of observations on

the motions and sounds of the heart, confirming mainly those previously made.
They first noticed the production of sound by the auricles, when their contrac-

Ition is vigorous, in a recently slain animal. A few months after, observed

the same fact in one of Dr. C^endinning's experiments at the Marylebone

IInfirmary. In the exposed heart of a recently killed animal, the ventricles

had ceased to beat ; but saw the auricles contracting so vigorously and

regularly, that I drew Dr. C.'s attention to it, saying, ' Such motions ought to

produce sound : ' and so it proved ; each contraction gave a short distinct
sound, somewhat like a weak second sound of the heart. The fact was
recorded in the Eeport of 1838, 1839, and 1840, which formed the sixth experi-
mental contribution to this subject. Eeport of British Association, &c., 1840.

infatuation and perversion of the truth were very much con-

fined to his own publications : the chief authorities and
journalists of this country, of the Continent, and of America
accepted my designation of the experiments, as ' instituted
and performed by myself, with the assistance of Dr. Hope and

others.'
     The publication of the third edition of my work, with the

account of the Researches on the Heart, took place in March
1835, under the title ' The Pathology and Diagnosis of Diseases
of the Chest, Illustrated especially by a Eational Exposition of
their Physical Signs.'

     The work had a rapid sale in this country ; was reprinted
in America; and translated into German and Swedish.
Copious extracts appeared also in the French journals. The.
German translator, Dr. Velten, on sending me a copy of his

translation, mentioned that the book had been much recom-

Imended by Professor Nasse of Bonn. afterwards heard that

a second edition was soon called for ; and that the book was

introduced in almost all the German Medical Schools.

Ifessorial work, that had not time to do anything for the
IEoyal Society ; and seldom attended its meetings. These

meetings have become much more interesting of late years by
the admission of verbal discussion : but the internal govern-
ment and working of the society have been much hampered
by the introduction of injudicious and illegal restrictions in
the election of Fellows ; and the society appears to me to fall
far short of what its founders intended it to be, and of what it

ought to be, as the leading Scientific Society of the mightiest
civilised country in the world. This subject will claim our

attention on a future occasion.

   IIn the summer of 1835, together with my wife, visited

Dublin at the meeting of the British Association ; and we
were welcomed with true Irish hospitality ; and formed several

valued friendships, which have endured through many years
of our lives. Of these, nearly all have passed away : Sir

Henry Marsh, the Cramptons, Graves, and Stokes, E. Adams,

Hudson, McDowell, among them. Dr. Evory Kennedy
happily survives, now living in London ; and we can recall
our pleasant meetings at the Eotunda of Dublin, subsequently

at Castle Belgard ; and more recently at Cannes. That first
meeting of the Association in Dublin was a most successful
one, and displayed well the aptitude of the Irish for impromptu
discussion. The Eeport of the Dublin Committee on the

Sounds of the Heart gave occasion for a fine field-day in the

then flourishing Medical Section, 1 and my own recent experi-

ments supplied further material for a lively debate. We had

    1 In the early meetings of the Association there was a place among the
sciences for Medicine, under the section, Anatomy and Medicine. The term

was afterwards changed to Physiology ; and more recently to Biology. The
indisposition of what are now called Physicists, to fraternise with their con-

geners, Physicians, was exemplified in something which I witnessed in the

General Committee at this meeting. The ascendant party, Geologists and

Physicists, named the Marquis of Lansdowne as President of the next meet

ing at Bristol. Others thought that Dr. J. 0. Prichard, author of the Natural

History of Man, and a resident, had a better claim. The Rev. Professor
Bobison of Armagh protested that he had never heard of Dr. Prichard, and
could not tell in what department of science he was known. ' That is not Dr.
Prichard's fault ! ' cried half-a-dozen voices, among which, that of Dr. Graves,

was not the least indignant. But the nobleman prevailed over the founder of
British Anthropology ; and Lord Lansdowne became president of the Bristol

meeting.  I

a pleasant excursion among the Wicklow Mountains after the
meeting ; and returned by Liverpool, to make a first trial of
the railway to Manchester, which had not long been opened.

Although hitherto the only recreations mentioned in my

professional life have been those in art and science, it must

not be supposed that we had not also holiday excursions, like

other folks. My wife's health rendered it necessary that she

should often go out of town for change of air. Ivy Eock, a

country cottage with grounds on the high range between the

Severn and the Wye, in Gloucestershire, was frequently at her

disposal ; and there were annual visits to the sea-side, at

Kamsgate, Brighton, or Hastings. It was impossible for me

Ito indulge much in these excursions ; for even if had not

much practice to detain me, it was a primary duty to be at

home, waiting for practice, as the only chance of getting it.

But for two or three weeks in the autumn, and for two or

Ithree days at other times when not positively engaged, did

manage to snatch a few holidays ; and never without much

enjoyment and benefit.

Then before practice became very pressing, that during

the first ten years in London, was able to take pretty regular

horse exercise, which was salutary as well as enjoyable. My

could not accompany her, rode with a riding master's party,

    1836 was rather an eventful year. In the spring

menced my first course of lectures. My excellent and faithful
friend Thomas Tatum, Senior Lecturer at the Anatomical

School in Kinnerton Street, connected with St. George's
Hospital, invited me to make use of his theatre, by giving

lectures on the Diseases of the Chest. It was just the oppor-

tunity which most desired.                                  had refused to connect myself

highest quarters, and left me free to choose and treat my

subject in my own way ; and although there was no lack of

these lectures. It was not probable that many students

would come, as such lectures would not qualify for examina-

tions : but some few had expressed a wish to attend, and by

inviting the gratuitous attendance of practitioners, there was
Ia chance of an audience.
                           took great pains, making large

drawings, and diagrams, and having apparatus and models, to

render the lectures as demonstrative as possible ; knowing

from long and varied experience, how much effective teaching

depends on the exercise of all the senses, as well as of the

understanding. This demonstrative method of teaching has

now become so general, that it may seem superfluous to

Imention it ; but at that time, fifty years ago, it had hardly
been attempted.   had^in entry of nine students, and nearly

twenty physicians and surgeons ; a fair proportion continued

to attend throughout the course, which consisted of thirty

lectures, with the following title : Lectures on the Physiology

and Diseases of the Chest ; including The Principles of Phy-

sical and General Diagnosis, and their application to Practice.

Among the practitioners who introduced themselves to me

at these lectures were several estimable men, whose friendship

I enjoyed long after ; but their teacher has survived them all.

     Dr. Eoscoe, son of the Liverpool patriot ; Dr. Sandwith
of Hull, father of Dr. Humphry Sandwith, C.B., of Kars;

(who was also my pupil, later at University College) ; Dr.
Davison, who practised for some years in Paris ; Dr. Harvey,

of Leicester Square, who practiced as an aurist ; Mr. Woolley

of Brompton ; and Mr. Streeter of Harpur Street, highly
respected general practitioners. Except Dr. Davison, they

were all considerably my seniors; and evinced a rare

superiority to the common prejudice against youth and

novelty. If they derived any advantages from my instruc-
Ition, I profited also by their hints and experience ; and look

back on those courses (for it was repeated the next year) as a

afterwards to undertake.

    At the termination of these lectures, I had a hasty sum-

mons to Paris on account of a relative, whose eccentricities

had carried him beyond the tolerance of French society ; and

he was consigned to a maison de santc. His Father wrote, in
Igreat agony of mind, to urge me to go to bis rescue.
                                                       had

attended him on a former occasion for symptoms threatening

acute mania ; when he was promptly and permanently relieved

by bleeding from the temporal artery and cold douches. On

Iarriving, found he had already been bled and subjected to

warm bath with cold douche to the head, and that he was

rational, and no longer excited except from the annoyance
Iof his position.
                   ventured to release him and take him with

me, notwithstanding the protest of his doctor : ' Eh bien !

vous etes medecin, et devez savoir : mais prenez garde a lui ;

c'est un homme tres fort, tres puissant, et il est tout capable
Ia vous tuer ! '
                  kept him with me a few days in apartments,

without any attendant ; and as he proved quite tractable, and

Idid no further harm than boring me with his conversation,

returned to England, leaving him at Eouen, to follow at

leisure. He recovered completely; and although always

eccentric, had no return of the malady for several years, when

it did recur at intervals until his death a few years ago at

the age of seventy. I always had a strong disinclination to

undertake the care of cases of insanity, and as a rule re-

fused to do so, referring them to those physicians who had

made mental diseases a special study. My friend Sir Thomas

Watson long ago told me that he did the same.

   ISoon after my return from Paris, when riding in quest of

a country retreat for the autumn, was thrown by my horse

rearing, and falling backwards ; and my right collar-bone was

Ibroken. It was the only fall from horseback that ever had.

Although skilfully treated by my friends Brodie and Tatum,

II was partially disabled for two months. Nevertheless,

managed to attend the meeting of the British Association at
Bristol ; being concerned in the First Report to be made of the

ILondon Committee on the Heart Sounds, with Drs. Clendinning

and Todd ; and had also a paper to communicate to the
BRITISH ASSOCIATION AT BRISTOL.  117

Physical Section on the construction of Ear-trumpets. These

subjects have been already referred to. On this occasion we
were guests of Dr. and Mrs. Francis Fox, at Brislington,
long intimate friends of my wife. We met there Dr. Henry

of Manchester, the eminent chemist, and his son, Dr. W. H.

IHenry, whom have the pleasure to count among my

excellent and congenial friends to the present time: his
admirable wife, and several members of his family having

been under my professional care.

     This meeting of the British Association, if not so brilliant
as that at Dublin, was full of interest ; and a great sensation
was caused by the ovations of Messrs. Sedgwick, Murchison,
Conybeare, and others, in unearthing a native philosopher,
Mr. Andrew Cross, who, unknown in the wilds of the Mendip
hills, had been pursuing profound and wonderful researches in

galvanic and terrestrial science with unexpected results. There
was Oomething fascinating in such vast modes of interrogating

Inature by miles of electricity and months of action ; but do

not know that any definite response came out of it. But

when the same rustic genius a while after discovered the
evolution of an acarus from a solution of silica, faith in native

philosophy suffered an abatement. The meetings of the
British Association were enlivened by the enthusiasm with

which anything like discovery was received ; and although
not always confirmed by the test of more deliberate and strict

inquiry, the encouragement given was a genial contrast to
the censorious spirit often predominating in the deliberations

of the Eoyal Society.

      On returning to London after this meeting, both my wife
and myself felt the need of some change, more than that of
an ordinary holiday in the country. So we arranged to take
 a leisurely journey on horseback, through Kent, Surrey, and

 Sussex, making Seven Oaks, Tunbridge Wells, and Hastings,
 our chief halting places. Travelling from ten to fifteen miles

 a day ; and continuing daily excursions from the several
 stations, wo enjoyed many hours in the open air in delightful

 scenery ; and with very moderate fatigue. My broken bone

 soon united : and we both gained flesh and strength in a more

 satisfactory in.-iniiei-. than in an ordinary country or sea-side

  excursion.
ii8 MY FATHER'S DEATH. BIRTH OF A SON.

On our return early in October, we were met at Eltham

by a messenger on horseback, with a letter announcing the

Iserious illness of my Father at Ryde, now in his eighty- seventh

year. Thither immediately repaired ; and found him suffer-

ing from an apoplectic stroke ; which prostrated his mental and

bodily powers, and in a few days terminated his life.

That he was loved and venerated by all his children, was

the normal result of a long life of probity and amiability of

Icharacter, and of paternal affection which never failed : but

more than others, seemed to owe him affection and gratitude,

for the indulgence with which he had yielded to my bias in

favour of studies not familiar to him, and had afforded the
Imeans to pursue them on an extended scale.
                                             was thankful

Ithat his life was spared long enough to be gratified at my

success ; and, was told by my sister, that in the last year of

his life, nothing secular gave him so much pleasure a,s the

news, that the book, which he first urged me to publish, was

translated into foreign languages. How much more blessed

the translation of his own name to the Lamb's Book of Life,

among those, who through the atoning Blood, have their names

written in Heaven !

He had been blessed with a vigorous constitution, and

performed his duties in the ministry for upwards of sixty

years, with hardly any intermission ; usually taking three

services on every Sunday, until about two years before his

death. He owed more to the natural vigour of his health,

than to salubrious habits. He used to pass most of his time

in reading and writing ; only once or twice a week mounting

his horse for a long ride and a gallop on the downs. He was

a firm believer in the salutary effects of cold water; and

many years persisted in the daily use of a douche bath at a

mill-pond. He used to tell us of the wonderful success, which

had resulted from his recommendation of the use of cold

affusion in desperate cases, at a period, long before that of

Dr. Currie, or the modern water-cure.

     One event, which would have much gratified my dear
Father, had he lived to know was the birth of grandson,
which occurred in the following spring. We had been married
                     it,
                                                        a

more than six years ; and had almost given up thoughts of
having children, when this surprise came ; and strange to
tell, was followed by eight more births in the course of the

next twelve years. It would be ungrateful not to acknow-

ledge the gracious dealings of God in thus bestowing His

blessings with considerate delay, at times better suited to our

circumstances, than if the charge and anxiety connected with a

large family had come earlier. Six years without those blessed

encumbrances, gave time to my wife to recover health under

the trying change from country to town ; and left me more
free to work at the literature and practice of my profession,

Ithan could have been, with an early intrusion of little ones.

     As it was, we were well established in housekeeping and

town life before the family came ; and although my pro-

fessional income was considerably less than my repute, and
did not come up to a third of my expenses, it was steadily on
the increase, especially in consultation practice, and did not
seem likely to slacken. My lectures in Kinnerton Street were
repeated the following year, with fewer paying students, but
more practitioners ; who although they paid no fees, brought

patients, and benefited me by friendly interest.

IN the two winter seasons about this period, the Harveian

ISociety and the Westminster Medical Society did me the

honour of electing me president ; and frequently attended

Itheir meetings. Among several communications which
made on these occasions, I may mention one, ' On the Acoustic

Principle of Percussion,' which was printed in the 'London
Medical Gazette ' in January 1837, and has hardly ever been
noticed since, although it was mentioned by Dr. Forbes at

Ithe time, as marking progress in the subject.
         pointed out that the ordinary sounds of pectoral percus-
sion do not depend on the longitudinal vibrations of the hollow
in the lungs and air tubes ; otherwise they would be altered
by closing the glottis, or by varying the size of that hollow in
breathing which they are not: but stroke sounds depend
on the transverse vibrations of the solids -chest-walls and con-
tents and are longer, freer, and deeper or more resonant,
when these are more aereal, as well as solid shorter, more
frequent and of higher pitch, where the chest and its contents
are more solid, and less aereal and shorter, and more dead
and dull, with only liquid or soft solid underneath the walls.
DRS. JOHNSON AND ADDIS ON.  121

Where tubes come near the surface, as at the trachea, the
longitudinal vibrations become audible in the tubular note,
which is stopped by closing the glottis. And where tympanic

cavities lie underneath, as over pneumothorax, and over

stomach, or intestines, a drumlike note and tinkling echo are

added to the transverse vibrations, giving different varieties
of tympanic, humoric, and tinkling sounds. This view calls

attention further to the state of the walls of the chest, or

abdomen, as capable of increasing, diminishing, or deadening
the sounds, by the respective properties, elasticity, rigidity,

or flaccidity ; and, if fully followed out in detail, will aid

much in explaining and guiding the methods and practice of

percussion.

   IIn connection with the Westminster Medical Society,

cannot miss the opportunity of recalling a pleasing remi-
niscence of two men, who took a prominent part in its discus-
sions at that time, Dr. James Johnson, and Dr. Thomas

Addison. The former was the enterprising and indefatigable
founder and editor of the ' Medico- Chirurgical Eeview,' a
journal of considerable circulation and great utility, which by

analytic reviews and periscopic reports, made known to the
profession a great amount of the medical literature and news
of the time. But in the debating society he was by no means

a bookworm or dogmatic critic. In his North Irish brogue,

and racy narrative, he would recount his practical experiences
in a way acceptable to his audience, chiefly general prac-
titioners; and although himself a sufferer from hypochon-

driasis and indifferent health ; he always seemed genial and
hearty in society. Dr. Thomas Addison was a man of much
higher abilities. As a lecturer and speaker, he had few equals ;
and as a clinical teacher and hospital Physician, he was most
successful. His partiality for the Westminster Medical
Society was remarkable and of great service to it : but he was
rather a nervous shy man, and hardly attained in the pro-

fession the position for which his talents and attainments

qualified him.
     The Harveian Society was first formed by Dr. Willi.-nu

Stroud, for the meeting of medical practitioners in the North
          of London, to read papers and discuss matters of profes-
122 DR. STROUD REPORT ON MURMURS.

sional interest. Dr. Stroud was a learned earnest man, with
strong religious convictions, but much intelligence, and with
a vein of natural humour, which enlivened his speeches and
made him an agreeable debater. He wrote a history of the
Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh ; and more recently an
essay on the Death of Christ, which he attributed to rupture
of the heart. He was the first to introduce the use of the
flexible stethoscope, which has peculiar advantages for certain

purposes.

    In the summer of 1837, 1 worked for the Second Eeport of

the London Committee of the British Association on the

Sounds of the Heart ; and I obtained the principal facts,

before joining with Dr. Todd, Professor of Anatomy at King's
College, who was to be my confederate. Our subject wyas
chiefly directed to the causes of those remarkable and various
accompaniments of the heart's action, called murmurs, which
were compared by Laennec to the noises of blowing, filing,
rasping, sawing, purring, cooing, &c. In my first publication
in 1828, was the following opinion :

    I' am disposed to think that were we better acquainted with the

laws of the production of sound, we might find that it may be
excited by the motions of liquids, as well as by that of air, in or
against solids of a particular form l ; and that we might find a
satisfactory explanation of the phenomena in question in the moving
 mass of blood being thrown into sonorous vibration by some modi-
fication in its course. Such a modification might be produced by
thickening or irregularity in one of the valves of the heart, or by
 spasmodic action of some of the columns carneae, by any obstacle
in the calibre of an artery, &c. ; and these causes might, as in the
 analogous case of air, render the passage of the blood sonorous,
 instead of, as it usually is, silent.'

      These anticipations were fully verified by the results of our
 experiments. Dr. Corrigan and others at Dublin had already
 found that the passage of water through india-rubber tubes
 could produce sounds like the bruit de soufflet ; but he ascribed

       t The invention of the Siren by M. Cagniard de Latour, has experimentally
 demonstrated this acoustic principle by the production of, not only sounds,
 but musical notes, by a motion of a liquid in tubes, and through apertures.

them to undulations in the water beyond the obstruction,
rather than to vibrations in the tube itself. A few extracts

from the report will suffice to show the conclusive character of

the experiments.

     ' 1. A caoutchouc tube, 18 inches long and |ths of an inch in
diameter, was attached to the stopcock of a reservoir, in which
was water to the depth of from 8 to 10 inches. When the water
flowed perpendicularly through this tube, (the air being first ex-
pelled, and the lower end of the tube kept under water in a recipient

below,) no sound was heard : but on pressing any part of the tube,
so as to diminish its calibre, a blowing sound occurred at and below

the point of pressure ; and this sound became louder and more
whizzing, as the pressure was increased. The loudest sounds were

heard at the lowest end of the tube, (where the current was
strongest), and they sometimes became quite musical; and by in-
creasing the pressure at regular intervals, a periodic increase, and
raising of the tone was produced, closely resembling the sound in

....the neck, to which the French have given the name of ' bruit

de diable.'
     ' 3. The same tube being adapted to the stopcock of a water

supply-pipe, through which a current could be let to pass with
more or less force, it was found possible to imitate every variety of
blowing, whizzing, or musical murmurs, by varying the pressure
on, or the obstruction in, the tube, or by altering the force of the
current. When the current was strong, the least obstruction caused
a murmur ; but with weaker currents, a greater obstruction became
necessary for the same effect. An obstruction which, with a weak
current, caused a blowing sound, gave with a stronger current, one
of more whizzing character. Grating or rasping sounds were best
obtained by the action of a strong current on a knotted thread
across the diameter of the tube. The musical or uniform sounds

resulted from a moderately strong current through a considerable
impediment : increasing the force of the current, or the degree of
obstruction, rendered them whizzing and imperfect : diminishing
the current or the obstruction, converted them into a simple blow-
ing. When a sound was of an appreciable pitch, its note was
higher in proportion to the force of the current and the amount of

obstruction a fine forcible stream producing the highest note.
Sometimes, however, with a strong current, a loud trumpet note
would be set up, which was not altered in pitch, but only in force,
by changing the strength of the current. This kind of note
produced visible and palpable vibrations of the tube below the
124 EXPERIMENTS ON CARDIAC MURMURS.

obstruction, and seemed to have relation to the length of the tube.

In many instances these vibrations closely resembled the purring

tremors and thrilling vibration, sometimes felt in the region of the
heart and large arteries. Musical sounds of a more variable
character, like the cooing of a dove, the humming of a fly, or the
whistling of wind, were produced with weak currents passing
through a tube much obstructed. The pressure of a column only
two or three inches high, was sufficient to give acute whistling
notes, which were sustained, although varying, even when the water,
that passed, fell only in drops from the end of the tube.' . . .

     ' From these and other experiments it was plain, that a partial
obstruction, causing vibrating resistance to the current, is the essen-
tial physical cause of all murmurs produced by the motions of
liquids through tubes. That any condition of the walls beyond the
obstructing point is not, as it has been supposed, essential to the
production of these sounds, is proved by the fact that they may be
produced by an obstruction at the terminal orifice of the tube,

where there is no tube beyond to cause them.' . . . ' In short the

laws of the production of sounds in liquids so closely resemble those
which regulate the same phenomena in air, that it is unnecessary to
enter into further detail.'

      Some of the above experiments were repeated with water
rendered glutinous with size ; and it was found that the sounds

were not so readily produced, as with plain water, and required
a greater force of current. This explains the fact that mur-
murs occur more in the living body, in states of anaemia, when
the blood is thin and more like water.

     The Committee made observations on the production of
murmurs in the arteries and veins of the living body ; and
found them all amenable to the same laws. They confirmed
the discovery, recently made by Dr. Ogier Ward, that the re-
markable continuous murmur often heard in the neck, called
by the French, bruit de monchc, or bruit dc fliablc, has its seat
in the jugular vein, and can be arrested by pressure on the

vein above.

    IOne point in this report needs correction ; and feel called

on more to make as the inaccuracy lay with myself.
states that the Committee found venous murmurs to occur not
only in clilorotic or anfemic subjects, but also in healthy in-
dividuals. Now the supposed healthy individual was myself,

Inot considering that I was otherwise than healthy. But
Iafterwards had reason to conclude that was not at that time

in good health, and that my blood was in a poor condition.
Further experience proved to me that murmurs in general,
and venous murmurs particularly, are more readily produced
in anaemic persons, as stated by Andral and Bouillaud : and
this admission negatives the qualifying clause of the last con-

clusion.

     ' Although it appears that the venous sounds are not necessarily
signs of disease, yet the circumstance proved by the Committee,
that water is thrown into sonorous vibrations more readily than a
liquid of more glutinous character, renders it probable that these
and other sounds, depending on the motion of liquids in the circu-
lation, may be more easily produced where the blood is thin and
deficient in quantity ; and under these circumstances, they may
occur in the neck, from the mere pressure of the muscles on the

jugular veins.'

The report was presented to the Medical Section of the

British Association at its first meeting at Liverpool in 1837.

   I have a vivid recollection of attending service in the

church of the Rev. Hugh McNeile, on the Sunday preceding the
Imeeting.  did not know him, but I was at once struck by the

manner in which he read the service ; solemn, emphatic, and

expressive ; with a noble barytone voice an utterance so

distinct, that not a syllable was lost ; and a cadence so natural,

as to be free from either monotony, or sing-song : the prayers

were devoutly prayed : the Scriptures, simply and reverently

read, as the word of God : and the sermon spoken, with the
Iearnestness and eloquence becoming a message from God.
Ithink that never heard a more perfect specimen of pulpit
Ioratory.
           do not recollect the text ; but the chief subject was

the utter inadequacy of human science to teach man religion.

The sermon did not meet with the full approval of the philo-

Isophers, who discussed it at the hotel where was staying :

the Eev. Professor Sedgwick, especially, denouncing it as

' flimsy and narrow-minded surely science gives some light

of religion; though it be but a glimmering.' I think the
Professor's view is supported by Bom. i. 19, 20. I have long

been led to regard the book of nature, no less than the book
 126 SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS.

of Eevelation, as God's word and work ; to be reverently and
truthfully, but naturally, studied and interpreted, through the
senses and intellect, with which He has endowed us ; even as
the Revealed Word is to be received supernaturally, through
faith in the Incarnate Word, and the inspiration of God's Holy
Spirit.

    IAs Dr. Todd was not present at the meeting, had the sole

charge of the Report on the Heart's Sounds ; and conducted
the experimental demonstrations in a manner, which seemed

Ito satisfy the Medical Section, which was numerously attended.

   recollect that Dr. Copland and Dr. James Johnson, who
were present, were particularly delighted at my imitations of
all the bruits or murmurs de soufflet, de rape, de scie, de mouche,
de diable, fremissement cataire, &c., which they had been in the
habit of hearing and describing, as occurring in the human
body. An attempted popular exposition of the same subject
at the General Meeting was not equally successful. The
appointed president of the Medical Section did not come ; and
Dr. Peter Mark Roget asked me to propose him to fill the

Ioffice, which did ; not without some misgiving, for although

he had done good work in his time, and was very long a
Secretary of the Royal Society, he was now by no means a
man for the occasion. Yet he took it into his head to attempt
to make our report the theme of a public address, ' On the dis-

Icovery of the language of the heart.' So had to coach him
Iup in the subject, which was no easy matter. As had to leave
Ibefore the end of the meeting, did not witness the result :
Ibut my friend, Dr. C. Lingen of Hereford, (whom met on the

top of a coach on his journey home), told me that he was
present, and saw Dr. Roget, gesticulating on the platform, with
a stethoscope in his hand ; but neither he, nor the greater part
of the audience, heard a word of what he said. What an utter
absurdity in the arrangement of public meetings, to entrust an
address to a person who has neither voice to make himself
heard, nor capacity to make himself understood !

THE chief professional event which marked 1838, was the
publication, in the ' London Medical Gazette,' of the Lectures

Ion the Physiology and Diseases of the Chest, which had
delivered hi Kinnerton Street ; and I have reason to think

that nothing that had hitherto occurred in my career, had
tended so much to advance my reputation. My previous
publications were either not practical in their character, or
were chiefly designed for the use of students. But the
' Medical Gazette ' had a large circulation among medical

Ipractitioners, and it was not long before received expressions

of encouragement and approval from several of authority and
eminence. The publishers liberally provided excellent wood
engravings of some of my drawings ; and when the thirty
lectures were 1 all printed they formed an octavo pamphlet of
 upwards of 200 double-column pages of small type, containing
more matter than an ordinary octavo volume of five or six

hundred pages. I had only 50 copies struck off for presenta-

 tion : but it was proposed to me to publish them as a separate
128 DIAGNOSIS OF VALVULAR MURMURS.

Ivolume.   thought it better, however, to improve and enlarge

it by further experience and fuller illustration, so as to make it

Ia more complete work on Diseases of the Chest. This object

Inever accomplished ; as soon after became so fully occupied
by Professional duties and practice, that I had not time for the

publication of large works. In the meantime, much of the

matter of the lectures appeared in the third volume of Tweedie's

' Library  of Medicine     '  and portions  relating to pathology and
                        ;

diagnosis, in the fourth edition of my original work, published

in 1840.

But one advantage resulted, and still results to me, in the

publication of these lectures in 1838, by establishing the

priority of my claim to certain points in the diagnosis and

pathology of disease. The most important of these refers to

the principles of physical diagnosis in valvular disease of the

Iheart, which claim to have been the first to discover and

make known to the profession. Details must be reserved for

a later volume ; but as the ground of my claim seems to have

Ibeen little known, I think that owe it to myself to give here

a brief statement of the facts. 1

In his original work on ' Diseases of the Heart,' published

in 1831, Dr. Hope attempted a diagnosis between different

valvular lesions, by the situation of the murmurs : that the
disease of a particular valve may be known by the murmur

being heard best at a spot on the walls of the chest nearest to

that valve, and by the murmur being whizzing or deep toned,

according to the proximity or remoteness of the valve from

the walls of the chest. The same view was continued in

his second edition of 1835 ; although he there modified his

opinions regarding the natural sounds, in conformity with the
results of my experiments, which he called his own. In my

Ithird edition which appeared also in 1835, proved by ex-

perience, as well as in theory, that the true ground of distinc-

tion lay, not in the respective position of the valves, (which
are really too close together to be discriminated), but in the

different directions in which the sonorous currents spread the

sounds, and in the different manner in which they are transmitted

Ito the walls of the chest. Thus the aortic murmurs, which

termed obstructive, are best heard, not only over the aortic

valves, but also at and above the base of the heart, in the direc-

tion of the aorta and great branches. The regurgitant mitral

is to be heard, less over the mitral orifice, which lies back,

covered with lung, but more below the breast, where beats the

apex, which through the tightened cords and fleshy columns,

conducts the sound straight from the vibrating orifice. This

and other considerations, which it is not necessary to specify

further, first established the distinction between basic and

apex murmurs, which is now so familiar ; and these rules of

diagnosis were confirmed and enlarged by observations of cases

Iwhich published in the ' Medical Gazette ' in March 1836.

They were also more fully developed in the lectures of 1836

and 1837, and now published in 1838. It was not until after

all this, that in August 1838, in a journal, and in his third edi-

tion in 1839, Dr. Hope announced similar views as his own,

without even a mention of my previous publications.

    It is painful to me to have to record the occurrence of

misunderstandings and acts of hostility, which broke up a

friendship of long standing, and led to dissensions which must

have been distressing to both parties, and which unhappily

were never properly set right. Dr. Hope was my senior as a

Istudent, and at St. George's Hospital : and so far was from

Ithinking of competing with him, that on several occasions

when was privately encouraged by some of the medical

officers to come forward as candidate for the office of assistant

I Iphysician, or lecturer, refused to do so, that might not

interfere with his claims; and the same disposition was

publicly declared, when on the occasion of his election to the
Ioffice of assistant physician,
                                 announced my intention of

withdrawing in his favour. Even after the first misunder-

Istanding about the experiments, assumed no attitude of

hostility ; and neither in my third edition of 1835, nor in the

lectures published in 1838, were there any expressions, beyond

those of fair and temperate criticism. It was quite otherwise

with the language and spirit of Dr. Hope's third edition, pub-
lished in 1839. Not only did the unqualified manner in which

 he excluded me from the experiments, imply an imputation of
 fraud and untruthfulness on my part ; but the bitterness with
 which he cavilled at and attacked almost every statement,
 disclosed an animosity, which seemed implacable, whilst his

 misrepresentations were such as to render further argument

 hopeless.

     In this state of things, the resignation of Dr. Chambers

Icaused a vacancy in the office of physician to St. George's

 Hospital, and was urged by many friends to offer myself for
 the office in opposition to Dr. Hope, who was already assistant
 Physician. This was a strong measure, and one warranted
 only by unusual circumstances. Dr. Hope was a very accom-
plished man, and of undoubtedly high abilities ; but he carried
his pretensions so high as to render himself unpopular with
many. Without discussing the grounds of this unpopularity,
this, together with his recent conduct towards me, determined
many of the influential governors of the hospital to offer me
their support, and among these were all the visiting apothe-
caries and two of the surgeons of the hospital. The medical
staff, as a body, decided not to support either candidate ; which
seemed to imply that they would leave the field open for each
competitor to fight his own battle. And so the canvassing

Iwent on for two or three days, and had a large promise of

votes. But we soon found that we were hardly warranted in
persevering in the course which we had commenced. What-
ever may have been his defects, Dr. Hope's claims, from being
already in office, and having creditably performed its duties
for a considerable time, were too weighty to be set aside.

Most of the medical staff, although they refused to support
him in a body, now declared their intention of voting for him.
One of them said, ' Dr. Hope has had a slap in the face, and
he deserved it : but he is our colleague, and we don't intend
to turn him out.' As soon as this feeling became manifest,

I Iimmediately retired from the contest, which should never
Ihave begun, had not been led to suppose that the majority

of the staff would support me. From the sequel it appears,
that they only made my movement the means of administering
a rebuke to a pretentious colleague.

     Although this termination of my connection with St.

IGeorge's Hospital was a temporary disappointment, felt that

it was to be preferred to either, my being elected, to what

might seem an unfair exclusion of my opponent, or to my

waiting for another vacancy, whilst he continued in an attitude

of open hostility. It had been altogether distressing to be

thus thrust into a quarrel with an old friend, at a juncture, as

critical to him, as it was to me ; and became a matter of more
Ipainful regret to myself afterwards, (what did not know at
Ithe time), that he was then suffering from ill health.
                                                         must

conclude this subject with one more extract from the ' Eeply

to statements in the Memoir of Dr. Hope ' before referred to.

     ' The only remaining point which requires explanation, is the

Istatement that declined an arbitration proposed by the Eev. Mr.
INiven, chaplain of St. George's Hospital. Now, can appeal to
IMr. Niven,' (and have his letters) ' in support of my assertion, that
Iup to the summer of 1839, was most desirous that the difference
Ishould be adjusted ; for entertained no feeling of resentment ; nor

was it on my part, that the alienation bad begun. It was not till that

summer, that Dr. Hope expressed to Mr. Niven his wisb for another

arbitration with a view to reconciliation. This was in the midst of
the contest for the election, which of course prevented me from

entertaining the subject at that time. Shortly afterwards, how-

Iever, made many attempts to bring the matter to arbitration ;

having solicited several eminent men, whose position in tbe profes-
sion would, it was hoped, make their decision final, to undertake

Itbe office ; but could not prevail on them to do so. At last, at

Itbe recommendation of Dr. Latham, applied to tbe Censors of the

College of Physicians, with the proposal that, in their official

capacity, they should arbitrate between two members of their

College. The Censors' board, after some deliberation, declined to

Iact in tbe matter. Thus baffled in all my attempts to effect an

arbitration, was in the meantime obliged to defend myself against
imputations conveyed by statements in tbe third edition of Dr.

IHope's work, which although published in May, did not see until

August of that year. These statements, botb by their matter, and
by their tone, destroyed in my mind, all bope of reconciliation, and

Iexcited me to publish a reply, the warmth of which now regret,
Ialthough cannot deviate from its substance.

Iduration ; and for many months before Dr. Hope's death, declared

to several persons who were aware of tbe dispute, (some of them

Ihis own relatives), that although believed he was under misappre-
Ihensions with regard to my conduct, retained no feeling of ani-

mosity towards him.

   I' In conclusion, after reading the ' Memoir,' can only lament
I(and in saying this hlame myself) that the bond of peace was not

more earnestly sought and openly displayed between those who pro-

fessed to be followers of Him who is the Prince of Peace.' 1842.

     The disappointment of my prospects at St. George's Hos-
pital was not unmixed with signs of encouragement from other
quarters. My private practice and professional reputation were
increasing more than at any former period ; and from opponents

Ias well as supporters in the late contest, received numerous

assurances of the most friendly esteem and appreciation. 1

IBut what most missed, was the hospital field of work : for
Ialthough had no other footing in the hospital than that of a
Iperpetual pupil, and governor, yet had the freest access to

the wards and post-mortem rooms ; and several of the phy-

Isicians treated me rather as a colleague than as a pupil ; so

that could carry on my own observations of the cases, and

Igain the experience of hospital practice. This felt bound to
Igive up, as no longer intended to become a candidate. No

1 The following genial letter from Dr. Chambers will suffice as a sample.

' My dear Dr. Williams,  I ' Brook Street : June 1839.

                           am indeed grieved to find that you have taken
Iso much to heart your disappointment at St. George's Hospital. No one,
I Iassure you, feels for you more than myself ; although confess do not view

your present failure so gloomily as you do, in looking at your future prospects.

Your want of success had, in fact nothing to do with your comparative merits,

I Ibut was the result of circumstances which neither you nor any of your friends

could control. For myself can only say that have now been well acquainted

Iwith you for many years, and have seen much of you both in private, and at

the hospital : and in both characters, mean as a student and practitioner,

I have been struck with your talents and high professional attainments. At
Ithe hospital, indeed, with regard to all that concerns auscultation, have been
your pupil rather than your instructor. IOf your lectures and writings need
not speak, for they are known and appreciated by all medical men. With

Ithese impressions on my own mind, (which I am persuaded are very general

ones,) cannot understand how you can for a moment suppose that in re-

tiring from the contest at the hospital you are regarded by any one of those
connected with the institution, except as a distinguished Physician, whom,
had circumstances permitted it, they would have been proud to accept as their

co lleague and associate.

     I shall always, I assure you, cordially cherish your regard and esteem, and

  emain, my dear Dr. Williams, your obliged and faithful friend,

doubt I should have felt the loss of my chief occupation much

more, if my thoughts had not been diverted with a novel and

Iextra professional object of interest, to which had been direct-

ing attention in the construction of two- wheeled carriages.

      The Hansom cabs had then just been introduced, and com-

mended themselves, above the four-wheelers, by their greater

ease and speed ; and above gigs, old cabs, and all other two-

wheeled carriages, by their greater safety as well as ease ; and

these advantages have rendered them popular down to the
present day. But they are clumsy, heavy machines ; most
trying to the horse, especially in going up or down hill, when
their lumbering shaft-frames tilt up, or bear down on the poor
brute, in the way most calculated to embarrass his movements.

      By a careful scientific study of the principles, on which

Itwo wheeled carriages should be constructed, arrived at the

following conclusions :
      1. The draught of the horse should be as directly as

possible from the axle to the shaft, so that the whole force of
the horse shall be directed to onward motion, and none lost

and misdirected in other ways, as when the horse draws from

the carriage or springs, which causes shaking, as well as loss

of power.
      2. Instead of the springs which bear the carriage being

faced on the axle, they ought to hang from the axle, by an
attachment which admits of a certain amount of motion, sc
limited by stays, as to make the weight of the carriage bear
perpendicularly on level ground, but bear down on the shafts
in going up hill, and bear up under the shafts, in going down
hill. This property of self adjustment of weight depends on
the centre of gravity of the carriage being placed below the
axle, instead of being, as in gigs and other common two

wheeled carriages, above the axle.
      3. The wheels should be large and the axle high; and

the nearer the seat of the carriage is to the axle, as the centre
of motion, the less will be its motion ; in fact, the steadier will
it be: but in addition to this steadiness, the seat must be
saved from shock or jars of sudden motion or collision, whether
from the movements of the horse or from the concussion of
134 IMPROVEMENTS FOR EASE AND SAFETY.

the wheels against hardness and irregularities in the road.

This softening or buffing process is effected, not only by the

springs, which yield while they resist, but also by the moveable

joints between the axle and the springs, which break every shock

from the horse, or from the wheels, before it can reach either

springs or seat. The seat, in short, hangs like a cradle by sus-

pension ; comparatively still and free, both from the joltings

of the paces of the horse, and from the roughnesses of the road.

     These principles, calculated and carried out in diagrams

Iand drawings, brought to the test of experiment in a coach-

builder's yard ; and soon became convinced of their correctness

and practicability. To work them out further in detail in the

construction of a carriage for my own trial and use, was an-

other occupation of interest and amusement ; which culminated

in its completion in due time ; and in a delightful drive, with
my wife and two children, in my new ' Underhung ' two wheeled

carriage to Eichmond.

Making allowances for a few imperfections in details of the

mechanism, which further experience soon rectified, this new

invention was certainly a remarkable success ; fulfilling all my

expectations as to the ease, safety, and light and fleet traction,

to a degree surpassing anything that had been accomplished

in a two wheel carriage hitherto. Its ease was compared by

my friend Dr. Neil Arnott to sitting in a lounging chair, and

this was but little disturbed in trotting over a stony road, or

when the horse broke into a gallop ; so little did the wheel or

horse motions reach the suspended seat. It was impossible to

upset it ; and even should the horse fall down, the shafts

might suffer, but the seat of the carriage could be hardly dis-

turbed from its level: so there was no chance of the rider

being ever thrown out. Its inconvenience lay chiefly in the

seat being low for driving, and exposing the riders to mud

Iand dust. These were avoided in another carriage, which

had built 40 years later, by having a high driving seat, like

Ithat of a Hansom ; and by high splash leathers.
     Beguiled by this invention fancy, was next tempted by

suggestions of friends to take out a patent ; and proceeded to

Idevise other forms of carriages and cars, open and closed, to
which the same principle could be applied.  found it quite
      MORE PRAISE THAN PROFIT.                    135

applicable to light and heavy carts, with or without springs ;it;a
and by throwing the weight below, instead of above the axle,it,
likely to lighten, or equalise much, the weight under which the  it
horse has to struggle. The plan seemed especially suited for
A
ambulance carriages, as securing greater ease for the wounded,;
even on the rugged ground and with the hasty paces of the
battle field. And 1 believe to this day, that the same principlesI
well worked out and utilised, by able hands, and with propera
materials, are capable of effecting much good in various ways
ato both man and beast.

   'IBut was soon reminded by calls to weightier matters,

that good and useful as this diversion was in its way, it was
not in my line of business ; and that there were higher and
better objects, to claim the attention and the devotion of the

whole mind. The patent was therefore turned over to a
solicitor, to make what he could of which proved to be, as
in the case of nine-tenths of these patents nothing. The

only practical results of my invention were; the carriage
then built for my own use, (which, easy and pleasant as
was for country trips, soon had to be replaced by brougham
suited for my town work and increasing practice) and forty
years later, another carriage on the same plan, for my retire-

ment and although this was defective through having been
built of bad materials, yet has carried me safely, swiftly, and
pleasantly, along the roads of Cannes during the last six years.

SHORTLY after my retirement from St. George's Hospital, my

friend and late pupil, Dr. Richard Eoscoe, called to ask me
Iwhether had thought of making application for the Pro-
Ifessorship of Medicine at University College ?
                                                 replied in

the negative, adding that the time for making such application

had some time expired. Being intimate with some members

of the Council of the College, he was able to inform me, that if

I had a mind to apply, it was not too late. Profiting by this
Ihint, lost no time in calling on my friend Professor Sharpey,

who confirmed Dr. Roscoe's report, and advised me at once to

send in my application.

    It is unnecessary to enter into a description of the position

and prospects of University College at that time. They had

already become established on a firm footing, and begun an

enterprising and successful career ; especially as regards the

Medical School. Founded about a dozen years before, under
             CANDIDATE FOR PROFESSORSHIP.  137

the title of University of London, by Lord Brougham and his

associates in the twofold cause of full Liberty of Conscience,

and active Diffusion of Knowledge ; and making its appoint-

ments on the sole ground of merit and ability, irrespective of

creed, connection or patronage, the College had attracted a

large staff of able professors, who were carrying out their

plans of instruction on a scale, and with appliances, which

had never been attempted before. The result, with regard to

the Medical classes, was even in these few years, the accession

of so many students, as to considerably outnumber those of

any other school in London. Although this early success had

been a good deal disturbed by various dissensions which had

occurred, (and were to be expected in a body inspired by
liberty and popularity,), yet in the medical profession, there

was a strong tide of feeling in favour of the new liberal

institution, with already marked confidence in favourite

professors.

Although never a keen politician, my convictions and

Iinclinations were always in favour of liberty and reform ; and

no one who, as did, so much preferred natural knowledge to

classical learning, could fail to sympathise with all efforts

to increase and diffuse knowledge, against all oppositions

of antique prejudice and ignorance. Devoutly believing in

revealed religion, as a reality, above the domain of natural

Iknowledge, acknowledge its paramount claims on the faith
Iand obedience of man ; but never found reason to believe

that its influence is limited to, or much promoted by, enforced

attendance on the lifeless forms of gabbled words of a

college chapel. But that is a matter of individual opinion :
I Iothers think differently.
             state thus much to show that

held no views opposed to the practice of University College, in

teaching secular knowledge apart from any form of religion ;

and that I admired and approved of the example, which that

Institution had already held out, of making that knowledge as

extensive and complete as possible.
     The election of the Professor was vested in the Council of

the College, under the advice of the Senate, consisting of the

Professors of the Faculty of Medicine and some from the

Faculty of Arts. I was requested to send in testimonials,
138 OTHER CANDIDATES DRS. COPLAND, M. HALL, &c.

Iwith the intimation that a few only would be necessary, as

was already well known to several of the Professors. Those

sent, were from Drs. Chambers and Macleod, and Sir B.

Brodie, physicians and surgeon to St. George's Hospital, Sir

James Clark, and Dr. Neil Arnott.

The resignation of Dr. Elliotson, which occasioned the

vacancy, was caused, by his being prohibited by the Council

from practising Mesmerism in the Hospital. The story is

well known and need not be repeated. But Dr. Elliotson

was a favourite with the pupils, some of whom vehemently

resented his removal ; and made such an uproar when Dr.

Copland was appointed to finish the course, that he was un-

able to proceed with the lectures for several days ; and had

but a scanty attendance to the last. But he was still a

candidate for the chair ; and his vast erudition in medical lite-

rature, his indomitable industry, and abilities, as manifested in

the writing of the most learned Dictionary of Medicine ever

compiled, seemed to make up a weighty claim. But what

might have been thought the best chance in his favour, turned

against him : he was tried ; and in the estimate of the students,

hard to please, after losing their favourite, was found

wanting. He was, nevertheless, a kind hearted, as well as a

learned man ; a most indefatigable writer ; and deserved well

of his compeers.

     Two others of my good friends were also candidates. Dr.

IMarshall Hall had offered himself ; but as understood, with-
Idrew his application, when became a candidate. His great

eminence and long standing in the profession must have

placed his claims far above mine ; but, he probably had mis-

givings that his health would hardly be equal to the arduous

duties of the office, in all its details of lecturing and hospital

attendance. He always treated me with much courtesy and

consideration ; and several times consulted me, concerning

the health of his son, and at a later period, his own, when he

began to suffer from the disease of the ossophagus of which he

died a few years after.                     Ifriend to whom
     Dr. Clendinning was also my excellent
                                            him and several
became much attached ; and I attended

members of his family, until his death about ten years after.
APPOINTED PROFESSOR.                 139

IThere were several other candidates, but cannot now

recollect even their names.          The committee of the

   I was not long kept in suspense.

Senate made a report on the qualifications of the respective

candidates, and concluded by a decided recommendation in

my favour. This report was adopted by the Senate, and

transmitted to the Council, who forthwith appointed me Pro-

fessor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine, and Professor

of Clinical Medicine, and First Physician to the Hospital of

University College, London.

This important and welcome appointment made a complete

change in all my plans and prospects, and was as encouraging

to my hopes and aspirations, as it exceeded my utmost ex-

I Ipectations. Had succeeded at St. George's, should have

been only a junior, in a comparatively small school, and

might have had to wait long to enjoy the privileges and

Iprofits of lectureship. Here was to be placed at once at the

head of the Hospital staff, and in full exercise of the high

office of Professor of Medicine in the largest Medical School

in England. Doubtless, the duties were most arduous, and

the responsibilities great : and the spirit of one so young and

so little practised in teaching, might well quail before so vast

and so difficult an undertaking ; but success braced me up to
the work, and increased my confidence, that the powers, with
which God had endowed me, would not fail me in future, any
more than they had in the past.

     Although thus resolving to make as sure of success as

Ipossible by the most assiduous diligence, could never forget

the magnitude of the task before me ; and in deprecation of

severe criticism, I had much reason to plead for consideration

and indulgence on every side. The winter session was to

commence on the first of October ; and I had only two months

to prepare for a course of daily lectures of six months' duration.
Much consideration was shown me by the Council, and by my

Icolleagues ; and it was arranged that should not be expected

to enter on my duties at the hospital till a week before the

commencing session.
     My wife and children wanted country air, and it was

settled that wTe should spend six weeks at Southend, and
140 PREPARATIONS FOR LECTURES.

devote the time to the preparation of the lectures, and the

recreation of horse exercise, which was necessary for the im-

provement of our bodily health.

     Although my practice in lectures had been limited, yet

Iwith familiar subjects, found no difficulty in delivering them
Iextemporaneously, with the aid only of short notes. But as

had now to enter on a number of new subjects, with much

Idetail and matters of fact, requiring accuracy and precision,

  thought it best to write the lectures, at least for the intro-

ductory part of the course, on the Causes of Disease, and the

Principles of Medicine. It would give one more confidence of

being prepared, to have a few hundreds of pages of manuscript

to begin with. And no doubt this is a good method of mastering

a subject ; not only to read upon  it,      but to appropriate by
                                            I

                                                            it
writing in one's own language. But when came to read
a it
these written lectures, soon found that they were too con-
      :

       II
cise for oral delivery the student could not keep pace, with

either mind or pen, and had to intersperse explanatory sen-

tences in more colloquial style.

Among the changes necessary under altered circumstances,

was the removal to new residence. My increasing family
      a

had already raised the want of more room and the situation
                                            ;

                                               I

                                                                a
of Half Moon Street was too remote from my new sphere of

action. Having little time to w ait or search, took house
                                 r
                                         ;
in Holies Street, Cavendish Square of sufficient size for our

present need and the situation was less fashionable, than
      ;

              if

that of my former residence, was more central, and con-
                  it

veniently near to the College. The toils of moving house and

furnishing at this busy time are too trivial to be mentioned       ;

but they did not lighten the weight of work on us.

But the great subject of anxiety, as the time for opening

the session approached, was, whether my appointment, made

by the council of the college, would be favourably received by

the students. Many of these had been much offended by the

measures, which caused the resignation of Dr. Elliotson, and

had continued to manifest their hostility by their misbehaviour

at the lectures of Dr. Copland, when he was authorised by the

Council to complete Dr. Elliotson's unfinished course. It was

quite uncertain whether they would be more favourably dis-
SUCCESS OF OPENING LECTURE.                   141

posed towards me. However, paragraphs in my favour (with-

Iout my knowledge) appeared in some of the journals. In my

visits to the Hospital, took the opportunity of talking to the

students a few words in a good natured manner ; and two of

the senior influential students applied for my clinical clerkship.

These were good signs ; and the Medical Faculty then decided,
that I should give the introductory lecture at the opening of
Ithe session. chose for my subject, The Scientific Foundations
Iand Noble Objects of Medicine.
                                 delivered this address

before a crowded audience, who received me in a most friendly

manner, and encouraged me by unhesitating applause. One

passage was especially cheered by a group of students. It was

a quotation from the writings of ' one who formerly occupied

this chair.' My young friends thought this must be their

favourite : it was really Dr. Conolly, his predecessor. But
all passed off peaceably, and my ' first appearance ' was pro-

nounced ' a success.' My predominant feeling was that I could

not be sufficiently thankful to an Over-ruling Providence who

Ihad led me by a way that knew not, and was sustaining me

in a position of responsibility and utility.

The eclat of the debut passed ; then came the steady work ;

and this made demands on my time and energies more than
I Iever had before.

to a soiree ; and particularly enjoyed the lectures at the Royal
Institution, and a visit to the Royal Academy, and other

picture galleries. But now all these relaxations must be un-
compromisingly renounced. All my mind, and no less all my

strength, was wanted for work professional professorial,

and hospital work.

     The daily lecture at the College during the first year was

from 5 to 6 P.M. (In following years I was glad to have the

earlier hour of from 9 to 10 A.M.) The mornings were occu-
pied with preparations for the lecture, and with receiving

private patients, the numbers of which were now considerably

increasing. The hour for the visit to the Hospital was two

o'clock ; and although the patients were not numerous, the

visit usually occupied from one to two hours. The physicians

        Iwere not required to visit the hdspital oftener than three days

        in the week ; but generally found the need of a daily visit,

        to thoroughly study the cases, and to explain them to students,

        who were always ready to follow the physician whenever he

        Imade his appearance. And as I came with the name of some

        skill in physical diagnosis, had more than my share of this

        occupation. The short interval of the afternoon before the

        lecture at five o'clock was taken up with visiting private

        Ipatients. After the lecture came back, generally tired enough,

        to dinner ; after which when possible, an hour's nap was very

        welcome, followed by a cup of tea, which freshened one up for

        Iletter-writing or any necessary literary occupation, till mid-

        night. Beyond this hour made it a rule, as absolute as pos-

        Isible, not to sit up. To these restrictions, and to the regularity
        of this mode of life, ascribe

        of assistance in this department had been much felt and some

        members of the Medical Faculty had advised the appointment

        of Special Professor of Clinical Medicine, to supplement the

instruction of the present Physicians. Dr. Carswell, the Pro-

        fessor of Pathological Anatomy had already been appointed

medical officer, Dr. John Taylor, an old student and a dis-

tinguished graduate of the new University of London, had

been in the habit of giving clinical demonstrations at his

early visit ; and with considerable advantage to the students.

It was proposed by some members of the Medical Faculty,

to create a special professorship of Clinical Medicine, whose

duty should be to personally instruct the students in this
department. My colleague, Dr. Anthony Todd Thomson,

Professor of Materia Medica, was decidedly opposed to this

appointment, as infringing on the office pertaining to the other

physicians. But reserving to the senior physicians their full

Ititles and offices of Professors of Clinical Medicine, had no
Ihesitation in supporting the proposition, as felt fully how

much both physicians and students needed this additional

help : and through my support, the measure was enacted by
Ithe Council.
               also fully approved of the appointment to the

office of Dr. John Taylor, who had already proved his special

fitness for it. At a later period I also similarly acquiesced in

the appointment of Dr. Walshe, as Professor of Pathological

Anatomy.

     But notwithstanding the frankness and amity of my con-

Iduct, was disappointed to find some workings of a leaven of

jealousy and ill-feeling mixed up with this affair, as if the

interests of the new objects could not be forwarded, without

disparagement of the existing state of things. With all my

devotion to my work, I was quite conscious of shortcomings

and failures ; but still hoped these would diminish with

increasing experience and confidence. From the majority of

Ithe students, received hearty encouragement ; and it was

surprising as well as delightful to me, at the weekly examina-

Itions, to find how well they mastered what had taught them.

But there are in most communities some individuals more

difficult, less docile, and more discontented ; who perhaps

would do harm only to themselves, if they did not find older

ears eager for evil report and rejoicing in it. However, with

the friendly countenance of the great majority of the professors

and students, I could afford to disregard little manifestations

of unpleasant feeling which sometimes occurred. Dr. Sharpey

and Professor Graham were my oldest and firmest friends ;
I144 IMPROVEMENTS A' HOSPITAL.

Iand was soon on friendly terms with Dr. A. T. Thomson,

Samuel Cooper, Professor of Surgery, Eobert Listen, Pro-
fessor of Clinical Surgery, Dr. D. Davies, Professor of Obste-
trics, and Mr. K. Quain, Professor of Anatomy. Of the
Faculty of Arts, Professor Maldon (Greek), Professor T. H.
Key (Latin), and Professor De Morgan (Mathematics), often
joined our meetings. With the Rev. Dr. Hoppus, Professor

Iof Logic, became intimate through my professional attendance

on members of his family ; and through our accordance in
essentials in religious faith ; although he was an Independent,

and I an English Churchman. These and others of the Pro-

fessors used to meet at intervals at each other's houses for

harmonious and social converse ; but my heavy engagements

prevented my frequent presence.

    I succeeded in introducing several changes in the Hospital,

and especially in the clinical and post-mortem departments.
At the head of each bed, was a card with the patient's name,

disease, and the prescriptions for the treatment, for inspection

by the students ; instead of having to refer to the books, which
had before been the case. This practice has since become

general everywhere ; as has that of having glasses for exhibit-
ing and testing the secretions, with thermometers and hydro-
meters, at hand, &c., which had never been done in this
Hospital. But where a change was most wanted, was in the
place for examinations post mortem. This was nothing more
than a shed, with a wooden shelf, open to the weather, and
hardly screened ; without table or water supply. Such a state
of things would have been disgraceful anywhere ; but what for
an Institution, which prided itself on having first established a

professorship of Pathological Anatomy ! They told me that
inspections of importance were made in the surgical operating

Itheatre much to Mr. Listen's disgust and indignation.

Without loss of time, employed a builder to inspect the
premises, and made a plan for building a proper theatre, with
iron railings on steps overlooking a central table covered with

Izinc ; and with proper water appliances and drainage. This

plan with estimate, sent to the Hospital Committee, with a
letter, offering to make a donation of Fifty Pounds to the
Funds of the Hospital, if they would consent to the adoption

of the plan ; which would cost little more than double that

sum. My proposal was at once adopted ; and thereafter the

Iexaminations, to which had always attached the utmost im-

portance, were carried on in a decent and instructive manner.
    For the illustration of my lectures at the College, on the

Principles and Practice of Medicine, I had not only my own

drawings, diagrams, and tables, but also the valuable collec-

tion of pathological drawings, executed by Dr. (afterwards Sir
Eobert) Carswell, similar to those with which he had supplied
IProfessor Thomson of Edinburgh for his lectures already
referred to.  had also a complete set of Cruveilhier's Patho-

logical plates (presented to me by my old friend and fellow-
Icollegian Dr. F. Leighton, whose family I professionally
attended).    had further the use of a valuable series of life-

size stencillings of the position and condition of organs in

disease, by my friend, Mr. Francis Sibson, then resident in the

Nottingham Hospital. These tracings were made according

to the suggestions of my friend, Dr. Thomas Hodgkin. (Dr.
Sibson's eminent career afterwards is well known : cut short

as it was by early death from aneurism). I spared neither
Itime nor pains in using these illustrations to the utmost ; and

if my lectures had any amount of success, consider that they

owed much to those objective demonstrations, which engage

and exercise the senses as well as the understanding.

The disturbances which had occurred in the business of

the College, in connection with Dr. Elliotson's removal and

other matters during the last two years, caused some anxiety

among its friends, lest the success of the Institution should

suffer in consequence ; but these apprehensions were happily

removed by the advent of the full number of students ; so

that the College retained its position at the head of the Medical

Schools of London. My class in numbers surpassed all former

years; there being no less than 221 students, of which 119

were new entries, the largest number ever made, before or

since. The fees amounted to 764/. ; from which, deducting

one third for the College, left my portion 509L 6s. M. This

seemed a handsome salary, and I was thankful for it : but it

is by no means high, considering the amount of work to be

done, and that nothing more is derived from hospital fees.

              L
146 NO HOSPITAL FEESFIRST STUDENTS:

In most of the London Hospitals, the money paid by

students for attendance on the Medical and Surgical Practice,

is all divided among the Physicians and Surgeons ; but at the

foundation of the hospital in connection with University Col-

lege, the Professors of the College volunteered to forego their

claims, and to surrender the whole sum for the support of the

Hospital ; because its existence was necessary for the working

of the Medical School. King's College and its Hospital were

founded soon after; and its Professors, wiser in their generation

than those of the University, made claim to two-thirds of the

Hospital fees, leaving one-third only to aid to support the Hos-
I Ipital.
confess that partook of the feeling, general in the

Profession, that the King's College Professors were right ; and

that however generous and disinterested the sacrifice of those

of University College might seem, it was hardly equitable that

the medical profession should be thought so little worthy of

its hire, as to be doubly taxed with gratuitous work, for

students, as well as for the sick poor. But the practice had

been established, and we had to submit to it ; which was less

a hardship then, when the school was flourishing, than it has

Ibecome of late years, when its numbers have been seriously

diminished. But understand that recently these arrange-

ments have been more equitably settled ; and that the medical

officers now receive a proportion of the fees paid by students

for Hospital attendance.

    It is pleasant to me to recall the names of some of my

first pupils of University College, especially those best known

to me by having regularly attended at the weekly examina-

tions of the class. Several, alas ! have passed away before

their old teacher.

Thomas Patrick Matthew took my first gold medal, earned

the first Fellowes prize, and was my clinical clerk, and one of

my most diligent and talented pupils. He died early of con-

sumption. J. Deakin Heaton was also a gold medallist, and

my clerk and excellent friend. He was covered with honours

and distinctions, both at the College and University of London ;
and after a successful career in his native town, Leeds, died

in the prime of life. Edmund Parkes was a most attentive

student at my lectures ; but did not compete for my medals,

being much engaged with his relative, Dr. Anthony Todd
Thomson. He often consulted me before his subsequent

Ibrilliant career ; and endeavoured to persuade him to re-edit

my ' Principles of Medicine,' which he professed to admire ; but
he was too fully occupied with his own great work, which has

Isince proved to us how much was lost in his early death.

teacher, and whose names are familiar to the profession and

Ito the public, am happy to mention the following old friends

and pupils. Wildman Whitehouse, Charles John Hare, M.D.,

    It was a subject of much thankfulness, that I was enabled

to accomplish the work of that session, and give the full course
of lectures and hospital attendance, without any serious in-

terruption. My friends were very doubtful that my health

 would stand the strain, and considerately forebore their claims

on me for private practice, under the supposition that I was

already overworked. In the first half-year after my appoint-

ment to the College, my private practice actually diminished ;

Iand it was not until had successfully struggled through the
Iwork of the session, that began to derive, in this respect,

 any advantage from my new connection : then it seemed

 to come, less from any repute, or prestige attaching to the

 College, than from the personal influence of the pupils and

 their friends, who began to judge favourably of one's abilities

 as a practitioner, as well as of one's success as a lecturer.

DURING the summer session the Hospital practice and
Clinical lectures continued as usual, and some of these were
published from time to time in the ' London Medical Gazette,'
by the request of the Editor. The termination of the winter
lectures at the College, also gave me time to prepare a
fourth edition of my work on Diseases of the Chest, which
appeared in the autumn of that year, with the following title ;
 ' The Pathology and Diagnosis of Diseases of the Chest, com-
prising a Rational Exposition of their Physical Signs.' The
 following extract from the preface will show the intentions

Iwhich entertained at that time, and have never been able to

 carry out.
       ' More than a year has elapsed since the last edition of this work

 was out of print. It had been my intention to condense it into a

 Manual of Diagnosis of Pectoral Diseases, and to arrange in a larger
 work, on the Nature, Causes, Distinction and Treatment, materials
 which have been accumulating during many years of experience
 and study in Diseases of the Chest. But the important and respon-

 Isible duties of teacher of practical and clinical medicine having

 engrossed nearly all my time not engaged in practice, have been
  obliged to postpone the task, and to complete a fourth edition on
 the former plan. In its present enlarged form, it may have some-

proving standard of medical education, as well as the favourable

reception of former editions, gives me reason to hope that many

students and young practitioners will not be content with a mere
smattering on the subjects of this work ; but will hail in its in-

creased size an extension of the limits of sound knowledge, which

when properly mastered and applied, constitutes useful power.

Iterms to designate the phenomena of auscultation ; but aware of

the inconvenience of any change in nomenclature, have generally
retained that hitherto employed. The favourable reception of former
editions of this work in this and in several foreign countries, confirms

me in the conviction that the only fundamental mode of studying

auscultation, is through a knowledge of those facts and laws in

Iphysics and in pathology, of which the phenomena of auscultation
are examples.  have not the same confidence in adverting to the
I Irational views which have given of the general symptoms ; but

think the time is come when we should at least endeavour to make

our improved physiological and pathological knowledge more avail-
able in practice ; and connect with it in an intelligible order, the
multitudinous facts which have been stored up by observation.'

    In this year also was published the ' Library of Medicine,'

edited by Dr. Tweedie, in which my contributions on Diseases
of the Chest occupied the greater part of the third volume,
and included treatment, which was not given in the separate

publication. It contained in a condensed form the principal

matter of the lectures, which were never reproduced in this

Icountry in a separate form. It was quite otherwise in America.

About this time received a handsome volume of all my

lectures on the chest, with notes by Dr. Meredith Clymer, from

through several editions. It was doubtless gratifying to learn

that my labours were so much appreciated by that intelligent

benefit : but the return to me was only in the form of credit.
Publishers and people profited the author got nothing but

famishing fame. 1

     But we had reason to thank God that we were no longer
in straitened circumstances. For the first time, income began

to exceed expenditure. In 1840, in addition to my private

Iincome, which was 426L a year, had from publications, 130Z.,

College fees, 509Z., and private fees, 260Z: total 1325Z. The
ordinary expenditure for that year, excluding extras, was

1125L In the next year (1841), the sum from private fees was
nearly doubled ; and went on increasing in subsequent years
in a very rapid ratio ; while expenses also increased, but not

Iin equal proportion.

        leave it to my readers to make their reflections on my
history, so far as it goes, as bearing on the prospects offered
in the medical profession, in return for investment of money
and intellectual labour. From 1820 to 1830, ten years, may
be put down generally, as those of education, at an average
outlay of 150L a year; (this sum is lowered by the considera-
tion of some gains towards the end of this period). Next we
may count ten years of establishment in London, from 1830
to 1840, during which expenses exceeded receipts, at an average
of 600L a year. Now, in 1840, through God's goodness, we have
reached the third decade, the end of which is yet to be told ;
but this commencement marks the turn of the balance, when

the returns exceed the expenses, and the prospect seems fair for
progressive and ample success. But this is all contingent on

the life and health of one frail mortal. If he fails, all is lost ;

and even if spared, much will depend on what measure of
health and strength may be granted, to reap the fruits of his

labour. My example has been often spoken of as one of early
extraordinary success ; but the preceding statements will show
that it was one at least as much of labour as of luck ; and that
there could be no undue precocity, after a preparation of

twenty years.

     1 A similar empty return resulted from the several large editions of my
Principles of Medicine, subsequently published in America : but the more
recent work on Consumption, by myself and my son, was acknowledged by a
small pecuniary offering from the publisher, Mr. Henry C. Lea, of Phila-
delphia.

I Although blessed with much bodily and mental activity,
  was never robust in health ; and although I managed to

struggle through them, the labour and anxiety involved in my
new duties had told much on my bodily frame. Several of

Imy friends could hardly disguise their conviction that 'should

have to give them up, or they would be my death. But my

Iown courage failed not. The chief ailments, from which

suffered, were occasional attacks of giddiness, sometimes end-
ing in vomiting ; no doubt the result of cerebral exhaustion.

They were soon relieved by absolute rest, and were neither

accompanied nor followed by pain or mental weakness. In fact

the activity of my brain at that time often surprised me,
and tempted me at times beyond necessary work.

   IOne investigation in experimental physiology was tempted
Ito undertake during the summer of 1840 ; for which had

been engaged by the committee of recommendations of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science three

years previously, On the contractility and sensibility of the
Lungs and Air-tubes. Some of the experiments relating to

Ithis subject were performed at University College ; and was

assisted by Professor Sharpey, Mr. James Blake, 1 Edmund
Parkes, A. Bloomfield, Jos. King, and other pupils. The object
is explained in an extract from the report.

    ' It has long been a subject of controversy, whether the lungs

and air-tubes are more than passive in the motions of respiration
if they possess any self -contracting or expanding power, independent
of the muscles which affect the capacity of the chest. Different
writers, ancient and modern, have maintained opposite opinions.

nlense and unprecedented cold. See Nature, April 12 and May 31, 1883.

lungs have both a self-contracting and self -expansive property.

Haller, on the other hand, was led by experiments to deny that any

independent rhythmical motions, corresponding with movements of

respiration, are exhibited by the Inngs of animals, and J. Miiller has

confirmed this negative result. Nay, within the last few years,

certain writers in this country and in France, have denied altogether

the muscular contractility of any part of the air-tubes. These

negations are in opposition to the generally received opinion,

derived chiefly from the examinations of Keisseissen, that the

circular fibres of the air-tubes, from the trachea to their termina-

tion, are muscular. Very few attempts have been made to solve

this problem by experiment. Wernier and Wedemeyer succeeded

only in exciting partial contractions in the smaller bronchi ; but

with all their results, J. Miiller concludes that, "it is remarkable

that there exists at  present  no direct proof  obfratnhcehecson"tra(Ectleilimty.  of
the muscular fibres   of the   trachea and its                                     of

Physiology, translated by Baly).'

The experiments are too long to be detailed here : if there

is room they may be given in the second volume : but here

are the chief general results. They were performed on the

lungs and air-passages of recently killed animals, by attaching

to the windpipe or bronch, a bent glass tube with coloured

liquid (called a manometer) ; wherein any muscular contrac-
tion would cause the liquid to rise in the tube. On passing a

galvanic current across, or along, the air-passage's of the

lungs, the liquid rose distinctly and repeatedly, until the

muscular power was exhausted by continued stimulation ; after

an interval of repose, it could be made to rise again ; thus

proving beyond doubt the existence of irritable contractility in

the bronchial fibres. The experiments were varied in different

ways, and proved that the greatest amount of contractility

resided in the large and middle-sized bronchi, and less in the

smallest and in the trachea. It was found moreover that the

contraction of the bronchi could be excited by mechanical and

chemical irritation, as well as by galvanism ; causing the

expulsion of frothy mucus. Irritations, electric, chemical, or

mechanical, of the vagi nerves, had little or no effect on the

bronchial fibres.

Having thus established the important fact that the air-
Ipassages are endowed with muscular contractility,
                                                    sought

 further to determine what influences would increase and what
 diminish this property ; and so to be led to discover a remedy

for spasmodic asthma, which must depend on its excess. In

 animals killed by pithing, or by the poison of hydrocyanic
 acid, the contractile power remained in full force : but in those

poisoned by belladonna or stramonium, this contractility of

the tubes was almost destroyed, giving no signs of movement

under galvanism. In animals poisoned by opium and by
strychnia, it was impaired, but not destroyed ; confirming

the fact, well known to the experienced practitioner, that
these are inferior to belladonna and stramonium as remedies

Ifor the spasm of asthma.

Iof this Report at the Meeting of the Association at Glasgow :

but heard that it excited much interest, and was highly

applauded, as an attempt to improve the practice of medicine

by experimental research. The experiments were performed,
with only one exception, after the death of the animals ; and
therefore would not come under the insane denunciations of
the anti-vivisectionists. And what was the exceptional half-
hour's trial before death of one dog, in comparison with the
prolonged sufferings of a patient in a bad fit of asthma, which
we have in many cases been able to relieve, through the
knowledge obtained in this investigation ?

too wide to be fully explained here ; and as some corrections
have been made to mitigate the evils complained of, it may be
inexpedient to open up the whole controversy ; but a few words
of explanation will give some notion of how the matter stood

at this time.
     The charters of the Koyal College of Physicians of London

incorporate into one body all physicians in London and
seven miles round, without making any division or distinction
between the members of that body, except in the appointment
of a President, four Censors, and eight Elects. But in course

of time, this body proceeded to enact by-laws, making between

those whom they admitted to their body, a division into
Fellows or Socii, and Licentiates, or Permissi ; the former only

having the privileges of Fellowship, and the latter being merely
authorised to practise. The effect of this enactment was to
degrade the Licentiates into an inferior order of physicians,
and to monopolise to the Fellows the honours and government
of the College. The distinction and exclusion was carried
further, by restricting the Fellowship chiefly to graduates of
Oxford and Cambridge ; and placing those from other uni-
versities in the lower order of Licentiates.

      These encroachments had caused loud complaints, from time
to time, on the part of the Licentiates, and in some instances
 led to appeals to courts of law ; with the general result of

judgments, condemning the conduct of the College. For some

 years past, the College itself had admitted the necessity of
 abating some of its exclusiveness ; and had admitted to the
 Fellowship several Licentiates of eminence. But this very con-
 cession was objected to by the body of Licentiates, as stamping
 the inferiority of their class by taking out of it the best men ;
 and some of these thus chosen refused to accept the offer.
 Among these were my friends Sir James Clark and Dr. Neill

IArnott ; and I had some doubts whether ought not to follow
Itheir example. But on further consideration, thought that,

 as these eminent recusants did not seem likely to make any

 Iexertions on behalf of the body of Licentiates, among whom

 they chose to remain, could better promote the reform of the
 College, by accepting the Fellowship, and endeavouring to work
 to that end within the body.
           PRESIDENTS SURPRISE REST.  155

In making known to the Eegistrar of the College my accept-

ance of the Fellowship, with full acknowledgment of the per-

sonal compliment thus conferred, I intimated my intention to

avail myself of my position to endeavour, on a fitting occasion,

to bring about a reform of those abuses in the management of

Ithe College, against which, with other Licentiates, had

already remonstrated. It so happened, that the President,

Sir Henry Halford, was with the Eegistrar at this interview ;

and although quite friendly, he was not a little surprised at
my presumption. ' Well now ! ' said he, ' look here, my young

friend ; we give you the Fellowship what can you want
Imore ? '
           abstained from debating the matter then with the
Icourtly President ; but within twelve months gave him an

answer in open College.

Dr. Hope was elected to the Fellowship at the same time

as myself; and that we two alone should be selected for the

honour, gave evidence, that whatever had been our personal

disagreements, they had not injured our characters in the

estimation of the College.

The holidays of August 1840 were spent at our cottage,

Ivy Eock, near Chepstow ; where my wife and children had

been staying during the summer ; and the rest of mind, com-

bined with increased and varied exercise of body, proved most

welcome means of refreshment.

THE next session, 1840-41,- was not less busy, but less
strained under severe pressure, than that preceding. Lectur-

Iing was becoming easier work ; both from increased practice,

and from a better arrangement of matter. But found much
need of text-books of reference ; especially on the Principles
of Medicine, or General Pathology and Therapeutics. There
were the ' Cyclopaedia ' and ' Library,' of Practical Medicine,

and Copland's elaborate Dictionary, all copious enough on
special diseases; but for the important subject of General

Pathology, and the rational principles of Treatment, we had no

work but that of Professor Alison, which, although excellent as
far as it went, was too brief for our needs. More therefore was

Irequired of the lecturer ; and soon arrived at the conclusion,
Ithat must myself endeavour to supply the want by writing

a book on the subject. But the subject itself needed much to
clear it up much thought and consideration, to define and

arrange what was already known, and further investigation,
to extend knowledge in important questions still involved in

Iobscurity. Among many topics which found in confusion

in lecturing on them last year was that of the pathology of

the small blood-vessels, including the subjects of congestion,

Idetermination of blood, and inflammation. On each of these
   had begun to make regular researches, aided by the micro-

scope ; and was soon rewarded by results, which threw much

light on the matter. I was able to make diagrams of several

of these observations in illustration of my lectures on the

subject, which were thus rendered much more intelligible, and

Ithe phenomena were more satisfactorily explained.

    In microscopical examination, got considerable assistance

Ifrom two friends who were zealous observers at that time ;

and like to recall their pleasant memories, for they were both

taken early from their promising and useful career. John

Dalrymple was my next-door neighbour in Holies Street. He

was introduced to me by my colleague Liston, on the occasion

Iof the illness of a brother, Donald Dalrymple, whom attended

through a dangerous attack of pneumonia, and who was my

warm and faithful friend until his death, soon after his entry

on a successful parliamentary life, as member for Bath.

John Dalrymple devoted much attention to diseases of the

eye ; and was well skilled in the use of the microscope, having
Ia first-rate one of the most modern construction.
                                                    had been

working away with an old instrument, and with difficulty

made out the state of the vessels in the frog's web. But when

I saw the same object in my neighbour's microscope, all

difficulty vanished; and the elliptical blood-discs, the pale

Icorpuscles, and the variations in calibre of arteries, capillaries,

and veins, were as plain as noonday. So soon got new

lenses put in my instrument by Powell and Lealand, and

quite enjoyed the increased facilities.

The other friend who aided me in this work, who became

afterwards eminent in aural surgery, was Joseph Toynbee.

I had known him at St. George's Hospital as a zealous co-

operator with me in the inspection-room; and he now

delighted me with his fine injections, as objects for the micro-

Iscope, bearing on the subjects which had in hand. His en-

thusiasm in everything tending to the advancement of medical

science, together with personal intimacy arising from my attend-

ance on a most promising brother, who died early, made us

fast friends, up to the period of his untimely death, from

experimental inhalation of hydrocyanic acid.
158 GULSTONIAN LECTURES ON

IDuring this winter was requested by the President of the

College of Physicians to deliver the Gulstonian Lectures of that

year. To be selected for this office so soon after my election

Ito the Fellowship took for a compliment ; for although

only two Fellows were appointed from the Licentiates, there

were several other young Fellows, who being graduates of

Oxford or Cambridge had been promoted to the Fellowship in

Ithat year. Although, with little time at command, would
Ihave preferred to postpone the engagement, was glad of the

opportunity of making known my new researches.

     The lectures were delivered in the spring, and were pub-

lished in the ' Medical Gazette ' of the July following, with

additional microscopic observations. They embrace topics

fundamental to a great department of General Pathology ;

and expanded into their sundry details and applications,
occupy two hundred pages of the last edition of my ' Principles
of Medicine.' The more original parts, which in my opinion

have been hardly understood by subsequent writers, may find

Iinsertion in a second volume ; and shall only briefly notice

here one or two points connected with each of these condi-

Itions, congestion of blood, determination of blood, and inflam-

mation, in which claim originality, having been the first to

establish their distinctions by direct observation.

      Of the forms of local hyper&mia (too much blood in a
.part), congestion, is that icitli diminished motion of the blood :

determination, is too much blood, with increased motion : in-

flammation, is too much blood, with its motion partly increased,

partly diminished.

These are definitions : that is, brief characteristic designa-

tions ; (not descriptions.)
     Of the physical causes of congestion, that from venous

obstruction had been sufficiently recognised ; but experiment
enabled me to demonstrate another, in loss of tone in capillaries

and veins, producing their enlargement, without any enlarge-

ment, or with diminution, of the supplying arteries : this would

fulfil the definition ' too much blood, with diminished motion.'

IBut what is the physical cause of determination of blood
that is, too much blood with increased motion ?      claim to have
Ibeen the first to give the true answer, when pointed to en-
VARIETIES CONGESTION DETERMINA TION. \ 59

largement of the arteries leading to the part as the direct physical
cause of increased afflux of blood to the part. But what is

the cause of this enlargement? Physiological experiment

negatives the idea of increased action, or active dilatation of

the arteries. They have no such properties. Besides the
elasticity which resides chiefly in the outer coat, arteries
have only the slow contractility of their middle coat, called
tonicity ; l and the effect of increased action of this would be
to contract the artery, and so to diminish the flow. Therefore,
instead of increased action of the arteries, there must be

diminished contraction, causing them to enlarge from the

vis a tergo (heart and blood pressure), and so to become the
channels of increased flow more blood ivith more motion.

     ' When the web of a frog's foot is gently irritated by an
aromatic water, the arteries may be seen through the micro-
scope to become enlarged, and to supply a fuller and more

impulsive flow of blood to the capillaries and veins, which then
all become enlarged too : the whole vascular plexus, including

vessels which before scarcely admitted red corpuscles, then
becomes the seat of a largely increased current. This is de-
termination of blood."* Afterwards an additional factor in

   I1 It is to be regretted that English writers do not adhere to this expressive

word tonicity, which was in use before applied and defined it, as a primary

physiological element, in the first edition of my Principles in 1843. The

Germans more recently have introduced the term tonus ; a word signifying a

state, rather than a property.

   I2 Principles of Medicine, 3rd ed. p. 263, and London Medical Gazette,

July 16 and 23, 1841. On the differences which endeavoured to trace

between determination and inflammation, I am proud to quote the following

passage from the most eminent modern writer on the subject ; the only one,
Professor Virchow excepted, who has done me anything like justice. ' No

experiment can be better adapted to show the complete distinction between

determination of blood and inflammatory hypertemia than that described

by Dr. Williams in the Gulstonian Lectures, to which I have already

referred. Hunter had shown by his experiment that it is possible for the

inflammatory blush to subside, leaving no trace, or the injured part to be

flooded with blood, and then return to its original condition. But Hunter's

attention was entirely fixed on the blood-vessels, to the action of which he
attributed the whole process. For the purpose of separating Hunter's incipient

enlargement of the vessels upon the first excitement of inflammation (Treatise
on the Blood, etc., p. 279) from the definitive changes which followed  it,  Dr.

Williams most judiciously adopted this method of graduated irritation of the

web of the frog's foot, which was at that time the only field of experimental

observation. He found that a weak solution of capsicum applied to the web,

causes dilatation with acceleration of the movement of the blood (hyperaemia
160 INFLAMMATION INTIMATE NATURE.

the process was discovered, when Bernard and Brown Sequard

found that this vascular contractility is sustained by the power

of the sympathetic nerves ; and that injury to these nerves
had the same effect on arteries in connection with them, as

direct stimulation of small arteries causing their enlargement,

with increased flow.

   IInflammation denned as too much blood in a part (local

hypersemia) with motion partly increased, partly diminished. On

Iexamining, in a frog's web, a spot inflamed by the contact of

a particle of capsicum, saw a large and rapid motion of
blood to and around the spot, (determination) and too much
blood with motion impeded sometimes arrested, in the part
most inflamed : fulfilling the terms of the definition.

     But attention to the contents of the blood-vessels revealed

further changes ivithin them. Where the motion was retarded,

were seen numerous white corpuscles, some rolling slowly at the
margin of the blood stream, others stationary and sticking to
the sides of the vessels (capillaries and veins). 1 And this
production of white corpuscles, together with their adhesive
character, serves to explain the characteristic feature which

distinguishes inflammation from determination, and adds

partial obstruction, or diminished motion. In my description

Iof the nature and purpose of these leucocytes (as they have

since been termed, and not quite correctly), came nearer

Ithe truth when called them ' spheroidal granular bodies of

strengthened, or the application several times repeated, the quickening soon

gave way to slowing and commencing stagnation. (Princ. of Mcd. 3rd ed.
pp. 240 and 263). The effect of the weak excitation was transitory, and the
observation could be repeated any number of times on the same web. The

stronger solution produced permanent damage of the tissue, resulting in
inflammatory congestion, exudation, and stasis.' Lumleian Lectures on In-

   Mr. Addison, and others after him, supposed these bodies

to be invested by a delicate membrane. But Mr. Addison

Iwas the first to discover (what did not see) that these

bodies penetrate the wall of the vessel to which they adhered,

and migrate through it ; and this observation was con-

firmed three years after by Dr. Augustus Waller, who in-

formed me of the fact by letter. But both these observations

were forgotten, amid the prevailing tendency to regard

every new growth as cellular, until rediscovered by Cohnheim

many years after. It was a wonderful addition to these dis-

coveries, when the amceboid properties of these corpuscles

became known, and they were proved to be ' masses of con-

tractile living protoplasm.' 2

important subject, which of all those comprehended in my
after work on the ' Principles of Medicine,' cost me most

     which, although making Partial Eeforms, is far short of what it ought to
     be as the Eepresentative Head of the most Learned and Skilled Body in the
     Profession.

IN December 1840 an opportunity occurred of joining in dis-
cussions on the subject of reform in the College of Physicians.
Petitions had been addressed to both Houses of Parliament
in favour of reform in all the medical corporations, urging
the necessity of legislative' interference in every department.
The Licentiates of the College of Physicians complained of the
illiberal, unjust and even illegal manner, in which they were
excluded from the privileges of the Fellowship, and were a
merely external appendage on sufferance, instead of being a
part of the corporation. Under the influence of this pressure,
the Council of the College issued an address to the Fellows,
inviting their attention to the subjects of complaint, with a

view to deliberation as to whether any, and if any what

changes may be necessary in the by-laws and government of
the College.

     The original charter of the College of Physicians (10 Hen.

VIII. A.D. 1518, with the statutes of 14 and 15, c. 5,

    1522-23, 32 c. 40, 1540, Henry VIII.) was published by the
    College in 1862, and can now be easily referred to : but at

    that time, I had made myself acquainted with their purport,

    sufficiently to be convinced that they did not warrant the

    restrictive and exclusive regulations, which had since been

    introduced ; especially in the establishment of a lower order

    of Physicians, and in the arrogation to the Fellows, of the ex-

    clusive privileges of membership of the body. It appeared to

    me that the rectification of this abuse of the powers of the

    College was the most essential step in its reform. To restore

    it to its original constitution, in one united body, comprehend-

    ing all well qualified and worthy physicians, and having super-

    intendence over, not only the education of those who are to be-

    come physicians, but also the interests and welfare of all its

    members ; to make it the representative head of the most

    learned and skilful of the whole profession and to supply its

    collective wisdom to the needs of the State these ought to be

the real objects of all attempts at reform. Therefore, instead

    of trying to patch up a dilapidated structure, by partial and

    Iclumsy repairs, moved a resolution, which should reach to

                          :                                            in the strength

                                                                  it,
    its very foundation, with a view to rebuild

    and proportions, becoming the high purposes of the edifice.

a It  was to this effect

        In order to make the College truly to represent the interests,:

      This motion occasioned no small stir in the College. Many

    were surprised at my audacity and an impression first seemed

object. The subject was hardly discussed openly ; but before

Ithe motion was rejected, remarked a very earnest whispering

among some of the senior Fellows ; and on the day following,
Dr. (since Sir Thomas) Watson called on me to say, that Dr.
P. M. Latham and himself had been talking over the subject,

with the result of finally approving of my proposition, and

Iresolving to bring it again before the College, as a substantive

motion, proceeding from themselves. To this willingly gave

my assent ; and at an adjourned meeting, Dr. Latham moved

a resolution, to make the Fellows and Licentiates one body, and

to vest the government of the College in a representative

Council, to be chosen therefrom. The motion was seconded by

Dr. Watson, and supported by Dr. Boots and a few of the

more liberal of the senior Fellows ; but was strongly opposed

by my friend Dr. W. F. Chambers ; who argued against

not so much on the ground of its merits, or on the changes

which would effect in the College, and in the profession, as

on that of the surrender of the privileges of the Fellows, which

would involve, and the yielding to the attacks of their worst

enemies. This argument swayed the majority of the Fellows,

many of whom were Oxford and Cambridge graduates, glory-

ing in their privileges, which we considered usurped, and dis-

regarding the great purposes for which the College was founded,

and of which the growing wants of the profession and of the

public, were hourly declaring the need.

The failure of this movement was very injurious to the

popularity of the College, and marked the loss of an oppor-

tunity in which the liberal spirit of its most enlightened

Fellows might have led the way to that summit of power in

the State, which the head of the most learned body in the

profession ought to occupy, and which now was likely to be

assumed by some new institution.  did not omit few words

Iother corporate bodies, and in the whole of the profession ;

and in the autumn of that year addressed two letters on the

Isubject to the ' London Medical Gazette,' which reprint, as

an outcome of the history of the time, and suggestive of
thoughts of what might have been the course of events, had

some such plans been adopted.

ON THE STATE OF THE MEDICAL PEOFESSION, AND ON THE
                 KIND OF REFORM THAT IT REQUIRES.

                      To the editor of the 'Medical Gazette. 1

    Sir, It has never been my disposition to meddle with medical

politics ; but recent occurrences, and especially a circular issued in
November last by the Royal College of Physicians, inviting its
Fellows to communicate their views with regard to changes in its
constitution, have led me to reflect much, on the state of the

medical profession, and on the best means of improving it. These
reflections, and the examination of many facts connected with the
subject, have produced in my mind convictions too strong to permit
me to remain inactive in the cause of medical reform.

   I IBut although thus declare in favour of reform, must claim

the title of a conservative reformer. For reasons too numerous to
be stated here, it seems to me both just and expedient that the
government of the profession should be vested in the three existing
corporate bodies ; but it is equally just and needful that these bodies
should be so constituted as faithfully to represent, as well as to
govern, the interests of their respective members.

     Nothing less than an honest conviction, that, in the College of

Physicians, such a change is absolutely required by the state of the
profession, woiild have induced me, tbe junior fellow, to move in

the College tbe following resolution :

    ' In order to make the College truly to represent tbe interests,

the feelings, tbe learning, and the influence, of tbe whole body of
physicians practising in this country, it must admit tbe whole body

to privileges of membership. It is therefore expedient tbat tbe dis-

tinctions between fellows and licentiates should cease ; and tbat tbe

government and acts of the College be delegated to a Council or re-
presentative bead, consisting of tbe office-bearers and a certain
number of fellows or members ; a third of which is to be elected
annually, by ballot of all the members, from those of at least five
years' standing in tbe College.'
166 MEDICAL PROFESSION UNREPRESENTED.

     That the College would at once receive such a proposition, now

Ifor the first time made,"was scarcely to be anticipated ; but had

reason to expect that it would be supported by those, who, out of
the College, had, with myself, petitioned Parliament against dis-

Itinctions, which this resolution proposed to remove. In this expec-

tation was disappointed.
     The failure of this, and of a similar motion afterwards brought

forward by two of the most distinguished fellows of the College, does
not make the case desperate. The measures, that have been carried,

Iare more liberal than those proposed before the rejected motions ;

and would still hope that the most influential opponents of the
latter will give way on a mature consideration of the arguments in
favour of a reform, that would be conservative by being complete ;
that would preserve the College, not for itself only, but for the good
of the whole profession.

   IThis hope induces me to address you on the subject ; and am

the more confirmed in doing this, in consequence of some remarks
contained in a recent editorial article (July 16, p. 662), which prove to
me that the propositions in question are not fully known to you.

    This reform cannot be effective or final, if the good of all its

subjects be not fully regarded, as its most important aim. To the
medical community this principle is the more necessary, because
that community depends solely on itself, being unguarded, and

scarcely cared for, by the legislature, and by the government.
     The position which the medical profession holds, in the consti-

tution of the country, is quite anomalous. Unlike other professions,
it is excluded equally from all branches of the government. The
clergy are represented in the upper house of parliament. The pro-
fessions of the law, the army, and the navy, not only have many
representatives in both the legislative assemblies, but they are also
sure to hold many influential places in the administrative and
executive branches of the government. The interests of trade and

commerce are guarded by special government offices, and by re-
presentatives, expressly returned for the purpose, by numerous
co-operating constituencies. The medical profession alone is unre-
presented : without government and without protection, it is a civil
cypher ; a nonenity in the state !

      Does our profession suffer in consequence ? Look for answer to
the oppressive treatment which medical men experience from poor-
law unions, vestry boards, government offices, the governors of
hospitals and dispensaries, from scientific bodies, and too often from
the public at large. What educated man is so hardly worked and
so ill requited as the medical man ? Take another illustration.
        MEDICAL REFORM PUBLIC INDIFFERENCE. 167

Is a measure, seriously affecting the interests of the medical profes-
sion, brought before the House of Commons ? either the house is

' counted out,' or the members by their remarks evince their ignor-
ance or their carelessness about the matter. Some two or three

honourable members have indeed deigned to patronise medical
questions : but of these, one denies to the members of a learned
profession, the right or the capacity to judge what is best for them-
selves ; another is turned by every voice, and is ready to follow the
noisiest, or the last, complainant : another, formerly himself in the
profession, is now too much engaged with the interests of a popu-
lous constituency, and other matters, to give much attention to
those of medicine.

     Powerless as the profession is in its civil relations, its members
yet have an extensive influence : but it is the moral and social
influence which must accrue to those essential to the well-being of
society ; it is an influence of individuals only, unlinked by a common

purpose and harmonious sentiments : and powerless, because not
strengthened by the sympathies and energies of union. The peer

and the M.P. highly esteem their physician or surgeon, and would
willingly do him a service by supporting his favourite measure in
Parliament : but the town doctor and the country doctor, the

physician, the surgeon, and the apothecary, have each a different plan ;
' and who shall decide when doctors disagree ? ' So his lordship,
and the honourable member, prudently and politely evade the matter.

     The lately proposed scheme, of returning to parliament a mem-

ber to represent the medical profession, is quite chimerical. Where
is there to be found an individual, so qualified by ability, knowledge,
and integrity of principle so free from party spirit and personal
bias as to possess the confidence of the bulk of the profession ?

And if such an individual could be found, what is likely to induce

him to undertake the unenviable office? The matters of the

medical profession can be fairly debated and adjusted only by a
sufficient number of its own members ; and to force them before
parliament, in a crude and unsettled state, through one or more
nominal representatives, would be to mix medical and general
politics, in a manner distasteful and injurious to both subjects, and
calculated only to give to medical questions the odium of political

partisanship.
     We are then led to these conclusions : that the legislature is

too ignorant about the state and wants of the profession to be com-
petent, and too apathetic to be willing, to reform it : the profession
is at present too much divided in the opinions and influence of its
members, either to reform or to govern itself. How obvious is the
168 WANT OF UNITY IN PROFESSION.

principal remedy which these conclusions suggest ! Union above
all things. Union of opinion, by which an acceptable and efficient
plan of reform may be devised; and union of influence, by which
this plan may be carried through the legislature.

     But by what means is this union to be attained amid such dis-
cordant elements ? An approach to union may be anticipated only
through the true principles of incorporation and representation.
Let all the members of the profession be incorporated and repre-
sented : not a few only, as in the present corporations, to the
exclusion of the many, who are tints not living members, but dead
and offensive excrescences : not in one faculty only, to the con-

founding of those grades and distinctions which the extent of the
art has produced, which experience has sanctioned, and which

society requires ; but let the existing corporations extend their
arms, and open their hearts, and lift up their voices, to receive
their deserted and neglected offspring, and affiliate all that should
be members ; to feel for them, to speak for them, and defend them ;
let them show a parental feeling for the whole kindred of the pro-
fession : and then shall these bodies become vigorous in their old

age, and not more venerable from antiquity and associations, than
strong in the united power and affections of their members.

     But be it clearly understood, in order to fix the confidence and
embody the strength of the profession in the existing corporations,
they must fully and fairly adopt the representative principle. The
doubts which may be entertained as to the expediency of admitting
to the elective franchise the lower classes of society, surely cannot
apply to the members of a learned profession. None ought to be
excluded from voting for representatives in the councils of their

respective bodies ; and to form these councils, those only should be
elected, who have gained the confidence of the majority of an in-
telligent and well-educated constituency.

     The representative plan has been objected to as likely to diffuse
through the profession a spirit of political agitation and discord.
How blind the authors of such objections must be, and how low

their estimates of the characters of their brethren ! The representa-
tive plan is one essentially of union, and strikes at the very root

of discord. Is there now no agitation, no discord? The whole
profession is like a troubled sea. Men will stir when their rights
are unprotected. Men will complain when their wants are disre-
garded. Division must ensue where there is no community of

feeling or interest. Turbulence and democracy must arise where

there is no effective government.
     A fair representative government will go far to remove these
             REFORM OF CORPORATIONS.                             169

elements of strife. The real evils, which now degrade, vex, and

divide the members of the profession the oppressions, the collision,

the invidious and unjust divisions will then, in many instances,

cease ; in others they will be put in train to be lightened or amelio-

rated. The truly aggrieved, trusting where to find redress, will no
longer waste his time and injure his temper in fruitless agitation.
The voice of the malcontent and demagogue, if not altogether

silenced, will become comparatively powerless and inoffensive.

And when such advantages may reasonably be anticipated from

a simple change in the existing corporations, can it be supposed
that these bodies will refuse to make the change ? Is it possible that

a selfish spirit of exclusiveness can so far prevail over a generous

desire for the common-weal, as to make them look to themselves,

rather than to the profession at large ? With the voice of complaint

within and without, loudly proclaiming their weakness and inef-

ficiency on the one hand, and their oppressive restrictions and

invidious distinctions on the other, is it possible that they will still

cling to what they have been, and are to their own exclusive

rights, nominal privileges and antiquated customs and forget

I Iwhat they may be, and ought to be, in this enlightened age ?
cannot believe it possible.  trust that we shall find in these

Colleges, close and exclusive as they have been, a number of liberal

and public -spirited men, sufficient to place these bodies in the

honourable and useful position which they ought to hold, as the

Irepresentative heads of the whole profession. This is the argument

that should decide them. would not argue the law of the case. It

were frivolous to debate now whether the Colleges have, or have

not, acted up to the letter or the spirit of their charter, or whether

the Society of Apothecaries have exceeded theirs. Disputes on

these points tend to no good, but only excite animosity and widen

the breach.

     Let us freely admit the good which these bodies have done.
For example, the stamp of respectability and literary attainments,

which the College of Physicians has conferred on its order ; the

encouragement given to the study of anatomy by the College of
Surgeons ; and above all, the benefit conferred on the profession,

and on the public, by this body and the Board of Apothecaries, in

raising the standard of medical education. It is because they have

wrought these good things, that we would expect from them still better

things. It is because they have not been idle, although shackled

by partial and antiquated by-laws, that we would strike off their

fetters, extend their ability, and raise them to a post of honour and

of power that of guardians and representatives of the interests of

the whole profession.
170 SACRIFICE REQUIRED.

Let us freely admit that in conceding the desired changes,

those now invested with power will make some sacrifice. But what

is public virtue without some private sacrifice ? It is because the

disinterestedness of the act would ensure the confidence of all par-

ties, that we would desire to see the corporations cheerfully and

earnestly engage in the noble work of a thorough self-reform.

And after all, what a shadow is the contemplated sacrifice, in

comparison with the substantial good to be achieved. The surrender

of certain empty privileges by a few, to the end that justice and

protection shall be administered to the many. Nay, in the end,

will the sacrifice be real ? Will not those who voluntarily give up

their exclusive privileges for the common interests of the profession,

so entirely deserve and obtain the confidence of that profession and

of the government, that to them chiefly will be entrusted the en-

larged power and higher honour, of presiding over and protecting

Ithe whole medical community ? Truly, believe that they will.
   IIn another letter propose to develop that plan of reform in the

ICollege of Physicians, which, as it appears to me, should be the
first step of the great work.  am, sir, your obedient servant,
                               CHAELES J. B. WILLIAMS.

7 Holies Street, Cavendish Square : September 17, 1841.

To the, Editor of the ' Medical Gazette.'
ISir, In my former letter
                               endeavoured to point out the

anomalous position of the medical men of this country : without
Irepresentation, and without protection of their interests.
                                                               argued

that it is vain to hope for due attention from the Government, or
from Parliament, until medical men themselves shall unite more in

their opinions and in their influence ; and as the safest and surest

mode of engaging the sense and strength of the medical community,

without harassing its members with revolutionary measures, it was

proposed that new powers from the Government, as well as from
the profession, should be vested in the three existing corporate

bodies ; these being first reformed on the principles of true incor-

Iporation, and equal and responsible representation.
     Before proceed to the chief subject of this letter, a specific
plan of reform for the College of Physicians, it will be well to

state some general features of that applicable to the whole profes-

sion.

    It seems to me expedient, for the sake of the public as well as

of the profession, that, in the contemplated changes, as little

violence as possible be done to established usages, where these are
THREE ORDERS TO BE RETAINED.  171

Inot productive of injurious results. For this reason, rather than

because abstractedly it is the best possible division, would retain

the distinction of the three orders of the profession, physicians,
surgeons, and practitioners in medicine, or general practitioners.

     The physicians constitute the highest class of the profession,
whose special object is the treatment of internal or constitutional
diseases. They are to be distinguished, first, by the time devoted

to their education, both preliminary and medical, the latter being
both academical and practical ; secondly, by their having attained
the degree of doctor in medicine ; thirdly, by the amount of fees to
which they are entitled ; fourthly, by their not practising pharmacy
in any shape.

     The surgeons are the highest class, whose special object is the
treatment of external diseases, and of those which require manual
operations. They should be distinguished by the time expended in
their education, which should, in all points, correspond with that
of physicians, except that, in their practical studies, surgery should
take the prominent part. In the amount of their fees, and in their
not practising pharmacy, they should also be on a par with the

physicians.
     The practitioners in medicine, although inferior to the physicians

and surgeons in the time required for their education, and in the
amount of their fees, must be sufficiently instructed to qualify them
for the treatment of disease, internal and external. Their examin-
ing body must be formed in part by physicians and surgeons. They
may practise pharmacy, but not as a means of remuneration. They

may not hold offices of physicians or surgeons to public institutions.

Physicians and surgeons shall be entitled to enter the order of
medical practitioners ; but in so doing they must give up the titles

and privileges of their former rank.
      The practice of midwifery may be attached to either order of

the profession, after an examination by competent persons in the

 respective boards of examiners.
      The affairs and interests of each order of practitioners are to be

entrusted to a representative head or council, a third of which is to
be elected annually by the ballot votes of all the members.

      The councils of the respective bodies should have the power of
entrusting to a committee of conference, consisting of a certain
number from each council, matters affecting the different bodies in
common. Questions which the committee of conference cannot
 terminate to the satisfaction of the councils, may be referred to the
 Secretary of State for the Home Department. This is the only

 case in which lay interference will be needed, if the corporate bodies
172 REFORM OF COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS.

will adopt fully the representative principle. If they refuse to do

this, the government of the profession will surely pass into lay
hands : and probably the best way in which this may be effected, is

by the Government forming a board of public instruction for this

Iand other needed purposes. But this is an alternative which do
Inot like to contemplate. To return to the College of Physicians.

     The great purposes of a college of physicians conceive to be,
not only, first, ' to ensure the best education for those who are to

become physicians,' (Circular of the College, November 27, 1840) ;
but also, secondly, to protect the interests of physicians against all
circumstances, loithin and without, which may injure the moral,
intellectual, or civil dignity of their art and profession ; and, thirdly,
as the representative organ of the most learned and dignified class
of medical practitioners, to decide or report on all important ques-
tions regarding the public health, or other subjects referred to them
by the Government, or by other public authorities.

     The following are the outlines of a plan for the reform of the

College :
     1. The College is to consist of fellows, a president, council,

censors, and other office-bearers, as at present.
     2. The order of licentiates is to be abolished.
     3. The fellows are to consist of the present fellows and licen-

tiates. To these are now to be added, by an act of grace, without
examination, all other regularly educated physicians in England
and Wales of three years' standing, on payment of a certain con-
tribution to the College. All of less than three years' standing are
to submit to an examination.

     4. The council is to consist of the office-bearers, and a certain
number of fellows, elected by ballot votes of all the fellows, from
those of five years' standing in the College. Of these a third go
out annually, at a general meeting of the College. A ballot paper,
signed by the registrar, with a list of all the eligible fellows, to be
sent to each fellow, who writes on it the names of those for whom

he wishes to vote. These papers may be sent by post, sealed for

the ballot box.
     5. The president is to be elected annually by the fellows, from

those who are or have been members of the council. Election as

with members of the council.
     6. The censors and other office-bearers are to be elected by the

council.

     7. The government and acts of the College are to be entrusted
to the council, which is to have the power to fine, suspend, and

expel offending fellows.
PLAN OF COLLEGE REFORM.  173

    8. All in future practising as physicians must become fellows of
the College, under penalty of fine.

     9. Candidates for the fellowship must have completed their
26th year ; and, in addition to an adequate acquaintance with
classical and general literature and science, they must have spent
at least five years in the study of medicine, and the contributory

sciences, at some recognised college or school. In the case of

those who have been already ten years in practice, four years of

study may suffice.
     10. Examinations to be conducted by the censors, viva voce,

and in writing, and to include clinical tests of competency.

I This plan, with one or two slight alterations, is that which
   submitted to the conference committee of the College in last

IDecember ; and after having heard many other schemes proposed

and debated in the College, humbly think that this, in simplicity,
safety, and sufficiency, excels them all ; excepting, however, that
subsequently brought forward by Drs. Latham and Watson, which,

Iin no material respect, differs from mine. In further explanation

and support of this plan, will add a few remarks on its several

 items.

      1. This constitution of. the College resembles that of other
learned societies, and is the only plan on which the privileges of
 members may be preserved, whilst the offices afford fair means of

 honourable distinction.

      2. The abolition of the degrading distinction of the licentiate,

I hold to be essential to the prosperity, nay, the very existence of

 the College, in the position in which we hope to see it. All that
 was urged in my former letter against the causes of disunion, is
 especially applicable to this invidious division in the same order of
 men. To recognise a man as a physician, and yet to refuse him
 the full rights and privileges of a member of the body of physicians,
 is to stultify the recognition, and to stamp him with a mark of
 inferiority which renders the distinction a perpetual subject of
 shame and discontent. Even conceding to the licentiates (accord-
 ing to some of the recently proposed schemes), the title of members,
 with the privilege of naming annually for the fellowship a number
 out of their own order, one half of which number is to be rejected
 by the fellows, would be but an ungracious half-measure of justice,
 and one ill. calculated to promote that harmony and unity of interest
 which should subsist between the members of the same body. The

  same serious objections stand against the plan of limiting the
  number of fellows, and filling up the vacancies, as they may occur,

  by election from the licentiates. As long as the number of fellows
174 LICENTIATES TO BE MADE FELLOWS.

is limited (even were it less so than it is proposed to be), so long
will there be discontent among the degraded seniors that are

excluded ; and although a disgrace to be excluded, it would be no
peculiar honour to be included in the proposed body of two hundred

fellows. It is impossible not to foresee that all such measures which

keep up a distinction, to which the majority cannot have access,
and over which they can exercise no control, must perpetuate that

jealousy and distrust that has hitherto alienated the College from

the greater number of the physicians practising in this country.

This obnoxious distinction was one of the chief grievances com-

Iplained of in the petitions of the licentiates to the two Houses of
Parliament.  appeal to the present licentiates do they still

Idesire it to be removed ?
     3. propose that all the present licentiates shall be at once
raised to the privileges of fellowship ; and with the view to in-

corporate the whole order of regularly educated physicians in this
country, it seems proper to admit at this time, without examination,
all physicians who have been three years or upwards in practice.

Those of a later date could not well object to an examination. (I

may state, that the College has already resolved on such an act of
grace, by which all regularly educated physicians now in practice
shall be at once admitted to the licentiate, on the payment of a

certain fee.)
     4. The order of physicians will still have an aristocracy, and

the College will still hold out its distinctions ; and they will not be
distinctions in name only, impaired by numbers, but honourable

offices of trust and usefulness. These honours, being conferred by

the suffrages of the whole body, will prove bonds of mutual esteem

and confidence, instead of causes of jealousy ; and being open to

all, they will be incentives to honourable ambition, as the rewards
of intellectual merit and moral worth. The only limit which it

seems desirable to make, is with regard to age and standing in the

College. A trust so important as that of assisting in the councils
Iof the governing body of the profession, requires some experience
and knowledge of the profession and of the world.  would pro-

pose even a longer noviciate than five years, but that the increased
sphere and importance of the operations of the College are likely to

develop more business than the senior fellows might have time to

transact. The more onerous duties should, therefore, devolve on
younger, yet not inexperienced, men ; whilst the council would
have the advantage of the assistance of the seniors in all matters of

importance. The number of the council is a matter for consider-

ation. It is desirable that the number should be sufficient to
COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS COUNCIL.                      175

perform the work satisfactorily, and without too great a tax on
the time of each member ; but it should not be so great as to lower

the honour or the responsibility of the office. Probably from fifty

to sixty would suffice.

The mode of conducting the ballot for the election of the council

is proposed after much deliberation, and with deference to those

who have advised the voting to be only personal. When we con-

sider the engrossing engagements of medical men, it is too much to

expect those resident at a distance, at a sacrifice of time and money,

to come to London to vote ; and it would not be fair to deprive
country physicians of this their best privilege. Fellows residing in

ILondon and its vicinity would otherwise enjoy many advantages

over their provincial brethren ; and think it but just to preserve,

as much as possible, the privileges of the latter.

5. The power of electing to the presidency of the College of

Physicians, the highest medical honour which this country can
bestow, certainly ought to be placed in the hands of all the

members of so highly educated a body.

6. The duties of censors as examiners, require peculiar quali-

fications ; and it appears to me that the members of the council

would, better than the fellows at large, be able to select the fittest

persons for this important office.

    7. It has been generally found that the affairs of societies are

most efficiently and satisfactorily managed by a representative

council. The busy and engrossing occupation of medical men

renders especially desirable for them this plan of entrusting their
common interests to a few of their own choosing. These are still

responsible for the trust committed to them, having to give a
general report of their proceedings at the annual meeting of the
fellows. The yearly change of a third of the council also affords to

the whole body the opportunity of refreshing their representative

head, according to the wishes of the majority.

The council, as the acting body of the College, will have to co-

operate for the fulfilment of what, in a former part of this letter,

have been described as the three great purposes of the College of

Physicians.  As these purposes comprehend several classes of

subjects, it will be advisable that the council should appoint sepa-

rate committees : for example, an Education Committee, a Com-

mittee of Privilege and Discipline, a Committee for Medical Police,

a Pharmacopeia Committee, a Library Committee, &c. Without
entering into further details, it must be apparent that the office of

a councillor would be no sinecure : the reward would be the honour
which it confers ; but it seems fair that there should be some
176 TOO BUSY TO PURSUE SUBJECT.

stipend attached to the office, not remunerative, but as an indemnity

for time and service.

    8. It is quite proper that a reformed College should have juris-

diction over all the physicians of the country ; and that the privileges

of its members should be protected by law.

9. The subject of medical education is too wide to be considered

here ; but the outline given is intended to mark the elevated

standard of education and mature age required in this highest rank

of medical practitioners.

10. My great reason for mentioning the mode of examination

is, to draw attention to the clinical test which is proposed for the

Ipractical qualifications of the candidates. This should, think, be

the characteristic of the examination by the College of Physicians,

and should not be dispensed with even in those cases in which the

high character of the academic degree of the candidate might

render superfluous further trial on other subjects.

My chief object in addressing you has been to draw the atten-

tion of the profession to its present helpless and oppressed condition ;
and to point out to all, but especially to those engaged in the

reform of the three corporate institutions, the need of the largest

and most conciliatory measures to ensure union, strength, and
Ijustice, to the whole medical community.
                                            have the honour to be,

sir, your obedient servant,  CHARLES J. B. WILLIAMS.

Holies Street, Cavendish Square : September 24, 1841.

It may seem strange, after the expression of such decided

Iand deliberate opinions on the subject of reform of the College

of Physicians, that did not follow it up by continuing to take

Ian active part in the affairs of that body. But in fact, had

not time for it. The duties of the professorship, together with

the rapidly increasing engagements of private practice, were

too engrossing, to permit of frequent attendance at the tedious

deliberations of the College. Even after my resignation of the

Professorship, my injured health limited my powers very much
Ito the occupations of a very extensive practice.
                                                       suppose it

is much the case with other public bodies, that their manage-

ment falls chiefly into the hands of those who have little else

to do, and who make it their business to attend every meeting,

take possession of the situation, and by unyielding persistence,
eventually succeed in getting everything their own way. The
REFORM HITHERTO IMPERFECT.  177

worst of this is that these busybodies, of small occupation,
jiiv apt to be narrow-minded in their views, and look more to

personal advantage and privilege, than to high principle and
public good. No doubt many changes for the better have

Itaken place since this period, in the state and management of

the College of Physicians, and have not been wanting in my
endeavours to promote them : but, to my mind, they have

fallen short of what was needed to establish the College on a

comprehensive basis of efficiency and general utility, and to
satisfy the expectations of the physicians of town and country.
The change in title from Licentiates to Members seems an im-
provement ; but it is more in name than in reality ; for the
so-called Members have no functions or privileges of the body
corporate ; election and government being still restricted to
Fellows. The election to the Fellowship, instead of being

limited to a favoured few, and so made a cause of jealousy and
discontent to the members, ought to be liberal and impartial,
and extend to all the highly qualified physicians of the Empire.
Thus the College might become, what it is intended to be, the
representative Head of the most learned and skilful of the

Profession.

     of its Founder and Honorary Secretary, Sir Philip Rose, Bart.

IT was in this year, 1841, that the first public steps were taken
for the establishment of the Hospital for Consumption and
Diseases of the Chest. The idea of such an institution
originated entirely with a young solicitor, Philip Eose, member
of the firm of Baxter, Eose, and Norton ; and it was mainly

through his zeal, energy, and indefatigable perseverance, that
the idea was realised, and the hospital founded ; which has
now expanded into one of the grandest and most beneficent
institutions in the world.

    It happened that a clerk in his firm was ill in consump-

tion ; and on endeavouring to get him into a hospital, Eose
found that consumptive patients were excluded by the rules
of most of the London Hospitals, on the general plea of the
lingering and incurable nature of the disease. This case of
deep individual distress, led him to the discovery of a great

public want. For the sufferers from a disease, which destroys

a fifth of the adult population, there was no asylum ; and
only limited means of out-door relief. His heart felt the

greatness of the evil ; and his energetic spirit stirred him

to the effort of seeking for a remedy. He appealed to some

of the medical authorities of his acquaintance ; but the only

one from whom he could get encouragement, was Mr. Benjamin

Travers, the distinguished surgeon.

Mr. Eose was a member of the congregation of the Rev.

W. Niven, incumbent of St. Saviour's Church, Chelsea ; who

was also my particular friend, and late Chaplain at St. George's

Hospital. He introduced Mr. Eose to me, for advice on the

whole question, and for assistance in its pursuit in prospect

of possible benefit. At that time my personal experience

with regard to consumptive disease in hospital and in private,

was considerable, (although nothing to what it afterwards

Ibecame) ; and it had inspired me with more hope thari found

to be entertained by standard writers or practitioners ; not

only as to the palliative powers of medicine, to mitigate and

soothe the disease ; but also as to the possibility of retarding

and arresting and in early and limited cases, of even effect-
a

so much as felt it. The strong feeling prevailing in the

profession against quackery, and the false hopes which

Mr. F. Mowatt, Mr. H. Cremer, Dr. Guy, Dr. Eobert Dickson,

and Messrs. Barnes, Browne and Gardiner, surgeons of the

neighbourhood. Dr. Guy was relative of Mr. Eose, and

aided me much in representing the medical relations of our

Iproject : but felt that the chief responsibility in this respect
Idevolved on myself.
                                      tried my utmost to interest several

leading hospital physicians in the movement, (including Drs.

Chambers, Latham, Watson, and Bright) but I could not get

any to give the support of even their names. Sir James

Clark declined for himself; but he recommended Dr. John

Forbes to join us ; and encouraged us to hope for countenance
at Court. In May 1841 a public meeting to support the
project was held in Hanover Square Booms, the Earl of Hare-
wood in the chair ; with a pretty full attendance, and fair

promise of support. Of medical men who spoke, besides
myself, were Sir Charles Scudamore and Dr. Forbes. My

public support of the proposed hospital was expressed chiefly

on the prospect of its proving the means of great temporal

and spiritual good to the patients, and as affording oppor-
tunities for studying the disease and improving its treatment,

rather than on any avowed hopes of effecting its cure. It

was encouraging to find that there was no public expression

of disapproval by the press or in the profession ; and the

committee had to be very circumspect in their proceedings, to

keep clear of all imputations of jobbing or quackery. After

a while, when the soundness of the undertaking became ap-

parent, from the character of those engaged in
                                      is               and the

fession, as well as of the public, was not withheld.

Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen consented to become

the Patron during the following year, and evinced warm

interest in its success. The Duke of Bichmond was President,
and several noblemen Vice-Presidents. It unnecessary to

mention here the further steps of the development of the

Hospital, which may be seen in the reports. The most im-

portant events were, the laying the foundation of the New
Hospital at Brompton by His Boyal Highness Prince Albert
on June 11, 1844, and the opening of the Hospital in June

1846.

Ishadow of self-interested motives in what had done. When
Itherefore the committee requested me to become consulting

physician, at first refused the office. But a second unani-

Imous request, that would accept the office, came from the

Committee, backed by a letter from Mr. Travers, expressing
his opinion that my withdrawal would injure the prospects

Iof the institution. So became Consulting Physician, which
Ioffice have held ever since : although of late years my
Itenure has been more nominal than real. Dr. Forbes was

elected at the same time, and was very glad of his assistance
in drawing up the regulations, and in considering the qualifica-
tions of the numerous applicants for office. 1 As the projected
institution gained favour with the public, we began to feel
the pressure of aristocratic patronage on behalf of favourite
nominees, and the Committee of Management had a difficult
task to perform. But it is due to Mr. Philip Eose and his
friends, to record their unswerving loyalty to the medical staff,
to whom they had confided the medical affairs of the infant
establishment. Mr. Eose was the son of a medical man, and
had married the daughter of a highly respected practitioner at

Hastings, Mr. Eankine, whom I knew for years, and attended

some members of his family. As Honorary Secretary, Mr.
Eose was the leading spirit of the enterprise, and his cordial
co-operation with competent and disinterested medical advisers
was greatly conducive to its success. Mr. Liston, Professor
of Clinical Surgery at University College, was appointed Con-
sulting Surgeon. And for the regular work of the Hospital,
Dr. Hamilton Eoe and Dr. Walshe were Physicians, and Dr.
Theophilus Thompson, Physician to visit out-patients. This
staff was increased from time to time as the Hospital became
enlarged ; and in the list of Physicians and Assistant Phy-
sicians since appointed, may be found many well known and
eminent names too numerous for insertion here.

     The institution from its first foundation to the present
time has received the warm support of the clergy; and
deservedly so, for established for those among whom there

182 ZEALOUS PULPIT SUPPORT.

must always be a large mortality, the spiritual wants of the

patients call for full and free ministration of the means of

Grace ; and this has been always an important function of the

Hospital. A chaplain, wholly devoted to its work, was one of

the earliest appointments ; and later, a chapel for public

worship, dedicated to St. Luke, was consecrated within the
building, at the sole cost of the Rev. Sir Henry Foulis, Bart,

for some years chairman of the Committee of Management.

Among those who first and most earnestly pleaded the cause

of the hospital in various churches, was the Eev. Robert

Montgomery, who preached more than thirty sermons on its

behalf. He was a powerful preacher, and with a mind full of

earnest poetic feeling, which was turned to good account in

the pulpit ; whatever may have been the faults in his poetry,

which brought on him the scathing criticism of Macaulay ;
Itoo bitter to be unprejudiced.
                                 knew Mr. Montgomery well,

and valued his zealous efforts in our good cause. Some years

later, my friend, the Rev. Capel Molyneux, was often eloquent

Iin our behalf; and also acted on the Committee, as the^
Hospital was near his church.    had been so fortunate as to

restore to him a daughter, who was pronounced to be in a

Ihopeless state of Consumption ; but believe that the disease

was inflammatory ; and the patient recovered. Mr. Molyneux's

power of riveting his hearers, by the force and beauty of his

rapid oratory, was such, that his sermons would last for an

hour and more, without the least failure of rapt attention.

I used to implore him to have more mercy on himself, if not

on his hearers. He said that preaching did not in the least

fatigue him, and that he often felt, at the end of his sermon,

more fresh than when he began. But some time afterwards,

he came to me with intermitting pulse, and other signs of

overstrain ; and in a few years broke down with disease of the

vessels of the brain.

     The Rev. W. Harrison was another able preacher, zealous
in the cause ; with others too numerous to mention. In the

forty- second report of the Hospital, which appeared this year

1883, I find a record of 440 church collections having bee.n

made on behalf of the Hospital by clergymen of the English

Church, including 64 Archbishops and Bishops. The fact

speaks well for the Church and for the Hospital, and is a great

proof of their mutual appreciation. The benefits of the Hos-

pital are open to all denominations; and patients are permitted

to have the ministrations from their respective churches.

The Institution became an object of much interest among

many of the literary and musical world ; and several were

among its early supporters. The well known and agreeable

writers, Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall, lived in the neighbourhood ;

and at their house we (the Committee) met some years later,

to present a testimonial to Mile. Jenny Lind, in acknow-

ledgment of her having given concerts in aid of funds to build

a new wing to the Hospital, which was afterwards called by her

name. The present was a silver salver with inscription, and

engraved above, a view of the building in finished lines, the

completed part, but in airy outlines only, the wanted wing, to

be turned to substantial reality, by the magic power of the voice
Iof the gifted songstress.
                            remember too, Charles Dickens pre-

siding at a public dinner in aid of the Hospital, and diverting as

well as interesting, his hearers in his versatile manner. On

that occasion, Dr. Guy made a good speech, in anticipation

of recent hygienic movements, warning us of a rife source of

Consumption, in the close unhealthy habitations of the poor.

    It is unnecessary here to record the several steps of

development, which have marked the progress of this Institu-

tion during the last forty years, but I have requested my son,

Dr. Charles Theodore Williams, one of the Physicians of the

Hospital, to insert a brief account of its present state.

     ' The Hospital has gradually extended its sphere of usefulness,
by an increase in the number of wards and of out-patients. Com-
mencing with ninety beds in 184G, it rose to 200 in 1856 ; and in
1882, on the opening of the new extension building, it reached a
total of 331 beds, which are always fully occupied. The medical

staff lias been correspondingly augmented, and now includes four

consulting physicians, a consulting surgeon, six physicians, six

assistant-physicians, besides two resident medical officers, and
four clinical assistants. The establishment further comprises, the

chaplain, the secretary and clerks, the matron and nurses, and
other domestics. The building now consists of two magnificent
structures, one on either side of the Fulham road, communicating
 184 NEW BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS.

 by a tunnel and a telephone. The old, or parent hospital, stands
 in a garden of three acres, is built in the Elizabethan style in the
 form of the letter H, and consists of two wings, each 190 feet deep,
 running north and south, joined by an intermediate portion, which
 runs east and west, with a frontage of 200 feet. Behind this hospital
 is the beautiful chapel, connected with the first floor by a corridor.
 The building contains a basement, with kitchen, boiler and engine
 rooms, secretary's office, resident's apartments, and a spacious
 board-room. Above this is the first floor, devoted to the female

 galleries and wards ; the second floor for males, the arrangements

being similar on both floors. In the attic are the nurses' rooms,

 and above these the ventilating towers.
      ' The principles of construction are the same in both hospitals,

but the new one may be regarded as their further development, by
the aid of the most modern appliances. The new extension building,
in the Queen Anne style of architecture, consists of a basement,
ground floor, and first, second, and third floors ; the last three being
devoted to the wards, which contain 137 beds. On the ground floor
is the out-patient department, and into these lofty and capacious
halls with convenient consulting and waiting rooms, and dispensary,

    out-patients, to the number of 200 or 300 a day, flock from far
and near, to receive advice and medicine. Last year upwards of
12,000 new cases were seen in this department ; and such is the
excellence of the ventilation, that the air of the waiting-rooms is as
free from smell at the end of the day, as at the beginning, notwith-
standing the large attendance, and with no windows open.

     ' Ascending to the wards, each floor consists of a dining-hall,
corridors, wards, nurses' and bath-rooms, and lavatories. The
corridors and hall are fitted up with couches, seats, and tables ; and
here the patients pass most of their time, only sleeping in the wards ;
unless when confined to bed by a severe attack. The wards con-

tain from one to eight beds each, according to their size ; and allow,

on an average, of 115 feet floor space, and 1,400 cubic feet per head
for each patient. To prevent the smell of cooking from entering the
wards, the kitchen is placed at the top of the house ; and the food
is brought down by hydraulic lifts : a special one on a larger scale

is used for patients and nurses.
     ' The ventilation of the hospital is maintained independently of

the windows and fireplaces, and supplies 4,000 cubic feet per hour
to each patient ; the problem to be solved being, the combination of
an abundant supply of air, and the maintenance of a warm and
equable temperature (60 Fahr.) night and day. This is done by
        BROMPTON HOSPITAL VENTILATION, ETC. 185

 the admission of air into the corridors and wards, partly through
 vertical tubes, and partly through hotwater-coils, the vitiated air
 being drawn off by flues opening into four towers, containing steam-
 pipes, which form the exhausting chambers, and are maintained at
 a temperature 10 F. higher than that of the wards. In accordance
with the requirements of modern therapeutics, special rooms are
devoted to the application of steam sprays, and inhalations, on each
gallery ; while the basement contains a complete Turkish bath, in-
 cluding an excellent douche ; and also a compressed-air bath, worked

 by a steam-engine, and expressly adapted for the treatment of pul-

 monary disease.
      ' The dietary of the patients is generous and varied as far as

possible ; and while a garden affords opportunities of exercise out of
doors, a bright airy recreation-room is provided within for their

amusement. Here, throughout the winter, weekly entertainments
of music, readings, conjuring, and dramatic performances, take
place, so that the lot of the inmates is rendered as agreeable as

possible.
      ' One of the great objects of the Hospital being to afford a more

extended field for medical observation and research than existed
previously, the Committee of Management have acted wisely in
adding a new pathological department, where, besides the usual re-
cords of morbid anatomy being kept, special researches, microscopic
and chemical, into the intimate nature and causation of Consump-
tion, are now being systematically carried on.

     ' This department, in addition to the wards and out-patients,
affords a rich store of clinical and pathological observations, valuable
for teaching purposes, and with the same object, the medical practice
of the hospital has been thrown open to practitioners and students,
on payment of a small fee ; and lectures and demonstrations are

given once a week by the medical staff, the attendance at which
steadily increases.

     ' The development of the hospital is largely due to the spirit of
progress and enlightenment influencing the present Committee of
Management ; and to their cordial endeavours to carry into effect
the recommendations of the medical staff : on the continued hearty
co-operation of these two, and the support of the public, the future
welfare of the hospital will depend.

    ' In conclusion, it may be safely affirmed that, furnished as the

Brompton Hospital is with all the best hygienic and therapeutic
appliances, with excellent nursing, and a large and active medical
staff, it is not excelled by any institution in the world ; and is not

To resume the life narrative of the year 1841. In the holiday

of that year, at the end of July, Dr. Sharpey accompanied me in

a tour to the Isle of Wight, with a peep at my friends Dr. Martin,

and the Rev. Charles Bury (an old patient) ; and then visiting
the British Association (Science), in its meeting at Plymouth,

where we were joined by my friend Mr. James Smith of Jordan

Hill, whose family I had long attended. As may be supposed

Ifrom what has been said of the amount of business gone
through,  had no paper for the meeting, and there was

nothing remarkable to record of the proceedings for that year.

We delayed not to adjourn for our remaining holiday to our

cottage home at Ivy Rock, near Chepstow : where my wife

and family, (now four children) passed the summer. My

friend, Sharpey, was much pleased with our scenery and

country life. Not equally so with the equestrian excursions,

suited to that picturesque country ; and after two or three

rides, to Tintern, Eagland, &c., in which the Professor did

not succeed in harmonising well with his horse's paces, he

Igave up his rides, declaring ' would just rather walk.' More

congenial were his visits to the Bishop of Llandaff, Dr.

Coppleston, who lived in that neighbourhood. Sharpey was a

good causeur ; and his stories were interesting to those who

had not heard them before. The Bishop was like him, and

enjoyed both hearing and talking.

But Dr. Coppleston was remarkable for drawing out great

talkers. Being also Dean of St. Paul's, he used to ask me to
his dinners at the Deanery, with the certainty of meeting in-

Iteresting guests, among whom, best remember Archbishop

Whately, and the Bishop of Exeter, Dr. Phillpott. They were

both famous for monopolising conversation. But the vehe-

ment rapid words of the Archbishop, light-complexioned and

tall, seemed to bear down the Bishop, who was dark, rather

stout, pompous, and deliberate with his sentences. But they

both spoke extremely W7ell, and it was profitable to listen to
them. A few words which fell from Archbishop Whately on

one of these occasions, on a grammatical inaccuracy of the

IAuthorised Version of ihe New Testament, 1 first interested me

in the study of the Greek Testament, which took up soon after ;

and it became a daily practice during the latter part of my life.

The Session of 1841-42 was not marked by any stirring

incident. The systematic Lectures on Medicine were given

every morning from 9 to 10 ; a more convenient hour ;

with the refreshment of a walk to and from the College. The

routine of Lectures and hospital duties became easier ; but not

to the extent of giving less occupation. Practice and habit

had improved the efficiency of the work, and made it more

practically, in as plain and pleasant a manner as could find

no attempt at artificial wit. My predecessor, Dr. Elliotson,

was naturally jocose ; and made his lectures amusing, as
well as instructive, by the familiar and funny way in which he

Iexpressed himself. Then he had rendered himself popular in

another way, in which could not follow. He had a large

theatrical connection, and used to attend gratuitously dramatic

and musical performers. They returned the compliment by

sending him free tickets, which he distributed largely in his

class, to the great gratification of some among their number.

Such would not relish my practice of giving at the beginning

of the course, something like a sermon an address of friendly

advice, for the preservation of their health, in body and mind,

during their student life. It was well attended by the best of

Ithe students, and hoped gave encouragement, at least to the

well disposed.

   IAmong those most marked for regularity of attendance

and proficiency during these two sessions, find the following
names. Henry Allen ; W. H. Williams ; Francis Buckell ;

Fred. Manning ; George Canney ; W. L. Adye ; John Boulby ;

Robert Eansom ; Alex. J. Lamotte ; Alfred B. Garrod ; Thomas

James Gramshaw ; F. J. Brown ; William Da vies ; John W.

Davies ; Kirkham Burton ; G. F. Webb ; Henry James Stokes ;

R. D. Adams ; William M. Kelly ; Godwin Tims ; Wm. John

Preston ; and Howell Evans. Of these several will be recog-
Inised as having since risen to eminence. Some,
Iknow how many, have passed away.                hardly

                                            hope it will not be

Iunpleasant to the survivors to see their names in this memoir.

For my part, could not but feel an interest in those attentive

students, who, day after day, for many months, sat listening

to me ; and with an intelligence of expression, which betokened

communion of thought and feeling. It was much to my regret

Ithat could have so little intercourse with my pupils. The

clinical clerks were always invited to my house : but my ex-

cessive occupation, and the delicate health of my wife, which

occasioned her frequent absence from home, prevented me

from showing much hospitality ; as the same causes had

debarred me also from visiting in society.

In point of numbers there was a considerable diminution ;

 378Z. 13s. 4tL More than sufficient to make up this deficiency,
were the receipts from private practice, which were nearly
 double those of the preceding year.

    IIn connection with the increase of private practice, must
Imention the names of some friends whose good opinion was

so fortunate as to gain. Sir James McGrigor, at the head of

the medical department of the Army, sent me a number of

patients, and promoted the reading of my works among the

medical officers of the Army. Sir John Webb, at the head of

Ithe Ordnance Department at Woolwich, was also my good

friend ; and in seeing patients with him, had the opportunity
of observing the salutary influence of his religious character on

the officers of the Artillery and their families. My old College
chums, Drs. Prestwood and Henry Lucas, were several years in

the Artillery, and always spoke most warmly of their Director-

General. My friend, the Eev. Capel Molyneux, was then the

popular preacher of Woolwich, and had exercised a benign

influence on society there, including the Arsenal. Dr. John
Scott was in general practice at Barnes ; but having a good
Indian connection, he was appointed Examiner to the East
Indian Board, after Dr. Chambers. He then moved to Stratton

Street, and practised as physician. Having consulted me for

his own health, he thought so well of me, as to call me into

consultation on every possible occasion, which his Oriental
connection rendered not rare. University College, in virtue
of its tolerance of all forms of religious belief, has a large
Hebrew connection ; Sir Isaac Lionel Goldsmid, being its most
zealous and beneficent treasurer. Many Jews came to me ;

and I became an especial favourite of the great Jewish Dr.

Van Oven, who in his family, and among his people, found me

Ino end of patients.

     But from no one did get more introductions to practice,
and those of the highest class, than from Sir Charles Locock.

He was well acquainted with my affair at St. George's
Hospital, and judged it right to support Dr. Hope ; never-
theless he showed his confidence in me by recommending

me to be consulted in numerous cases, especially those of dif-

Ificult diagnosis. Locock was one of the ablest practitioners

   ever met. Plain and rather dry in address and manner, he

was earnest and thorough in his investigation of a case ; and

by dint of intelligent and persevering trials, had acquired the

knowledge of a great number of remedies, which supplied him

with a variety of resources, and made him often successful,

where every one else had failed. But he was weak in physical

diagnosis, and knew it. He had never been properly instructed,

and besides, had too much dulness of hearing to permit him

to distinguish the weaker sounds. So he availed himself of my

help in diagnosis ; and always gave me the full credit of it. On

Imy part often profited by his superior knowledge of remedies ;
Iand in obstinate or difficult disorders, not at all confined to his

department, when have resorted to Locock for a new remedy,

I have been well satisfied with the success of the result.
   IDuring spring '42, heard of a proposal made in the

Council of the British Association for the Advancement of

Science, to discontinue the Section of Anatomy and Medicine.

It was said not to be well supported ; and that the Provincial

Medical Association would be the fitter channel for Medical
Isubjects.
            immediately wrote to Sir Edward (then Major)
ISabine, (who, think, was General Secretary), urging the right-

ful claims which Medical Science had to be represented in a

Scientific Congress : and from my own knowledge bore witness

to the utility and success of the Section in former years. The

Imeeting this year was to be at Manchester ; and moved some

of my medical friends there to bestir themselves against this

annuated member, inadequately representing Medicine in the

Council, and having no zeal himself in the cause, tried to choke

the whole concern. Major Sabine replied that the Council

were anxious to maintain the completeness of the Association,

which depended on all the branches being continued in full

activity.   So the Section was formed as usual, and was well

   IIn October 1842 was again requested to give the open-
Iing lecture of the session ; and was not at a loss for a fitting

subject; for the preparation of a work on the 'Principles of

IMedicine ' had been occupying all the spare time that could

command. It was then, On the need of the study of General

Pathology as the foundation of Practical Medicine. The theatre

was crowded ; and there were several foreign visitors, including
Professor Justus von Liebig, introduced by his friend, Professor

Graham. In conversation with me after the lecture, Professor

Liebig expressed his entire concurrence with my views.
     The following extracts will serve to show the drift of the

lecture. After adverting to the state of medicine as a study
and as an art ; and to the favour shown to empiricism by
the public, the difficulties and unattractiveness of practical
medicine are set forth.

         In fact, a true pathology, or sound principles of medicine, is

the embodiment of the results of experience in disease, with a
knowledge of structure and function in health. It is the only

connecting link between the preparatory sciences and practical

medicine. Without it, these are disjecta membra; with

form a connected body of science young yet, it is true, and falling

short of all the objects of the art, but already available for much, and

needing only the growth and continued support of its chief mem-

bers, especially anatomy, physiology, and clinical observation, to

become a more perfect and efficient director of practical medicine.

The great proof of the practical utility of general pathology is,

the aid which it gives in the study of clinical medicine, and the light

which clinical medicine continually throws on it. The states which

the practitioner has to treat are often too indefinite, or too mixed,

to correspond with any of the definitions of special disease. They

frequently consist of functional disorder, varying with time and

circumstance, or changing its place, so as to present no fixed

characters. But, compared by the pathologist with the standard

of health, and analysed from their complexity, their nature be-

comes intelligible, and their proper treatment obvious, so far as

means are possessed to counteract or control that which is wrong.

Let us take one out of many examples. The disordered state of

health, for treating which Mr. Abernethy gained such a reputation,

is one of the commonest ailments we have to prescribe for : some

call with Abernethy, all stomach others, liver others,
'                                      '            '               ;
                                                           ;
          it,                                               '        it, ' '

                                                                                        '

differently they may name                   it,  few refuse to treat  as Abernethy

did, by regulated diet, blue pill, and mild saline aperients, re-

peatedly administered. Now the pathologist analyses the symp-

toms of such state, and in the white or yellowish furred tongue,
               a

morbid eructations, tender epigastrium, sometimes full right hypo-

chondrium, with extended dulness on percussion, the discoloured

fteces, the high-coloured and turbid urine, he finds proof of con-

gestion and disturbed secretion of the liver and upper part of the

alimentary canal and he recognises in the remedies employed,
if
                                    ;
means which, by increasing the secretions, relieve the congestion
                                                                      ;
and these fail, he can suggest other measures, which he knows                      ;

to be efficacious in removing congestion, and restoring the natural                       :
                                                                                                          ;
secretions. Again, what confusion in diagnosis, as well as in

practice, has arisen from comprehending, under the special name

hysteria, the most opposite and most varying conditions, merely

because they are consorted with some nervous phenomena so that

this word becomes almost synonymous with female diseases. But,
pathologically considered, the confusion in diagnosis, and, in some

measure, the perplexity in regard to treatment, cease. In one

group of such cases, the pathologist finds really such signs of dis-

ordered uterine function as would justify the name other symp-

toms, however varied, taking their origin from this disorder and

                                                 o
194 PRINCIPLES IN MEDICINE

he thus discovers the necessity of directing the treatment to this
cause. In another group, again, he finds the uterine function

impaired ; but this only in common with other functions : and all
this in consequence of a want of blood throughout the body, which
want is denoted by the waxy complexion, the pallid lips and gums,

the loose yet easily quickened pulse, the panting breath, the feeble
limbs, &c. Here the restoration of the blood is the obvious indi-

cation ; and in proportion as this is effected, the symptoms of
nervousness, debility, and loss of function, disappear. In a third

group of cases, called hysterical, the pathologist discovers the

opposite condition, that of sanguineous plethora, which, indepen-
dently of any disorder of the uterus, causes trouble, sometimes in

one part, sometimes in another, but especially in the nervous
system, which, in most females, is peculiarly liable to disorder.

Here, too, he is led to the most appropriate treatment.

     This is but one instance out of many that might be adduced

to show the great practical utility of a good knowledge of patho-
logy. In fact, the leading rules of practice, those which guide the
most experienced men, (although many are not aware of it, and

would not acknowledge it,) are founded on general views of diseased
function and structure that is, general pathology. You will not

find that practical men treat a disease merely according to its
name, or according to the nature of the local mischief. Inflam-

mation is not always to be combated by bloodletting, nor haemor-

rhage by styptics. The condition of the system that is, of the
functions, is to be taken into account ; and the variations of this

condition, the states of sthenia and asthenia, tone and debility,

excitement and depression, plethora and anaemia, are the very

subjects which general pathology explains and shows how to treat.

   I say, practitioners do act more on general ideas of disease, than

on their knowledge of particular diseases. They feel the pulse and

the skin, to guide them in the use of bloodletting, whether they

have found out the special disease or not. They examine the

tongue, and inquire as to the state of the evacuations, to guide
them in the use of purgatives, under whatever complaint the

patient labours. They consider the complexion and bodily strength
in connexion with dietetic measures ; and the chief treatment of

convalescence depends on rules suggested by general pathological

knowledge.
     There are other very important departments of medicine which

Iare comprehended in general pathology, and with it have been too
much neglected  mean, the study of the causes of disease, and

their modes of operating on the living body, (etiology,} and the
   PRACTICALLY USEFUL.                      195

-

means by which they may be avoided or counteracted, including
prophylaxis, or the prevention of disease ; and hygienics, preserva-
tion of health. Neither of these subjects can be satisfactorily

comprehended without a sufficient knowledge of the elements and

laws of disease.

    Is it not, therefore, most important that these general views,
which are so practical and so extensive in their application, should
be well founded and carefully studied ? Is it right that the lead-

ing doctrines of disease, leading not in theory only, but in practice,

should, as hitherto, be left to be picked up irregularly, from casual

retrospects of study or experience, when they may be learned as
the very groundwork of practical knowledge ?

     What, then, is this general pathology, which we extol so much

as the proper foundation of practical medicine ? Let us first state

what it is not. It is not a collection of hypotheses hung on soli-

tary facts, and ingeniously devised to explain this or that symp-

tom, or the modus operandi of this or that remedy. It is not

anything floating on (I cannot say, founded on) conjectural notions

in anatomy and physiology, such as the existence and circulation

of a nervous fluid, the presiding influence of the ganglionic system,
or the vital attractions and repulsions of the circulating fluids ;

notions which, however they may hereafter be substantiated, are at

present too speculative to form a foundation for pathology. Nor is
it a partial set of opinions, erected on one only of the many pedi-
ments of fact on which the science of medicine should stand.

Healthy anatomy, physiology, physics, chemistry, the study of

clinical medicine, that of materia medica, morbid anatomy neither
of these alone can furnish a foundation for pathology that found-

ation must be formed by ALL the facts which ALL supply, constitute
the material of which it is built, and the general facts or laws of ALL

must be brought to bear on the arrangement of these materials, in

the construction of a system of pathology.

     Some advancement in these contributory departments is neces-
sary before the work can be begun, and it is because they have

advanced, that the opportunity is afforded. Why should the
science of medicine remain in a state of powerless infancy, when

its members are progressively acquiring strength and maturity ?
Why should the art of medicine still be groping about in blind
empiricism, and an unintelligible confusion of facts, when science

Ieven now can afford it the beginnings of light and of order ?
        have just said that the contributory sciences are sufficiently

Iadvanced to be generally applicable to practical medicine. The

proofs of this in detail, will, trust, appear in the progress of the
                                                o2
196 ALL CONTRIBUTORY SCIENCES.

Icourse ; but will adduce here a few examples of a prominent kind.

Disease, in so far as it is the result of mechanical change, or in

part made up of mechanical elements, may be properly treated by

mechanical means. It was the knowledge of this fact which led

Dr. Arnott to invent that admirable contrivance, the water-bed, by

which disease is often prevented and removed ; and he has lately
made another application of physical science, in modes of applying

pressure to parts with such equality as to control to any degree the

circulation of the blood through them, and thus to relieve pain,

remove congestion, subdue inflammation, heal ulcers, disperse

swellings, and arrest the growth, if not to effect the removal, of

tumours and other morbid productions. Disease, so far as it is

physical in its nature and in its effects, is to be investigated by

physical means. Hence the advantage of acoustic science in assist-

ing us in diagnosis of internal disease, and of optical science in

Ienabling us to witness the minutiae of its operations and its products.
  need scarcely add, that the treatment of disease ia in some in-

stances founded on, and in most cases guided by, knowledge thus

obtained.

   IAs an example of improvements in anatomy and physiology

bearing on practical medicine, may mention the late researches

on the nervous system, and especially those of Dr. Hall. By

these, much that before was unintelligible in diseases of the ner-

vous system has been satisfactorily explained, and their diagnosis

and treatment have received proportionate aid. Considerable

light has been thrown on diseases of the liver and of the heart, by

recent anatomical and physiological investigations of these organs.

The aids afforded by chemistry to the materia medica have been

long acknowledged, and continue to increase ; but chemistry is
growing in importance in its applications to every department of

practical medicine. It is now directly useful in the diagnosis
and treatment of diseases of the urinary organs. It furnishes a

key to the most important rules of diet, in health as well as in
disease, and bids fair to supply much that is wanting in explana-

tion of the origin of many maladies, and the most direct mode of

preventing them. It is through the aid of organic chemistry, now

far advanced advanced, too, mainly by the labours and genius of

an illustrious chemist, who this day honours us with his presence

(Professor   Liebig)     that we may hope that experimental physiolo-
gists and    clinical
                       observers will be enabled to solve some of the

dark problems of the operation of medicines ; a subject replete with

practical importance, yet one that still lies chiefly in the region of

conjecture.
           CLINICAL MEDICINE, ANATOMY, ETC.  197

It will not be disputed that clinical observation has lately done

much for the advancement of the science of medicine ; and this,
not only because it is the test by which the contributions of other

branches are tried, but also because in itself it is carried on with

the minuteness and precision which are essential to science.

This precision must apply, not only to the modes of calculating

facts, but also and most particularly to the correct determina-

tion and classification of these facts. The accuracy of counting

is a mere facility in common arithmetic. The accuracy of ob-

serving and arranging the facts to be counted, is the higher and

rarer quality. Both are required in th prosecution of clinical

research.

The whole department of practical medicine teems with ex-

amples of the benefits which it has derived from morbid anatomy.
What should we know of the nature, products, and tendencies of

inflammations, and other diseases which alter the structures, but

for the scalpel revealing them to our very sight and touch ? The

minuteness with which it (morbid anatomy) has been pursued in
connection with clinical observation, in regard to diseases of the

lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and alimentary canal, deserves especially

to be mentioned, as the great source of our improved theory and
practice in these complaints.

    It is not a general or superficial knowledge of any of these

fundamental sciences that will avail to make them profitable to
medicine. It is where their facts and laws have been carefully

studied, in relation to the living body, that the advantage has

become practical ; and this study has in many instances developed

new phenomena, which reflect light also on the contributory

science. The application of hearing to the distinction of diseases

has given rise to a more intimate knowledge of acoustic science.

Some of the most interesting facts and laws of organic chemistry

have resulted from researches instituted with reference to the

investigation of disease ; as, for example, those of Prout, Wohler,

and Liebig. In regard to anatomy and physiology, the instances
are abundant. For example, the researches of Charles Bell,
Foville, and M. Hall, on the nervous system, were conducted with

express reference to and were often suggested by the knowledgeit,

previously possessed of these diseases. In this respect they followedI
John Hunter, who throughout his anatomical labours had an eye

to pathology, and by observing disease, was continually guided to

objects for -these labours.

Do not suppose, because      insist strongly on general pathology

being the proper basis of practical medicine, that this will lead us to
198 PRINCIPLES KEY TO PRACTICE.

neglect the superstructure, special pathology. Individual diseases

Iwill be the chief subjects of the course, occupying 100 out of 150

lectures ; and trust that their details will become much more

Icomprehensible by the arrangement into which general pathology
will enable us to distribute them. It is because  feel the vast

Iimportance and extent of our knowledge of individual disease, that
  would endeavour to introduce you to it from the most advan-

tageous and commanding position ; and that position is afforded by

a previous acquaintance with the general features of disease. In

fact, individual diseases are like the leaves and boughs of the

tree, of which general pathology constitutes the trunk and great
branches all preserving an identity and connexion, yet each
portion having peculiarities of character which require separate
study. Or medicine may be compared to a great edifice, the

foundation and chief entrances of which represent pathology,

which generally give the proper approach to the separate rooms,
special diseases. To some of these, in the imperfect state of the

structure, there may be access only by the dark back ways of blind

experience, which then must not be neglected ; but this is no
reason for continuing to make these dark back ways the only

entrance.

Throughout our examination of the details of disease, we shall

find the principles of general pathology continually exemplified ;

and through these principles the mind can master the details, to an

extent wholly unattainable by those who pursue them as uncon-

nected matters of fact. Those who begin the study of practical

medicine by attempting to learn the details of diseases, are like
those who would endeavour to master all the facts of chemistry,

without any knowledge of the general facts or laws of chemical
action, affinity, and definite proportions ; yet even in practical

chemistry, or chemistry applied to the arts and manufactures, the

most extensive and important services have been obtained from

these very principles, applied to the details.

The purpose of lectures on the practice of medicine is not

merely to convey knowledge of disease and its treatment, but also
to direct the mind in the ways of using this knowledge, and of

acquiring more. Books will supply details which cannot be given
in the lectures ; but the more important additional source of infor-

mation is clinical instruction. This is an essential part of the

teaching of practical medicine. It is its demonstrative part, and

is essential, not only because, like other witnessed phenomena, it

appeals to the senses, but also because it is necessary to practise
those senses in the examination of the signs of disease, and to
          CAREFUL SCRUTINY OF DISEASE.        199

exercise the reasoning powers in the interpretation of those signs,

and in the further application of previously acquired knowledge.

As general pathology is the connecting link between the prepara-

tory studies and practical medicine, so clinical instruction is the

Istep between the knowledge of medicine and the personal appli-
cation of that knowledge in actual practice.  need not say that

each of these is most necessary to the formation of a good prac

titioner : but there are especial reasons why clinical study, con-

nected with the practice of medicine, is more indispensable now
than it ever was. In former days, medicine was little more than

a matter of routine ; and the examination of a patient was summed

up in feeling the pulse, looking at the tongue, and asking a few

questions as to the feelings and functions, and this was often done

for the sake more of form than of information ; for the pills and
draughts were much the same in most cases. This was little better

than quackery, and required no great preparatory study. That it

sometimes succeeded to win the favour of the public, is not sur-

prising, seeing that quackery often had a similar or greater success.

Then the ignorant practitioner could disguise his emptiness by

a cloak of mystery, and a solemnity of manner, and could command

confidence by dropping a hint about his experience, tact, and
intuitive perception of disease. But, ignorant as people still are in

medical matters, they are not so dull as to be deceived by these

means. They have a smattering of physiology and the use of

remedies, and they are become troublesomely inquisitive ; and if

they are taken in, it is by the clever quack, who is ready with his

theories and persuasive proportion of cures, and not by the unsatis-

factory regular, who examines but little, and cannot explain his

views or his practice. In short, the public look for what they have

a right to expect, thoroughly educated practitioners, who prove

their qualifications by their careful method of investigating disease,

the clearness with which they give their opinions, and the general

correctness of those opinions.
     This, then, is another reason for thoroughly availing yourselves

of practical instruction, especially in the clinical department. The

Igreat importance of this department has occasioned the adoption of
extended measures for teaching it.  trust that you will prove, by

the assiduity and success of your practical studies, that the College
has not adopted these means in vain ; but that, as in the prepara-
tory branches, so in the finishing of your medical education, you

will obtain that high standard of qualification that must insure the

confidence and esteem of those among whom you may exercise yonr

calling.

THE first edition of the ' Principles of Medicine ' was published

in the year 1843. In this the attempt was made to supply

the want, discussed in the introductory lecture, by a systematic
description and explanation of the leading and general facts
and doctrines regarding disease and its treatment. This
department of medical knowledge is also designated by the
term General Pathology and Therapeutics ; as distinguished
from Special Pathology and Therapeutics, or the theory and
practice of medicine in relation to individual diseases. Professor

IAlison's ' Outlines of Pathology ' had suggested somewhat of

the plan of the work, and was indebted to him for some of
its materials ; but the ' Principles ' embraced a wider scope,
entered into fuller details, and in every point were illustrated
by practical exemplification.

    It was my first satisfaction to find that the work was

highly appreciated by my pupils, who found in it a text book

Ifor the most difficult part of the course. But soon learned

that it was recommended by other Lecturers on Medicine ; and
it retained its popularity, through the three editions, which
were called for : the second in 1848 ; and the last in 1856,
when it had expanded to a volume of 600 pages, with much
additional matter, including a new chapter of nearly fifty pages
               SUCCESS OF THE WORK.                  201

on Prophylaxis and Hygienics. This was entirely original ;
and was almost the only treatise on the subjects in the English

language, until several years later, when the comprehensive

work of my former pupil, Dr. Parkes, appeared. To avoid

repetition, the succeeding remarks will refer to the later, as
well as to the first edition, which contained all the most

original and characteristic features, but further extended and

exemplified in the subsequent editions.

      The whole work was the most difficult and laborious of all

Ithat had ever undertaken; requiring not only extensive

reading and personal observation, for the supply of facts, but

also much depth of thought and careful deliberation in the

interpretation and arrangement of the knowledge thus supplied,

and in drawing inferences from it. In passing in review and

describing such a multiplicity of subjects, it was also necessary

Ito be very clear and precise in verbal expression, avoiding
all obscurity or confusion of terms.     was often conscious of
Ifalling short of what attempted to do ; of leaving questions
Iunanswered and difficulties unsolved. Nevertheless obtained

the credit of having given a more rational and connected view

of the Principles of Medicine than had ever been given before ;
and in addition to many favourable reviews in the journals,

I received numerous private letters expressive of general

satisfaction.

Owing to my increased occupation in practice, together

with the impediments of ill-health, the book has now been out

of print for many years. It would be impossible to give here

anything like an analysis of a treatise written in so concise

and condensed a style ; but as there seems little chance of its

ever being re-edited, and as it can still be referred to in the

public libraries, it may not be out of place to introduce an

abstract of the contents of a work, which, for more than a

quarter of a century, has occupied a conspicuous position in

the medical literature of this country and America.

                                     PLAN OF THE WORK.

     Taking Anatomy and Physiology as the basis of our know-
ledge of the structures and functions of the body in health,
the Principles of Medicine comprise the study of the same struc-
tures and functions, as changed by disease, together with the
powers of remedial agents to correct or cure them. And inas-
much as structures and functions consist of elements, simple,

   and in various combinations, the Principles of Medicine
204 SUMMARY OF METHOD.

also consist of elements, simple, and in various combinations,
ultimate or primary, proximate or secondary and combined
in various complications.

     The principles of medicine may be deduced in part from a
knowledge of the animal structures and functions, conjoined
with an acquaintance with the agents, which cause and
remove disease : but they are chiefly arrived at, by a genera-
lisation of the facts observed in an extensive study of disease
itself; whether these effects be manifested in the living, or in
the dead body. But so far as they have been ascertained,
they become more intelligible to the student, if explained
synthetically ; that is by describing first, the causes of
disease, then the operation of these on the body ; and lastly
the resulting changes in function or structure, which constitute
the more elementary forms o"f disease.

      The text throughout the work was divided into numbered

paragraphs, which severally became propositions ; each to be
referred to by its number, for proof or explanation, in subse-
quent paragraphs. This was an attempt to follow at a dis-
tance the method of Euclid's geometry ; and to preserve an
intelligible connection throughout the work.

     Etiology, or a knowledge of the causes of disease, appro-
priately introduces the consideration of the effect disease
itself: the nature and constitution of which may then be
conveniently considered under the head of Patliogeny, or
Pathology Proper, which occupies the greater part of the work ;
being combined with such an elementary view of the Principles
of Treatment, (General Therapeutics) as experience and reason
will supply. Throughout the volume merely speculative discus-
 sions were carefully avoided ; and at every point, the endeavour
 was made to introduce such practical inferences with regard to
treatment, as to render it helpful in the art, as well as in the
 science, of medicine.

      The history of this work in its successive editions extends
through many subsequent years ; but as it would be tedious
 to recur repeatedly to the same subject, which may not
equally interest all readers, it may be well to conclude by
 quoting the testimony of few, out of many more critics,

always esteemed the work as the best instance of the employment

Iof physiology in the general doctrines of medicine ; hope to study
Ithe second as carefully as studied the first edition. Let me add

that few things could gratify me more than your generous approval

of my researches. Belitve me to be very truly yours,

My dear Sir,                            Edinburgh : October 7, 1848.

I Iread few medical books but have re-read your Principles

with great pleasure and great profit. As a systematic view of

Ipathological and therapeutical knowledge, it is immeasurably,
Ithink, before any other existing work. And have heard several

of our physicians here express a similar opinion. Never mind Dr.

Bennet criticising you on some minor points. Here at least no

body minds it. Yours very truly,        J. Y. SIMPSON

                                        regard you with veneration

that you should have found time, with your immense practice, to

write such a book in the first instance ; and then to keep it so

perfectly au niveau.

We find that the deeply interesting matter and style of this

book have so far fascinated us, that we have unconsciously hung on

its pages, not too long indeed for our own profit, but longer than

reviewers can be permitted to indulge. We leave the further

analysis to the student and practitioner. Our judgment of the

work has already been sufficiently expressed. It is a judgment of

almost unqualified praise. The work is not of a controversial, but

of a didactic character ; and as such we hail  and recommendis it,

     There is no work in medical literature which can fill the place
of this one. It is the Primer of the young practitioner, and the
Koran of the scientific one. Three large editions of it have already
been exhausted in the United States ; and now the fourth is pre-

sented. It must have, so long as the volume remains uncumber-

some, the first place among pathological authorities. We feel
warranted hi saying that no medical book has yet been written
which contains so much in the small number of pages which com-
pose this one, and yet it is complete. Stethoscope.

     This exceedingly valuable work is the best, we believe, in the
whole round of medica! literature. The division of the different
subjects is excellent. The author's method of investigation and
mode of expression, in our judgment, are faultless. We can most
cheerfully commend the work as the best that has ever appeared
on the principles of medicine. Southern Journal of Medical and
Physical Sciences.

   I have to offer my hearty thanks to the respective writers

of these too flattering extracts from journals ; although not

one of them is or ever has been personally known to me.

as proving that the spirit of my intentions in my mode of

treating my subjects has been appreciated and turned to
profit, in studying the Principles and in applying them to prac-
tice, in a manner utterly unattainable by the readers of other

systems or dictionaries of practical medicine. The first is from
Dr. Herzig of Marienbad.

        Marienbad : April 1858.

Sir, Being one of the admirers of your ' Principles of Medicine,'

Ition.

Ithis work of yours : would only mention the impression it has
Imade on me, by telling that derived from it a great deal of infor-

mation, and read it every day during the last winter, with pleasure ;

for such is the management of the immense subject, that the book

is extremely interesting. It must be particularly so to the prac-

Ititioner, who endeavoured to study the numberless chronic devia-

tions from health, as tried to do, during twenty years' practice

in this place. As in such cases, frequently no (special) disease is

developed, the physician cannot obtain an accurate knowledge of

the nature of these cases ; but by following your way, and your

of which they really only are numberless combinations, no special

disease being as yet formed. Your directions for the treatment of

constituents of disease are equally excellent and useful ; and those

for the employment of eliminant and tonic remedies, and their
I Icombined or successive use, are the best that ever read.

much gratified to see that you highly esteem saline chalybeate

waters, and that you also mention those of Marienbad.

   I IDear Sir, find that have here very imperfectly expressed my
Ithoughts on your book, which hope will still for a long time be

admirer,

merits of the work that resolved upon translating it into my

out of print ; and he supplied me with copies within the last
ten years, adding the remark that he was ' surprised at the

vitality of a book that has so long disappeared in its own

country.' It was much to my regret that the state of my

health and my other more imperative engagements prevented

me from continuing the production of a work that had risen

Iso high in public estimation. In the last edition was ably

contents, and he has referred to      repeatedly in his great

work as standard authority on the subject. Dr. Jeune, the

late Bishop of Peterborough, was another of its amateur

readers.

       This expectation has not been fulfilled in quarter from which hada
least reason to anticipate an oversight. In Dr. B. Quain's Dictionary Medi-

I IBEFORE take leave of the subject, must refer to one friend,

who gave me the most valuable assistance, by his exact patho-

logical knowledge of matters connected with the work, particu-
Ilarly in microscopic observations.
                                     mean George Gulliver
IF.R.S. was introduced to him by our excellent mutual friend,

Dr. Clendinning, who had invited our help in researches on the

heart at the Marylebone Infirmary. Gulliver was delighted

Iwith my demonstration of the action of the valves of the

heart ; and was equally pleased at pumping him, for some of

his profound knowledge respecting fibrin and the blood cor-

puscles. So we took to each other, and were fast and faithful

Ifriends to the time of his death last year. The assistance

which received from him, in various parts of the Principles

of Medicine, was not limited to quotations from his published

works : he also gave me private information on many im-

portant points ; and revised some of the sheets for the press.
     Although plain in manner, and rather provincial in speech,

his truthful heartiness made him a favourite, even in the fas-
tidious society of the Life Guardsmen and their friends, with

whom he passed much of his life. But devotion to the pursuit

of natural history and physiology in various branches, was his

ruling passion ; and the patience and perseverance with which

he carried on his manifold researches, and his rare intelligence

and skill in conducting them, have left their mark by valu-

able discoveries in many departments. He had also a iaste

for literature, natural and cultivated ; and his Hunterian

Oration at the College of Surgeons gives evidence of the en-

dowments of a refined mind. Through many late years of his

life he was a martyr to inveterate gout, which although crippling

and prostrating him, did not entirely debar him from interest
Iin his favourite pursuits.
                             had been his principal medical

adviser during our long intercourse ; and after his death re-

ceived from his widow by his direction a touching memorial

of his friendship.

To resume the narrative of events. The number of new

pupils entered to the class of Medicine in the year 1842-43,

was 73 ; with fees amounting to 362Z. In 1843-4 number

88 ; fees, 367Z. The names most marked in the examination

book were James Clifton, James Hakes, Samuel Battley, W.

H. Meadows, Charles R. Prance, A. Markwick, Henry Fearn-

side, Kirkham Burton, Henry J. Stokes, S. S. Alford, William
Clayton, Geo. Moreton, John Gabb, J. H. Elliott, W. W.

Moore, Eobert Hopwood, Geo. Pickess, W. Edw. Wright, Geo.

A. Hallion, W. Henry Allchin, Richard Swan Finch, Robert
Kemp, Fred. Marshall, Robert Ellis, Robert Cross.

      The income from private practice went on steadily increas-

ingin 1842 being 681L ; and in 1843, 1,249L There was

no longer any cause for anxiety about the future, provided

my health should continue to stand the work. By system-

atically following a very careful and regular mode of life, and

continuing to avoid visiting and late hours, I was enabled to

ominous warnings from time to time.  sometimes had
attacks of vertigo, which would end in vomiting, if not relieved

by immediate and absolute rest for several hours. Happily

these attacks never left behind them any want of mental

vigour ; and up to the time of their coming on, the flow of

thought was never impaired. I heard some of my friends

Ispeak of having written, or lectured themselves, dry ; never

experienced that feeling. Even in the midst of fatigue and

bodily weakness, the mind would seem as active as ever, until

Ithe body stopped it by faintness and general failure. But

now can see that during those and the following years of high

Ipressure, was enduring a perilous strain, which sooner or

later must lead to a break down of some kind.

   I had now four boys, and at last, a girl ; and this increase

of my family, together with the state of my wife's health,

rendered it necessary that they should be much out of town ;

so that besides the summer absence of several months, some

weeks at Brighton, or some other watering place, were occasion-

ally required. This did not increase domestic comfort : but

with so many blessings some sacrifices must be expected.

   IThen cannot say that the proceedings in the College or

Iin the Hospital were altogether so harmonious as they were at

first. With the students was always on good terms ; and

except the differences arising out of some being industrious,

I Iand others not, had never any disagreement with them.

Imay say the same of the majority of the professors, with

whom continued on amicable terms : but there were two or

Ithree with whom could not always agree ; and who seemed

to me not to be animated with a spirit of conciliation. It

Iwould answer no good purpose at this distant period to detail

these petty quarrels : but cannot avoid noticing their occur-

rence ; for the unpleasant feelings connected with them did

Inot pass away during the remaining period of my connection

with the College. But never suffered any misunderstandings

to interfere with the regular and conscientious performance of

Imy duties both to the patients and students ; and am con-
Ifident that never gave any reason for complaint of remiss-

Iness or want of punctuality on my part. With the house phy-

sicians, clinical assistants, and clinical clerks, was always on

Ithe most amicable terms ; perhaps more so than was always
agreeable to complaining parties : but  am not aware of

having been ever chargeable with unfair favouritism. The

visiting physicians are necessarily brought into close relation,

in the clinical department, with the house physician, and

ne is expected to be present at the clinical lectures. In this

capacity successively, among others, Dr. Croft, Dr. Lankester,

Dr. R. Quain, Dr. Allchin, and later, Mr. J. T. Clover, gave

useful assistance, and disposed me always to forward their
interests on fitting occasions. The clinical lectures were regu-
larly continued once a week, and in the summer, sometimes
twice. Some of them were reported in the ' Lancet,' or
' Medical Gazette ' by the clinical clerks.

     The entries of new students in the class of Medicine in

1844-5 were 77. Professor's fees, 3482. 13s. 4d.

     In 1845-6, number 78, fees 3862. The names most marked
in the examination book were, Alex. Henry, William Sedg-
wick, John Elliott Wood, Richard Eliot West, John Yeoman,
Bryan Lister, N. H. Littleton, John Rowe, Henry Chawner,
Temple C. Paley, John R. Humphreys, Gopal Chunder

West.
      Private practice in 1844 brought 1,4922. : and in 1845,

1,7172. to which may be added nearly 1002., as half the profits
on the sale of the Principles of Medicine, first edition.

      By far the greater part of my practice lay in what are
termed consultations ; whether in conjunction with another

practitioner or otherwise. The cases were for the most part
new, seen for the first time, and often for that once only.

IIn common with other consulting physicians, think that the

fee of one guinea is not a sufficient remuneration for the
 amount of time and skill bestowed on a new case ; and that the

 first fee ought to be at least two guineas, as has been cus-

 tomary in consultations with other physicians. In olden times
 a physician, with watch in hand, would feel the pulse of a

 patient, look at his tongue, ask a few questions, write a pre-
 scription and take his fee ; and, thus disposing of patients at
 the rate of six in the hour, would be well remunerated by one
 guinea from each. But now, a physician must first inquire
 carefully into the history of the case ; then in addition to the

 old appeal to pulse, tongue, &c. he must physically explore,

 and if necessary measure, the chest, and abdomen ; often he

 has to chemically test, and microscopically examine the secre-
214 PHYSICIANS* FEES INADEQUATE.

tions, and call to his aid the thermometer, and perchance the
laryngoscope, and the sphygmograph ; and then, in addition
to a fully explained prescription, he may have to supply a long
dietary table, and perhaps have to write a letter to the doctor
in the bargain ! Such consultations can hardly be completed
within the hour ; and are poorly paid by a fee of even two

Iguineas. Very early in my career began to protest against the

irregularity and insufficiency of physicians' fees, and to claim
for the most skilful and complete medical advice, an adequate
estimation and remuneration. Except from persons of limited
means, the first fee should not be less than two guineas ; and

a letter of instruction to a doctor, or of directions for future

guidance, or of authoritative statement of opinion, should be
entitled to a similar remuneration.

      Compared with those of barristers of the highest eminence,

the honoraria of consulting physicians are very low, and do
not represent the learning and dignity of the profession, or the

value of its work. If health and life are esteemed at least as

highly as property and civil rights, their guardians ought not
to be stinted in their emoluments ; yet, not only are lawyers'
fees higher, but in judgeships and many other offices, lawyers
have many prizes, which are altogether wanting in the medical

Iprofession. At one time considered the usual rate of fees for

eminent physicians and surgeons travelling to distant places
too high, being a guinea per mile by road, or two thirds of
that sum by rail and proposed that the charge should be for
time, rather than for distance -say five guineas per hour

but difficulties arise as to charging for night as well as day,

and I found that the plan would not work well. But instead

of a uniform charge of two-thirds of a guinea per mile for all

railway journeys, that proportion should be required only for
out-of-the-way places, or those accessible by few trains; but
for all easily accessible points, with abundant choice of trains,
and facilities of going and returning, half a guinea per mile is

Ia sufficient recompense.
         fear that these remarks may lay me open to the imputa-
tion of a mercenary feeling prevailing among other consi-
derations; but my desire is only to claim what is due to our
profession, after all its expensive and laborious outlay, and with
   SEASIDE AND RAILWAY FATIGUES.      215

its \u-ighty and anxious responsibilities, and its not inconsider-
able amount of risk, and wear and tear to both mind and body.

;     The augmentation of my professional income was a provi-I
dential help for the increasing family needs. We had now six; I it,
children ; and for their and my wife's health, a frequent resi-I
dence in the country was required. Several years in succession,
   a
I had a house at the seaside (generally at Brighton) for some
                   I
months. With my incessant engagements, this involved muchI

separation from my family, or the not very restful alternative ofit

Irattling up and down in train for a Sunday's holiday; but was
Ithankful for these, the only peeps could get at my children.
IAs for racing up and down every day, it was to me a profes-

sional impossibility, even if could have borne the bodily
fatigue. It may seem charmingly convenient to men of busi-
ness to have a seaside home, accessible by rail in little more
than an hour no more than a drive to a suburban villa !

But the wear and tear from those rapid noisy railway journeys
   twice daily, binding and grinding in time and toil is too

much for a highly worked brain. Merchants and men of the

Stock Exchange, may bear with their limited office hours,
and their freedom from nightly calls or studies but doctors
cnnnot and still less can professors, with their double-strained

brain work. But have seen how the daily double railway
journey used to tell, even on men of business. In my weekly

return on Monday morning, used to watch many of these up
and down daily travellers and by the end of the season,
could see their hair whitened, and their faces more wrinkled,

    aged, in fact, by the daily reiteration of the haste and din of
the iron road. In those days the Brighton line was notorious
for its noise and unsteadiness. Of late years has been much

improved.
     Whilst on the subject of railways, may take this oppor-

tunity to mention, that few years later, was requested by
the editor of the Lancet to write some notes of my experi-

ence on railway travelling, and its effects in health and dis-
ci so; these notes appeared in that journal about the year

 1865 to which must refer, as have no room for them

 here.

     thological Society has attained an Unparalleled Success, having issued Thirty-
     Four most Valuable Reports, carried on its Meetings with unabated In-
     terest, and won the Adhesion of all of the Highest Eminence in the Profession.

THE year 1846 was marked by the formation of the Patho-

Ilogical Society of London, by which was honoured by being

elected its first President.

   I had joined the Eoyal Medical and Chirurgical Society
Isome years before ; and although my engagements permitted

me to take little part in its proceedings, had earnestly joined
with Mr. James Moncrieff Arnott and others, in an attempt
to establish a Pathological Branch of that Society. A few
meetings were held, at which specimens were exhibited, and
sufficient interest was shown in its proceedings, but not suffi-
cient to secure its continuance, in opposition to the red tape
and lethargy of the old Society.

      The idea of establishing a separate body under the title
of the Pathological Society, seems to have originated with Dr.
Edward Bentley of Guy's Hospital; and he with several
friends met together in February of this year, and agreed upon
the issue of a circular to such members of the Profession, as
        PATHOLOGICAL SOCIETY FIRST ADDRESS. 217

were known to be more particularly interested in Pathological
studies. To this circular, a sufficient number of favourable
answers was received, to encourage the movers to proceed.
' A provisional committee of the gentlemen who had expressed
their concurrence was appointed, with Dr. Bentley and Mr.
Nathaniel Ward as secretaries ; and these after having several
times met at the houses of Drs. Babington and Williams, drew
up the plan of the Society, as it is at present constituted, ap-
pointed provisionally the several officers, and agreed on the
issue of a Prospectus to the members of the Profession at large,
inviting their support and co-operation.

     ' This appeal met with unexpected support ; and on October
20, at the first meeting of the Society, there were enrolled 106
members.' First Report of the Pathological Society of London.

To be chosen the first President of this Society was, and

ever has been since, a subject no less of gratification than of

surprise, in consideration of the senior standing and greater

eminence of many others on the list ; but my zeal in the

cause of Pathology, of which my recent work had become an

Ievidence, probably influenced the Members of the Council in
selecting me for the office.  have no notes of my address on
Ithe occasion of the first meeting ; for had not much time
I Ifor preparation ; and believe, for the most part, spoke ex-
Itemporaneously : but
                       find in the Lancet of October 31,
I1846, a report, from which make the following extract.

    ' Gentlemen, In opening the public proceedings of the Patho-

Ilogical Society of London, in this first year of its existence, cannot

but feel the painful disproportion between the vastness and import-
ance of the objects which are contemplated in its formation, and
my power to do them due justice. But the obvious merits of our
cause set aside all personal considerations ; &nd confiding in their

Iown greatness and strength, rather than in my feeble advocacy of

them on this occasion, beg to submit to your attention a few
remarks on the uses and difficulties of the study of pathology, and
on the modes in which the proceedings of this Society are calculated
to advance it.

     ' That practical medicine, as a science, and as an art, is a most

intricate and difficult subject, will be admitted by all who have con-
2iS MEDICINE NEEDS PATHOLOGY.

scientiously engaged in its pursuit, from the zealous student, who
when he leaves the comparatively easy and pleasant paths of the
introductory sciences, struggles in the thickets of the practical
department, to the veteran practitioner, who, after much toil and
disappointment in trying to thread the labyrinth, has been com-
pelled to work his way by some short cut of empirical routine.
That practical medicine is unsatisfactory, as well as difficult, is
obvious, not only from the notorious popularity of empiricism in
any new form, but also from the avowed scepticism in its utility,

Iof many who stand high in the profession ; and lament to add,

from the desertion from its ranks of some few estimable men

into the erratic bands of homoeopathy, hydropathy, mesmerism, or
some such specious chimasra.

   I' It would detain you too long were to go through all the steps

Iof the argument, by which, as think, it may be proved that one,

if not the, great reason, why the study of medicine is so difficult

and so unsatisfactory, is because it has hitherto been taught and

treated too metaphysically, too much by closet speculation, too
much by book description, mystified or cramped as this often is by
a vague, or Procrustean phraseology, derived from ages in which it
would be vain to expect language commensurate with the advanced
knowledge of the present day. Too little has been done by physical
demonstration too little by appeals to the senses too little by
direct observation and experiment too little by habits of that care-
ful and accurate investigation of phenomena, to which alone Nature
 discloses her truths. Hence the knowledge obtained by the student
is of that abstract kind which helps him little at the bedside of the

patient. It has not upon it the stamp of Nature. He finds much

 more, or much less, than what he expects from the description of

 others ; and his senses are unpractised to discern for himself.
 Herefrom arise confusion, vacillation, and failure in practice ; and
 distrusting all scientific medicine, he either falls into a narrow

 routine of empiricism, or becomes a ready advocate for any partial
 hypothesis, which applies some universal remedy or easy line of
 treatment to all diseases.

      ' We want, then, the means of rendering the study and science
 of medicine more personal and practical ; more a subject of indi-
 vidual observation and demonstration ; and for this end we look,
 first, to clinical medicine ; and guided by the applied skill of former
  observers, our understanding enlightened by the standard truths of
  anatomy and physiology, our senses sharpened and aided by all
  that optics, acoustics, hydraulics, mechanics, and chemistry can do
  for us, we examine signs and symptoms, and make ourselves ac-
          DIFFICULTIES OF MORBID ANATOMY.                    219

quainted with'disease in the living body. But our research stops

not here : we pursue disease even to the field of its triumph in
death ; and there, in the sad havoc which the destroyer has made
in the organisation, we find out the mode of his warfare, trace out

his weapons and plans of attack, and thus forewarned, seek for

means of counteracting them in future.

' One great cause of the difficulty in mastering morbid anatomy

is its great variety, and the want of means of illustrating it by

demonstration. No one questions the necessity of demonstrations

and actual dissections in order to obtain a due knowledge of

healthy anatomy, and much time and labour are properly bestowed

on these studies': yet one healthy body dissected, is a type of all.

It is quite different with morbid anatomy : disease and its results

present infinite varieties, which yet require to be seen, to be pro-

perly understood ; and no one can hope to attain a comprehensive
knowledge of the anatomy of disease, without witnessing post-

mortem examinations for a series of years. The ordinary career of

a student at a hospital enables him to see but a tithe of this ex-

Itensive subject ; and even hospital physicians, with years of experi-
ence, are frequently meeting with something new.             have myself

been at work for a quarter of a century, and have assisted at the

Iexamination of more than two thousand bodies ; yet even now,

rarely attend one, without finding out something that is new and

instructive. How little chance is there, then, for practitioners in

general, to become conversant with this most instructive branch of

medical science, with their scanty opportunities, reduced as they

are, by want of time and inclination for the pursuit, and by the

difficulties arising from popular prejudice !

1 Now, to lessen these difficulties, to open an extended field, and

to promote zeal in its cultivation, we propose to proceed on the

plan of co-operation and concentration. By making this Society a

medium of exhibition of morbid specimens, and by our meeting

here to examine and discuss them, we create a school of morbid

anatomy, where those demonstrations, that are elsewhere wanting,

may be carried on, and where every member of the Society is

given an advantage, even beyond that of any one hospital phy-
sician ; for here we expect to receive contributions from all the
hospitals in the metropolis ; to cull the fruit from each pathological

Ifield ;                                                     from private practice,
                                                             will trespass on your

but for

patience by reading from a paper, drawn up by the committee, a

statement of the chief objects which we hope to accomplish by this

Society.
220 CHIEF OBJECTS OF PATHOLOGICAL SOCIETY.

     ' 1. The exhibition and description of morbid specimens, recent,
preserved, or represented by drawings or models ; not excepting
those that are common, provided that they are sufficiently well-
marked to be fit for demonstration.

     ' 2. The critical examination of unusual specimens, referred to
the Society for the purpose. A sub-committee has already been
appointed for the purpose, of some members of the Council much
experienced in morbid anatomy, and who will report to the Society
on any specimens transmitted to them.

     ' 3. The classification and simultaneous exhibition of series of
specimens, with the view to illustrate the progress or varieties of
diseased structures.

     ' 4. The comparison of like preparations from different museums,
with the view to discover discrepancies, and to establish uniformity,
of arrangements and nomenclature.

     ' 5. To direct the attention of morbid anatomists to particular
objects of interest ; and to promote pathological research by syste-
matic observations and experiments.

      ' 6. Objects of exhibition illustrative of pathology in the living
body, whether cases of disease, or microscopic appearances of
matters derived from them, will fall within the province of the

 Society.

      ' But observe, gentlemen, we do nothing without an appeal
to the senses, by specimen, preparation, drawing or model, and
this is one distinguishing feature of the Society. We can admit no
merely speculative argumentation or discussion. The communi-
 cations are to be confined to a description of the object to be
exhibited, with such a brief history as may serve to explain its
 pathological bearings ; and the remarks of members and visitors
 must be restricted to the same topics. Our objects must speak for

themselves, and require neither long papers nor long speeches. If

 members differ in their views, let them argue, not by mere words,
 but by specimens ; and we shall all be instructed, if not convinced,
 by the argument ; and in this multiplication of facts there will be
 the best chance of attaining the truth.

     ' It is intended, through the co-operation of our excellent secre-

 taries, to keep an accurate record of the proceedings of the Society ;
 and from these the most valuable communications will be selected
 by the Council, for publication in the Transactions of the Society.

    I' Such then, gentlemen, are the chief aims and objects of the

 Pathological Society of London, and trust that they commend
              IGNORANCE OF PATHOLOGY.                                            221

Ithemselves to you as both feasible and useful.           hope that it will

appear that we are not infringing on ground already occupied ; for

there is abundance of material without intruding on the wide

domain of symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Proper

pathology, and its groundwork, morbid anatomy, are its legitimate

and fertile field. We hope to cultivate these, not only directly by

our own work, but indirectly, by spreading abroad a knowledge of

morbid anatomy, by fostering zeal in its pursuit, and by raising up

a large class of intelligent cultivators. We hope that more bodies

Iwill be opened, and not only so, but better opened, and better
understood.   need not tell you, gentlemen, that the utility and

instructiveness of post-mortem inspections depend on the care and

completeness with which they are carried out. Permit me to

trespass on your patience with two anecdotes in illustration.

' A friend of mine, zealous in the pursuit of morbid anatomy,

endeavoured in vain to excite a kindred spirit among the prac-

titioners of  "thWe hnaeitghisbothuerhouosed   in which   he had just  settled.    One
asked him,                                    of opening  bodies ? it  is never  satis-

factory : we never find what we expected."

     ' Another case was an answer to this. Having watched with

Igreat interest a remarkable case of pulmonary disease, was very

I Ianxious to know the result of the post-mortem examination, which
was concluded before arrived.                 was told that the only disease

found was enlargement of the heart, which being all that the physi-

cian in attendance expected, he was satisfied, and looked no further.

I I IAs expected more, had the body reopened, and found what

Iexpected extensive consolidation of the lung. So far was satisfied

I Ialso : but searching further, found more than expected, in a
Igeneral dilatation of the bronchial tubes : and this was the case in

which first discovered the connection of that lesion with pleuro-
pneumonia. This, although unexpected, was still more satisfactory.

    ' And herein lies the value of morbid anatomy, if pursued with

a single eye, searching for truth ; it brings the diagnosis and

pathology of the practitioner to a tribunal from which there is no

appeal ; it detects error ; it establishes sound views ; and it extends

the boundaries of knowledge. Indeed, it is no small stigma on the

profession in London, that no association has been hitherto formed

for the cultivation of this branch of knowledge : that while Paris,

Dublin, and even some provincial towns of the kingdom, have their

pathological societies, active, and working much good in their

spheres, the metropolis of this country, the great emporium, not

more of fashion, wealth, trade and commerce, than of life, disease

and death, with a population, living and dying, of nearly two
222 SUCCESS OF PATHOLOGICAL SOCIETY.

millions, should have no institution to make its study, that science,
which regards the change and decay of the body, to which these
millions are all, sooner or later, tending !

      ' Gentlemen, it is for us to remove this stigma ; and permit me
to congratulate you on the array" of high talent and eminence com-
prised in the body who compose your Vice-presidents, Council, and
Secretaries. With such a combination of zeal and ability to direct
our proceedings, and with your cordial support and contributions,

Iwe shall be sure to succeed in so good a cause. For myself, have

only to crave your indulgence in my attempt to perform the duties
of the highly honourable office to which the too favourable opinion
of the Council has kindly promoted me. However inadequate my
abilities may be to acquit myself as you have a right to expect, both
my gratitude to you for conferring on me this honour, and my hearty
desire to co-operate in this most instructive pursuit, will excite me
to exert them to the utmost.'

     Of the Pathological Society of London it is not too much
to say that it has attained and preserved to tjjie present time,

an amount of popularity, utility, and eminence, equal, if not

superior, to that of any medical society in this or in any
country. Its published Transactions, now amounting to
thirty-four volumes, form a repertory of illustrated morbid

anatomy and pathology, unequalled for extent and variety.

In the attendance of its members, in the supply of interesting
objects, and in the animation and searching character of its

discussions, there never seems to have been any material
falling off ; so that its whole career of thirty-seven years, has
been one of uninterrupted success.

      Although the proposal to establish the Society was well
received by many of the profession, it did not at first gain the
support of all. Among the original members were a few
veterans of the highest repute : Dr. Eichard Bright, Dr. B. G.
Babington, Caesar Hawkins, James Moncrieff Arnott, Dr.

John Forbes, C. Aston Key, and Eobert Listen, among the
number. Drs. Watson and Latham held aloof for a while ;
until convinced of the genuine excellency of the Society ; when

Ithey joined, and soon succeeded to the chair which had first

occupied. Among those most actively and continuously con-
cerned in the formation and early management of the Society,

in addition to Dr. Bentley, its originator, I would especially

record the names of Dr. Peacock and Dr. R. Quain, who
worked long and effectively, in editing the Transactions, in
addition to their official duties, successively as Secretary,
Treasurer, and President.

     The seal of the Society is a medallion of the head of Dr.
Matthew Baillie, with the motto (suggested hy myself), ' NEC
SILET MOBS.'

     Long after the termination of my official connection with

Ithe Society during its first two years, often was gratified by

attending its meetings, and never without learning something
new : this experience of its first president has been often
re-echoed by his successors.

IN resuming the notice of events in the next two years it will
be unnecessary to dwell on common details. The entries of
new pupils in 1846-7 were 72. Professor's fees, 389Z. In
1847-8, new pupils, 77. Fees, 420Z.

     The names most noted in the examination book were :

Henry Briggs, James Morris, Arthur S. Willocks, J. Ellerton,
Thos. Park, J. Eussell Reynolds, Theophilus Taylor, Wm.

Filliter, Geo. Wyld, Geo. W. New, Soorjo-Coomar Chucker-

butty (Hindoo), Fred. J. Gant, Thos. J. Warburton.

      Fees from private practice amounted in 1846 to 2,171L
and in 1847 to 2,749Z.

      There was also the accession of a small fee (25Z.) for the

Ioffice of Censorship of the College of Physicians, which held

for these two years. The duties of this office were not
onerous ; and although important and responsible, were
generally rendered agreeable by the courteous and friendly
feeling which prevailed at the Board. The most important

            :duties were the examinations for the membership, before the
quarterly meetings of the College, conducted by the President,a
          I
and four Censors. The President then was Dr. John Ayrton
                          itParis, an able and well informed man, but getting rusty, and
hardly keeping pace with the progress of the age. The
aRegistrar was Dr. Francis Hawkins, and my colleagues in the
Censorship, were Dr. (since Sir) George Burrows, Dr. Clen-
dinning, Dr. Nairne, and Dr. Geo. Budd. A less important

but not unamusing office of the Censor's board at that time,
was to visit the apothecaries' shops at stated times, for the
purpose of examining their drugs, ' that they ' (in the language
of the Act) ' the said Physicians may and shall execute that
search and view, and the due punishment of the Poticaries for
any their evil and faulty stuff, according to the statute.' After
our fulfilling the letter of this enactment by calling at Apothe-

caries' Hall and a few of the druggists' shops in the city, and
inspecting and tasting samples of their drugs, the day was

concluded by a dinner at the Thatched House, where the
President was ready to receive us. This absurd formality has
been very properly discontinued.

     A more unpleasant duty attaching to the office of Censor
was that of admonishing any physicians practising in London

without the authority of the College. Although there was
still much in the practices, and even in some of the by-laws

Iof the College, which I did not approve of, and which hoped

would be altered, yet it was the existing authority, by law

established, and in virtue of my office I was bound to uphold

    at least by warning, which was not meant in an unfriendly
spirit but fear sometimes became cause of offence.

     This (1847) was the year of poor Listen's death, which
was great loss to the College and to the profession. We
were always on friendly terms although there was not much
community of sentiment between us and he did not except
me from the jocular disparagement, with which he was in the
habit of speaking of medicine and of doctors in general. His
skill and manual dexterity in operative surgery, and the effica-
cious simplicity of his methods of treatment, had gained for
him the highest reputation and success, which surmounted

226 DEATH OF LISTON.

the objectionable qualities of his character, which, if they were

obnoxious to others, were quite as damaging to himself.
There can be little doubt that the disease, which cut short his
life at a vigorous age, was the result of the high feeding and
violent exercise, which he made his habit ; and that its fatal
issue was accelerated by his obstinate recklessness. He was
not a man of intempterate habits ; but one, who lived regu-
larly well, and, denouncing all messes and slops, fed almost
entirely on meat and bread, with no other beverage than ale
or wine. Then he made a constant habit of a long fast walk,
such as to Hampstead or Highgate, and back, before his sub-
stantial breakfast, and devoted all spare time which he could
get, to boating, yachting, or horse exercise. These were his
habits ; and he firmly believed that to them he owed the re-
markable share of strength and activity which he enjoyed.
The continued strain or high pressure led to a breakdown,
comparatively sudden, in the full course of his energetic and
successful career.

   I was absent from town at the commencement of his ill-
Iness ; and although he sent for me on my return, did not

continue to attend him, as he had placed himself under the

Icare of Dr. Watson and Dr. Forbes ; and did not see him
Ifor a month before December 7, when heard of his death.

     The circumstances of Mr. Listen's illness and death were

reported in the Lancet of December 11 by Mr. Wm. Cadge, his

late House Surgeon; and became the subject of a correspon-

Idence in that journal, originating with a letter from me, and

continued between Dr. Watson and myself. think it right
to republish the whole matter, for although it has been often
referred to, it has been chiefly by quoting Dr. Watson's letter
of reproof to me, without noticing my letter of defence, or Mr.

Cadge's statement, the errors of which were the real cause of

misunderstanding, and were all that I had to retract. 1

MR. CADGE'S REPORT.  227

                     Death O/EOBEKT LISTON Esq. F.E.S.

                    (From tlie ' Lancet,' December 11, 1847.)

       We have received the following succinct and interesting account
 from Mr. Cadge, his late house-surgeon at University College
 Hospital, who was in constant attendance upon him before his

 death, and who conducted the post-mortem examination.

      In the early part of the summer of the present year, Mr. Liston
 first complained of a feeling of constriction at the top of the wind-
pipe, and a sense of choking when stooping forwards. It was also
 noticed by those constantly in his company, that he had a manifest,
 though slight, difficulty in swallowing. This difficulty appeared
most palpably when swallowing the last drops of a glass of what-
 ever he was drinking. He occasionally remarked this himself, but
seemed to think very slightly of it. He had also occasionally a

most peculiar cough, harsh, dry, and grating ; this however was so
seldom that it gave him little uneasiness : in short, he may be said,
so far as appearances went, to have been in fair health. He lived,

as usual generously, and took his customary long morning walks.

     It was late in July, that the first serious, and alarming symptom

occurred, while receiving visits from patients at home, and when
perfectly quiet ; he suddenly felt his mouth fill with fluid, and

retiring into his dressing-room, he coughed up between thirty and
forty ounces of florid arterial blood ; it was expelled almost without
effort ; the blood was in one clot, and without froth or mucus
fainting came on, and the haemorrhage ceased. He soon recovered,
and remained quiet during the remainder of the day. Drs. Watson
and Forbes visited him, and examined the chest ; but could detect
nothing morbid either in the lungs or circulation ; the source of the
bleeding was therefore very obscure. He himself hinted that there
might be an aneurism ; but in the absence of all physical signs of
such a lesion, the most favourable view was taken of the case, and
it was conceived that it might be a salutary relief from a congested
lung. From that moment he lost all sense of choking or con-
striction in the throat, and was in fact better in health than

previously. The only treatment adopted, was local abstraction of
blood by cupping, spare diet, and less violent exercise. With these
restrictions, he continued his ordinary avocations till the beginning

of October, when the cough returned. It was at first thought to

be a mere catarrhal affection from exposure to cold ; for some weeks

he paid no particular attention to it, till it became more frequent
and distressing, attended with expectoration, which was difficult,

                                                                            Q2
228 DEATH OF LISTON.

small in quantity, and of a rusty colour ; occasional dyspnoea super-

vening.
     Drs. Watson and Forbes were again consulted. Blood-letting,

counterirritation and confinement to the house, were had recourse

to, and were followed by marked alleviation of his symptoms ; and

on November 28 he resumed his professional occupations, and rode

out on horse-back.

     December 1. While at the house of a patient, he was seized
with what appeared to be a fit of spasmodic asthma : he returned
home immediately, and soon recovered. In the evening he had a
still more severe attack ; and from that period to the time of his

death, he was unable to assume the recumbent posture.
     December 2. The dyspnoea returned, the usual remedies were

administered but without much benefit : in one of the attacks he

inhaled chloroform, but to no purpose : there was no constitutional

disturbance or pain.

     December 3. Fits of dyspnoea somewhat less urgent : the great-
est relief was obtained from opium : the physical signs were still

obscure : percussion and auscultation pointed out no perceptible
lesion of the lungs or heart ; but from the loud, noisy, prolonged
aispirations, it was conjectured that the dyspnoea was dependent on
mechanical pressure upon the trachea or bronchi.

     December 4. The breathing throughout the day was more
laboured, with occasional fits of coughing and difficulty of deglu-
tition : the pulse rose to 100, and became somewhat hard. In the

evening Dr. Latham was associated in consultation. It was re-

solved to take away more blood ; and the loss of twenty ounces
afforded the greatest relief : the breathing became easier, the
dysphagia diminished ; and with the aid of half a grain of muriate
of morphia, he passed a quiet night.

      December 5 and 6. There was no particular difference in the
state of the breathing ; but it was manifest that his strength was
rapidly sinking. Sir B. Brodie saw him in consultation. He con-
tinued however to get weaker, and died at half past ten o'clock on
the evening of the 7th, soon after a paroxysm of dyspnoea.

     Post-mortem examination thirty-six hours after death. The
thorax was opened by Mr. Cadge, in the presence of Sir B. Brodie,

Drs. Watson, Latham, and Forbes, and Mr. J. Dalrymple. The

lungs were found but slightly collapsed, congested throughout, but
otherwise perfectly healthy: the pericardium contained about an ounce
of transparent yellowish serum : the heart itself was healthy, save
a slight atheromatous deposit in the mitral and aortic semilunar
valves. On removing the subclavian vein and cellular tissue from
       AUTHOR'S LETTER.                                  229

the arch of the aorta, the cause of death at once became apparent.
An aneurism, as large as an orange, flattened from before back-
wards, was seen pressing back the trachea ; it arose from the upper
part of the arch, close behind the left carotid artery, at the origin
of the innominata, which seemed almost to commence from the

aneurismal pouch : the communication with the aorta was by a
circular opening, as large as a halfcrown. On opening the trachea

from behind, the mucous membrane was seen to be very dark and
congested, and in its front part, where it was firmly connected with
the tumour, there were three or four whitish prominences as large
as split peas, situated between the rings : it was at first difficult to

understand what these elevations really were : but on splitting up

the pouch, and removing the fibrinous laminae, they were drawn
from between the ring, leaving the latter quite bare, and the
trachea perforated in three or four points ; they were in short,
portions of the clot, which half filled the sac of the aneurism.
The source of the haemorrhage and the cause of death was at once

explained.

    In the next week, December 18, the Lancet contained the

following letter.

       THE PHYSICAL SIGNS OF DISEASE IN THE CASE OF THE
                                    LATE MB. LlSTON.

       To the Editor of the Lancet.

Sir, Having seen, and heard it stated in several quarters, that

Ithere were no physical signs of disease detected in the chest of my

lamented colleague, think it right, for the credit of physical

diagnosis, as well as in justice to myself, to make known the results

of my own examination of the case, which were (according to my

custom) recorded in my note-book shortly after the examinations

were made v

    On the attack of haemorrhage at the end of July, Mr. Listoii

Isent for me ; but unfortunately was absent in the country, and

did not return to town till three weeks after. My first examination

I Iwas made on August 18 in the presence of Mr. Cadge (who was
made acquainted with the signs, which  detected) and another

friend of Mr. Liston, whose name do not recollect. At this time

Mr. Liston felt no ailment whatever, and had resumed his habits

of daily active exercise. The following is the *hote of positive

abnormal signs detected on exploration of the chest at that

time.
230 SIGNS DETECTED AND WARNINGS GIVEN.

      ' Marked dulness above the left clavicle and scapula (on strong
percussion) : large tubular breath and voice sound in the same
space: tubular expiration above upper inner angle of right scapula.'

      The tubular sounds here mentioned were not of that slight
muffled character, sometimes heard in the upper posterior regions
of healthy chests (generally in thin persons) ; but were boldly
marked, and obviously morbid signs ; and knowing the buoyancy of

Ihis spirits, and his propensity to dangerous exertions of strength,

hesitated not to state to my friend my conviction, that there was

some disease in his chest, which if not dangerous from its extent,
was so from its locality, in the vicinity of great blood-vessels ; the
profuse haemorrhage, which had occurred, being a signal warning
of such danger. The precise nature of the disease was not equally

evident. There was obviously deep-seated consolidation, or com-
pression, of the inner part of the apex of the left lung, causing the

deep dulness between the clavicle and scapula, and large tubular
sounds in the same region ; and the tubular expiration at the upper
inner margin of the right scapula, implied a similar cause, but to
less extent, operating on the right side : but whether the lesion was

tuberculous or other deposit at the root of the lungs, extending
towards the apex of the left, or a small aneurismal tumour, com-
pressing these parts, or a morbid growth encroaching on them,
could not at that period be determined. The occurrence of the

profuse haemorrhage deterred me from suspecting the last to exist ;

Iand not finding any unusual pulsation, or other signs of aneurism,
  then inclined to the first of these alternatives. But my earnest
cautions to my friend were grounded, not on the precise nature of
the disease, which was doubtful, but on the presence and position
of some disease, which was not doubtful, and which, considered in
connection with the previous haemorrhage, was most alarming.

     But alas ! my warnings were little heeded ; and on several sub-
sequent occasions on which we met in professional intercourse, he
had always some feat of activity or strength to recount, in falsifi-
cation of my diagnosis. At one of these times, he suggested to me,
that a former fracture, and consequent overlapping of the ends, of

Ithe left clavicle, might cause the signs which had heard : but my

reply was, that this could not produce dulness or tubular sounds

above the scapula. It is a poor consolation, but it saves me from

Iself reproach, that never said anything to countenance his dis-

position to make light of his malady ; but uniformly asserted my
conviction of its serious character.

     The second and last occasion on which he consulted me, was
early in November, during the second of a series of attacks of
US TOWS CASE- AUTHORS LETTER.                                           231

hoarseness, with cough and deficient expectoration, which continued

to recur, until the last fatal attack in December. The result of my

examination at this time (I think the first week in November, but

the date is not inserted) is thus recorded : ' The same dulness in
upper left, and an increase of tubular sounds, which are very loud
above left scapula and at- inner margin of right scapula : something

pressing on trachea ; but no obvious pulsation.'

There was now evidently a tumour pressing on the trachea near

Iits division ; for the tubular sound was different from that in the

larynx ; and expressed to him my fear that there would be either

Isuppuration, haemorrhage, or increased dyspnoea, unless active
means were used to reduce the internal swelling.  strongly urged

him to be cupped to ten ounces above the left scapula, and to avoid

every description of excitement or exertion. He did not follow this

advice in any particular ; but, as he afterwards told me, got relief
by strong exercise in riding a restive horse, which promoted ex-

Ipectoration.    did not see him professionally, as he placed him-
     After this

self under the care of physicians, who, both before and after this

period, found no physical signs of disease, and who therefore took a

Imore favourable view of the case than did.
   IThe result is known, and make no further comment on it ;

Ibut cannot close this letter without drawing the attention of your

readers to the paramount importance of the supra- and inter- scapular

regions, as the field for physical signs of serious and deep-seated

diseases of the lungs and great vessels. It has been the common

mistake, since the time of Laennec, to search too exclusively below

the clavicles ; yet in five-sixths of the cases of incipient diseases of
the lungs, and in more than half the cases of aneurism of the arch

of the aorta, the signs are heard at an earlier period, and more dis-

Itinctly, between the clavicles and scapulae, and within the scapulae,
than in any spot below the clavicles.         am Sir yours faithfully,

Dear Dr. Williams, More than one person came to me yester-

day, to call my attention to a letter of yours published in Saturday's
ILancet. On referring to it perceive that you have done great
Iinjustice to Dr. Forbes and to me.
                                       say to us in particular, because

we are the only physicians who had charge of poor Liston, both in
the early and in the latter stages of his fatal illness ; and this Mr.

ICadge's brief, and in some points imperfect statement, which did

not see till after it was printed in the Lancet, has made known.
     You are quite wrong in supposing and stating that we ' found

no physical signs of disease,' and ' therefore took a more favourable

view of the case than you did.'

   IFrom the very first, my anticipations of its ultimate event (as

many could testify) were most gloomy, and so, know, were Dr.

Forbes's.

   ISoon after the haemorrhage, noticed, and recorded in my note-

book, which you are welcome to see, some imperfection in the
breath sounds about the upper part of the left scapula, something
not quite natural also at the summit of the right, and some

Iappreciable difference in the voice in the two supraspinal fossae.

then went out of town and was absent five weeks. After my re-
turn Mr. Liston called on me (on November 13) complaining of
cough. He had then manifest shortness of breath. From that
time ' physical signs ' were never absent. A very peculiar, rough,

Iand loud respiratory murmur pervaded both lungs. At first
Iconfess apprehended, from this sound, the rapid multiplication
Iof small tubercles ; for had been informed that his mother, and
Ialso a sister, had died comsumptive ; and by these facts inter-
Ipreted the previous haemorrhage. But very soon Dr. Forbes and

convinced ourselves of the presence of some obstacle in the large

and primary air-passages, whence the remarkable sound was
propagated. At that time Mr. Liston was bled, with relief, and

the blood was distinctly buffed and cupped. For three weeks at
least before his death our opinion (and that of everyone else
who saw him in our presence) was clear, that some mechanical im-
pediment existed about the bifurcation of the trachea, or in the
first division of the bronchi. The inspirations were comparatively

facile the expirations were long, noisy, and growling. Some
dyspbagia was also detected, although the patient himself was
reluctant to acknowledge it. Possibly (we thought) an enlarged
bronchial gland, or some morbid growth, was exercising pressure

there most probably, an aneurismal tumour. Of all this, if it were

worth while, several witnesses might be called.

   IFrom various phrases and sentences in your letter, which need

not cite, as well as from its whole tenour, an ordinary reader,

unacquainted with the real facts of the case, could not fail to infer,
that we did not as you had done, ' warn ' our patient ; that we
'countenanced his disposition to make light of his malady,' and
       LfSTOX'S CASE DR. WATSON'S STATEMENT. 233

ought    therefore  to  stand  ' self-reproached    '  that  we  sanctioned  his
                                                  ;

taking ' strong exercise in riding a restive horse ' which promoted

expectoration, and that had the solemn and responsible office of

advising and treating thib eminent surgeon been yours instead of

Iours, a different ' result ' might have been hoped for ; for you close

your observations with these words ' After this, did not see him

professionally, as he placed himself under the care of physicians

who, both before and after this period, found no physical signs of

I Idisease, and who therefore took a more favourable view of his case

than did. The result is known, and make no further comment

on it.'

     Now the real truth is (as his family can tell you) that our poor
patient's imprudent acts were done in spite of our most earnest and

reiterated remonstrances remonstrances so urged, as sometimes

to make him almost angry with us, and especially with Dr. Forbes,

Iwho living near him, saw and expostulated with him more fre-

quently than had the opportunity of doing. Our entreaties to
him to ' avoid every description of excitement and exertion,' were

as pressing as yours could have been, only (from circumstances)
much oftener repeated. We had even prevailed upon him, just

before his sudden attack of severe dyspnoea, again to leave town for

a while, that he might ensure the means of quietude. Much the

same kind of treatment which you affirm would have been appro-

Ipriate, was counselled by us and adopted. He was cupped, twice,

  think, bled twice from the arm, blistered, and kept on low diet.
    In short all the treatment that you would have recommended,

we recommended ; all that could be positively known concerning

the disease during life we knew as surely as yourself viz. : the

certain existence of mechanical pressure about the lower part of

the windpipe ; and all that could be reasonably conjectured of its

material cause, we saw as clearly as you did viz., the probable

Iexistence of an aneurisrnal tumour.

      Ihope have satisfied you that you have been greatly misin-

formed respecting the facts and practice, upon which directly or

indirectly you have been pleased to comment in a tone of disparage-

ment.

Now was it courteous, or even fair, to publish what you have

published, in reference to the physicians, who could be no other

than Dr. Forbes and myself, without previously ascertaining from

one or the other of us, whether the facts of the case really were as

you understood them to be ? Would it have been charitable or

generous so to exhibit our mistakes, even if you were sure that we
had made them ? Do you indeed believe that if our lamented

patient had been entrusted solely to your care, and could be induced
implicitly to obey your directions, the fatal ' result ' of his disease

Iwould have been prevented ?
     One more question venture, in perfect amity to propose for
your calm consideration. Is it consistent with your character
with your high rank in our profession with your office (which
presents you as an example to so many) in one of our great metro-
politan schools of medicine thus publicly and needlessly, under
profession of a zeal for science, to proclaim your own superior
sagacity, and (by implication) the comparative ignorance or unskil-
fulness of others, your contemporaries, pursuing in the same place,
to the best of their humbler abilities, the same vocation with your-
self, and in this instance, engaged in the peculiarly anxious duty of
ministering to the relief of a professional brother. Would Baillie

Ior Heberden have done this ? remain yours truly,

                                                                              THOMAS WATSON.

Letter from Dr. C. J. B. WILLIAMS to Dr. WATSON.

                    Lancet (Jan. 1, 1848.)

Dear Dr. Watson,  Holies Street, Cavendish Square : Dec. 27, 1847.

                  I Iassure you that much regret that my

Iletter in the Lancet has appeared to be unjust to you or Dr.

Forbes, and am most willing to retract any expressions, which

Imay have wronged you.
     On a re-perusal of my letter, cannot perceive that there is any

Iallusion to you, direct or indirect, except in one sentence, and this
  would willingly retract, even had your explanation not proved the
information contained in it to be incorrect. The paragraph is quite

detached, and may be well suppressed, without impairing the sense

Iof the rest of the narrative, which when separated from it, will not,
   trust, be liable to misinterpretation : it is as follows :
   I' After this, did not see him professionally, as he placed him-

self under the care of physicians, who both before and after this

period, found no physical signs of disease, and who therefore took

Ia more favourable view of the case than did.'
   I I Irepeat that fully retract these expressions ; but may be

allowed to mention, in apology for my having used them, that so

far as they related to the physicians, they implied nothing beyond
what had already appeared in the Lancet of the week preceding

my letter, and had been repeated in many of the public prints.
Thus in the report of Mr. Liston's illness by his assistant Mr.
Cadge, It is stated that ' nothing morbid either in the lungs or
       ERRORS RETRACTED REST RE-AFFIRMED. 235

circulation was detected ; ' and ' in the absence of all physical signs
of such a lesion ' (aneurism) ' a favourable view was taken of the
disease.' Again, so lately as the report of Dec. 8, it is men-

tioned that ' the physical signs were still obscure,' &c. These

Ireports corresponded with an impression generally abroad, with

which became the more acquainted from my position, as Mr.

Liston's colleague, especially directing inquiries to me, and no one

seemed to have been more completely under this erroneous im-

pression than the patient himself, who, doubtless, blinded by his

Ihopes, and disregarding what both you and had told him, ex-
Ipressed to several individuals, whom could name, his satisfaction

that auscultation had discovered no disease in his chest.

   IThat should have been under the same mistaken impression

with regard to your examinations, will appear less strange, when

you recollect, that although the colleague of the patient, the

physician whose aid had been first sought, and who had subsequently

Itwice examined him, and detected positive indications of disease

  was neither summoned to any of the consultations on the case,

nor personally referred to by those in attendance, for any informa-

Ition or suggestion, which possibly might have been able to
Isupply ; therefore remained in ignorance of the real result of your

Iexaminations ; and concluding the published (Mr. Cadge's) report

to be correct, unfortunately relied on in the obnoxious sentence,
       it
which      is

               I
                                      is
                                                            it,

     The generous spirit of mutual concession and amity, which
marks the conclusion of this letter, was equally satisfactory to

myself, and was loyally preserved between us during our
subsequent friendship of thirty-five years unruffled by any
further misunderstanding ; while it was promoted by much

genial professional and social intercourse ; and my attach-

ment to this good man was more than ever confirmed by his
noble act in heading my defence against a mad onslaught
made on me in later years.

    In July 1847 we had the affliction of losing my wife's

father, Mr. James Jenkins of Chepstow at the age of 76 after

a long life of consistent piety and well-doing. Long engaged
in mercantile pursuits, he had latterly lived as a country
gentleman, cultivating a little of his own land, and chiefly
engaged in works of charity and public utility. Although

always hospitable and genial to those around him, he pre-
ferred a private life to one of publicity ; and it was not
without reluctance that he accepted the offices of High Sheriff
and Deputy Lieutenant for the county, that were pressed on
him. By all ranks, high and low, and especially by his

numerous relations and friends, and by the poor, he died,

universally beloved and lamented.

THE death of Liston was the indirect occasion of other dis-

agreements in connection with University College, not like

Watson's and mine, soon explained and happily adjusted, but

long and bitter, and venting much angry feeling in the

medical journals of that year, far from edifying to the public,

or salutary to the Institution, in which they originated. I

took no active part in them then, and shall not enter on the

Isubject now : but found it difficult by that impartiality to
avoid giving offence ; and I cannot say that anything like

general harmony was restored during the remainder of my

connection with the College, or long after. The invitation of

Professor Syme from Edinburgh, to supply the offices vacated

by Mr. Listen's death ; the resignation of the Chair of Surgery

by Professor Cooper ; the sudden abandonment of his new

office by Mr. Syme, were the great disturbing events, which

interrupted the smooth working of the Surgical School, and

spoiled prospects, which had been most promising.

The unsettled state of the Surgical School did not affect my

Idepartment. On the contrary, on that and the following year

Imencement ; and "was well satisfied with the proficiency of

     But in the last two years, began to find my health failing
in various ways. All my life had been an occasional sufferer

from toothache.          was often in the hands of the original

Samuel Cartwright of Old Burlington Street, famous as an

expert extractor of teeth, and still more famous for preserv-

ing them by one mode only stopping with gold. Two of my

upper front teeth were beginning to decay forty years ago
they were saved, and are still sound, with Cartwright's gold

lectures in later years.

    Gentlemen, now bring to conclusion the longest course of lectures ever

given in this country, amounting to upwards of 150 lectures and examinations.

Yet so far have we been from exhausting our subjects, that many, have had

to treat in outline, rather than in detail. If lectures on the practice of medicine

were to be given as fully as those on Anatomy and Physiology, two courses would
be required instead of one. In fact, our subjects are never exhausted there

ever something new which, studied with intelligence, interesting in-

in various parts ; painful enough in themselves, and never

seeming to me much bettered, by still more painful surgical

Itreatment. Then sleep often failed me, and was driven to

seek relief in opiates, or other narcotics ; and was one night

Inearly poisoned by the green tincture of Indian hemp not

from the largeness of the dose, for think it was only twelve

or fifteen drops, but from previous exhaustion, by pain and

fatigue. It gave at first ease and sleep ; but then came a

trance-like faintness, with irregular pulse and sensation of

Isinking, which lasted several hours. For some months con-
tinued ailing in various ways ; but not ill enough to be obliged

to give up work. Fortunately it was not during the lecture

Iseason : but my private practice was now heavy; and often

had to refer my patients to friends who assisted me ; par-

ticularly Dr. Eichard Quain and Mr. J. T. Clover, who from

their position as resident medical officers of the hospital, knew

my practice well, and were well qualified to continue my
treatment. Nor were they losers in any way by their kind

during their attendance ; and these introductions were very

useful to them in their subsequent career.

I IBut these failures of health were serious warnings to me,

strong convictions, that hospital physicians ought not to con-

tinue in office, when the claims of private practice encroach

so much on their time and strength as to prevent them from

Iperforming their Hospital duties efficiently. At the request of

Dr. Forbes, wrote a review of the work of Dr. W. Stokes

on the Chest, in the British and Foreign Medico- chirurgical
I IEeview ; think in 1838 ; before was myself a hospital
Iphysician, and in that article
                                 had suggested that the

appointment of Metropolitan Hospital Physicians should be

limited to a term of ten or twelve years. This would be time

sufficient to test their capacities. If a hospital physician

profits by his position, and proves his abilities to the profession

and to the public, private practice pretty surely follows, soon

enough to make the hospital appointment no longer a neces-

sity at the end of the term ; he then resigns the hospital to

another, who is free to devote himself to and make the most

of the office and its opportunities. If, on the contrary, a

hospital physician in ten or twelve years fails to make his

mark, and to prove his abilities to the profession or to the

public, it is high time that he should vacate his office, and

make way for a better occupant. If it be objected, this

would be hard on the unsuccessful, and give no chance to

second-rate men, however industrious and deserving, I reply,

Hospital appointments are not for second-rate men. Only first-
class men deserve them, and can work them for the best ; and

through them only is the greatest amount of good to be achieved ;

but even the best men, when from full occupation, or other

cause, they fail to give their best time, and their best abilities,

ought likewise to make way for others. These views on the

true aristocracy in the profession, and the optimism of its
I Iobjects,
foresaw      should soon have to carry out in

practice.
     Although now in comparative affluence, (my professional

income having reached 3,600Z. in 1848), neither my family
nor myself were comfortable in domestic arrangements. The
house in Holies Street had become too small for the family and
household, who were for the most part at Brighton, or else-
where in the country ; whilst the town house was devoted to

the reception of patients, and bachelor quarters for myself. In

I1847, took a family house in Avenue Eoad, Kegent's Park,

where our third daughter (the second was stillborn), and eighth
child, was born, within sound of the lion's roar in the Zoolo-

gical Gardens. In the following year, 1848, my family occu-
pied a house in Upper Hamilton Terrace, St. John's Wood ;

and there our youngest daughter was born ; completing the

eight living children who composed our family. It pleased

God, through many delicacies and trials, to spare them all to

us, till March 12, 1880, when this youngest darling (Fanny)
fell asleep in Jesus, and was interred in the cemetery of

Cannes.

    The placing of my family in the suburbs, where I could

see them almost daily, was a great improvement on the more
distant separation, which for many years had much marred

my domestic happiness : but I could not help looking forward
to a time, when, less overwhelmed with engagements, I would

and greatly enjoyed entering into their pursuits and amuse-

ments ; to say nothing of the deep and tender interest which

a father must feel in their whole well-being, of body and mind.

So it was a great gain to me, whenever, in a suburban resi-

Idence, could have the elder ones with me at the early break-

fast and morning prayer; and regularly enjoy the Sabbath

rest and worship together, without the hurry and turmoil of

travelling to and fro. Our places of worship in London were,

Trinity Chapel, Conduit Street, under the Rev. H. H. Beamish,

who was long my patient as well as my pastor : and in St.

John's Wood, the church of the Eev. Mr. Fiske, Hamilton

ITerrace. In addition to the usual ministerial intercourse,

sometimes engaged Mr. Beamish and others of the clergy in

the neighbourhood, to come to gatherings of a few of the

students, who met together for prayer and Bible reading. The

Rev. Dr. Chandler and the Rev. F. Baring, after Bishop of

Durham, were among those who came to my house hi Holies

Street for this purpose. Similar meetings were afterwards

carried on under the title of the Christian Medical Association,

at some of which it was my privilege to preside.

   IBefore the opening of the winter session of 1848-49, had

been led to the conclusion, that this was to be my last course of

lectures. The entries were more numerous than in any pre-
ceding year, except the first ; being 181, including several old
pupils. My kind old friend and colleague, Dr. Robert Grant,
who had been Professor of Comparative Anatomy since the

foundation of the College, was also a regular attendant ; and

it was wonderful to witness the zealous interest with which
this veteran enthusiast in Biology listened to the applications

of modern physiology to practical medicine.

themselves, by either gaming honours at the final examina-

unhesitatingly say that my relations with the students in
general, and the most industrious and talented in particular,

were always pleasant and cordial. It was this good under-

standing with the students, which was my principal encourage-
ment to continue in this arduous work, longer than was good
for my health, or profitable to my interests. The increasing
engagements of private practice, and occasional failures in my

Ihealth, did in the last two years render the work of the College

revised by a medical man, who acted as sub-editor, but had
never attended the lectures. Flagrant errors continued to

Iappear ; and had to insert in the journals a notice that

these reported lectures were unauthentic and incorrect. It

was not till these disavowals were repeated, and elicited some

abusive rejoinders from the journal, that these parodied reports

were discontinued. It was among my regrets, and among the

Ievil results of overwork with which was harassed during the
Ilatter part of my connection with the College, that wras un-

able to authorise and superintend the publication of a course

of lectures, which had cost me so much labour, and which had
been undergoing revision and improvement in each of the ten

the hospital duties, which continued during the summer ; but

THE termination of the connection with University College
left me free to prepare for another change, which had long
been desirable, removal to another habitation, in size and
situation, more suitable to the needs of a large family : for a

Ifamily house in town longed to have, after having been

subjected so many years to shiftings and separations. In

Itwo years was so fortunate as to secure a house in Upper

Brook Street, near to Hyde Park, which had been occupied by
the Earl of Shaftesbury, before his father's death ; when he
succeeded to the title and the residence in Grosvenor Square.

By adding a portico and two bed-rooms, I made it quite

adequate to our needs ; and so rejoiced in a, commodious
habitation in one of the choicest and healthiest spots in
London.

I This was my third and last move in London. Ten years

   was in Half Moon Street waiting for practice. Eleven
years in Holies Street getting into full practice. In Upper
Brook Street, it pleased God to continue my life for twenty-
four years, in possession of a large consulting practice. This
was the commencement of this last period, of nearly a quarter

of a century ; a period by no means uneventful ; for each year

has its portion of important occurrences ; but marking less
change in the course of life ; and therefore less, calling for
record, or fit for publication. The concerns of a public body
like a college or university are fit matters for publication ;

and it might be better for the public, if its eye were more upon
them. But the records of private practice belong to the

secrets of private life, and as a general rule, should be held
sacred by those who are admitted to its confidence ; with par-

ticular exceptions, to be made only on sufficient grounds.

    I formerly mentioned, that the heavy tax on my time and

mental labour, caused by my first undertaking the Profes-
sorship in University College, obliged me to give up all evening
visiting and amusements, including even most of the conver-

sazioni and meetings of learned societies. Some relaxation of
this restriction might now be made ; and the new indulgence

Iproved very agreeable. But soon found that health began to

put in a veto. Having got into a habit of early hours, and great
regularity, it was not to be changed with impunity. Evening
meetings, however pleasant, were exciting, as well as fatiguing,

and would drive away sleep from the overwrought brain : and

a sleepless night was a bad preparative for the day's work,
even moderated as work had now become. Then as the calls

multiplied, which they did almost day by day, and the need
of rest more urgently felt, the conviction was forced upon me

Ithat still ought to avoid evening parties, and superfluous

causes of excitement ; and reserve my powers mainly for the

daily work of life. Society and the arts had then* charms, to

Iwhich was by no means insensible ; and scientific meetings

seemed still more legitimate in their claims on my interest ;
but above all were the claims of eight children, whose prospect
of provision clearly lay in the preservation of my health, and
in my steady devotion to a lucrative practice.

    In the first number of the London Journal of Medicine,

January, 1849, appeared a paper ' On the use and administra-
tion of cod-liver oil in pulmonary consumption.' This was my

first public notice on this subject, in which I had been engaged

for the last three years. My attention had been called to
248 USE OF COD-LIVER OIL EXAMPLE.

cod-liver oil as a useful medicine in scrofula, by Dr. Darling,

who practised for some time in partnership with Dr. Neil

IArnott ; and had met him repeatedly in consultation. But the
Ioil which he employed was of the impure kind used by curriers,

and so offensive that could never get patients to take it. In

1841, Dr. Hughes Bennett published a little book recommend-

ing the oil, on the authority of Dutch and German doctors.

He gave me a copy, and urged me to try the light brown, as
Iless offensive than the common kind.
                                       did try it ; but this

also proved too disgusting for my patients to persevere in its

use. Soon afterwards, several chemists began to produce oil

from the fresh livers of the fish, much more free from the

rank smell and taste, so that it became an available medicine.

IThis pure oil I began to use in 1846, and with such surprisingly

good results, that in 1848, was able to report as follows.

I' have prescribed the oil in above 400 cases of tuberculous

disease of the lungs in different stages, which have been under my

Icare in private practice, and of 284 of these have notes. Out of

this number the oil disagreed, and was discontinued, in only nine
instances. In nineteen, it appeared to do no good ; while in the

large proportion of 206 out of 234, its use was followed by marked
and unequivocal improvement, varying in degree in different cases,

from a temporary retardation of the progress of the disease and

mitigation of distressing symptoms, up to a more or less complete

restoration to apparent health.'

    It is unnecessary to give further details from this paper,

as the evidence which it gives of the power of cod oil as a
remedy in consumption has been fully confirmed and extended
by subsequent experience, particularly that fully detailed and
explained in the work on Consumption, by myself and my
son, published in 1871. But two or three extracts and notes

may serve to illustrate the history of .the subject. Of the

eleven cases described, the following is a sample.

Miss  ret. 28, of consumptive family : first visited Sept. 3,

1847, with Mr. Sawyer of Pentonville. Had slight cough ever

since taking cold baths in summer of 1846. A glandular swelling

formed below the jaw, and continued until the last two months.
In March, 1847, an eruption of purpura appeared; and as it sub-

sided, the cough became more troublesome, and flesh and strength

visibly declined. In the last two months she has become much

worse, with distressing cough and shortness of breath, evening

fever and night sweats, absolute loathing of food, and rapid ema-

ciation. A week ago, expectorated a few teaspoonfuls of blood, with

some relief to breath and cough. Now much emaciated, very

tremulous and feeble, with rapid running pulse, difficult to count.

There was complete dulness over more than half of the upper left

chest, with mixture of large gurgling and pectoriloquy. Below less

dulness, and moist crepitus only accompanied the respiratory move-

ments. Breath weak, with moist crepitus, also above right clavicle ;
and large tubular expiration loud at the root of the right lung.

     This patient seemed in so hopeless a condition, and had such

Ifoulness of tongue and delicacy of stomach, that did not like to

subject her to the annoyance of a trial of the oil ; and therefore

Iprescribed an agreeable draught with nitric acid, and a linctus for

the cough. visited her again in a week, and found her no better,

but obviously rapidly declining, with the same insuperable disgust

at nourishing food. Considering that matters could not well be

Iworse, did then order the oil, and took my leave, fully expecting
Ito hear of her death in a few weeks. However, heard nothing

of her for two months, when one of her sisters came to consult me
Iabout her own health.
                        learnt to my surprise that her sister was

not only alive, but comparatively fat and well, having little to com-

plain of but hunger, and ' that she could not be allowed the run of

the house, to eat any and every eatable to be met with.' This

marvellous restoration of the appetite followed the first few doses

Iof the oil ; and the diminution of hectic, sweats, cough and expec-

toration speedily ensued. In Jan. 1848 was requested to see her,

uot on account of any check in her progress, but for a temporary

I Iailment. On entering the room, looked round it twice before

could recognise my patient, so entirely was she altered in appear-

ance ; and she was, unquestionably, the healthiest looking person

present. The pulse was at 80, of moderate strength, and the tongue

quite clean. The fair outside was not, however, matched by an

equal improvement within. The duhiess and cavernous sounds

still continued in the upper half of the left lung, but with much less

gurgling of liquid ; and the short crepitus of the lower parts of this

lung had given place to a harsh and somewhat rough breath sound.

The tubular expiration remained in the right interscapular region ;

but the breath sound was dry and clear above the right clavicle.

This lady called on me a fortnight ago (Nov. 1848), having been

well and active ever since ; only acknowledging a slight cough and

short breath on exertion. The chest on examination manifested

continued improvement. She has continued steadfast in the use

Iof the oil, and happily believes and feels the truth of what tell

her, that it is as the staff of life to her. This lady lived many
years after ; a further history is mentioned in the work on Con-
sumption.

      The paper proceeds to discuss the mode of operation of
cod-liver oil, a subject comprehended in the second edition of
the Principles of Medicine, then just published; and con-
cludes with directions for the preparation and administration
of the remedy, on a due attention to which its utility and
success mainly depend.

    ' If the experience of the profession at large should accord with

my own, and with that of those who preceded me in recommending
the oil, our prognosis with regard to phthisis must undergo some

Imodification. To what extent this modification may reach, cannot

be determined, until such cases as those which have recorded shall
have been tested by years of time : but even now, when we re-
peatedly find forms and degrees of disease, that former experience
had taught us to be utterly hopeless and speedily fatal, retarded,
arrested, nay sometimes even removed, and almost obliterated by
varying processes of restored health, we must pause ere we, in

future, pass the terrible sentence of" no hope," on the consumptive

invalid.

    I' In conclusion, repeat that further observations, and longer

time are required to determine with accuracy the extent to which
this agent can control or remove tuberculous disease of the lung ;

Ibut would affirm as the result of extensive experience, confirmed

by a rational consideration of its mode of action, that the pure fresh
oil from the liver of the cod, is more beneficial in the treatment of
pulmonary consumption, than any agent, medicinal, dietetic, or
regiminal that has yet been employed.'

   I I Ihope that may not be judged conceited, if say that

this paper caused a great sensation among doctors and
druggists, the effect being more lively in the trade, than in

the profession. It was reprinted in the Pharmaceutical

Journal, and circulated widely through town and country;

Iand had the mortification to see my name paraded among
Ithe bottles of the shops. This was a notoriety which was
Ifar from coveting ; and did feel annoyed at sharing a popu-

  began to meditate how could best clear myself of such

Iimputation. But further reflection and multiplying experience
set me right, and banished my qualms.          had published
Inothing but what knew to be truth, and truth which might
be, and ought to be, useful to the community. In this view

it became a duty to make it known for the public good, with-
Iout too sensitively regarding censorious criticism. And

man whose large and gloomy experience had rendered him very sceptical of the
power of any remedy in this destructive disease.

Paris, le 26 Oct. 1849.

The exhortation of M. Louis was not in vain ; and some of the results were

recorded in our work on Consumption, in 1870, when the great champion of

the numerical method had ceased to count.

   I* Here, as on former occasions, make a point of acknowledging the priority
of Dr. Hughes Bennett in the recommendation of the cod-liver oil ; but I never

succeeded in giving him satisfaction, as may be inferred from the following note

appended to this paper :     the  " Edinburgh  Monthly Journal of Medical
    ' In a recent number of

Science," the Editor, Dr. Hughes Bennett (or some one writing under his direc-
tion) accuses me of plagiarism, in adopting his explanation of the action of

thirty years, and Dr. Bardsley of Manchester fifty years, in re-

commending cod-liver oil as a remedy. If any credit is due

to me, it was in my proving that the fresh pure oil, which

every one can take, is at least as efficacious as the impure oil,
which very few could take, in my encouraging chemists to
obtain it in that pure state ; and in my devising various
means of facilitating the administration and securing the
agreement of the remedy. These particulars, first given in
this article in the London Journal of Medicine, were repeated
more fully in subsequent publications (Principles of Medicine
3rd edition 1856, and Pulmonary Consumption &c. 1870),

and require no further notice here ; but one passage relating

to the peculiar influence of the oil on the digestive organs and

liver, deserves to be quoted, as bearing on points which have

escaped general attention.

     ' Unlike other oils or fats, cod-liver oil rarely disorders the stomach

or bowels, or disturbs the function of the liver. If taken in any

quantity, vegetable oils commonly purge ; and animal oils turn

rancid in the stomach, causing heartburn, bilious attacks, and

even jaundice. On the contrary cod-liver oil generally improves

all the chylopoietic functions, and distinctly promotes the action

of the liver ; so that, in several of the cases above narrated, the

appetite and power of digestion are restored, and patients are

Ienabled to take an amount and variety of food, beyond what they
were accustomed to, even in health.           cannot help thinking that

his, but quoted frqm Ascherson and other German writers (and is combined

Iby Dr. Bennett with the notion of the oil acting by its iodine), is by no means

that which propose, as may be seen on reference to the text. The professed
review which contains this accusation, betrays such gross misunderstandings

Iof the work, which it criticises, and such a spirit of personal jealousy, that
Ido not think it needful to notice it.'
                                              really do not know what first set Dr.
Bennett in such violent opposition to me. I could not agree with all his
Iviews ; but in my dissent was never aware of having said anything person-
Ially offensive ; yet in the review of my ' Principles,' above alluded to (the only

unfavourable one, believe, that had ever appeared), the general tone was that

Iof such open hostility, accompanied by so much inaccuracy and misrepresenta-

tion, that thought myself called on to reply to it-. But on consulting Sir James

this peptic influence of the oil is due to its containing some biliary
principle, which both favours its divisibility in the process of diges-
tion, and promotes the natural secretions of the liver. The flow of

bile, as indicated by the colour of the faeces, is generally free and
Iuniform during its exhibition ; and

of the liver (as determined by percussion) becomes augmented
during its use, yet without tenderness, or other sign of disorder. In
fact this seems to be a kind of useful hypertrophy, induced by the oil
increasing the bulk and number of the hepatic cells, and supplying
also a material more fitted for this secretion, because it has
already within it some elements of biliary matter, which served a
similar purpose in the liver of the fish, and this at a lower tempera-
ture, and less favourable to the activity of the process. The obser-
vation of this influence of cod-liver oil has led me to use it in several
cases of functional and structural disease of the liver, marked by
defective or depraved secretion ; and in some instances with most
satisfactory results ; especially in one of habitual formation of gall-
stones, which had resisted all kinds of treatment, and was rapidly
destroying the health : the use of the oil has entirely stopped the

attacks and has restored the patient to good health.
    ' It appears therefore that although other oils might be equally

influential in promoting nutrition, and in preventing and removing
the cacoplastic and aplastic exudations of scrofulous subjects, the oil

from the cod's liver, and perhaps those from the livers of other
fish, have the advantage in point of digestibility, and in promoting
the action of the digestive and biliary organs. '

an eruption like itch, thus cures itch. On the contrary,

physicians know that cow-pox is really the same disease as
small-pox, but in a milder form ; and that vaccination prevents

control of appreciability through the most delicate tests, and

fly into the mystical regions of innumerability and utter
vagueness ! They pretend indeed to express in numbers their

infinitesimal dilutions, and talk flippantly about their billionths

and trillionths and decillionths of a grain, as if these were

comprehensible numbers, and not mere abstractions of thought,

belonging exclusively to the transcendental regions of mathe-

matics and astronomy. To pretend that such practical non-

entities are physical agents, capable of controlling the bodily

powers in the treatment of disease, is more monstrous than

the frauds of mesmerism and magic. If homoeopathy has

any real agency, it is not physical, but metaphysical, through

the mind and imagination, which is wonderfully active in

atoning for the failures of all sorts of mockeries of medicine.

Then, in defence, rises the fallacious argument of experimental

success of homoeopathy, attested by a fallible public and by

two or three fanciful peers, pacing in the tracks of post hoc, ergo

propter hoc, and ignoring the beneficent hand of kind Nature,

who cures many diseases, in spite of bad treatment, or of

no treatment at all. Where statistical comparisons have

been carefully made on a large scale, and with strict attention

to all conditions, as in the hospitals of Vienna, the mortality

has been proved to be much greater under homoeopathy, than

under legitimate medicine. 1

It has fallen to my lot to meet with several instances, in

which precious time has been lost, and life has been sacrificed,

by the patients trusting to Homoeopathy in the early treat-

ment of their illness. These remarks will sufficiently explain

the following correspondence, which appeared in the Lancet,

March 23, 1850.

Dear Sir,                      7 Holies Street, Cavendish Square : Feb. 1850.

             I am obliged to you for your courtesy in wishing to

have my opinion on the diagnosis of the case of the Hon. Mrs.

Iand for your candour in apprising me that she is under homeopathic

treatment ; but under these circumstances, must beg you to excuse

Imy attendance.

     Believing as firmly do, that the so-called ' homoeopathic system '

Iis an entire fallacy, and therefore calculated to do much injury to

those on whom it is practised, consider it to be my duty to do

nothing that can, directly or indirectly, countenance or aid it ; and

it appears to me, that to meet a homoeopathic physician in consulta-

tion, and to assist in the diagnosis of a case, professedly under

I Ihomoeopathic treatment, would have such an effect.
        need scarcely add that have no personal feelings in the
Imatter. And hoping that you will soon return to the domain of

legitimate medicine, remain, dear sir, yours faithfully,

    In speaking of Homoeopathy, I allude to that of its inventor,

Hahnemann, professedly adopted and strictly followed by
numerous disciples. We are told now that modern homoeo-
paths no longer hold his characteristic doctrines, either of

similia similibus, etc. or of infinitesimal doses. If so, they are

no longer homoeopaths and if they retain the title, they de-

serve to be denounced as swindlers, practising and obtaining
money under false pretences.

ALTHOUGH my time was well occupied with a rapidly increas-

ing practice, my retirement from the trammels of College and

Hospital engagements, gave me more liberty in its disposal.

Instead of having to hurry off to the lecture after an early

Ibreakfast, could have my leisure repast with my elder sons,

and a short time for Scripture reading and prayer, before the

Iarrival of patients. Our Scripture study was that of the
Greek Testament, of which  had already made a daily

practice for some years ; and this was continued during the

Iremainder of my life in London. Conscious that had not
Isufficiently mastered Greek in early life, had always a desire

to know it better, not only on account of the beauty and rich-

ness of the language, and its aptitude for supplying new words

in literature and science, but above all, because it is the

language of the inspired Word of Life, and thus may become

a key to the most precious of all knowledge. When old

enough, my daughters also joined in this study, with occasional

assistance of a friend, a good Greek scholar, the Eev. Hugh

McSorley, M.A. T.C.D. It is not to be expected that knowledge

of Greek, derived from the study of the New Testament only,

Ihowever prolonged, could be critical or profound ; but can

testify that it has enabled me to comprehend the exact mean-
258 EDUCATION OF SONS.

Iing of the Sacred Text more fully and satisfactorily than
Icould from any translation. The Eevised Version, find on

the whole a considerable improvement on the old : but it
seems to me in many passages to fall short of the fulness of
meaning conveyed by a more literal translation of the original ;
although this may sometimes be difficult to express in English

idiom.

    In recording the restoration of the fuller enjoyment of

family associations consequent on my release from college

Iengagements, and removal to a larger house, am reminded

to say a few words on my children and their education. Of
five sons, of ages from fourteen downwards, the three eldest

had been sent to preparatory schools, of which Mrs. Bartlett's

of Sussex Square, Brighton, and Messrs. Adams and Langtry
of the same town, deserve mention. With the eldest, James
Thomas, private tuition seemed more suitable than school, as,

like his father, he had more taste for tooling and technical

matters, than for classical studies ; and he was placed with
my old patient and friend, the Eev. Charles Bury, at Bon-
church in the Isle of Wight. Later he was sent to the care
of Dr. Wagner, a pastor near Stutgardt, where he made

Igood progress in German and French. The second, Charles

Theodore, who had done well at school, sent to Harrow;

but after a year of promising study, he had a severe attack of

Irheumatic fever, which rendered him unfit to return to school ;

and placed him, together with his next brother, Harry
Samuel, under the able tuition of the Eev. Charles Bradley,
of Southgate, the eldest of that well-known family, renowned
especially for scholastic eminence. With him they remained
for two or three years, to the great improvement of body and
mind, until they entered the Universities : Charles at Oxford,

Harry at Cambridge. They both passed a creditable career,

Iand graduated with honours. Of the younger sons and

 daughters may have occasion to speak later.

     It will be easily understood that this increased freedom

 and opportunity of enjoying the society of my family in their
 occupations and amusements, was a great improvement on

Ithe close college life in Holies Street. Fond as was of my

 profession, and finding good cheer and encouragement in the

        well as refreshing change, to have now and then an hour or

        two of diversion, in visit with my boys to the Polytechnic,

        the Botanic, and the Zoological Gardens and to enjoy the

        pleasure of watching on their minds the impressions produced

        by such objects, as used to delight me at their age and they

        all had the same taste for natural history and natural science

        that had. But there was this difference. They had such
        I

        an abundance of these sights, hi London, and such numbers

        of books and pictures descriptive of them, that they soon became

        satiated, and lost their keen relish whereas in my dull

        country home, was in state of semi-starvation, from paucity
                         a

        of objects, and scarcity of books. And think should have

        gone right mad,  if        could have had Polytechnic or

                           I

        Zoological, brought to me at Heytesbury. But probably the

        poverty of the objects, became the means of driving the mind

to greater effort, and the senses to examine more closely and

        search more deeply and so not only to find more, but to
                         ;

But had not slept on for many nights, before discovered in another

virtue which did not anticipate. It was symphonic. Whether from toothache

        or other pain, or even from weariness or want of sleep, was often in the habit

of slightly moaning, as lay. To my surprise my moans were answered, by                                                     aa

consonant note, from some of the springs of my new bed. Whatever the

pitch of the moaning voice, was answered by the corresponding vibrations of

        some portions of the metallic coils. So moaned not alone, but heard

260 HISTORIC PERSONAGES OF THE WORLD'S FAIR:

poverty in all objects of taste and decorative art was quite

humiliating. This inferiority entirely disappeared in subse-

quent exhibitions. The British manufacturers learned a

great lesson from that first exhibition, and have since accom-

plished gigantic strides of improvement.

     Another triumph, accomplished in that exhibition, excelled

any of those which came after, the triumph of the genius

of the scientific naturalist, over the gloomy conceptions of

classical architecture. The substitution of Sir Joseph

Paxton's crystal roof for the dark ceilings of the architect,

was significant of the want of the age, which struggling out
of mediaeval gloom, was crying for ' More light ! more light ! '

     Besides the objective marvels of this First World's Fair,

there was the grand historical fact of the congress of all

nations, and the personal presence of the foremost represen-

tatives of humanity from all quarters of the world to inaugurate

the event. Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, in opening

this exhibition, emblazoned this day as one of the most

glorious in Her prosperous reign. Under Her, was an
assemblage of the great, in every rank and sphere, who had

joined to aid and celebrate this grand step of human progress ;

but conspicuous above all, stood two most prominent personages
                         ;
whom, brief as this notice                   impossible not to name.

Prince Albert the Good who was the first to conceive the
bright thought of devising this World's Fair, and in maturing

DEATH OF DUKE OF WELLINGTON.                                 261

Ivisit this Great Man at Walmer : but his spirit had fled before
  arrived.
   IOn September 14, on calling at my house about 4 P.M.
found the following telegram :

' SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY ELECTBIC TELEGRAPH. LONDON STATION.

At 2.19 P.M., Tuesday, 14th day of Sept. 1852.

Received the following message :

                       From                             To
Name Lord Charles Wellesley
                             Name Dr. C. J. B. Williams

Address Walmer Castle, Deal  Address Late of 7 Holies Street, and

Dr. C. J. B. Williams, late of 7 Holies Street, is requested to

come to Walmer Castle immediately.

Dispatched from London Office at 3.31 P.M.'

   I had never attended the Duke, nor had I any intelligence
Iof his illness : in fact, could only guess that the message

related to him. The only way to ' come immediately,' was to

Iwait for the next train, which was to start at 6 P.M. (I think).

Had taken a special train, it was doubtful that it would

arrive sooner, and the message did not seem to warrant my

taking that step. There was no message to stop my coming

Iat London Bridge : but on the journey heard a rumour of

the Duke's death. On arriving at Walmer Castle, between
I8 and 9, learnt that His Grace had been dead several
Ihours, do not now remember how many, but the death
Imust have taken place before
                                             received the message in

London.

   I heard from Lord Charles Wellesley the particulars of
I Ihis illness, some of which will relate, so far as can

remember them. The Duke was in his usual health the day

before, Monday ; and had driven to Dover to meet a friend

who was to arrive by steamer. The packet was behind time ;

and the Duke walked with Lord Charles on the pier, seemingly

quite well ; and as usual, plying the men with questions about
what they were doing. His sight was so good that he

'Idescribed to Lord Charles what he could see on the French
coast, 'where,' Lord Charles added,             could see nothing.'
I(Lord Charles's sight was defective : saw him afterwards
when he became blind, from the disease of which he died.)
262 HIS TOR YANECDO TE.

The Duke was thus kept waiting ; and returned to dinner two

I Ihours after his usual time. He was very hungry, and ate
hastily and heartily.  am not sure, but think his valet

Itold me that a meat pie and cold salad formed part of the

dinner ; and know that he mentioned that the Duke drank

a great deal of water, but not a drop of wine or spirit. In

the night he had a severe epileptic fit, to which he was liable ;
and on recovering, desired his valet to send for Dr. Hulke, his

usual medical attendant, who came and administered proper
I Iremedies, but do not remember further particulars.
                                                                did

not then see Dr. Hulke, but met him after at the funeral.

We agreed in attributing the death to the consequences of the

violent convulsive attack, brought on by an over-distended

stomach. He lived, it is true, to a good old age : but it can

hardly be doubted, considering how well he seemed to be

the day before, that but for that long and exhausting fast,

and the large and hasty meal of cold indigestible food,

he might have avoided that attack and lived for a while

longer.

The Duke, although a strict disciplinarian, was wayward

as a patient, and had Spartan notions against self indulgence

of any kind. Dr. Eobert Ferguson told me that once the

IDuke complained to him of his feet getting cold in bed. '

would advise your Grace,' said Dr. F. * to have a hot bottle

Iin your bed.' ' Hot bottle ! Naw, naw ! rub 'em rub 'em
Ihalf-an-hour.' A good sample of the Iron Duke's endurance as

well as natural sagacity. have proved the benefit of imita-

ting his perseverance : rubbing one's own feet, at first seems a

feeble and fatiguing exertion, and with little result : but if

you take a leaf out of the Duke's book, and go on rubbing for
half-an-hour, or even a quarter of an hour, you will surely find

Inot the feet only, but the whole body, in a glow.

    In reply to a letter which wrote to the Marquis of Douro

to express my own and my portion of a nation's condolence

Ion our great loss, received the following :

" Sir,                                      3 Upper Belgrave Street : Oct. 17, 1852.

         It may be some slight compensation for the anxiety and

pain that you must have felt as an Englishman, that you have the

assurance that in your skill the utmost confidence was placed.

Iare left to hope that his mission on earth has been fulfilled.

Dr. Williams.  DOUEO."

   I Ilearned that owed the honour of this distinguished,

although disappointing, engagement, to the good opinion of my
friend the Earl of Clanwilliam, who, occupying Deal Castle,

was near neighbour to the Duke.

   IA few days later received the following invitation.

carriage by Dr. Hume and by the Chaplain General of the Forces
and the Chaplain of the Tower."

     At 8 A.M. on the morning of the Funeral, November 18, by

direction, I entered the Park by Buckingham Gate, and joined

the procession of the carriages preceding the Funeral Car, and
was joined by not those indicated in the Earl Marshal's letter,
but Dr. Eobert Ferguson, (my old friend), and Dr. Hulke.

     That procession, its object, its composition one Illustrious

Dead, and thousands of Living Mourners, the streets and

houses crowded by millions, through which it passed, and the
vast solemn edifice, which, serried with figures and furnitures of
mourning, received the departed to his last Home these all
formed a scene to be beheld once only in a lifetime, and once
seen never to be forgotten ! A mighty nation, headed by its
Beloved Queen, personally present in crowds of millions, and

all other nations of the earth represented by their magnates

and ambassadors appointed for the occasion were assembled
to do homage to the memory of One Man, whose corpse was

borne before them to the tomb.
     Our place in the Cavalcade was favourable for watching

the procession through all the stages of its progress, which was
from St. James's Park along the^ Birdcage Walk up Consti-

tution Hill to Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly, St. James's

    As the procession was slowly winding up Constitution Hill

in sight of Apsley House and the bronze statue on the arch,

the plaintive notes of the Dead March in Saul sounding from

between the trees, we could not but be moved with the

thought, that now he was passing for the last time by the

way of his habitation at Hyde Park Corner, where, for forty

years past, his familiar figure had been so often seen, seeming,
as it were, to belong to the place but hencefor wards, ' the

place thereof shall know him no more.'

Our position in the Cathedral, was quite in the centre, on

the ground floor, close to the funeral car ; with a crowd of Kings'

sons, Princes, and Ambassadors, behind us, and with the
Ifullest opportunity of seeing and hearing everything.

Isuch an event ; but not without a humiliating thought of how

little merited the honour.

AFTER my establishment in my new residence in Upper Brook

Street, my time was chiefly devoted to private practice, less

laborious, and much more remunerative, than College and

Hospital work. Morning consultations formed the chief part

Iof the practice ; and for these was at home from 9 till 1, and

often detained till 2 or 3 P.M. Many of the patients were

sufferers from chest disease, and many were new cases ; all

requiring lengthened and minute examinations. From twelve

to eighteen was the average attendance, which would occupy

the whole time ; but occasionally the number of patients would

rise to twenty, and even twenty- four, which would keep me at
home till 3 or 4 o'clock. The visiting practice lay chiefly

Iin consultations with other practitioners, which occupied the
time through the rest of the afternoon.  had never a large

family practice ; and therefore was rarely called out at late or
266 DEMANDS OF AUTHORSHIP.

early hours. The families, who habitually employed me, were
a few among the nobility, bankers, merchants and others of

the upper ranks of the middle class, who generally were also
my intimate friends.

     We did not mix much in society. The frequent ill-health

of my wife, and the necessity for strict and regular living,
which my past trying life had laid on me, interfered with

much visiting ; and although they deprived me of much social

enjoyment, these comparatively recluse habits reserved strength

for what were absolutely necessary, professional occupations.
And this work included, not only the private practice, to which

I have been alluding, but also the duties of authorship. My

office as public instructor did not terminate with the release

from University College ; there was a call from the public for

new editions Of my published works. The second edition of

Ithe Principles of Medicine was issued in 1848. Early in 1853,

it was exhausted, and had immediately to provide for its
renewal. 1 But this was no easy matter ; involving the necessity
of much reading of recent works in physiology and pathology,
to bring the information up to the advances of the present day.

IThis could not do by myself without working at night more
Ithan in my state of health, and with fully employed days,

would be safe. But was most glad to find the needed help

hi my old pupil and friend, Dr. E. J. Mann, himself the suc-

cessful author of several elementary works in physiology and
other branches of science. He zealously undertook, and faith-

fully fulfilled his task to my great relief and satisfaction.
But even with his able assistance, it took me nearly three
years to complete this edition, including as it did much

Ioriginal matter, requiring much thought and careful delibera-

tion. On this work need not dwell longer, having already

anticipated the subject in Chap. XXIII.

     1 Princes Street, Soho : Feb. 17, 1853.

   IMy dear Sir, Since you favoured me with a call, have had an order from
IIndia for 25 copies of your ' Principles of Medicine : ' could only send 11
copies, and have now not one copy on hand. It is a pity such a work should
be so long out of print ; particularly as it is recommended by several teachers
                      I am,
to their classes.

                      Yours faithfully,

Dr. Williams, F.B.S.         JOHN CHUKCHILL.
DISAPPOINTED OF ASSISTANCE.                     267

    A work from my pen on Diseases of the Chest, was another

Iintended undertaking, and the more incumbent on me, as

had promised it to the profession more than ten years before,

and the small volume, embracing only a part of the subject,
Ihad been also out of print for several years.
                                                had a large

amount of material, unpublished, or only partially published,

accumulating for this object, and every year added to the

stock. But with my increasing engagements, and weight of

Iresponsibility in private practice, rather shrank from under-

taking a great new work single-handed, and desired to find

some one to join me in it. Dr. Eichard Quain had been in the
habit of assisting me for several years, not only in his official

capacity of House-Physician to the hospital, but also in private

I Ipractice, when, from pressure of engagements, or from ill-

health, was unable to attend. had also frequently deputed

him to take charge of my patients in my absence, with the

understanding, according to my rule, that he should retain the

honoraria. He had not been my pupil in the class of Medicine,

having followed the Course of Drs. Elliotson and Copland before

my appointment ; but he was a regular attendant at my clinical

lectures, and was quite conversant with my views and practice.

He had been recently appointed Assistant Physician in the

Hospital at Brompton, which gave him a wide field of experi-

ence in diseases of the chest. What then could be more

Inatural and fitting than that should propose to Dr. Quain
Ito join me in the production of this work on Diseases of the

Chest ? This did, also with the understanding that we

should be equal participators in the profits. To this he

assented with great apparent gratification and good will ; and
the work was publicly announced in our joint names by Mr.

Churchill, as preparing for publication.

     Writing for this work now became the occasional occupa-

tion of my most leisure hours. It was less pressing than that

for the ' Principles,' and could bear waiting. Still I intended

steadily to proceed ; and had already written upwards of a

Ihundred pages, when began to question Dr. Quain as to his

progress ; the answers were not satisfactory. This went on

for months and years, without anything forthcoming on his

part ; and the ultimate result has been, that although he has
268 DEVOTION TO PRACTICE.

continued to be my confidential friend and assistant in prac-

tice, to his own advantage, as well as to mine, he has given

Ime no help in this or other literary work. The sequel (I

know not if may say the consequence) of the delinquency

Iwas that soon also ceased to write ; and the work has been in

abeyance ever since. Such is the fact; and it is not to the

credit of my independence, or of my resolution, that, being

Idisappointed of the promised co-operation, have allowed the

fruit of much labour and thought to remain buried and un-

productive through the period of upwards of thirty years.

   I know not what excuse to make for Dr. Quain. For my-
Iself, can only plead that, being disappointed of his expected
Ico-operation, began to feel increasing inaptitude for more
Iwork than was positively necessary. had good employment

in practice ; and felt generally tired enough at the end of each
day's work, to make me glad of rest. In fact neither in bodily

Ihealth, nor in mental vigour, had recovered from that ten
Iyears' strain, which had struggled through; and friends
Iwere continually urging on me that needed more rest.

   IAnd more rest did take. Postponing for the time the
Icalls for re-publication, or fresh enterprise, devoted myself

entirely to the duties of my large practice, which occupied me

from ten to fourteen hours in the day, and brought me a large
income, of from four to seven thousand a year. Unfortunately I
Ihave mislaid the memoranda of the fullest years ; but know
Ithat it never exceeded the latter amount.
                                            had the credit of

receiving much more ; perhaps from the numbers of patients

who consulted me : many of these, however, came only once

Ior twice, and never saw them again. This kind of practice

occupies much time and thought, involves great responsibility,
Iand is by no means remunerative in proportion.
                                                 was one

of the first to introduce the rule of demanding double fees for

first consultations ; as justly due for the greater expenditure

of time and skill, which they require ; and this practice has

since become more general ; with the result of considerably

increasing the incomes of consulting physicians of the present

day ; but it was not sufficiently adopted in my time to give

me its full benefit. Therefore my largest receipts, handsome

as they were, did not equal those of fashionable physicians of
         GAINS LESSENED BY LOSSES.          269

olden times, nor of the two or three special favourites of the

present day. Doubtless, my practice was much enlarged

during the early years of my connection with University

ICollege ; but for the last two or three years, its heavy duties

restricted the further increase ; and as soon as was relieved

of these, the augmentation went on rapidly, and did not abate

during the succeeding twenty years, until infirm health and

advancing age began to tell on me.

    It might be expected that so large an income, continuing

for so many years, must have made me a rich man : but such

Iwas not the case ; and although have always had reason to

be thankful for a comfortable competency, circumstances have

occurred to withhold anything like great affluence. The ex-

penses of a large family (of whom five were boys) were heavy,
and increased with the demands for education. But the

greatest cause of limitation of my wealth was bad investment ;
I Ithrough which sustained losses, amounting to more than
Ilike to mention.
                   cannot acquit myself from the charge of

imprudence and foolish credulity in these unfortunate transac-

tions, which stamp my conduct, as largely wanting in worldly

wisdom.

   IAlthough in practice as well as in writing, always endea-

vouring to pursue a rational method, was also on the look out

for useful knowledge resulting from mere experience, where

that was sound and reliable. Much information on the use of

Imedicines, and on the application of remedies, is to be gathered

from the medical journals of the period : but found great

advantage of this kind, also from intercourse with a few able

Imen who have a peculiar talent for finding out, and for happily
applying, successful methods of treatment.  have already

mentioned Sir Charles Locock, as excelling in this knowledge

of remedies. Another, whose name I would record, as also

that of a dear and valued friend, was Mr. James Startin,

whose treatment in his special department, diseases of the skin,

was far more successful than that of any other practitioner

Ithat ever knew. His knowledge may not have been very

scientific, or based on very exact pathological investigations:

but he succeeded in curing aggravated and inveterate forms
270 FRIENDS CLEVER IN PRACTICE.

of disease, that had baffled many other practitioners. He was

the first to introduce the free use of glycerine in medicine ;

and having traced acne, and other follicular diseases to fatty

concretions, he successfully applied oil of turpentine and other

essential oils to dissolve and disperse them. He was remark-

ably ingenious and fertile of resource in the use of caustics,

and in small surgical operations ; and had for cutaneous

affections a variety of pigments, which seemed complicated and

unchemical in their composition : yet they were nevertheless

efficacious, not only in covering unsightly appearances, but
Ialso in soothing and in promoting a healthy action.
                                                      could

not always equally approve of his internal remedies, some of
which were much like those prescribed by Dr. H. Jephson of

ILeamington, combining tonics with aperients ; and often
Iheard complaints of their disagreement : but must also add,

that they sometimes wrought a cure, where simpler means

had failed. Startin had great confidence in my medical skill ;
and we were warmly attached by mutual obligations in friendly

and professional intercourse.

Another dear friend, whose communion used to delight

me, also in connection with his earnestness and with the

Ifertility of his resources, was Sir James Simpson, the dis-
tinguished Professor at Edinburgh.  did not deserve his

friendship at the beginning, for my intimacy with Dr. Evory
Kennedy of Dublin, had led me to support him, Dr. Simpson's

Iopponent, in the election to the Professorial Chair. Neverthe-

less, heard so much of Dr. Simpson's kindness in the family

Iof my cousin, Archdeacon Williams, and of my youngest

brother, with whom he was most intimate, that could not

but welcome him warmly, when he sought me out in his visits to

London. And there was something so winning in his simple
heartiness, and so charming hi his enthusiasm in the progress

of our art, that our intercourse was ever after a source of

much enjoyment and benefit. At one time he tried to per-
suade me that it would be to my advantage to exchange my
field of action, from London to Edinburgh ; and urged that a

professorship in the latter university would be preferable to
any similar office which London could offer : but with the

much scantier prospects of private practice, and more con-
JAMES SIMPSON.  271

Itracted sphere of action, of Edinburgh, could see nothing in

the proposed exchange to tempt a man with a large family,
and who had already been overstrained with professorial

engagements.

   I was always intensely interested in Professor Simpson's
Ianaesthetic discoveries, which was enabled to announce in the

later editions of my ' Principles,' as making an important
addition to our therapeutic treasury. We had several
discussions about the use of anaesthetics for other purposes,

Ibesides that of removing pain ; and on one of the last occasions

on which saw him, when he sent for me to see a patient
with him at the Bridge of Allan, he had a number of asthma-
tics at his house, trying to inhale carbonic acid gas, which he

Ihad found, in some cases, to give great relief to the breathing.

  cannot say that my trials of this agent have proved successful. 1

      Admirable and beneficent as were the enthusiasm and

devotion, which marked the course of this most gifted and
amiable man, there can be little doubt that they shortened
his life. Under the highest motives he undertook more than

he was able to perform, and may be literally said to have died
   like not a few others in our arduous profession, prematurely
    of over-work. But in his later years, his eager spirit found,

and rejoiced in, a Treasure inestimably greater than all his, or

any other human discoveries ; and he was enabled to bear wit-
ness to its Precious Truths, and to hold forth to men its Divine

Light as the greatest of all blessings, for Time and for Eter-
nity. The tract, 'Dead in trespasses and sins,' which he sent
me, and several passages in his Biography, by the Eev. Dr.
Duns, reveal the higher life of this eminent Christian philo-

sopher and physician, as ' casting down reasonings and every
high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and
bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.' 3

   1 In connection with this subject I would mention that on calling on Dr.

Brown SSquard in Paris last May (1883), he told me, that he had lately proved
by experiment, that by introducing carbonic acid gas into the trachea, the

sensibility and excito-motory power of the superior laryngeal nerve was quite

abolished ; and that carbonic acid is therefore the proper anaesthetic for that

nerve, and the fittest remedy for all spasmodic and painful affections of the '
glottis. But the experiment must be difficult, as it was necessary to supply
air to the lung by another aperture, lower in the trachea.

272 DR. R. BRIGHT. MR. P. SQUIRE.

Another eminent physician, whom it was my privilege and

pleasure often to meet in consultation, was Dr. Eichard Bright,

whose character commended itself to all by its earnestness

and painstaking intelligence. He was a most judicious and

expert practitioner, and deservedly gained the full confidence

of his patients : but he used to confess himself to be some-

what old-fashioned, and sometimes to twit me good-humouredly

about my fondness for new remedies. Yet we were fully

agreed in our belief in the utility and safety of the well-

approved old ones ; against which inexperienced modern

writers have been uttering groundless denunciations.

   IBut on my part, always felt a strong desire to improve

our pharmaceutical knowledge, not only by acquisition of

new remedies, but also by more exact information of the true

modes of operation of the old, and of the best methods of

Ipreparing and combining them. And with this view found

the advantage of cultivating the acquaintance of the most

Iintelligent and advanced pharmaceutists, and feel sure that
I Iprofited much by the information which obtained from

them. Foremost among them was my friend, Mr. Peter

Squire, to whom British pharmacy is deeply indebted, not only
for his standard work, ' Companion to the British Pharmaco-

poeia,' which has gone through fifteen or sixteen editions, and

has no equal for amount and exactitude of information, but

also for the success of his work in vegetable pharmacy, par-

ticularly in improving the preparation of extracts, so as to
Ipreserve their remedial properties. When
                                           first began to
Ipractise, had little faith in vegetable extracts ; for they were

of doubtful efficacy, and all seemed much alike in their dark

treacly aspect and empyreumatic odour : very unlike the herbs

Ifrom which they were prepared. But when came to see

ISquire's extracts, preserving most of the colour, odour, and

characteristic taste of the fresh plant, began to believe in

them, and on trial proved their efficacy that of Taraxacum, for

example. 1

     1 My Father, although a parson, had a decided turn for physic ; and dande-

Ilion was one of his favourite remedies for the ailments of a sedentary life.

Among the recreations of our boyhood, might have mentioned the holidays
which were sometimes allowed us, for gathering the flowers of the dandelion.
Many basketsful were collected, and pounded in a stone trough ; the expressed

    I believe that the improvement consisted chiefly in avoid-

ing a high temperature in concentrating the extract, and pro-

moting evaporation by either diminished pressure, or more

simply by an increased current of air. A similar plan is now
adopted by most manufacturing druggists. Mr. Squire has
been also very successful in improving the taste and action of
opium, and of spirits of wine, by eliminating from them an

offensive and injurious ingredient ; and he has made several
valuable suggestions for the improvement of the processes in

the National Pharmacopoeia. I often resorted to his advice

in the choice and combination of my prescriptions with the

view to avoid incompatibility and unnecessary nauseousness.

Cito, tuto, etjiicunde, is a motto not to be neglected.

   I was very glad to see my old friend this summer enjoying
Ia green old age, yet not losing his faith in physic, albeit of a

very simple kind. When congratulated him on his health

and good looks, he told me that he takes every morning a

cup of fresh made, but weak, chamomile tea.

   IJacob Bell was another pharmaceutical friend, whom

often saw ; and in fact attended him in his long distressing
illness with laryngeal disease, of which he died. 1 He was

introduced to me by my much valued friend, Thomas Hodgkin,
on the occasion of our meeting with Sir Culling Eardley Smith,
and Dr. Conquest, to form the Syrian Aid Medical Mission,
when my friend Dr. George Whiteley, since of Cannes and
lately deceased, was sent to Beyrout as the first medical mis-
sionary. Jacob Bell was not much occupied with the details
of Pharmacy ; but he took an influential and active part in
the formation of the Pharmaceutical Society, and in conduct-
ing the Pharmaceutical Journal, both of which have done
much to elevate the knowledge of Pharmacy in this country.
He was also an enthusiastic and munificent patron of art ;

juice, was clarified by a short heating to simmering, and then strained and
bottled, with the addition of a little spirit. This was my Father's Liquor
Taraxaci of sixty years ago ; and he thought that a wineglassful in the early
morning was of great use to himself and his bilious friends. Sir James Clark
had also faith in this simple.

     1 In the earlier part of his illness, the lungs were also extensively affected :
but later the disease concentrated itself in the larynx, and the lungs became
comparatively clear, showing after death only traces of former disease, in ad-
hesions and granular indurations.

and his valuable bequests of paintings to the nation are well

known. He gave me an early proof of the Horse Fair of Kosa

Bonheur.

     His genial partner and successor Mr. T. H. Hills was an-

Iother practical pharmaceutist of whom often took counsel.

He is also one always forward in every benevolent professional
 work.

IN the year 1858, I received a visit from Mr. Jonathan Hut-

chinson, accompanied by Dr. George Johnson, Dr. G. Hilaro

Barlow, and other gentlemen, to request me to accept the

office of President of the New Sydenham Society which they

proposed to form, for the purpose of facilitating the supply of

useful medical literature, especially by translations of foreign

works, and republications of scattered papers, and of editions

out of print, at moderate cost by an annual subscription. The

original Sydenham Society had already fulfilled this object

for older writings, as those of Sydenham, Harvey, Hewson,

and others, and with a satisfactory result : but the promoters

of  that  society had  considered  their  task  fulfilled,  and  dissolved

their body. Mr. Hutchinson and his friends thought that

there was yet abundant need for a similar institution for more

modern works ; and they proposed to establish it under the
Ititle of ' The New Sydenhain Society.'
                                         fully concurred in

the opinion of these gentlemen, and could not but feel hon-

oured by their proposal to place me at the head of it. The

increasing number of interesting and important works, issuing

from the foreign press, made it most desirable that the best

of them should be translated and brought within the reach

of English readers. Germany especially was giving abundant

evidence of her industry, and was getting ahead of France

and England in scientific investigations ; yet her language

among the number.  had made many resolutions to learn

German, and tried to study the language on the occasions of

long journeys to the country, but these attempts proved abor-

Itive. was therefore quite prepared to promote the formation

of the New Sydenham Society, from which was issued the

following announcement ;

     ' The Society shall carry out its object by a succession of
publications, of which the following shall be the chief: 1. Trans-
lations of Foreign Works, Papers, and Essays of merit, to be
reproduced as early as practicable after their original issue :
2. British Works, Papers, Lectures, &c., which whilst of great value,

have become from any cause difficult to be obtained, excluding
those of living authors : 3. Annual Volumes, consisting of reports
in Abstract of the progress of different branches of Medical and

Surgical science during the year : 4. Dictionaries of Medical Biblio-

graphy and Biography.'

     The subscription was to be a guinea annually ; and the
members were to receive four or five volumes each year, ac-
cording to the number of subscribers. At the first annual
meeting this number amounted to 1,820, which in two years
increased to 3,000 ; and the society has continued to flourish

ever since.
      The Vice-Presidents first appointed included the names of

Sir Henry Holland, Dr. (since Sir T.) Watson, Mr. (since Sir
Jas.) Paget, Mr. (since Sir W.) Fergusson, Sir Charles Hast-

ings, Sir Jas. L. Bardsley, Dr. (since Sir James) Simpson,

     The Council comprised thirty-two distinguished names in

London and country.

testimony to the careful and conscientious manner in which

answer to my inquiry, lately received from my old friend, the
Secretary, its original founder and most constant supporter.

' Dear Dr. Williams,  I 15 Cavendish Square, W. : Sept. 18, 1883.
                        believe the New Sydenham Society has

now reached its 108th volume ; and it still has about 3,000

Imembers.
     ' am very glad to know that you have pleasant memories of
your labours in its formation. Your advice and help, as our first
President, were invaluable to us.

                      Believe me yours very truly.

                      JON. HUTCHINSON.'

     Besides the number of goodly volumes of the most recent
works in medical literature, the Society has issued costly

coloured plates of Skin Diseases, and other objects, Year-books

Iof Progress, and a Dictionary of Medical Terms. Nor should
   omit to mention, among the benefits resulting from this

Society, the profitable employment of the numerous deserving
writers, who have assisted, for the most part very creditably,
in translating, editing, and annotating, the several publications.

      Some years ago, the Council of the New Sydenham Society
paid me the compliment of sending me a portfolio with original
photographic portraits of the five first Presidents of the Society,
including my own, Sir Thomas Watson's, Sir James Paget's,

Dr. Stokes', of Dublin, and Mr. Hilton's. I should have been

glad to possess one also of the Secretary and Founder, as the
most completely identified with the Society.

    Dr. Chambers fell into ill health, which compelled his
              I
retirement, and soon terminated in his death, after short
                                    a
and brilliant career, in which this accomplished scholar, able
                                                          ;
physician, and noble-hearted gentleman, became valued by,

and endeared to, many.

     Sir Benjamin Brodie was ever my true and faithful friend,
and rejoiced in my success, which, he was so kind as to tell

me, he had always anticipated. We often had occasion to meet
in consultation and was indebted to his good opinion for in-

troduction to many patients, and among them, some members
of his own family. His memory was wonderful for its power
of recalling out of his vast experience, cases similar to those

under present consultation and his well-known practical

ability was grounded on good knowledge of physical and

chemical agents, guided by shrewd common sense albeit        ;
tinged with some veneration for remedies used by John Hunter
and Sir Everard Home.

Mr. Caesar Hawkins, with his amiable wife, had been

among our earliest and most intimate friends, from the time of
our first settling in Half Moon Street, where they also resided.

They afterwards removed to the house in Grosvenor Street,

formerly occupied by my old friend, Aylmer Bourke Lambert,

some time President of the Linnean Society.                  had always

the highest opinion of Csesar Hawkins' surgical judgment and

skill, and often profited by for myself and family. In the

steady careful exercise of the science and art of his profession,

he has attained to its highest eminence, and held its most

honourable dignities, and still, one of the few among my
contemporaries, survives the honoured Father of English

Surgery.

    Among the General Practitioners of the "West End fifty
years ago, none was better known or respected that Mr. H. P.

Fuller, of Piccadilly. He was one of the Visiting Apothecaries

mere inspection of drugs, he busied himself in various ways in
improving the Institution, and contributing to its support.

IThrough his exertions mainly, were funds collected, for re-

building the Hospital as it now stands. When first visited

were reedy and damp little better than swamp Yet

here John Hunter had studied to heal wounds, and Brodie had

struggled on through many sanitary difficulties.

Concerning how some of the physicians did their work,

  was told one story, but do not authenticate it. The Phy-
sician, senior, did not think necessary to see the patients
but once or twice week took seat in the board-room, and
I                                                                                                         ;:

     The spread of London had afterwards drained and over-
arched the marshy ground and then came Fuller and his

giving rest, until they had raised the funds for rebuilding and

furnishing the Hospital on its improved, but not yet perfect

scale.    was present at one of the efforts to raise the wind
a
dinner at Willis's Eooms, with the opposite neighbour of

Hyde Park Corner, the Duke of Wellington, in the chair. His

Grace spoke very briefly, but cordially, and right to the

purpose and the collection was liberal.                                1

very creditable representation of distinction due to profession above                                     a

the West End than tha,t of Mr. Fuller driving about in his white horsed dark

green chariot, out of which, letting down steps with cord, (before Broughamsa
were known), he would bustle out in his dark-blue coat with gilt buttons, buff

waistcoat, and always glove in his hand. To match, there was his excellent

Mr. Fuller's zeal for the good of St. George's Hospital was

untiring ; and he was deservedly rewarded by living to see his

son established as one of its physicians, and rising to great

usefulness and eminence in the profession. But Dr. Fuller's

career was short, for he died in the prime of life, obviously

from overwork.

Mr. Nussey, Mr. Tegart, and later, Mr. Illingworth and Mr.

IJohn Merriman, were also Visiting Apothecaries of St. George's,

with whom had much friendly and professional intercourse,

Iand attended members of their families. But they have all

passed away with many others, leaving me to marvel at the

mercy that has spared me so long.

Nussey was great at the Apothecaries' Hall, having been

repeatedly Master of the Worshipful Company. He was also

Apothecary to the Royal Household ; and was in much esteem

Iamong the upper classes of the West End.

    In consultation with him, was long in attendance on that

excellent lady the Countess of Pembroke, daughter of Count

Woronzow, and mother of the Honourable Sidney Herbert, of

the Marchioness of Ailesbury, the Countess Clanwilliam, and
Ithe Viscountess de Vesci. During many years saw much of
Ithis noble family and those connected with them.
                                                      have

expressive of satisfaction or appreciation of professional skill

and attention ; but it would hardly b^ in good taste to publish
Ithem, even assuming that they are not confidential.  have

already given expression to my feeling, that what takes place

in private practice ought to be sacred ; and that when in the

interest of science cases are published, names should never be

given without express permission.

But it is no breach of confidence to allude to the severe

trials of health, both in mind and body, which one of the

family just mentioned, Sidney Herbert, had to undergo about

this time during the fearful period of the Crimean War, for

they were known to the public, and endured in a public service ;
and I, who attended him during the early part of this time,

Ican bear witness, how he was harassed ; as had to follow

him at any hour, from Belgrave Square to the War Office,

and from the Office to the House of Commons, &c. when he

ought to have been resting in his bed. He was a most
reasonable, as well as a noble-hearted man, and in the ' weak

piping times of peace,' did, as well as gave, credit to his doctor :

but when came the strife of war and the fearful agonies of

such a war with the crushing weight of dread responsibilities,

and the shock of awful calamities befalling can it be won-

dered at, that physical endurance gave way ; and that the

j)ower of medicine could be of little avail, even had he been

able to persevere with it. So long as he continued under my

Icare, did my utmost to urge him to withdraw, from some at

least, of the burdens which were bearing him down. His

retiring from the House of Commons was one step of partial

relief, followed by temporary improvement of health. After-

wards, as he showed signs of a new disease, (of which it was
Ipresumed that could know nothing), he fell into- other hands,
I Iand did not see him again until was summoned to his
Ideath-bed at Wilton in August, 1861.
                                       shall have occasion

to advert to the noble character and achievements of this hero

of official life, in extracts from lectures on passages in the

sanitary discipline of the army to be given further on, when

another celebrated name will appear in the same history, that

of Florence Nightingale. On her return from the Crimean

IWar, this heroic lady placed herself under my care, and

had the pleasure and privilege of advising her for several

Iyears. As usual, refrain from making known any details
Iof private history ; but cannot withhold the tribute of my

admiration of her patient endurance of suffering, and her

self-forgetting devotion to thoughts for the good of others,

which persisted in spite of weakness, as they had triumphed

over the opposition and difficulties which she encountered in

the years of her activity and health.

    In September 1861, Dr. Mayo, then President of the
College of Physicians', requested me to deliver the Lumleian
282 DR. MAYO. LUMLEIAN LECTURES.

ILectures for the next year. Being very much occupied in

practice, hesitated about undertaking additional work at that

time. In a second note he urged me to comply with his re-
quest and suggested as a subject, ' An inquiry as to the rationale

of the effects of remedies ' which had been recommended for

consideration by a vote of the Fellows. ' This,' Dr. Mayo

added, ' unless modified by more caution than we are liable

to exhibit, is very likely to lead to very speculative methods

in actual practice. Modified by practical conclusions from

the experience of a man like yourself, whom no one will

venture to call empirical, these inquiries may be rendered

innocuous, and directed into right channels.'

In a few days came the following note, the third on this

subject :

' Dear Dr. Williams, There is no one, of or about your standing

at the College, (or under), who can do such justice to the Lumleiaii

ILectures as you, or who can by the method as well as by the sub-

ject matter, so benefit the College in the way which adverted to in

my last note to you. You cannot be at a loss for subject matter ;
Ibut it is in the method of treating it that want an example such
Ias you can set.
                  beg to consider you as having accepted the office.

                               ' Sincerely yours,

' Wimpole Street : Sept. 23.'                  ' T. MAYO.

I Idid accept the office, but did not see my way to adopt

the subject which he proposed. ' An inquiry as to the rationale

of the effects of remedies,' would require an experimental

Iinvestigation, such as could not undertake without a hospital,

and with so little spare time at my disposal.

The Lumleian Lectures are generally designed to treat on

therapeutics, or the art of healing in some aspect; and it

occurred to me that my large experience might supply the

material for taking stock of our attainments in the healing

art, by reviewing our successes and failures in various diseases,
extending the survey to Preventive, as well as to Curative,

Medicine. The subject will be resumed in the notice of the

delivery of the lectures in the following year, and of their

publication at a later date, when an opportunity will occur of

referring to the good deeds of the eminent individuals lately

named Lord Herbert and Miss Nightingale.
DEATH OF H.R.II. PRIXCE CONSORT.              283

Before the year closed another death occurred spreading

a gloom of sorrow through the land most deep and desolating

on our widowed Queen, bereft of the loving Partner of her

Life so wise, so talented, and so good discreet and gentle

councillor of Her Throne beloved by all. Her sorrow too

was shared, and brought a grief in every household home :

Albert the Good is gone !

   IFor my part, felt the stroke as a lesson humiliating to
Ithe pride of our profession. was entering on the momentous

subject of successes and failures in medicine, full of confidence
in the great preponderance of success ; when here came a

disastrous failure, in defiance of the most matured experience,

and the profoundest skill, with unlimited resources of wealth

and comfort. The opprobrium, if any, seemed to lie less in

the fatal issue of a disease, little controllable by art, and little

resisted by a frame, previously weakened by uncommon

anxiety and responsibility ; than in the occurrence at all of

such a disease known to take its origin only from filth and

corruption, and which might have been prevented by effective

measures of Sanitation.

At the Eoyal Medical and Chirurgical Society, a special

meeting was held to draw up a message expressive of the

dutiful and profound condolence of the Fellows of the Society

with Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen on the grievous
and irreparable loss which her Majesty and the country had
sustained in the death of His Eoyal Highness the Prince

Consort. The resolution was moved by Sir Benjamin C.

Brodie, Serjeant- Surgeon to Her Majesty, now stricken with

blindness; yet when led in, with his former animation, and

in his old style of anecdote, he recounted from his personal

knowledge, touching instances of the late Prince's intelligence
Iand kindly feeling.
                         was requested (I understood by Sir B.
IBrodie's wish) to second the motion, wrhich I did in very few

words ; because felt, as all must feel, how impossible it was

adequately to contemplate much more to express the

amount and preciousness of the loss, individual and manifold,

present and future, which Her Majesty and the country sus-

tained by this most afflictive bereavement !

IN compiling these ' Memoirs of Life and Work,' it occurs to

Ime that may fairly include Holiday Tours as belonging to

both Life and Work, but the predominance of life over work
is necessary to entitle the tour to the epithet, holiday : with
labours lighter and a life more free. We hope in a holiday
tour not merely to be in vacation, but to enjoy life in a new
and amusing way. But to those, who like myself, have to
seek refreshment of mind and body, and recruit lost strength,
it is very important to make a judicious choice in the direction

Iand management of the tours, and this was not what was

always able to do.

   During my connection with University ICollege, seldom

found time enough for a tour on the Continent ; but the
four or five weeks' holidays were usually passed at Ivy Bock
near Chepstow, with short excursions to North Wales, Scot-
land or Ireland. Of these it may be generally said that they
were too much hurried to afford much rest or enjoyment.
There was beauty and variety enough in the scenery each
country having its distinctive characters and peculiar charms

Ion which, had more space, I would delight to dwell. But

in all of them the traveller is often thwarted by the unpro-

pitious weather which predominates in these British Islands.

In Wales and in Scotland he has also to encounter hordes of

tourists, which beset the way, crowd up the inns, and tempt

the rapacity of natives, ever ready to make the most of their

harvest. In Ireland, if the travellers are fewer, the car-drivers

Iand guides are more importunate ; and for inexhaustible floods

of rain, know nothing to equal the Wicklow Mountains, and

the Lakes of Killarney, unless it be the Argyllshire Highlands

and the Isle of Skye. Of three visits of several days, to the
latter, two were spoilt by incessant rain. In a carriage drive

from Dingwall to Gairloch, by Kinlochewe and Loch Maree,

Iwe had three successive days of combined rain and sunshine

   such as never witnessed before or since the rain never

ceasing, yet the sun almost always shining.              will

   I Ihave not space to describe individual tours ; but

notice only a few passages of the most remarkable, beginning

with the earlier excursions in our own country.

    In one of our visits to North Wales, two daughters and

Imyself made the ascent of Cader Idris ; from the summit of

which made a sketch of the Snowdon range of mountains

to the north with the sea and the Isle of Man in the distance.

Columnar basaltic rocks rising around a small tarn, made a

Icharacteristic foreground. Bad weather prevented our ascent

of Snowdon : but got a good sketch of the mountain from

Capel Curig.

    In pouring rain a party, including myself, with a son and

daughter, ascended Lochnagar, in the Aberdeen Highlands.

As we neared the summit, the rain ceased : the clouds cleared

away and gave us a splendid view of the whole Cairn Gorm

range ; with patches of snow on Ben-Muich-Dhui. The Linn
of Dee, the Linn of Quoich, and especially the desolate Glen

IDerry, with its bleaching carcases of contorted pines, afforded

fine objects for sketching, which executed in neutral tint and

sepia.

     But the most striking and extraordinary scenery in Scot-
land, is that of the Isle of Skye, especially Glen Sligachan and

Ithe Cuchullin Hills, Loch Scavaig, and the Quiraing. made
286 SA' YEGLENGA RIFFEHOMDO URG.

 careful panoramic sketches of all these mountains ; which
although little above 3,000 feet in height, are so perpendicular
and rugged, as to vie in grandeur with loftier Alpine heights.

IThen the Quiraing, a group of rugged and stupendous basaltic

steeples surpassing anything of its kind that have seen
elsewhere with, by way of contrast, one, flat-levelled into a
gigantic table, with a table-cloth of bright green sward !

     In short, throughout that strange group of Western Isles,
geogenic nature seems to have indulged in the most fantastic
freaks of rocky conformation ; including Staffa and its
Fingal's Cave.

    IFrom a hill behind Eothesay, in the Isle of Bute, found a

charming view of the Isle of Arran, with its crest, the Goatfell :
in the middle ground, two lakes ; one higher, of fresh water,

on Bute land itself ; the other, lower, a land-locked patch of
sea : a nice lesson of perspective, to mark the height of each.

      Of all parts of Ireland visited, the most favourable impres-
sion was made by Glengariffe, beyond Bantry Bay, both for
beauty and scenery, and for its eligibility as a winter residence
for invalids. The mildness of its climate is evident from the

luxuriance of its myrtles, rhododendrons and other tender
shrubs. No doubt rain falls in abundance, as in all parts of
Ireland : but its propinquity to the sea, and its drier soil, render
it much less damp than Killarney and other inland parts.

      Our earlier excursions to the Continent during the holiday,
were directed to the Ehine, by the circumstance, that my wife
was recommended to resort to Hombourg for the waters, and
repeated her visits for several years. The air there is clear
and bracing, and the walks and drives in the tirwoods pleasant
enough. Not less so the early morning music in the Spa
Garden ; albeit then supported by the gambling tables of the
Cursaal. But the change was insufficient. The place was
not high enough, often too warm ; the air always too much
poisoned with tobacco smoke to be refreshing or invigorating.

I ISo gained no good until, with one or two of my sons, got

on to Switzerland, and began to climb the paths, and breathe
the air, of the mountains in all its freshness and purity. There
was hardly time to do this thoroughly without a longer holiday,
and devoting the whole time to the tour.
EFFECTS OF MOUNTAIN CLIMBING.  287

     As my occupations in London gave me little opportunity
for walking or horse exercise, not much could be accomplished

Iin this way at the commencement of each tour ; but found

the advantage of persevering within moderate limits, with the
result of gradually improving breath and strength, until at

Ithe end of the time could manage mountains up to six

or seven thousand feet without difficulty. But this was my

I Ilimit : if exceeded these heights became overtired and ill ;

and had to rest for several days to recover. The fact was

plain that I was not in vigorous health, and could bear only

moderate amounts of exertion. But the practice of those
limited efforts of hill-climbing did good, and brought the

health and bodily powers into a better condition than could

have been obtained either by rest only, or by more ordinary
kinds of exercise in a flat country.

     To make the most of a Swiss tour for the purpose of im-

proving health, I found it was best to ride or drive to the

mountains ; but up and down the mountains, to use one's

own legs as much as possible. There is always a great deal
of puffing and panting in the steeper ascents more at first,
less afterwards with breathing at the rate of 40 to 50 in the

minute, and with the necessity of frequent halts to get wind ;
but it is just these quickened and supplementary efforts of the
breathing machine, that do good, by fully inflating the air
cells, sweeping out the London smut and dust, and in
brisking the capillary circulation, to the removal of conges-
tions and obstructions, resulting from a close and sedentary
life. 1 Then there is the increased heat and perspiration, often

profuse, resulting from the arduous efforts ; these are not other-

wise than beneficial, if judiciously managed, with the proper
variation in clothing, in the chills of the mountain heights.
In making the ascent, with due consideration of the present
weather, it is well to be lightly clad, and even open one's

collar freely; but always to have ready against the chills
of the heights, and even of halting not only proper shawls

     1 Of course it is assumed that there is in the mountain climbing tourist no

serious unsoundness in heart or lungs to make the exertions hazardous. Yet
the recent experience at Davos, proves that even with small amounts of dis-
ease, and those not in an active state, regulated mountain exercise is both safe

and salutary ; but this is only under judicious superintendence.
288 EQUIPMENT. INDIA-RUBBER SHOES.

or wraps, but two or three dry silk handkerchiefs to thrust

under the body- clothes, to dry the perspiring skin.

     Being rather short of breath from disuse and being out

Iof condition, found the ascents always arduous ; but being

strong in the legs, the descents were easy and delightful ; and

Ibeing very surefooted, seldom found any too steep.
   IBut in the matter of footing, found reason to adopt a plan

of my own, which added greatly to my comfort and security in

mountain-climbing. Instead of the heavy, iron-clouted Alpine-

boots or shoes, which are not only clumsy, but fatiguing,
Iand very prone to slip on rock and glacier
                                                      wore shoes

of stout Indian rubber fabric, with soles thickened and

roughened. They may be procured at most of the India-

rubber shops. They have a light woollen lining; but for

Iwarmth found it useful to add inner cork soles, with their

usual fleecy covering. Of course they are to be worn with

thick Shetland, or well knit woollen, socks. The advantages

of these India-rubber shoes may be summed up under three

heads : 1. Their ease and lightness, never causing sore feet

or corns. 2. Their being quite waterproof, and impervious to

wet of grass, melting snow, and bog. 3. The safe footing they

afford on rocks and glaciers : where iron and hard leather

would slip, the caoutchouc clings, like a cat's paw. The only

surface on which they are apt to slip, is on a moist clay or earth

of such, the wearer must beware, with alpenstock in hand.

 It might be supposed that they would soon wear out, or

be cut to pieces by stones and rocks : but their elasticity and

toughness gives them such wonderful endurance, that they

last where iron and leather wear down and break. One pair

has generally served me for two yearly tours.

My early tours in Switzerland were with two of my sons

generally Charles, (since the Doctor) and Harry, (afterwards

Isolicitor) ; and when they were young in mountaineering, and
   could keep pace with them, we made good company, and
got on well. Thus we did the Bernese Oberland ; including
Miirren ; the Wengern Alp ; the Great and Little Scheideck ;

Kandersteg, and the Gemmi ; the Grimsel and the Glacier of

the Rhone : my sons, mostly on foot : self, more commonly

on horse or mule back. In after years, we all improved in

climbing ; but my sons soon outstripped me ; and when, at

Zermatt, I found the Eiffel and the Gorner Grat enough for

my powers, they were content with nothing short of the Cima
di Jazi or Monte Kosa.

     Another year my climbing ambition met with a lesson,
in the attempt to cross the Monte Moro from the Italian
side. One of the most lovely and striking sights in the Alps
is that of Monte Eosa at sunrise from the Ponte Grande, in
lovely Val Anzasca. Eich with festoons of fruit and foliage,
the valley lies still in the grey of dawn. At its upper end

the mountain mass is seen all white and cold ; when sud-

denly, a tinge of roseate light shines forth from its highest

peaks, to glow and spread through its vast expanse of snow,

till the whole mount reveals a lovely vision of the light
of heaven, gleaming on earthly darkness. But our ascent

was from Macugnaga, the mountain-hemmed upper end of

Val Anzasca, over the Monte Moro pass, of upwards of 9,000
Ifeet. Grand and soul-stirring as the view was,
                                                 was
Ithoroughly beaten before got down to the desolate valley of
ISaas, where was glad to go to bed in the first inn 1 came

to, at the Matt-Mark See, and required the clothes^ of three

Ibeds to make me warm. The next day, still feeling cold and

exhausted, could only walk down to Saas, to wait for my

sons, who had been making the ascent of one of the Mis-

Ichabel-Horner. They became enterprising Alpine climbers ;
and Harry joined the Alpine Club.  quite understand the

attraction of this pursuit ; but could never see the wisdom of

indulging in it too far, or of gambling with dangers to life and

limb for the sake of pleasant excitement.

     Dutiful and affectionate as my sons had been, in after

Itours found it more suitable to take my daughters, as com-

panions : they were not likely to out-walk me, for they were

not strong climbers ; but whilst they enjoyed their lower

rambles, among the flowers and ferns, I could continue the
Imoderate ascents, which found to do me so much good. It

was thus that we made, in successive years, the following
halting places, centres for excursions in the most beautiful
scenery, and all within our reach.

and the foot of the Todi. Engelberg, with the Triibsee Alp,

and the Joch-pass, under the Titlis ; Reichenbach, with Rosen -

laui, the Brunig, and the Grimsel. Seelisberg, with itskulm,

and the lake and mountains of Uri, the grandest part of Lake

Lucerne. On the opposite side, Axenstein and the Frohn Alp ;

Thusis and the Via Mala. In the Engadin, Samaden or

Silvaplana for residence, with excursions to Morteratsch

glacier, Val Roseg, Piz Languard, and the Maloya and Ber-
nina passes. In the Italian Alps, Bormio, with excursions to
Santa Caterina, La Scala, and the Stelvio pass.

     To describe all we did and saw at these places during our

Iholiday tours, would fill a large volume. But am tempted

to mention two or three other spots, on the Italian side, which

I Iare little frequented, and yet present some of the grandest
Alpine views that know.      may remark of these Italian

Alps, that they generally enjoy much finer weather than the

ISwiss Alps ; and repeatedly have been driven to them by

the ceaseless rain and cloud of the north.

us, to the music of the cattle of thousand hills,' we ascended

11,000 feet, the greatest that ever accomplished but

often crossed by travellers of both sexes. The view more

singular than beautiful, with the great white dome of the

    I do not recommend Cournaayeur, at the upper end of the
              it
Val d'Aosta, as a good place for getting views of the Mont
Blanc. You are too close under the mountains, which seem!
to be turning their backs on you ; and the Cramont, the1
mountain opposite, is not high enough, although near 9,000
feet ; and moreover very fatiguing to ascend, its turf beinge
steep and slippery, and inaccessible to horses.  ?

    I made one tour in the Pyrenees ; but not with a happy:
Iresult ; for was laid up with fever at Bagneres de Luchon for                      :
Ia month, with some doubt for a time as to the issue ; by God's
1
mercy, got through under the kind care of Drs. Lambron
and Bagnall, but did not recover from the weakness for several
months. The roads are excellent in the Pyrenees, and car-
riages and horses good but the air not bracing enough,
nor the ground generally high enough, to prove invigorating to

pedestrians.
     The mountain air in Switzerland often so exhilarated me

that found difficult to limit the language of my conversa-
tion to prose. Being constrained by my companions not to
derange the colloquial proprieties by my effusions, they found
vent in the following lines, addressed to my youngest daughter
on her return to school, after her first visit with me to

Switzerland.

          Fan, dearest can you er forget the scenes
          Of varied beauty, which in all degrees
          Of grandeur, sweetness, and sublimity,
          We traversed and enjoyed First, floating on
          Thun's azure wave, neath Niesen's towering culm,

          Next on we track Liitschinen's double stream,
          The right to rocky walls of Lauterbrun,
          Glistening with Staubacb and its echo falls,
          These from the Jungfrau, that from Miirren's heights

          The winding glaciers pour their solid flood
          Of crevassed ice, with skirt of rough moraine.
          Then on, o'er Brientz lake to Keichenbach,
          Whose foaming feath'ry sprays were on that night
          Illumed by magnesium light of many hues ; '
          A weird and fairy scene, but too theatrical
          For the wild Alps, where Nature ought to reign.

               Next day the sky was threatening ; but bright beams
           Broke through the clouds, and tempted us to mount
          For Eosenlaui's height, with Haslis vale
          Fading beneath us, whilst in front there rose,
          Looming athwart the mist, the Engelhorn,
          And Wellhorn's massive towers : but envious rain
          Now poured in torrents and disguised the view ;
          Still peered that wondrous icemount, Eosenlaui,
          Hiding in clouds its crest, the Wetterhorn :
           Yet was its ice so clear and blue, that we
          Appeared like spectres in its azure cave :
          And coming out, there seemed a sunshine bright : 2
          But no, alas! the rain was pouring still :
         So back rode Fanny, dripping down the hill.

                Next morning smiled upon us, 'twas of those
          When Nature crowns and decks herself with gems
           And vesture from her choicest wardrobe's store ;
          When an unclouded heaven pours down bright rays,
          And earth respondent mingles hers in air,
          Their dazzling softened, but yet, wearing still
          A thousand hues of varied loveliness,
          Which mark them heav'nborn, albeit tinged on earth :
           And like as with two mirrors' magic power,
           Thus heaven and earth reciprocally shine,
           Eeceive, reflect, renew, and multiply
           The ceaseless beauties of each other's face !
           And vain might search the Eye to find a spot
           Of blank, deformity, where beauty is not !
            Oh ! after storms, how such a day delights !

                On such a day we crossed the Grimsel pass :
           And how we gazed on its stupendous heights,

      1 The Falls of Eeichenbach and Giesbach are often illuminated at night
 with coloured lights.

 sunshine.

Of massive granite towering o'er our heads !

Or yawning deep in chasm beneath our path ;
As where the Aar and silver Aerlenbach

Gush down the Handeck's fall, in deaf ning roar,

And raise a cloud of iridescent spray.

Nor were the gentle charms of ferns and flowers

Wanting among the rocks, in varied form :

Straw- and blueberries too, to Fanny dear.

But as we mount in Ober Hasli Thai,

The scene grows desolate : the stunted fir

Alone survives the withering hurricane,

That howls at times athwart that savage glen,

O'er tracts of naked granite, ground and grooved
                            '
I' By                     :    so 'tis said ;
ancient  glacier  action

Yet the same grooves, saw around the sides

Of lofty cliffs, in horizontal lines,

As if from weather wearing of the rock.

There, in a vale of rocks, rugged and bare,

JStood Grimsel's Hospice ; an unsightly pile,
Welcome to strangers.     knew it too well,

To breathe its tobacco fumes, or feed its fleas ! '

So o'er the Grimsel-col we sped our way

By Todten-See name quite appropriate.

This desolation left ; now greets our view

The Mayenwand, that sunny slope of flowers,

Cleft by a steep and rugged path. Beneath,

The great Khone glacier spreads its fan-shaped flood

Of rugged ice, fed by the endless snows

Of lofty Galenstock. That milky stream,

Gushing from glacial caves and crevasses,
Is infant Rhone, rushing in rapid course

Down its long vale, swelled by the tribute flood,

Of countless rills and torrents from the heights,

Whose snowcapped tops we see in long array

To the far distance, lost in azure haze.

So near this icy cradle of the Rhone,

We slept that night, from fleas and smoking free.

     The morrow's sky looked threatening ; and the clouds,
Which gathered dark upon the mountain's brow,
Poured down their floods before we entered Viesch :

1 A former experience at the Grimsel Hospice.
294 OVER THE SIMPLON. GORGE OF GONDO.

           Malapropos ! for hence we hoped to mount
          The Eggischhorn, and view the vast expanse
          Of Aletsch glacier, and its iceberg sea.
          So disappointed, on we jogged to Brieg

        In an einspanner ; for we left our steeds

          At Oberwald.
                                    Next day at early dawn,

         In the high banquette of a diligence,
          We slowly mounted up the Simploii road :
          That wondrous work of engineering art,
         Which Titan like, seems to invade the skies.
         And as each zigzag lifted us aloft,
         Leaving the sunlit Valais far beneath
        In a faint fairy landscape ; watching still,
         We hoped to see the giant Alps beyond :
         But the great Aletsch, Jungfrau, Eiger, Monch,
         Finster-aar, Viescher-horns, all still were wrapt
         In the dark clouds that hid them yestereen.
         But we in sunshine basked ; 1 and the deep blue
          Of Italy without a fleck, in front

           Brightened our scene, and decked the graceful forms
          Of Mount Leone and the White Fletschhorn.
          Nor do the heavens thus brilliant shine in vain
          Upon ungrateful earth : for as we quit
          The northern summit, the Kaltwasser bleak,

           Passing the' Hospice, gain the southern slope,
          The greener verdure, and the flowers more bright,
          The trees more varied, and of statelier growth,
          The floating butterfly, the lizard brisk,

         All tell the balmy air of Italy.
          Yet not all soft and gentle ; as we wind
          Down to the gorge of Gondo, a deep chasm
         In adamantine cliffs of giddy height,
        In whose dark depths the struggling road is wrought
          By galleries tunnelled through the solid rock ;
         First one side, then the other; while beneath,
          Diveria's torrent roars in ceaseless strife.
          Nor is this strife from danger always free,
         For mighty storms at times have swollen the flood,
          And riven the rocks asunder, swept and crushed
           Unlucky travellers in this awful gorge.

          1 A contrast not uncommon in passing from Switzerland to Italy.

     Emerge we from it into'gentler scenes.
The cliffs, still lofty, open, and let down
The genial sunbeam on each shelf of soil,
Bedecked with flowrets, and with creepers green,
Which hang from rock to rock in festoon 'd sprays,
Sparkling with gem-like verdure mid the shade.
And see ! pours down that mighty slab of stone
A lovely waterfall not dashing down

In mad- and shapeless torrents, but in streams

Of liquid crystal gliding o'er the rock
And crossing each other in their slanting fall
Trace out a brilliant sheet of trellis-work

Like graceful pattern'd lace of pearly silk. 1
     Isella past, the scene grows richer still,

Tho' interspersed with nature's fiercer forms ;
The beetling rock, and over-hanging cliff
Eise fringed and mantled with gigantic trees -r
The spreading chestnut, and the stalwart oak,
The spicy walnut, and acacia bright ;
And many more ; while fruits in clusters hung,
Grapes, Figs, and Melons, with gigantic Gourds
In lavish bounty on each side the road.

 'Tis thus the grand and beautiful combine
In sweet Val Vedro, till it opening spreads
In the luxuriant vale of Ossola :
Italian quite ! at hand the trellised vines,
In festooned clusters overhang the walls,
Ensconced with shrines and saints in colours gay.
Beyond, the landscape rich with hill and dale,
 With villas speckt, and campaniles white,
 All blended in harmonious loveliness
 By the blue haze of soft Italian air.
 Then as we enter Domo d'Ossola,

 Antique arcades, porches, and oriels quaint,
 And walls with frescoes gay the country tell.

      That eve, (the dinner done, with luscious fruits,
 And Asti sparkling,) we strolled up a hill,

 By a paved road between the vineyard walls ;
 With divers chapels on the steep ascent,
 For rest, and prayer for pious passers by ;
 We hoped to see the sunset gild the tops

          Of some high Alps, which erewhile were in view
          With scattered snow crests : but there intervened
          The darkening violet forms of nearer hills,
          Which haste the twilight shades. So soon the vale
           Changes its lively tints for evening gloom,
           Broken hy glimmering lamps : while vesper bells
         Blend their tones softened with the teeming thrill
          Of grasshoppers, which fills the air around.

VlEW OF THE VAL D'AOSTA FROM THE COL D'lON,

                              AFTER A STORM.

Crossing from Val de Lys to Val d'Aoste,
Two lofty ridges must be scaled : the first
The Eanzola, was wrapt in darkening clouds,
Which welcomed us with rain and biting hail !
Brussone past, the Col d'lon was reached
In brilliant sunshine ; and the scene that burst

On our enchanted sight, transcends the power
Of pen or pencil to portray its beauty !
The height was moderate ; 7,000 feet :
But 'neath us lay, far as the eye could reach
The lovely Val d'Aosta, vale of the sun !

For richness, Eden's garden, stored with flowers
And fruits and trees by Nature's lavish hand :
But now by distance blent in azure hues,
Like some vast lake of lapis lazuli,

Fainter as further on the eye surveys,
Until it melts in the blue vault of heaven !

On either side gigantic mountains rise

In long array, and ever varying form ;
Their tint a sapphire blue, but on their limbs
And wreathing their snowy summits, still there hang
The relics of the storm, bright fleecy clouds,
Erewhile so dark, but now surpassing snow
In dazzling brilliancy ; as if to atone
For the dark veiling gloom they caused before.

IIN 1862 delivered the Lumleian Lectures at the College of

Physicians on the subject already mentioned, Successes and
Failures in Medicine. This was chosen not merely to illus-
trate from the results of individual experience what the healing
art had done, and what it had failed to do ; but also to direct
attention to the causes of failure, and the grounds of success.

IWith this view, endeavoured to represent in a tabular form

the chief Causes of Failure of Medicine, and in another table,
epitomising the Objects of Medicine, to indicate the means by
which these failures are to be avoided, and success in various
degrees to be attained. Such a subject, to be treated syste-
matically, would extend far beyond the limits of three
Lectures : but it was hoped that by Sketches, such an outline
 might be given as would prove more accurate and instructive,
 than the vague notions prevalent on these matters, not only
 among the public but in the profession. No authentic report
 of these Lectures was published until 1871, when they appeared
UNCERTAINTY OF MEDICINE.  299

in the ' Medical Times and Gazette ' with additional notes

up to that date.

    From these I here insert extracts, which relate chiefly to the

Successes and Failures of Preventive Medicine ; matters inte-

resting and intelligible to the public as well as to the profession.
Sketches of Success and Failure in Curative Medicine, drawn

Ichiefly from my own practice, propose to reserve for a second

volume, to be devoted to more strictly professional subjects.

        SKETCHES OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE IN MEDICINE.

     To one long engaged in the practice of Medicine, there are few
conclusions more striking than the general one of the uncertainty
of the art. His whole career seems to be made up of a series of

failures and successes. He may deem himself fortunate if the
successes preponderate over the failures, or, at least, if by their

magnitude and prominence, they throw these latter into the shade.
Of course, much may be said of the imperfections and shortcom-
ings of the art ; and more still may be urged on the intractability

of disease, and the inevitability of death. It is not to be supposed

that we are to make our patients immortal. But it is not unrea-
sonable on the part of the public to expect us to say what we
can cure, and what we cannot cure, and to look for results
more or less in accordance with our predictions ; and it is equally
reasonable on our part to point out that although in many instances
we can fulfil these expectations, yet in others the powers of health
and disease of life and death may be so nicely balanced, that it is
impossible to predict the result with any certainty. And this can-
did avowal of failure in our prognostic powers is more safe and more
honest than bold guesses at the result, which may be denounced
as sheer gambling with the chances of life and death.

    In truth, the fair appreciation of success and failure in Medicine
will depend much on the intelligence of the community. No
doubt, of late years, the public mind has become more enlightened,

and can distinguish between organic and functional disease, and
will not expect great achievements in the former, where structure
and mechanism are extensively injured. But neither the public
nor the professional mind is always alive to the equal impotence of
Medicine, in those terrible disorders in which a noxious ferment,

brewing in the living blood, converts its life-giving stream into a
channel of deadly poison, which arrests and perverts the functions,
and reduces the whole body to a mass of corruption.

     This table brings before us a classification of the chief causes
of failure in Medicine. The first class includes those already
noticed, in which the amount or the intensity of the disease exceeds
the powers of nature and art to overcome it ; and the consideration
of this limit to our art may well keep us humble. But, that we

may be heedful as well as humble, the table warns us that failure
may arise also from errors on our own part, in diagnosis, prognosis,
and in treatment. Such errors, although more or less the common

lot of humanity, are to be held up as avoidable ; and it is our obvious
duty to watch and guard against them with all possible vigilance

and energy.
     Now, in order to avoid as much as possible these causes of

failure, and to aim at achieving the greatest attainable amount of
success, it may be profitable to go back to Principles, and survey in
the abstract the chief OBJECTS OF MEDICINE. In the fulfilment of

these, are comprehended the elements of success ; and we may hope-
fully and profitably comment on this side of the picture for our

encouragement.

ciation of the true nature of disease, and of its relation to the
health-force of the body are of the highest importance to the
302 CURE AND PREVENTION.

scientific Physician, inasmuch as they are generally fundamental
to his success in the final object, the treatment of disease. Dia-
gnosis is not the mere detection of disease as a name, or a distinct
entity ; it is such a knowledge as enables one to discern disease in
all its characters and bearings, in relation to other diseases, and in
relation to the powers of health remaining in the body. Such a
knowledge, combined with that supplied from past experience of
similar cases, will furnish us with the surest means of prognosti-
cating the result ; and further, conjoined with a due acquaintance
with the powers of remedial agents, will prove the means of
attaining to the grand final object, the cure of disease.

      So, too, prognosis does not consist in a mere empirical obser-
vation of good and bad signs, such as any experienced nurse or
shrewd attendant, however ignorant, might exercise with some

rude semblance of success. Scientific prognosis is to be founded
on a careful valuation and calculation of the relative powers of
disease and of health in the system, and, by the light of past

experience, estimating and striking the balance between them. It

is by such a rational and circumspect procedure, that we may hope

to escape those errors in prognosis and diagnosis, which we have
classed among the causes of failure in Medicine.

     Proceeding next to the final objects of Medicine, obviously the

greatest are the COMPLETE CUBE AND ENTIBE PREVENTION OF
DISEASE, the substitution of life and health, for disease and death.
To accomplish these is to achieve the GRANDEST SUCCESSES of oiir
art. To restore a person from an extreme of suffering and weak-
ness, from frightful disorders of body and mind, from a dangerous
struggle with death itself, to a state of ease, health, and strength,
is indeed the best work of the Physician. But he must expect
often to divide the credit with nature, or the sound constitution of
the patient ; and it surely is not less creditable to his sagacity and

prudence, if his interference consists mainly in watching for, and

promoting, the health-restoring processes of nature, rather than in
a random exhibition of empirical remedies. These GREAT SUC-
CESSES may be looked for in cases of acute disease, fevers, inflam-
mations, and in a large proportion of functional disorders; and they
are the more signal, the more intense and aggravated the disease

has been.
     Such cases are, however, more commonly within the scope of

the ordinary family Practitioner than of London Physicians.
These, especially the consulting class, have hardly a fair share of
curable cases. They are rarely called in till danger is imminent,
too often not till hope is past, and disease triumphant ; and if they

now and then do get the credit of rescuing a case from impending

death, more frequently they have the melancholy office of endorsing
a death-warrant, sometimes reserving in their own breasts the
secret regret that they had been called in too late. But there is
also a secret success that will now and then gladden the heart of

the consulting Physician, and give him the inward satisfaction of
doing good, although he would fain conceal it from public notice.

It is where Medicine has hitherto failed through error in diagnosis

or treatment (see table of failures), and it is not too late to retrieve
the error. The Physician confidentially instructs the previous

attendant, alters the treatment, and thereby transfers the case from

the list of failures to that of successes.

    It cannot be questioned that the prevention of disease deserves

to take rank among the NOBLEST AIMS OF MEDICINE, and we may

well award the HIGHEST GRADE OF SUCCESS to the signal manner

in which the mortality, in certain localities and in certain classes

of persons, has been reduced by proper attention to the dictates of

sanitary science. The lives thus to be saved may be counted by

hundreds and by thousands. Yet how little of individual gratitude

does the sanitarian reap from all his beneficent labours ! If he,

who showed how to draw lightning from the clouds and send it

harmless to the earth, was hailed as a public benefactor, not less

should those who point out how to stop the risings of the noisome

pestilence, whether in the air we breathe, in the water we drink, or

in the ground we tread, or to render it comparatively harmless by
Iprocesses of cleanliness, ventilation, or purification.
                                                          lately had

occasion to advert to malignant small-pox, as one of the terrible

forms, in which a death-plague defies the power of art. Honour,

then, to the man who found the way to stay that plague ; who
discovered that the seeds of this very malady, by being transplanted

to another soil, might be so mitigated, without destroying their

identity as to produce a trivial and harmless degree of the same

disease, which should yet prove a protection against the invasion of

the malignant forms ! This PREVENTIVE SUCCESS is, indeed, a

triumph of our art perhaps the greatest that it has ever achieved.

     Does not, then, the DISCOVERER OF VACCINATION well merit a

foremost place of honour ? And if we raise in our public forum to

the gaze of the admiring multitude, statues of the heroes of a hun-

dred battles, whose good deeds and glories great as they undoubt-

edly are have been achieved through the horrible scenes of the

battle-field, amid bloodshed and death, suffering and slaughter,

lamentation and woe, shall we banish into obscurity the image of
304 PREVENTIVE SUCCESSES IN BRITISH ARMY.

OUR IMMORTAL JENNER, 1 whose priceless discovery whose bloodless
victory over disease has been the means of SAVING MORE LIVES
than all that were sacrificed, and of PREVENTING MORE MISERY
than all that was perpetrated, in the battles of Napoleon, Nelson,
and Wellington ? To displace the statue of such a BENEFACTOR OF
MANKIND is an outrage on humanity and a disgrace to an enlight-
ened age ; but, alack ! it is too much in keeping with the ignorant
and senseless caprices of many of a so-called upper class, who
pretend to set up the monstrous absurdities of homoeopathy and
mesmerism, in opposition to the facts and reasonings of science !

      Another example of SIGNAL SUCCESS IN THE PREVENTION OF
DISEASE AND. DEATH, may be found in the statistical returns of the

British army during the last ten years. The writings of Sir John
Pringle and others had directed the public attention, a century ago,

to the necessity of sanitary regulations for the preservation and
efficiency of the lives of soldiers and sailors men thrown together
in large numbers under circumstances in various ways trying to the
health; and the well-known fact that the history of our armies
generally comprised also the history of various pestilences, which
they carry in their train, could not be disputed. Those best
acquainted with the details of past sieges and campaigns knew also
that the ravages made by these foes within the camp were, often
tenfold nay, more than a hundredfold greater than those inflicted
by the arms of the enemy.

     But the destructiveness, not merely of war but of military life
during peace also was never fully felt, until made known by the
searching statistical records, first devised by Sir James MacGrigor,
afterwards digested into reports, by Dr. Graham Balfour and
Lieutenant (now Major-General Sir A.) Tulloch, and finally ex-
tended and completed by the Eoyal Commission of 1857, of which
Lord Herbert was president. Who could have supposed that the
annual mortality of the army in this country in time of peace was
more than double that of the general male population of the same
age? and, still more, that the Footguards, consisting of picked
men, selected for their healthiness and robustness, should annually
die off at the rate of 20*4 per thousand, whilst the ordinary mortality
does not exceed 9'8 ? Yet these were disgraceful facts, arising
from official carelessness and ignorance through a series of years,
until hundreds and thousands of valuable lives were sacrificed, an

       CRIMEAN HORRORS. CONSEQUENT REFORMS. 305

incalculable amount of public money wasted, and a stigma of
obloquy was cast on a noble branch of the national service. In vain
did many of the more intelligent and enlightened Medical officers

endeavour to make their representations at head- quarters, why such

mortality occurred, and how it could be prevented. In such appeals

to those in authority they generally only got snubbed, and were told
to hold their tongues and mind their own business !

    If such were the fatal results of the criminal indifference and

ignorance of the governing classes during peace, can we wonder at
the harvest of disaster, disease, and death, which resulted in the
trying times of war? The horrors of the Crimean campaign are
still fresh in our memories. And who is there among us that has

not heard of the prominent features of that eventful period which
bear 011 our present subject? of the unheeded warnings of the

Director- General and other experienced Medical men ? of the hasty
equipment of the expeditionary force, and its foretaste of suffering
from the neglect of sanitary precautions on the voyage, and in the
camp before Varna? of the inadequacy of the supplies for the sick
and wounded at Alma? of the perils and privations of Balaklava,

aggravated as they were by desolating storms, intense cold, and still
more by the blundering of officials, through which the troops were
kept without food and clothing, and were consequently soon deci-
mated by starvation aaid disease ? of the further ravages of zymotic
pestilence in the Crimea and at Scutari, from almost total want of
proper sanitary arrangements on board the transports, in the camps,
and in the Hospitals ?

     The amount of mortality from disease alone was something
appalling during the first seven months of the Crimean campaign,
rising to the rate of 60 per cent, per annum of the whole army a
mortality greater than that of the great plague of London in its
population ! And observe, all this awful sacrifice of life was from

preventible ca^lses, as you may judge from the sequel, which will
serve us as a present illustration of the successes of Medicine.

     During the last five months of the Crimean campaign the
mortality among the troops did not exceed 11 '5 per thousand per
annum, which is considerably below the average mortality of the
army at home in time of peace. And that this remarkable
improvement was really due to better management, and not to in-
creased healthiness of the climate, is obvious, from the fact that at
this very period in the contiguous French army, fever and other
zymotic diseases were still making fearful ravages.

     The reform thus accomplished at last, was brought about
through much tribulation. The British nation was aroused to

sympathy and indignation at the sufferings and destruction of its
army, denounced by one of the Ministers in the Government, as
' horrible and heartrending.' The public, through the agency of
the ' Times Commissioner,' vied with the now earnest and lavish
War Minister, in sending abundant supplies to the Hospitals and to
the camp, where the more enlightened Medical officers, now freed
from the trammels of red tape and official obstructiveness, and aided

and strengthened by able special commissioners, 1 were carrying on
their sanitary measures with the vigilant superintendence of that
guardian angel of the British army, Miss Nightingale, with her
band of devoted assistants. Thus was the residue of the army
saved, and the reinforcements sent out were preserved in health

and efficiency. So prosperously ended the Crimean campaign.
     But where was the security that the lesson thus taught would

be remembered any more than those to be learnt from former
wars, which had to struggle through similar disasters those of
Walcheren and the Peninsula, for example ? There was none ; and

if no further change had been made in the system, in all probability

the results of experience and the dictates of science and common
sense would have soon been set aside by the spirit of official
obstinacy and military arrogance which would surely prevail in the
War Department as hitherto administered.

     But, thanks to Sidney Herbert's Eoyal Commission of 1857, 2 a
change was made in the system the administration of the army
has been put on such a footing as to secure a constant attention to
sanitary matters in future ; and the short period which has since
elapsed enables me to record such satisfactory results, both in peace
and war, as to fully entitle them to a foremost place among the
SUCCESSES OF MEDICINE.

     Thus, during the last three years, since the reformed system
has been in operation, the annual mortality of the Footguards at
home has been reduced from 20 to 9 in 1,000, and that of the
infantry of the line from 17*9 to 8*5, and even so low as 5 in

Aldershot and Shorncliffe.

     1 Two commissions were sent out to the Crimean army at this date one
respecting supplies for troops and sick, presided over by Sir John MacNeil : the
other under Dr. Sutherland, for carrying out sanitary improvements in the
hospitals and camps of Scutari and before Sebastopol.

     - The members of this Koyal Commission were the Bight Hon. Sidney
Herbert, M.P. ; Augustus Stafford, M.P. ; Major-General Sir H. Storks ; Dr.

Andrew Smith, Director-General ; Mr. Alexander ; Sir J. Phillips ; Sir Ranald

Martin ; and Dr. Sutherland. After the lloyal Commission issued its report,
several commissions were appointed to give practical effect to its recommenda-
tions.
SUCCESSES FOUNDED ON MEDICAL SCIENCE. 307

   IAnd in proof of the success in war, will quote a passage from

one of Miss Nightingale's summaries : ' The crowning testimony

of the great national importance of the new system of sanitary ad-

ministration inaugurated by Lord Herbert, is to be found in the last

Chinese expedition, when his reforms were first practically tested.

An expeditionary force was sent to the opposite side of the world,

into a hostile country, notorious for its epidemic diseases. Every

required arrangement for the preservation of health was made, and

with the result that the mortality of this                        force, including              twheou"ndceodn,-

and one of the finest and most healthy in the British service, was

        claim for Medical science the chief credit in supplying the

foundation for these successes ; and had the voices of the more

enlightened and intelligent Medical officers of the army been

listened to long ago, much good might have been done, and much

evil averted sooner. But, as before said, these voices were silenced

by military despotism and official indifference ; and it was not until,

strengthened and re-echoed by new and awful experience, they

reached the ears, touched the heart, and convinced the understand-

ing, of one high in rank and authority, that they became strong

enough to bear down the opposition and obstruction that beset

them on every side. Lord Herbert had already considerable

experience in War-Office administration, when the disasters of the

Crimea occurred and opened his eyes to its utter inefficiency. From

that time forward, both in office and out of office, in public and in

private, he devoted his whole life and best energies to the ex-

amination of the details of every department, to searching out all

defects, and to finding and providing adequate remedies. At the

head of that before-named Royal Commission of 1857, supported by

competent Medical and other advisers conversant with the various

subjects to be examined, he summoned the most eminent or best-

informed witnesses, and in replies to upwards of ten thousand

questions, with voluminous appendices, was amassed an enormous

amount of information on all connected topics ; the results of which

were embodied in a most masterly report, concluding with a series

of practical recommendations, which have since been in great

measure adopted and carried out with a success exceeding the

highest expectations. Prominent among these recommendations was

that to place the Medical officers on a proper footing as guardians of
the health of the army, to be consulted and deferred to for the pre-
vention as well as for the cure of disease ; and thus for the first time
the Medical service became a power in the army, efficient and
successful in some proportion to its dignity and deserts.

     This great work Sidney Herbert conscientiously and nobly ac-
complished ; but, alas ! at the sacrifice of his health and life.

    Note added in 1871. Another great loss, which occurred about
the same time, was that of Mr. Alexander, the Director- General,
who, with great personal labour, first brought the new sanitary
regulations into operation. Happily Lord Herbert's successors, in
conjunction with Dr. Sutherland and other surviving members of
the Barrack and Hospital Improvement Commission, have continued

the arrangements under the authority of the present Army Sanitary
Commission, which comprises representatives of the War Office,
Eoyal Engineers, Office of Works, Local Government Act Office,
and India Office, together with the Army Medical Department.

     The most important field of operation of this Sanitary Com-
mission at present is in India, where it was introduced under the
direction of Lord Stanley, now Earl of Derby. Here it has already
begun to achieve great successes in the prevention of disease, and
bids fair to accomplish still greater triumphs hereafter. An annual
report of the measures adopted is now published by the India
Board ; and the following extract from the last report will serve as a

sample of what may be done.

    ' In the year 1857 Sir Eanald Martin addressed two letters to the

Chairman of the Court of Directors, recommending that all British
soldiers, available from the duties of the plains, should be per-
manently cantoned in the hill regions of the country, to diminish
the high mortality then prevalent among themamounting during
fifty-six years of this century to 69 per 1,000 per annum. In a
letter dated March 27, 1870, alluding to the adoption of Sir E.
Martin's recommendation, Dr. Cuningham states that Dr. Bryden
had sent in a table showing the results for working parties in the
hills during the past seven years. 1 The result is that the death-
rate per annum is only just over 4 per 1,000. That the removal
to the hill ranges, everywhere to be found throughout India, should
reduce the death-rate from 09 to 4 per 1,000 is, indeed, a most

patent and wonderful fact. It is the greatest triumph ever achieved

    1 It may, however, be questioned whether the greater salubrity of ' working
parties ' may not be in some measure due to their exercise in the open air as

well as to the altitude.

over the external causes of disease everywhere prevalent in the plains
of Hindostan.' Report, &c., p. 5.

     But there was one other chief agent in the commencement and

Icompletion of the great and successful work, (of the Crimean

campaign), whose name cannot pass over, although, being neither
Medical, military, nor even masculine, her share in the matter is
little known or even suspected.

    In all that relates to nursing and providing for the sick army in
the East, the name of Florence Nightingale is as a household word ;
suggestive of devotion so noble, of self sacrifice so chivalrous, that
it might seem romantic if it had not been so substantial and
practical in its beneficence. But the army and the country owe to
Miss Nightingale much more than the devoting of years of day and
night toil in watching, nursing, and superintending in the Hospitals
and camps of Scutari and the Crimea. With a vigilance untiring, a
rare intelligence, and a memory never failing, this gifted lady saw
and comprehended all the multitudinous wants and requirements
of the army, in Hospital, in camp, and in barrack ; in war and in
peace, in sickness and in health. She noted the complete failure of

the existing system of administration, and how much was necessary
to reform it in every department. At the end of the campaign in
185G, when Miss Nightingale returned home with weakened frame
and broken health, her Queen and her country were ready to
welcome her back to honour and to repose.

     But no, Miss Nightingale had a further mission to fulfil ; and
instead of accepting titles or honours for herself, the boon which
she asked was for the issue of that Eoyal Commission, with Sidney
Herbert at its head, which has been the means of bringing about
those reforms which she knew to be so much needed. Instead of
seeking her own ease and rest after labours almost superhuman, she
ceased not to work on for this end, by taking a chief part in suggest-
ing the course of the inquiries, and in obtaining the requisite
evidence, in ways and to an extent which her vast experience and
knowledge enabled her alone to do.

     Well, therefore, may we rank the name of Florence Nightingale
with that of Sidney Herbert, foremost among the authors of the
great sanitary regeneration of the British army, which has now
made beyond comparison, the best-provided and the healthiest
army in the world.

     Note added in 1871. Miss Nightingale's labours did not cease

suffering and failing strength, numerous proofs of her superior in-
telligence and experience may be found in the workings and reports
of various Government Commissions and public institutions con-
nected with the army, Hospitals, and sanitary science. Even in the
last Annual Keport of the Progress of Sanitary Measures in India,
Miss Nightingale's words of criticism, direction, and encouragement
are deservedly brought forward as those of the highest authority
and importance.

IN 1862, our eldest daughter, Sophia Janet, was married to
the Rev. S. Christopher Morgan, eldest son of the Rev.
Samuel Morgan, Vicar of Chepstow. This happy union has
been since blessed with six children, three sons and three
daughters, the eldest of whom is now 20 years of age. After
holding a curacy for a short time in Gloucestershire, my son-
in-law has been Vicar, successively, of Aldershot, of Christ
Church, Greenwich, of Roxeth, Harrow, and of Swansea,

S. Wales. The last important and responsible charge, he
has now held seven years ; and he has taken his degree of
Doctor of Divinity.

     These Memoirs are not intended to include details of
Family matters, but a brief notice of the history of my other
children, will not be irrelevant to that of my own Life.

     My eldest son, after a varied course of private tuition in
Germany and Geneva, studied for Civil Engineering at King's
College, London, and was articled to Mr. H. Conybeare of
Abingdon Street, Westminster : (Burkenshaw and Conybeare).
After fulfilling the term of pupillage, he was employed by the
312 HISTORY OF CHILDREN.

same engineer in the construction of railways in Ireland and
Wales. Unhappily he fell into ill health which entirely dis-
abled him from active employment, and terminated fatally in
November, 1882.

     My second son, Charles Theodore, after taking his degree
in arts at Oxford, studied Medicine at St. George's Hospital
and in Paris. He then took his Doctor's degree at Oxford and

became Member of the Koyal College of Physicians, London.
Showing some signs of delicacy of the chest, he passed two
winters in the South of France and Italy, and there per-
sonally acquired the local knowledge which supplied the
materials of his first little book on Climate, published in
1857.~ This residence in the South, with other measures,
was happily quite successful in re-establishing his health, and
he has continued to reside and practise in London ever since.

     My third son, Harry Samuel, during part of his time at
Cambridge, resided at the Observatory with Professor Challis.
In 1861 he was elected scholar of St. John's College, and in
1862 graduated as 22nd Wrangler. He afterwards entered

the office of Messrs. Capron & Co., solicitors, of Savile Place,
 (in which a son of my old friend, Dr. Brabant, was a partner),
and in due time he practised as solicitor ; during several years

in amicable partnership with my old patient and friend, Mr.
Owen Alger of Bedford Eow.

      My fourth son, Arthur David, evinced a great desire to go
into the Eoyal Navy, but, although well instructed by Dr.

Burney, he failed to satisfy one of the examiners who re-
quired him to go through the multiplication table in French.
Through the kindness of a friend he got an appointment as
midshipman in the Indian Navy, in which he served two or
three years and had some adventures with piratical tribes in
the Indian seas. Finding his health beginning to suffer, he
 gave up the service, returned to London, and entered the
 office of Messrs. Liddell & Gordon, Civil Engineers, and
attached himself to that line of business, in which he has

 continued ever since.
      My youngest son, Ernest Jenkins, suffered early from

 severe catarrhal attacks, complicated with asthma, and some-

times inflammatory earache, which he thought were aggravated

by cold at one of the schools at which he was pursuing his
education. He was afterwards placed under the private

tuition of the Rev. C. F. Childe, of Holbrook (formerly my

patient), where he was carefully treated and taught. But
the ear attacks ended in deafness, which all the kindness and
skill of my excellent friends Toynbee, Hinton, and Dolby, suc-

cessively, failed to remove. One winter he passed at Hyeres
with my good friend and old patient (arrested phthisis), Dr.
G. Griffith, with much benefit to his asthmatic affection.
The state of his health interfering with all close application,
he devoted himself much to Natural History, and passed a year
at the Eoyal Agricultural College at Cirencester, in the study

of Scientific Farming. In 1866 he emigrated to Buenos
Ayres, and passed two years in the prairies of the Argentine
States, wholly occupied in superintending cattle farms, riding
wild horses, catching them with the lasso, and other adven-

turous and invigorating pursuits. He returned much im-
proved in general health and strength; but very little in
hearing. Soon after he took a small farm in Shropshire;
and succeeded wonderfully in the management of it : but in
two or three years his health again began to suffer so much

from the climate, that he was obliged to give up the farm,
and again go abroad. This he did in a voyage to Teneriffe

and the Cape of Good Hope, where he bought a horse and

rode through South Africa to Natal, where he passed several
months in vigorous health. Returning to this country, he
suffered still in bad weather, but much less than formerly.
A winter passed in Egypt with his youngest sister ; and
sometimes accompanying his mother in her visits to the
south of France, have contributed to raise his condition above

that of an habitual invalid.

     Our two youngest daughters, Harriett Amelia, and Fanny
Catharine, in their early years were educated at home, with
the aid of several governesses in succession, English, French,
and German. But their education was chiefly carried on

and completed at the well-known and highly valued school of
Mrs. Umphelby at Belstead, near Ipswich, where they re-

mained many years. More recently two of my granddaugh-
ters have had the advantages of the judicious training of

the same estimable lady. After my daughters leaving school,

Ias may be anticipated, took good care that they should

have further good instruction in drawing, for which they both
had remarkable talents. They proved very successful, and
became excellent artists ; Amelia in landscapes ; Fanny in
flowers. The latter (whom we have since lost) was also very
musical, with a powerful voice (mezzo-soprano, including

Icontralto notes) ; and her mother secured for her lessons

being well taught in riding, (with a very successful result) as

conducive to health as well as to enjoyment. (It is still the

favourite exercise of my surviving daughter, who mounts her
beautiful chestnut Arab on every possible opportunity, some-
times still accompanied by her aged Father.)

     Both our daughters were delicate in health, and at times
caused us much anxiety. They both suffered but in different
ways from the cold of the English climate ; and in subse-

Iquent winters deemed it prudent to send them abroad with

their mother, who had already found it necessary to avoid
the cold and damp of this country.

noises in the ears and head, and sometimes confusion of

and a feeling of nervousness and depression, which was not

Inatural. For many at least twenty years, was constantly

worried more or less with tinnitus all sorts of noises in the
left ear, the hearing of which was never so good as that of
the other : and these noises were always greatly increased
under the circumstances of mental fatigue or bodily ex-
haustion ; and diminished by rest and by moderate exercise
in the open air. In the latter part of each holiday excursion,

and for a month or two after, I was most free from them.

I generally disregarded these symptoms, unless very severe ;

election, that they would have voted for me, had they known

that my name would be proposed.

   I had been still more decided in declining the proposal

Iwhich had been made to me some years previously by some

of the graduates of the University of London, that should be

put in nomination for the representation of that University in

Parliament. The position and duties of a Member of Parlia-

ment would have been quite incompatible with my necessary

occupations. Being then asked to recommend an eligible

Icandidate belonging to our profession, named Sir Charles

Locock, as a competent man ; of liberal politics, and no

longer embarrassed with the claims of practice, as he had
Iretired with a large fortune.
                                gave these gentlemen a letter

of introduction to Sir Charles ; he entered into negotiation

with them, and was declared a candidate, but further arrange-

ments prevented his election.

    It is much to be regretted that the Medical Profession is

not more adequately represented in Parliament. What is
needed is not merely the presence in the House of one or

more members who are or have been medical men, and who

may occasionally and irregularly speak on subjects connected
with the Profession ; but one, well acquainted with the past
history and present state of the medical institutions of the

country, and who is sufficiently known and respected, to

possess the confidence of a large portion, if not a majority,
of the members of the Profession. Such a representative,
always well informed and accurate in his subject, and speaking
with corresponding decision and a certain amount of self-

assertion, would always command the attention of the House,

and become somewhat of a power in the State. The only
M.P. who seems to me to have ever attained to anything like

this position was the late Thomas Wakley. The early part of

his career, as a censorious and radical journalist, was very

different from that of his later years as a very popular

member of Parliament and coroner for the Metropolitan

county. The journal, which he created, and which made

Jtiin, in spite of its early ribaldries and abusive personalities',

was interwoven with a web of truth and justice which gave

strength to its attacks and gained the attention and support

of the public ; notwithstanding the bitter opposition and per-

Isecution from old corporations and long-established monopolies
brought in array against it.  suppose it is the common lot

of radical reformers, who go to the very roots of the evils

which they seek to eradicate, to get some contamination of

language and spirit from the foulness and corruption of the

dirty soil into which they penetrate. At all events it is very

hard for human nature to be set to discover and denounce the

delinquencies and abuses of its fellows, without being tempted

into censoriousness of spirit and violence of language, which

render the work of reform the reverse of gentle or peaceful.

   IWhen first came to London, the ' Lancet ' was already a

power, which had made itself felt : relished by the profession

at large, which has rather a democratic taste, and hailed as

champion of their rights, received with curious interest by

the public, which is alive to anything strong or sensational :

but by the aristocracy of the Profession, including the accused

Hospital authorities and Corporations branded as malignant

and revolutionary ; and to be opposed in every possible way,

private and public. To be suspected of connection with the

' Lancet,' was to be tabooed by societies and respectable

bodies ; and woe to the student going in for examinations, if

he were supposed to have supplied it with reports ! Neverthe-

less the Journal continued to increase in circulation ; and no

wonder ; for over and above the censorious and scurrilous

matter, which served for sauce, it supplied useful food for the

minds of its readers, in copious medical news and reports of

lectures. Wakley showed his ability as an editor, not only in

his own slashing and incisive articles in which he attacked
318 WAKLEY'S PARLIAMENTARY POPULARITY.

abuses and held up to ridicule and condemnation the in-

efficiency and neglect of institutions and of their officers, but
also in his gathering around him a staff of really clever and

well-informed men, who could supply to his pages the most

recent knowledge, and guide his councils by the scientific

spirit of progress, required by the forward movements of the

times.

   IAt St. George's Hospital was in the anti-' Lancet ' camp,
Iand was strongly prejudiced against that journal. In fact

never read it ; and all my support and contributions were be-

spoken by Dr. Macleod, physician of the Hospital, in behalf of
the 'London Medical Gazette,' which he edited, and which was

said to have been started in opposition to the ' Lancet.' At

IUniversity College, Mr. Wakley's sons were my pupils, and
soon began to receive from him marks of courtesy and confi-

dence. He placed several members of his family under my

care, and he recommended a number of patients to consult me.

Among these were several Members of Parliament. They
familiarly called him 'Tom Wakley,' and all testified how

Imuch he was liked and respected in the House by all parties.

Of these Parliamentary friends recollect particularly Thomas

Slingsby Duncombe, his colleague for Finsbury ; the Hon.
Henry FitzEoy, Mr. Speaker Denison (since Lord Ossington),
and the Eight Hon. Dr. Lushington.

Mr. T. S. Duncombe, (who also was familiarly known as

' Tom Duncombe ') was a great sufferer from habitual asthma

Iexacerbations. He was an able man and had been a power-
ful popular orator.  set him up for a time, and he was able

to resume Parliamentary duties. But in an English climate

there was no chance of escape from relapses, and he would
not go abroad. He struggled on for a few years, and before

his death fell into the hands of quacks.

    The Hon. Henry FitzEoy (son of Lord Southampton),
although he had mitral valvular disease of the heart, became

so much better after treatment, that he was able to work

efficiently as Under Home Secretary several years under Lord

Palmerston. He introduced the Sixpence-a-mile Cab Act, and

other useful legislative measures; but fell a victim to his

official zeal in superintending the drainage of the Serpentine.

IHe caught intermittent fever ; and when went to see him at
IBrighton, found him dying. The damaged heart, although

it failed not under the trials of light ordinary work, could not

rally from the depressing power of the malarious poison.

   I attended Mr. Denison, the Speaker, several years, and

also his brother the Bishop of Salisbury. Their nephew, Lord

Albert Conyngham (afterwards Lord Londesborough), was
also long my patient. A son of Dr. Lushington made a

wonderful recovery from a very long illness from deep-seated

abscess of the lung.
   Although I had
                      these repeated proofs   of Mr. Wakley's
goodwill towards me,                         personally, till he

was agreeably surprised with the gentleness and geniality of

his manners, and the homely simplicity of his conversation.

His ill-health had impaired the vigour of his expression ; but

there was an earnestness in his look, with an occasional twinkle

of his eye, showing forth the workings of energy and of

humour in his nature. The hopeful courage and self-confi-

dence, which had borne him up through life against any

amount of opposition and difficulty, did not forsake him in
Ithe danger which now threatened him.
                                             have not the notes
Iof his case by me ; but so far as can recollect, it was one of

inflammatory origin, rather than of tuberculous consumption :

but it certainly went on to the formation of cavities, which

rendered the prospect of the future very serious : and the

more so, as his sanguine temperament and active mind

tended to make him impatient of the restrictions necessary

for any chance of recovery. These considerations further

pressed the expediency of his being sent abroad for the winter,

for the sake of seclusion and rest, as well as for the milder

climate. In the balmy air and quiet of Madeira he so far

improved as to pass the winter fairly without any material
increase of disease. His death, which took place in May, \vas

from haemorrhage, brought on, after a boating excursion, by a

well, and the difficulties experienced in landing). The occur-

rence shows that he was still in possession of considerable

activity and strength, and suggests the probability that his
ardent temperament was still apt to lead him beyond the
bounds of prudence.

     Without doubt the works of Thomas Wakley entitle him
to the foremost rank as a great Medical Eeformer ; and the
successful results of his labours in correcting abuses and
neglects of institutions, and in promoting and improving the
means of medical education and diffusion of knowledge, have
earned for him the gratitude of the Profession and of the
Public. No one has ever so consistently and successfully
defended the rights and best interests of the Medical Profes-
sion in Parliament, in Courts of Law, and through the Press ;
and if in his early life, his daring and asperities raised against
him a host of enemies, they were mostly pacified, and many
converted into friends, in his later years, when the beneficial
fruits of his efforts became apparent.

Ishare. Having early through my works obtained some re-

putation for skill in diagnosis, was often named by country
practitioners when people in affluence required further advice
for an object of solicitude, too ill to travel. Highly qualified
and able as country practitioners now are, the demand for
still more eminent skill, sought from a distance, should be
viewed as one of luxury rather than of necessity ; and as a
rule should be limited to those who can afford to pay liberally
for it. The London Physician or Surgeon ought to require
a high rate of remuneration, not only to recompense him for
his supposed higher skill, and for the time during which he is
taken away from his patients at home, but also in justice to
the country practitioners, who ought not to be damaged by

a distance. The scale of fees for long journeys has been

already mentioned in Chapter XXIV.

The difficulties of some of my early country journeys form

a contrast with the facility and speed of those of later years.

I think in 1842 I had to visit a patient in the New Forest,

Hampshire, to meet my friends, Messrs. Tatum and Moore of

Salisbury. The rail was open to Southampton with tele-
graphic communication to London, and one of the first

messages sent was that to summon me for "this journey.

IFrom Southampton took a post-chaise through the Forest,

but such was the state of the road, that after much flounder-

ing through ruts and mud, the chaise got stuck in a hole,
Iand could not be moved.
                          started off to walk the remaining

distance of two or three miles, but in half an hour was over-

taken by the chaise, which, by aid of some peasants, had been

Idragged out of its slough, and found my friends with the
Ipatient awaiting my arrival. The consultation over, started

off hoping to catch the night train from Southampton. But

I had not proceeded far, when, on sharply turning a corner,

down came the chaise with a crash, from the breaking of a

spring. It was getting dark ; and wre were several miles

distant from any place where a conveyance could be procured,

Iand I thought should have to trudge it on foot ; when for-

tunately a carriage with lights drove up, in which were my
Ifriends, Tatum and Moore, posting to Salisbury.
                                                  joyfully

joined them, and was just in time to catch the mail coach,

which joined the rail at Basingstoke : the line to Salisbury

Ibeing still unfinished. After it was completed, had many

more visits to patients at Salisbury and its neighbourhood,

under the care of my good friend George Tatum, brother of

my faithful old ally, of Paris and St. George's, Thomas

Tatum, who died of paralysis, after lingering several years,

with little more than half a life.

   Many visits Idid make also in North Wilts meeting my

friend Maurice of Maryborough, who had the best practice in

that neighbourhood. Several times I had to see the Marquis

and Marchioness of Ailesbury at Savernake, in Marlborough
Forest, and once their nephew, the present Admiral Earl
READING MANCHESTER.                                           323

Clanwilliam. These visits were very satisfactory and gave
Ime good repute in that country.
                                              ascribe much of their

success to the careful and judicious manner in which Maurice

entered into my views and carried them out in practice. His

brother at Beading was another skilful practitioner, with

whom it was always satisfactory to hold consultation. The

same may be said of Mr. Ceeley of Aylesbury, to whom we

owe the first demonstrative proofs of the identity of smallpox

and cowpox.

   IKarly in my career, was called to consultation in Man-
chester and its vicinity ; and my friend Mr. W. J. Wilson, in

large practice there, told me how without reference to

my subsequent successes, my first visit had made a favour-

able impression. Not for the purpose of display, but because

I really needed them I was in the habit of bringing with

me, not only a stethoscope, but also test-tubes and a few

chemical reagents for the examination of the state of the

secretions, &c. This has been done as a matter of course in

Ilater years : but it was not so forty years ago ; and when the

shrewd Lancashire manufacturer, to whom was called,

not ignorant of the value of chemical knowledge, saw me

going through the details of a thorough technical overhauling,

and comparing it with the character of former examinations
Ihe exclaimed, ' That's what call cluing business ! ' But
I repeat, this practice of thorough and careful scrutiny has
Ilong become general : only was a little beforehand with it.
IOften afterwards
                       had consultations with the intelligent

physicians and surgeons of that great industrial metropolis;
and a large clientele from thence found me out in London. 1

1 The following note from Sir James Bardsley is an example :

                       You may probably recollect that in March, 1864, I

sent a Greek gentleman to obtain your opinion as to the state of his lungs, and

that you agreed with me in opinion that there were no physical or other signs
indicative of tubercular disease in either lung. Your words were, ' Mr. K.

Ihave been those of catarrh, from which he is not yet quite free ; but there is
no reason to doubt that he will soon be so.'  afterwards learnt that Mr. K.

was advised to consult our friend, Dr. W., who pronounced his case as one of

Itubercular Phthisis. This opinion caused his friends great anxiety. advised

IIn like manner had several visits to Liverpool (chiefly

in consultation with Dr. Vose) : to Birmingham : (meeting
IDr. Evans) : to Sheffield, (with Dr. Overend) : to Leeds, with
Messrs. Hey and Teale. 1             saw several patients of the

Dalrymples in Norfolk : of Dr. Martin, of Eochester : of

Dr. J. A. Martin of Ventnor : and of Drs. Tetley and

Madden, and Evanson, and Mr. Toogood of Torquay : and

of Dr. Symonds of Clifton. I think I twice visited the

Dowager Marchioness of Londonderry at Seaham Hall, who

was under the care of Dr. Trotter of Sunderland ; but her

Ladyship had been for some years my patient in London.

Two or three times I went to see the Duke of Bedford at
Woburn, where I met his brother Lord John Eussell, and his
wife Lady Fanny, whom I had known in childhood as a

daughter of Lord Minto. Lord Eussell himself was also for

Isome time under my care in London and at Richmond. paid

a nocturnal visit to the Duke of Rutland in consultation with

Dr. Packman ; and came away without seeing any of the

beauties of Clumber Park.

   I have a sad recollection of a visit to Arundel Castle, the

seat of the Duke of Norfolk, to see his Father-in-law, Admiral

Lord Lyons, who, with his wife, had long been my patients.

Lady Lyons was a great sufferer from habitual asthma

IMr. C., happened to call two days ago to consult me about his own health, and

on inquiring about my former patient had the satisfaction to hear that he had
lost all chest symptoms, and was in full health. Thus you will perceive the

accuracy of your Diagnosis in this case ; and it was equally so with respect to

the condition of the lungs of a Greek lady, Mrs. Z., who saw you some time

ago, at my request.                         Believe me,

                                            Sincerely yours,

1 One case is worthy of record as showing the importance of attention to

what might seem to be a small matter in prescription. A Yorkshire Baronet,
of old lloman Catholic family, was very ill, from a fever supposed to have

been caused by the effluvia of artificial manures, with which his lands had

(emphysema), but had greatly benefited under treatment,
until they moved to Copenhagen, where Lord Lyons was
appointed ambassador to the Danish court. Here her Lady-

ship was carried off by an attack of bronchitis. The health
of Lord Lyons had been greatly tried in the Crimean War,

from which he was one of the few who returned with un-

qualified credit. When still suffering from the weakness,

brought on by the fatigues and anxieties of the campaign,

he was honoured with the command of the Queen to escort
Her Majesty in Her visit to Cherbourg ; a mark of special

approbation and favour, highly prized by the Admiral. But

during this voyage he caught a cold, to which, in his loyal

anxiety, he did not sufficiently attend : a low inflammation

I Icame on, which ended in suppuration and breaking down of

the lungs ; and when first saw him found him in an

advanced and hopeless stage of one of the most rapid forms

of galloping consumption.

   I could add an abundance more of these reminiscences,

which I write simply from recollection : but these are enough

to exemplify a department of practice which diversified the

routine of professional occupation. These long journeys gave

Isome rest to the brain, except at one time when tried to

devote the hours of travelling to the study of the German

language. The attempt often put me to sleep ; and when it

did not, it wearied the mind which ought to remain fresh for
Ithe coming consultation.
                           therefore came to the not dis-

agreeable conclusion, that in justice to the patient to be

Ivisited, must read nothing but newspapers and amusing

books ; and so keep the mind fresh to the journey's end.

     But pleasant as well as profitable as these country

journeys generally proved, I sometimes had too much of
them. There was a certain noble lady, whom I first saw in

consultation with Mr. Thomas Arthur Stone (nephew of dear

Iold Sir Charles Mansfield Clarke, whose name cannot

mention without a grateful tribute to his memory). Her

Ladyship, among other eccentricities, used often to insist on

our paying a visit twice in each day, when she or her husband

was ill. With ~our busy practice, this was difficult, even

when they lived at Putney Heath : but when for a season
326 OVERTAXED WITH LONG JOURNEYS.

they were residing at Brighton and the same demand was
made, with the offer of a special train if necessary, to suit
our own time, we had to reply that her Ladyship was asking

for impossibilities so, as a compromise with her importunity,

Iwe agreed to go alternately for a few days, instead of both

together. Then as on other occasions, when had to take a
special train, the proceeding always struck me as something
ludicrous : the parade of the great engine with its train, its

noise and fuss, with steam and smoke, the flashing of lights

and sounding of whistles on its arrival, with the array of
guards and porters with their lanterns for reception the
door is opened and out steps one poor little mortal !
' Parturiunt monies : nascitur ridiculus mus ! ' Absurdity was
further heightened on one of these occasions, wrhen Mr.

Stone and I, imperiously summoned at midnight, arrived by
special train at Brighton at 3 in the morning, having sped
from London in an hour. But there was no carriage in

waiting, and, at that hour, none to be hired. So we had to

trudge on foot to the further end of Brighton, a distance of

Ifour miles !

     Another occasion, on which found myself overtaxed with
long journeys, was in attendance on a patient in Cornwall,
not far from the Land's End. His wife (daughter of a noble-

man) had been under my care for serious pulmonary disease,
and had made a wonderful recovery, which is recorded anony-
mously in our work on Consumption. He had been for some
time under my care in London, where he improved : but since

his return to the country his complaint had assumed a serious
aspect (renal dropsy). He had been skilfully treated; but as

Ihe did not improve, was requested to visit him, and although
I did not give much hope of the eventual issue of the malady,

the lady strongly urged me to repeat my visit two or three
times a week. This was quite out of the question, not only
as incompatible with my other occupations, but also as unfair to
the medical men in the neighbourhood, with whom there wras

no reason for dissatisfaction. The sequel was, that I paid

four visits before the death of the patient, which took place
in little more than a month, and my friend Sir W. Gull was
also called in two or three times in addition.
FAITHFUL PATIENTS AND FRIENDS.  327

IAfter the above sketch of varieties in country journe3 rs,

will conclude this chapter with a notice of a fewr of the more

constant and remarkable of my London patients.

   IThrough three generations attended the Hambro family,

Danish Financiers, and was on terms of close intimacy with

Mr. J. Hambro the father, and Baron C. J. Hambro his son.

IThey were first introduced to me by a Danish professor (Otto,

  think), and by my excellent friend John Eric Erichsen, also

of Danish family, and who, although not my pupil, (having

completed his medical education before my time), became like

a pupil and effective assistant, often helping me in my work,

and afterwards in his successful career as an eminent surgeon,
Ibecoming one of the consultants in surgery in whom had the
Igreatest confidence.
                       found the senior Hambro suffering

from a fit of gout, with his foot in a sheepskin, believing in

that and patience as the only remedies ; and although they

were very slow, not curing in less than six weeks, they were also

quite safe, and did not interfere with the natural course of the

disease, which he thought a safeguard against other complaints.

But he soon found that there were safe means of reducing the

fit from six weeks to six days or less, and of further so correct-

ing the gouty constitution, as to prevent the recurrence of the

fit for months and even years. He became a ready convert to

belief in the treatment of the fit, but was not so readily per-

Isuaded to persevere with the proper remedies of diet for the

prevention. But we became last friends ; and enjoyed the

confidence of himself during the remainder of his life, and of

his son Charles J. Hambro and of his family for many years

after. Count Reventlow the Danish ambassador, and other

Scandinavian magnates, also became my patients through this

connection.

   IOf the whole circle of my acquaintance had no patients

more confiding, friendly, or more faithful, than the family of

Mr. Edward Marjoribanks, senior member of the eminent

Banking Firm of Coutts and Co. After a long attendance on

Mrs. Marjoribanks in the distressing illness which terminated

Ifatally (disease of the heart and dropsy), seemed to have

gained the confidence of the whole family; and enjoyed their

friendship down to the time of my retirement. Miss Maria
328 Sffi 7. A'AY SHUTTLE WORTH.

Marjoribanks, the eldest unmarried daughter, always proved
herself one of my kindest friends, and continued to be under
my son's care after my retirement. Her life, of much suffer-
ing to herself, but of never-failing kindliness to others, was

brought to a close, to the grief of many, last year (1882),
during my visit to London.

      Sir James Kay- Shuttleworth studied medicine in Edinburgh
shortly after my time there, and like me, engaged much in phy-
siological research. He never became a practical physician :
but engaged in works and inquiries connected with education
and sanitation. Having married an heiress, it was not neces-
sary for him to practise his profession : and not confident in
his own practical skill, he frequently consulted me on the sub-

Iject of his own health and on that of his family. have reason

to think that the result proved satisfactory ; particularly as
regarded the health of his children. In some way he had
been led into a plan, which might be called vegetarian, for the
diet of children, together with too much restriction in modes
and habits of exercise. The children did not thrive as he ex-
pected, but were pallid, thin, nervous, and growing in height
more than in breadth or strength. After a little explanation
and discussion, Sir James quite entered into my views, to
carry out apian of generous and varied, but regulated nutrition,
with as much enlivening and invigorating exercise in the open
air as strength, weather, and due attention to the cultivation

of the mind, would permit. The change for the better was

soon remarkable, and after two or three years, I saw no more
of them : but I understand that they grew up healthy young
Imen, and have since seen public mention of some of their

names as useful members of society.

    I have already had occasion to mention the name of Dr.

Robert Ferguson in connection with that of the Duke of

Wellington. It so happened that several others of his noble

patients came into my charge, at a time when he was inclining
to withdraw from practice. Among these may be mentioned
the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch, and their son Lord
Henry Scott, Frances, Marchioness of Londonderry and
Lady Clinton.

     When in acknowledgment of Dr. Ferguson's congratula-
 DR. R. FERGUSON CAPRICE ABOUT SPECIALTIES. 329

tionw that my ' name was up ' for chest complaints, I qualified
my expression of satisfaction by adding, that I did not like to
Ihe credited only with knowledge of specialties : and that was
Ianxious that it should he known that had fully studied and

written on other subjects besides chest complaints : he replied :
' My dear Williams, there is no reason for you to be anxious
about anything, but to cure your patients.'' This was compli-

mentary and sensible advice, if not quite to the point ; and it

did not reconcile me to the absurdly capricious judgments in

which some persons, chiefly of the titled class, indulge, that
a doctor can be clever on only one subject. More liberal

and reasonable was the conduct of Lady Wharncliffe, who,
after having witnessed my treatment of Lord Wharncliffe's
case, albeit hopelessly unsuccessful in the end (from over-
whelming lung-disease), did not hesitate to entrust me with
the care of her daughter, wrho was suffering from a complaint
quite unconnected with the chest. And happily the ultimate

result was successful, but after a 'long period of anxiety and

peril.

   I must say that I found it a relief, to have sometimes the

charge of cases of maladies, other than those of the chest.

Often their treatment is easier and less tedious, and for the

most part, more successful. And it is pleasant and cheering

to have to do with patients who soon get well and dismiss you
with a blessing, instead of those who linger long in anxiety
and doubt, or worse still, are stamped with the doom of mortal
disease. But happily, as for the patient, so for the doctor,
there is balm for all his woes ; and grace and comfort for all
the issues of life, or of death. ' Thou shalt keep him in per-
fect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee, because he trusteth
in Thee.'

    It is a profitable as well as pleasant lesson to recall in a

life, the memory of good works done by those who are them-
selves under sickness and suffering. The life of one of my
patients, Miss Laura Oldfield, was wonderfully prolonged
during many years, notwithstanding the existence of exten-

sive and incurable organic disease of the lungs. In fact in a
bodily sense her life was reduced to less than half its normal

capacity. There was less than half the lung left for breathing,
330 UNSUITABLE OCCUPATIONS.

which was more like that of a reptile, than of a warm-blooded

mammal. Yet this lady continued, by writing and direc-

tions, to act as secretary and superintendent of a beneficent

society for the relief of the sick and infirm poor, during

several years. Much as we must admire the heroism and

loveliness of such extraordinary self-sacrifice, as physicians,

we cannot approve of it ; for we feel ourselves called on to

inculcate as a primary duty, the due care and preservation of

that life which the Author of our being has entrusted to the

charge of each. If He sends sickness and weakness which

incapacitate for the duties of health, it is as a message to
possess our souls in patience biding His time in the use of

permitted means for the restoration of our powers and their

duties.                                                    my
                                                             of
   I have known many instances and have some in
Ithoughts whom could name, but this is not necessary

ladies who have undertaken offices and occupations which

were beyond their strength; and, in some examples, not suit-

able to female capacities. One has undertaken to form and to

superintend a religious Sisterhood, to be devoted to services

of high ritual and a programme of good works. Impelled

by enthusiastic feelings, more sensational than rational, and

more conventional than natural, she devises a code of regula-

tions and duties, the fulfilment of which makes great demands

on the bodily and mental powers. The plan attracts many

of like aesthetic tastes, who prefer gorgeous ceremonials and

church ordinances to simplicity of worship and spiritual

service. So the lady became superior of a large Sisterhood,

with a multiplicity of duties and a weight of responsibility,

which, however gratifying to ambition and flattering to self-

righteousness, must sorely try a conscientious mind and bear
down a not over vigorous body. And so it proved. In a few

Iyears found her quite broken down in health and strength.

Another young lady of strong ardent mind and health

good, except in being occasionally subject to spasmodic asthma,

undertook to make herself useful in society by establishing

and conducting a business, to be carried on by women. The

enterprise was for a time successful : but at the sacrifice of

the lady's health, who soon became an habitual asthmatic.
JOHN STUART MILL LORD LYTTON.                                331

I \\ill conclude this chapter by a brief notice of two dis-

tinguished men who were for a time my patients, and who as

patients, as well as in the prominent features of their nature

and characters, formed a striking contrast with each other.

    John Stuart Mill during several years came occasionally
to see me at my morning consultations. It is unnecessary to
allude to the nature of his ailments. For a man so noted in

his writings for profundity of thought and grasp of intellect,

his usual conversation was remarkable for its plainness and

simplicity. Bather reserved in disposition, he rarely diverged

from the object of his visit, which he stated sensibly but con-

cisely, and rather required to be drawn out by questions.

But he was always an attentive listener, and what is more, a

confiding, conformable, patient ; reasonable in his expectations,

and intelligently acquiescent in receiving explanations and
I Idirections.
need hardly say that felt it a pleasure as well

as an honour to possess the confidence of such a man, the

profundity of whose intellect did not impair the amiability of

his character. He thought himself generally benefited under

my treatment : but he resided much in the south of France

and I did not see him in the last two or three years of his life.

Lord Lytton was a genius of a totally different order, with

a greaJt predominance of imagination over the reasoning

faculties. "With a mind of great capacity and activity, trained

by high culture, and largely enriched by foreign travel and

intercourse with the world, he had become a prolific writer in

various departments of literature, and not more prolific than

successful. As poet, historian, dramatist, writer of fiction,

and politician his works had charmed the public, and had

raised him to the highest ranks of authorship.

    AY hen I visited him at his residence in Park Lane, even
Ion entrance at the outer door, began to find n^-self in

an atmosphere of perfume or rather of perfume, mixed with

tobiicco-fninc. On proceeding further through a long corridor
and anteroom, the fume waxed stronger, and on entrance to

the presence chamber or divan, at the further end, through a

lia/e of smoke, loomed his lordship's figure, wrapt in an

Oriental dressing robe with coloured Fez, and half reclined

upon an ottoman. Polished in manner, and most courteous

in address, he charmed me with his talk ; but when I pro-

ceeded to question him and enter into his case, his account

of himself w?as so mixed up with crotchets and fancies, that I

found it hard to get at the simple truth, and still more diffi-
cult to enlighten him and bring him round to my way of
thinking. With the ardour and versatility of genius, he
had studied all systems of medicine, legitimate and illegi-

timate ; but with a strange mixture of German scepticism and

Oriental credulity, almost amounting to superstition, he had
persevered in no definite plan of treatment, unless his habit
of indulgence in perpetual smoking could be considered as

such. As his complaints included a decided asthmatic com-

plication, I tried to persuade him (as giving it up was hope-

less) at least to improve his habit of smoking, by substituting
for a portion of his beloved tobacco stramonium, bella-
donna or Indian hemp, and so get more of their antispas-
modic effect, and less of the pernicious influence of the
tobacco on the heart and stomach. But, as in other cases of

Ihabitual intoxication with tobacco, doubt that my arguments

were of much avail, or that he derived any material benefit

Ifrom, the three or four visits which paid him. This chapter
Ihas already exceeded the usual bounds, and will add no
I Imore, but hope that may find a future opportunity of re-

lieving niy mind by a ' counterblast ' against the pernicious

Ieffects of tobacco, with which feel it charged.

A CONSIDERABLE proportion of the British public seems to have

a decided appetite for quackery. They read with avidity the
numerous specious advertisements in the public press, which

also finds them profitable, Jiot only in the payments of the
advertisers, but also in the gratification thus afforded to their

quackery-loving readers ; and the more sensational the cases,
and marvellous the announcement of cure, the greater will be

the fascination. In the years 1865 and 1866 a whole column
of the ' Times ' and of other popular journals, was often occu-
pied by large extracts from the pamphlet of a Dr. Robert
Hunter, setting forth new and startling statements respecting

the prevalence, and insidious approaches of consumption ; the

total failure of medical science to ascertain its nature, or to
find its remedy : then the announcement of Dr. Hunter's dis-

coveries as fulfilling both objects, professing to have detected

its nature, and promising confidently to effect its cure. Then
334 THE >PALL MALL GAZETTED AND DR. HUNTER.

these pretensions were garnished by a specious display of

chemical terms, and, by a reference to distinguished chemical

authorities, well devised to deceive the ignorant. No well-

informed medical man could be thus deluded : but Dr. Hunter

specially warns his readers against the whole profession, as

prejudiced, as well as incompetent. Eventually his advertise-

ments attracted a great many patients, and he had establish-

ments for carrying on his method of treatment in Scotland

and Ireland as well as in London.

    It was not long before I heard more of this pretender from

patients who had consulted him, and it was by no means to

his advantage. Only one of these thought he found some

temporary benefit from the inhalations ; some got no good,

and others became worse : but all complained of the charges,

which were a guinea for the first consultation, and 5L per

month afterwards. 1 It was the spirit of extortion thus mani-

fested, taking advantage of the alarms of deluded patients,

together with the combined craft and ignorance discovered in

the pretended invention, that aroused the indignant feelings

of an independent journalist, who publicly denounced the

offender in no measured terms in the pages of 'the ' Pall Mall

Gazette    '  and  describing  his  advertisements  as  fallacious  and
         ;

unprincipled, full of false and exaggerated statements, calcu-

lated to terrorise the public, to discredit medical practice in

general, and to puff off his own vaunted remedies, which were

really as destitute of efficacy as they were the outcome of

ignorance and error, concluded by strongly warning the public

against the whole concern.

Dr. Hunter could not do otherwise than bring an action

for libel, against the responsible publisher of the ' Pall Mall
Gazette,' who undertook to defend the action, pleading ' not '

  ACTION FOR LIBEL DR. HUNTER'S PAMPHLET. 335

guilty, and further, that the alleged libel was true in substance
and in fact.'

    Together with several other London Physicians, I was

summoned as witness for the defence ; and although such an
engagement in a Court of Law was far from agreeable, involv-
ing both anxiety and responsibility, and occupying much time,

I did not shrink from what seemed to be a plain public duty,

to support a public-spirited journal in a righteous endeavour
to expose fraud and ignorance, and to uphold the dignity and
interests of the Medical Profession.

    It would occupy too much space to give the details of the

trial, which were copiously reported by the journals of the

I Iperiod : and shall chiefly confine myself to the part which

took in it. The pamphlet of Dr. Hunter, extracts from which

formed the substance of the numerous advertisements appear-
ing in the daily and weekly newspapers, was a curious com-
pound of pretension and ignorance. He professed that he
had discovered that tubercles, the cause of consumption, con-
sisted of matter with an excess of carbon, resulting from in-
adequacy in the respiration to supply oxygen sufficient to

carry it off. In support of the notion of the excess of carbon
in tubercle, he quotes the analysis of Scherer, who found in
tubercle nearly 54 per cent, of carbon : but Dr. Hunter over-

looks the same chemist's analysis of protein and other animal
principles, which contain nearly 56 per cent, carbon; actually
more than tubercle so that Scherer is against him. Under

the same erroneous notion that tubercles arise from defective

respiration, he ascribes the power of bronchitis to produce
them, to its impeding respiration : overlooking the well-known
fact that other disorders which impede respiration, more, and
for a longer time, than bronchitis, ' are remarkably exempt
from the formation of tubercles. Thus asthma, spasmodic or
habitual, malformations of the heart, and distortions of the

spine, all of which greatly interfere with the oxygenation of
the blood, seem in some measure incompatible with a tuber-

culous tendency.
     Dr. Hunter's notions in /xitJiolo/ii/ thus proving so erro-

neous, nothing more satisfactory is to be found in his tJn'm-
     tics, or means of cure. They are described in the pam
336 EXAGGERATIONS AND ERRORS TRIAL.

phlet too vaguely to be intelligible or practicable by another
medical man : but much efficacy is ascribed to the use of
remedies by inhalation, and especially those which are said to
supply oxygen : but no explanation was given how this was
to be accomplished, nor directions for carrying out the plan.
Thus the method of treatment vaunted as being so much
more successful than any other, was kept secret and confined
to the practice of Dr. Hunter and his assistants.

      The extensive prevalence of the disease, proving fatal to

one-fourth of the adult population the insidiousness of its
approach with few premonitory symptoms are dwelt on in
exaggerated and alarming terms, and the fearful description
winds up with a solemn warning against all ordinary methods
of cure, which are denounced as irrational and ineffectual.

     On the assumption that the disease in consumption is
local, confined to the lungs, Dr. Hunter maintains that reme-
dies ought to be directed at once to the lungs ; and on the
assumption that tubercle, the cause of consumption, is dele-
terious through its containing an excess of carbon he insists
that the proper method of treatment is by the inhalation of
air or vapours with an increased supply of oxygen. Medical
men know well that both these assumptions are contrary to
facts ; abundant evidence to that effect came out in the trial.

     On the 27th of November, 1866, in the Court of Queen's
Bench, the Lord Chief Justice (Cockburn), with a special jury,
had before him the case of Hunter v. Sharpe, an action for
libel against the ' Pall Mall Gazette.' The defendant pleaded
' not guilty ; and further, that the alleged' libel was true in sub-
stance and in fact.' Mr. Coleridge, Q.C., Mr. Serjeant Ballan-
tine, and Mr. Hume Williams were counsel for the plaintiff;
Mr. Karslake, Q.C. and Mr. Fitzjames Stephen were counsel
for the defendant.

     Mr. Coleridge stated the plaintiff's case to the jury, handed
in the libel, and called as witnesses, the plaintiff, Robert
Hunter, M.D. of the University of New York, and Licentiate
of the Medical Board of New York ; Dr. Melville, M.D. Edin-
burgh ; and Dr. McGregor, M.D. Edinburgh ; assistants of Dr.
Hunter ; and six persons, who had been Dr. Hunter's patients.
After these respectively had given their evidence and had
EVIDENCE FOR DEFENCE PLAINTIFFS ERRORS. 337

been cross-examined, Mr. Karslake addressed the jury for the
defence, and then, on the third day of the trial, called, as first

witness :

(Taken principally from the Eeport in the ' Lancet.')

Dr. Williams, F.R.S., F.E.C.P., Senior Consulting Physician to

the Brompton Hospital for Consumption, who stated that he had
paid particular attention to diseases of the lungs, and had read Dr.

Hunter's book, which contained, he said, many exaggerations and

misstatements. The statement in the book that consumption arose

entirely from imperfect respiration was as much opposed to the

truth, as a statement could well be. It was a remarkable fact that

many of the diseases in which respiration was most imperfect were
unusually free from tubercular deposition. The subjects of habitual

asthma were nearly always free from tubercle ; the same remark

also would apply to spasmodic asthma. There was a similar class
of cases connected with malformations and disease of the heart, in

which there was imperfect respiration and yet no tubercles. In

cases of great distortion of the spine there was often very imperfect
respiration, yet in these tubercle was very uncommon. Again, the
statement in Dr. Hunter's book that carbon was a poison, inimical

to health, and that it was the source of consumption, was entirely

erroneous. Carbon was the same as charcoal, a remarkably inert
substance ; and was often formed in the lung tissue in considerable
quantities without doing any harm. And the statement that it is
the true cause of tubercle was unwarranted assumption. Dr. Hunter

appealed to chemical analysis to prove the large amount of carbon
in tubercle ; but its proportion, 54 per cent., was not greater than
in other animal matters. Other constituents of the blood and of the

body contained as much, and even more, carbon. There were
other statements entirely contrary to fact. The statement that

catarrh leads to consumption generally, was a gross exaggeration.

It could not be denied that catarrh might develop the disease in

persons predisposed to it. But in a common cold there was a

liability to cough and an increase of the pulse ; and many persons

were subject to nervous cough from accidental causes, and also to
quickening of pulse. The statement as to mischief in the lungs
being undoubtedly indicated by a ' hacking cough, with slight

shortness of breath, especially if associated with an acceleration of

10 to 15 beats per minute of the pulse, etc.,' was absurd.

The Lord Chief Justice said the whole passage should be looked

at, not isolated expressions.

                               z
338 ERRORS AND EXAGGERATIONS.

The entire passage was read :
' In consumption the pulse keeps pace with the shortness of

breath. In health the pulse should range from 60 to 68, the
Ifaverage being about 64 beats in a minute.
                                              therefore you have a

hacking cough and slight shortness of breath on exertion, accom-

panied by an increase in the frequency of the pulse of 10 or 15 beats

per minute, you cannot doubt the existence of mischief in the lungs,

and should instantly set about its removal.'

The witness stated that he had perused the entire chapter, and

indeed the whole work, and his opinion was that the passage read

was erroneous, and that the general tendency of the work was

unduly to alarm the public, and that it contained many statements

grossly exaggerated, if not entirely unfounded. His attention was

then directed to another passage :

   I' We do not always find apparent loss of flesh in the first stage

of consumption. In young women particularly have very often

found the lungs severely affected, while they still retained their

colour and plumpness. But, as a rule, if we reduce the matter to a

certainty by weighing, we shall find a few pounds of difference

between their present and their former weight. If, with the loss of

weight, there is a disposition to sigh, a dark discolouration below

the eyes and a quickened pulse, with some heat in the hands, set

it down as almost certain that the lungs are affected.'

The witness stated that though there was some degree of truth

in the first sentence, the latter part of the passage was very erro-

neous, and calculated to produce a false and alarming impression.

The symptoms described were often met with in cases where there

was no such affection of the lungs. His attention was then pointed

to a passage in which it was stated :

' The weekly bills of mortality point us to the startling fact that

of those who have passed the age of puberty, fully one in every
four persons we meet with in the great thoroughfares of business

and pleasure, is under the ban of this terrible disease, and destined

to fall a sacrifice to it unless saved through the prompt adoption of

more rational means than those usually employed.'

The witness stated that he considered this to be a gross exag-

geration and far too alarming. He was then asked as to a passage

which ran thus :

From these facts the reader can understand that one of the

great objects of treatment is to subdue the catarrhal condition of

the mucous membrane. How can this be accomplished ? It is no

treatment for a local disease in the lungs, to pour down cod-liver

oil and tonics into the stomach, for they never reach the parts
        ACTION OF COD-OIL AND OF INHALATIONS. 339

affected ; and, besides, such medicines possess no properties capable

of effecting cure, if they did. No physician will pretend that cod-

liver oil, or any cough mixture, or any tonic ever compounded, has
power to remove tubercle, purify the blood, or heal the mucous

membrane, even if directly applied. How, then, in the name of

reason, can they accomplish these objects when they are applied to
a distant and healthy part ? '

     The witness said this was entirely erroneous in both fact and

reasoning. There was abundant evidence that such medicines did

reach the lungs and every part of the body where the blood circu-

lated.
     The Lord Chief Justice. Then, you would say that cod-liver oil

had a beneficial action upon the lungs by the oily matter being
brought into immediate contact with every part of the lungs ?

     Witness. As one mode of action, but it has other modes of
operation : in generally promoting nutrition, for instance ?

    The Lord Chief Justice. In other words, you think that if the

lungs could be got at locally, it would do good to apply the oil to

Itheir surface ?

    Witness. Well, that should doubt. It is through the blood

that it is believed to effect good, because the deposit and changes
of tubercle depend upon the circulation of the blood in every part of
the lungs ; and it is in the blood thus circulating, that the oil acts,
and is believed to be very beneficial. The witness then had his
attention drawn to a passage in an essay prefixed by the plaintiff to

his book :
     ' The conclusion is that pulmonary complaints are curable, even

after they have reached a compound stage, when treated by properly

Iregulated, and adapted inhalations of oxygenated and medicated

vapours ; and cannot but regard it as a contribution to medical
science of inestimable importance to mankind, and one destined to
exert a more beneficial influence on the practice of medicine than
any discovery of modern times.'

     The witness stated that he had been for 30 years in the habit of
using inhalation in such cases, and that it had been used in the

Brompton Hospital for many years. It was no novelty, but was

common in his own practice, and he believed in that of many of his
brethren. He regarded it as a valuable auxiliary, but as subordinate
to the use of medicines taken into the stomach in the ordinary
way. Inhalation, he said, was transient in its effects ; and though,
no doubt, the substance inhaled reached the air-passages, and even
the blood, it was in such minute quantities that the effect was
not enduring. Inhalations too were uncertain in their operation.

                                                                             z2
 340 PLAINTIFF'S 'INHALATIONS' EXPOSED.

 Sometimes they would produce little or no effect, and sometimes,

on the contrary, strong, and even baneful effects ; so that they
required to be administered with great care, and with personal super-
 vision of the patient : and their beneficial operation, at the best, was

 limited, because transient. Take, for instance, asthma, the disease
in which it might be supposed likely to be useful : although the
inhalation of stramonium for its cure had been long known, indeed
it was in common use all over the world, yet it was transient in its

 operation ; whereas that same drug when administered through the

stomach, was far more beneficial in its effects. In fact, the pro-
fession, having long been acquainted with inhalation, and having
tried it with all kinds of drugs and in all kinds of cases and in all
kinds of ways, had concluded that it was neither so very efficacious,
or permanent in its operation, as was at first expected, and there-
fore they assigned it less importance than Dr. Hunter claimed for
it. Asked as to the modes of inhalation, he stated that, though he
had tried inhaling instruments, he had not found them so efficacious

as the more simple mode of putting the matter to be inhaled in a
jug of very hot water, throwing a cloth over the head while held
over it the result of which was that the patient inhaled with ease
by both nose and mouth. As to the plaintiff's ' inhaler ' he had
found it impossible to make out what it was. Neither his instru-
ment, nor his method was described in his book. The witness was
then directed to the passage in which the plaintiff described his

system :

     ' The medicines which it is necessary for the patient to inhale
are of four kinds first, expectorants, to expel the mucus; second,
sedatives, to allay irritation ; third, astringents, to diminish secre-

tion ; and fourth, alteratives, to change the action of the diseased

membrane.'

     He was asked whether he could collect from this the plaintiff's
system, so as to understand distinctly what it was, and he declared
that he could not ; it was so utterly vague and indefinite as to the

drugs to be used, their proportions and combination, or the means
employed for inhalation. And this remark he applied to the book
as a whole. There was nothing in it which was sufficiently clear
and definite to enable a medical man to understand the treatment
and to apply it. He found in particular no directions which would
guide any one in the administration of oxygen ; nor indeed up to
this moment could witness collect, even from the plaintiff's evidence,
that he ever really administered oxygen at all. The process
described by the plaintiff, was, he believed, one that would not
really disengage free oxygen. Chloric acid, which the plaintiff said
CAUSE AND CURABILITY OF CONSUMPTION. 341

he used, would no doubt, if decomposed, give out oxygen and

chlorine ; but if these were inhaled together, the chlorine would be

such an irritant to the lungs, as to prevent inhalation being con-

tinued ; and if they were mixed with other substances, then these

would absorb the oxygen ; so that in either case no free oxygen would
be inhaled at all, and the process was useless. In some cases, he

said, the real inhalation of oxygen would be dangerous in pulmonary

disease for reasons which he explained. Consumption always

comprised a tendency to inflammations, of which bronchitis was one,

and the effect of oxygen being to increase the stimulating effect of

the air on the lungs, he should fear its effects in increasing the

tendency to inflammation. So far, therefore, from thinking as the

plaintiff stated in his book, that the great thing in every case was

to inhale oxygen, it would be in many cases extremely injurious ;

and so far from the received modes of treatment by regular prac-

titioners having failed, as the plaintiff represented, to diminish the

mortality by consumption, he stated that the plaintiff's estimate of

the mortality was most exaggerated, and that the average duration

of the disease now was five years, whereas it used to be two.

IMr. Coleridge in cross-examination. Do you consider con-
sumption curable or not ?     consider it curable in certain forms

and degrees.

The Lord Chief Justice. In what forms and degrees ? In the

incipient stage, or when the disease is limited in extent.

Mr. Coleridge. Beyond that it is incurable ? When it is ex-

tensive and far advanced, no doubt it is incurable.

Then it is all the more important to treat it as early as pos-

sible ? Certainly, provided it exists. (A laugh.) But it is all the
more important to treat for it as soon as it is suspected to exist ?

Yes, no doubt.

The witness was then challenged upon his opinion as to a

passage in which the plaintiff stated, ' All observation and experience

unite to prove that the root of the malady is in the lungs, and that
                                                           '
tubercles  are but the fruit  of imperfect  respiration  ;    and he repeated

that this was as untrue as any statement could possibly be. He

was then asked as to another passage ' Tuberculous deposits are

the invariable results of insufficient performance of the respiratory

function and rebreathed air ; ' and he was asked whether this pro-

position was as false as the other ; and if not where was the dif-

ference. The witness pointed out that the distinction was, that in

the one case there was the mere imperfection of respiration ; whereas

in the other the latter passage there was a further corruption

caused by the air having already passed through the lungs. The
342 CROSS-EXAMINATIONS.

witness was then told that the latter proposition was from Dr.

MacCormac's work on consumption, and he said he did not alto-
gether dispute it. There might however, he added, be imperfect
respiration without consumption, and he quite denied that con-
sumption always had for its cause, imperfect respiration. There was,
he said, no evidence that imperfect respiration caused or preceded
the deposit of tubercle, though of course after consumption had
gone on respiration would often be interfered with : consumption,
however, was often found without previous imperfect respiration.
He also declared it to be a total mistake to state that the cause of
consumption was the absence of oxygen or the excess of carbon in
the blood, and the passage stating that carbon retained and not
sufficiently discharged was ' deposited as tubercle ' was quite in-
correct. The cause of consumption might be in the unhealthy
condition of various functions of the body ; respiration was only one
of them ; but it was utterly incorrect to represent absence of oxygen
or imperfection of respiration as the sole cause. The insufficiency
of oxygen, no doubt, might be one of several co-operating causes,
leading to that deteriorated state of the system which resulted in

consumption. Air which had been breathed or respired was

 positively pernicious. Asked whether oxygenation of the blood was
not of great importance and went on in the lungs, he said of course
 it was ; but the oxygen, to be beneficial, would be absorbed into the
 blood, and pass through the whole system, thus rendering all the
 functions of the body active by its presence. He denied the pro-
 position of the plaintiff that consumption is only the consequence of
 a carbonaceous condition of the blood.

      Mr. Coleridge. What do you consider the cause of consumption ?
      Dr. Williams. A degraded condition of the material of the
 blood ; that is, such a deteriorated condition of it that it no longer

 makes good flesh.
       Mr. Coleridge. And is not that the result of a carbonaceous con-

 dition of the blood and the deficiency of oxygen ?

       Witness. On the contrary, many eminent pathologists are of
 opinion that an excess of oxygen may lead to consumption.

       Mr. Coleridge. Ah, you may have too much of a good thing, no
 doubt ; but is it not a cause of consumption ?

      Witness. Not a direct cause. It may tend to that general

 deterioration of the blood which is the real source and cause of
 consumption, but is not a direct cause of it.

       Mr. Coleridge. Then your distinction is between direct and

  indirect ?

        Witness. No : between a sole cause and a co-operating cause.
CATARRH INHALATION NOT NEW.  343

The plaintiff states in his book that consumption is ' only the conse-

quence of a carbonaceous condition of the blood.'
     The witness was then challenged with the plaintiff's statement

' Catarrh is the first step towards consumption,' which he had

declared to be grossly exaggerated. Even when colds were chronic
and neglected they did not necessarily lead to consumption. A

catarrh might be neglected and go on for a whole winter, and
might pass away in summer, or might be prolonged for years, and

become what was called an ' old man's cough.' It often happened

that colds were unavoidably neglected ; and yet happily they did

not lead to consumption. If, indeed, there was a consumptive
tendency, or if the cold were combined with other deteriorating in-

fluences there might be danger ; but he entirely protested against
such a broad statement as that ' Catarrh was always the first step

to consumption.' So he entirely differed from the statement that
deaths caused by consumption were one-fourth of the whole number
of deaths caused by disease. That might have been supposed, half
a century ago, when the bills of mortality were not kept so accurately
as they are now, but it was not believed to be the case now. So of
the statement that ' one-fourth of the persons we meet with are

under the ban of this terrible disease.' It is nearer the truth to say

that the deaths from tuberculous consumption amount to one in 8
or 9 deaths from all causes. He particularly objected to the
passage : ' If, therefore, you have a hacking cough and slight
shortness of breath, etc. you cannot doubt the existence of mischief
in the lungs.' This, he said, was a great exaggeration, as these
were very common symptoms in persons not at all consumptive.
Asked about inhalation, the witness repeated his statement that it
had been used as a means of cure for 30 years ; and Sir C. Scudamore

as long ago as that, had published a treatise on the subject,
although it had not been found very successful. Iodine inhalation,
and other forms of inhalation, however were still in use ; but their

value was problematical. He knew of no considerable physician
who treated his patients exclusively by inhalation ; but it was well
known and used, and there have been fifty forms of inhaler in-
vented and used, Hemlock, stramonium, opium, camphor, and many
other drugs were thus used. The real inhalation of oxygen had
been practised in London to a considerable extent not exclusively
for diseases of the chest, but for them amongst others. Fifty years
ago Dr. Beddoes, of Bristol, used it ; and it was originally suggested
by Sir Humphry Davy. An institution had been actually estab-
lished for the purpose ; but the process had fallen into disuse. As
 to the plaintiff's process of inhalation of oxygen, it was utterly
344 OTHER WITNESSES VERDICT,

impossible to discover it from his book. There was no mode in which
oxygen could be brought into the lungs except in the form of gas.
He found from inquiries of the plaintiff's patients that no such

instrument was used as could sup'ply oxygen separately as a gas-

holder.

    In re -examination Dr. Williams stated that the efficacy of the

treatment for consumption had greatly increased of late years,
especially since cod-liver oil had been introduced in its purer forms ;
and it was now used to a greater extent than ever. (The evidence
and cross-examination of this witness occupied the whole of the

third and part of the fourth day of the trial.)
     Other witnesses examined for the defence were Dr. Eisdon

Bennett, Dr. Cotton, Dr. W. 0. Markham, Dr. Quain, Dr. George
Johnson and Dr. W. Odling. They all expressed their general con-
currence in the evidence of Dr. Williams, and added further impor-
tant testimony of a similar kind.

     Mr. Karslake's address for the defendant was commenced on the

fourth day and concluded on the fifth. It was followed by Mr.

Coleridge's reply for the plaintiff. On the morning following, the
Lord Chief Justice summed up at great length ; and the Jury after
two hours' deliberation found a verdict for the Plaintiff : DAMAGES

ONE FABTHING.

      This verdict although nominally for the plaintiff, by assign-

ing as damages the lowest coin in the realm, signified how

little he deserved from the protection of the law, and leaves

him chargeable with all his own costs in the action. The

public press generally concurred in the justice of the decision.
' The Times ' concludes its comment with these words : ' We
should fail in our duty if we did not express the conviction

that  such a verdict entirely  meets    the justice of the case, and
that  our contemporary (the            Mall Gazette ") is entitled to

the thanks of the public for a courageous attempt to protect

their interests.' The medical journals acknowledged the

benefit conferred on the medical profession by the trial, in

exposing false and fraudulent pretentions and practices, and

in upholding the moral and scientific character of the genuine

art.

      A word or two of remark on the principal personages in

this trial. Mr. Coleridge (now Lord Chief Justice of England)

although renowned for eloquence and argumentative power,

appeared to me to be very deficient in exactitude of knowledge
COMMENTS ON COUNSEL AND JUDGE.                             345

and in aptitude for mastering the details of his case. In fact

in technical matters he seemed to glory in professing his

ignorance ; and when dealing with them, he did not always

come off well. In cross-examining me he propounded in

a pompous tone this question, ' Have you taken into
account the vital capacity of the lungs ? ' Dr. W. ' What do
you mean by vital capacity ? ' Mr. C. ' Ah ! that's what

I want you to tell us; I don't know anything about it.'
IDr. W. ' Well, suppose you mean vital capacity in the

sense used by Dr. John Hutchinson, who invented an instru-

ment called a spirometer, to measure the quantity of air

which a person could blow into it at a breath ; that quantity

was a measure of what Dr. Hutchinson called the vital capacity

of the chest. Having thus explained to the Jury what vital

capacity means, what further question have you to ask about
it ? ' But the learned counsel had nothing more to say.

IAnother time, when was under examination, and was speak-

ing of the operation and good effects of cod-liver oil in tuber-

culous disease, Mr. Coleridge rose to his full height with a

book in hand, and said in a solemn voice, 'Are you aware that
Dr. MacCormac declares " that not all the oil of all the codfish

agree with those who object to the use of cod-liver oil.'

Mr. Karslake (afterwards Sir John and Attorney- General)

on the other hand was remarkable for the care with which he

studied his briefs, and spared no pains to make himself

thoroughly acquainted with the subject, however technical it

might be. And his arguments and examinations were equally

satisfactory and to the point.

THE Hunter trial attracted much attention especially in the
medical profession ; and although the verdict was nominally
for the plaintiff, yet the petty award of damages, and the
publication of the overwhelming evidence against his preten-
sions and modes of procedure, were sufficient to answer the

object of the defendant and to put an end to the stigmatised

practice. Had the language of the censure been a little more
moderate, it would have equally effected its purpose, with the

probable result of getting a verdict altogether for the de-

fendant.

   IThe prominent position in which was placed as principal
Iwitness, could not but take as complimentary : and it was

very satisfactory to me that my evidence was supported by

that of the eminent witnesses who followed me. I was

especially gratified by the corroboration and further explana-

tion of my statements on the chemistry of the subject, by the

authority of the distinguished chemical Professor, Dr. Odling,

the lucidity of whose evidence was highly applauded by the

Lord Chief Justice.

   I received several letters congratulating me on the manner
Iin which had represented at the trial the most correct and

advanced knowledge of the subject, and evaded the quibbles of
Icross-examination.
                     was specially invited by the Editor of

the Lancet to supply that journal with a summary of my

views and experience on the treatment of Consumption.
     And in truth the whole subject of Consumption had been

brewing in my mind for many years, and the occasion

of this trial had so stirred it up to increased activity that

experience, to certain general conclusions respecting the

nature of the disease and the best methods of treatment ;
and the increasing success of the results gave me confidence

Iin them. But felt the need of more exact methods of deal-

ing with vast numbers of facts than by trusting to mere

general conclusions. It was necessary more exactly to classify

and to count the facts, as well as to observe and record them ;

and to make the inferences the result of calculation, rather

than of vague impression.

   I was always quite aware of the value of the numerical

method, in dealing with large numbers of facts or cases ; and
ASSISTANCE OF DR. C. T. WILLIAMS.  349

I Iwhen had clinical clerks and assistants, largely employed
Ithem in this work : but had no great aptitude for it myself,

and rarely had time for it. But happily now my son Dr.
Charles Theodore Williams came to my aid, and manifested
both talent and taste for the work. He had been appointed

assistant physician to the Hospital for Consumption at
Brompton, and had been for some years assisting me in
practice ; seeing patients in my absence, as Dr. Quain had
done previously. He was therefore advantageously placed for
acquiring experience himself, and for becoming familiar with

Imany of my patients and with my methods of treatment.

     During my whole professional life, had been in the habit
of keeping concise (but accurate) notes of all but trivial cases

   Ientering them in little books suitable for the pocket ; and

had already between two and three hundred of these little
books, containing about a hundred cases in each ; amounting
in all to between twenty and thirty thousand cases. To

Iproperly select, assort, tabulate, and calculate these, was a

work of great labour, which could not have accomplished by

myself ; but my son could devote much time to the work ; and

soon began to get at important results, which could not have

been attained without this methodical system of study. For
example, on the subject of the duration of life in consumption,

my general conclusion, drawn from partial calculations and
limited numbers of cases, was that during my experience,

this length of life had increased from two years, the same as
that given by Laennec and Louis iv five years; this was
the number stated in my Lumleian Lectures, and repeated in
 the Hunter Trial. From a larger number of cases more care-

 fully collected and calculated, and corrected up to the latest

 date of history, my son found the average duration of life
 in 1,000 phthisical patients under my care during a period of
 twenty-two years, reached to nearly eight years in those that
 eventually died ; and to above eight years in those who yet
 survived : a considerably longer duration than any hitherto

 on record. My son drew up an elaborate paper on the sub-
ject, which was discussed at the Eoyal Medical and Chirurgical
 Society of London, and published in the fifty- fourth Volume

 of their Transactions.
350 SOWS MARRIAGE.

I IHaving now happily found in my son the assistance which

   had so long needed and wished for, was in a position to
entertain the proposal urged on me by Messieurs Longman &
Co., to publish a work on Pulmonary Consumption, which was
accordingly announced as forthcoming, in our joint names.
Owing to the interruption of extraordinary events, to be
noticed in this chapter, the book was not completed till the
summer of 1871, and it will be referred to in the memoirs of

Ithat period.

     At present have a few words to say on the happy associa-
tion with which God has blessed me in my son's adopting the
same profession from his own choice, and in our being united
in the same pursuits and interests. For some years he re-
mained with me in the same house, but in 1868 he married,
and occupied a small house very near me in Park Street.
His wife is a daughter of Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.E.S., a name
eminent in the scientific world, especially in connection with
his researches in Conchology, of which he has long been one
of the foremost and most successful cultivators. Mrs. Gwyn
Jeffreys, her accomplished mother, was a lady well known and
much esteemed in a large circle of society; and the young
couple began life with happy and encouraging prospects.

     My son was already well known through his little work
on the ' Climate of the South of France, &c.,' which had

reached a second edition ; and several contributions from his
pen had appeared in the Transactions of the Pathological and
other Societies. At a later date he drew from my case books
and his own a large stock of information on the results of
climate in Consumption, which enabled him to show by the
numerical method the actual value of climate in the treatment

of patients, and to classify the forms of Consumption suitable
for each variety of health-resort.
CASE OF EARL ST. MAUR LIBEL.                                   351

The case of the illness and death of the Earl St. Maur, with notice
    of the action for Libel brought by Dr. Williams against the

his breath had been shorter ever since. For the last three

ago, on making a few passes with a rapier, he was suddenly
seized with what he called ' extreme oppression, spasm, and

panting,' and when he recovered from .this there followed
frequent cough and shortness of breath. He sent for Dr.

Fairbank, and under his treatment gradually improved ; but

breath was still short on exertion, with occasional attacks of

increased difficulty in the morning. Had lost strength and

colour. Pulse now 80, weak, unsteady.

   IOn careful examination of the chest, found no signs of

the emphysema mentioned by Dr. Fairbank. Breath sound

distinct in every part, especially the inspiration, which was

louder and harsher than usual. No prolonged expiration,

wheeze or crepitus. Above left scapula breath and voice tubular*

Heart sounds very weak, slight venous murmur in neck. As

these signs, especially the natural motions, shape, and percus-

sion sounds of the chest and the absence of prolonged expira-

tion or wheeze disproved to me the presence of emphysema,

I concluded that the condition mentioned by Dr. Fairbank

was a temporary one, and had now passed away. But there

remained the loud inspiratory sound throughout the chest,

Iand the tubular sounds above the left scapula; and sus-

pected that these were due to the same cause some con-

solidation in, or tumor pressing on, the inner part of the

summit of the left lung. But the signs were too equivocal to

guide to any definite opinion at that time ; and in prescribing

Ifor the patient, and in explaining to him his symptoms,

referred principally to the weakness of the circulation, pre-

scribing quinine and iron by day, and an anti- spasmodic at

night, to counteract the tendency to spasmodic breathing,

which he still occasionally felt in the mornings.

The Duchess of Somerset had written to caution me not

to alarm the patient, and that she would call later to hear
Imy opinion.
              therefore did not explain to him the nature of

his case, but advised him generally, and enjoined quiet and

moderation in exertion. The Duchess did not call as she

promised ; but a few days after, sent a messenger with a

letter, requesting me to write to her son to dissuade him from

going into Wiltshire which he intended to do. On my inquir-

Iing of this messenger how Lord St. Maur was, learnt that

he was better, but sometimes still had slight attacks of diffi-

cult breathing described as being in the throat and of a

choking character. This account again suggested to my mind

the possibility that these attacks might be of the nature of

laryngeal spasm, excited by the pressure of a tumor on the

windpipe and inferior laryngeal (or recurrent) nerves within

the chest, and such tumor would account for the tubular
I Isounds which had found above the left scapula.

fatigued, weak, and with an unsteady pulse. He told me

that, two days before, he had been again (in spite of the

warnings from Dr. Fairbank and myself) endeavouring to

improve his breath by exercise, and had walked continuously

for three hours and a-half ; that he was so much exhausted

that he could eat no dinner, and took only soup and mulled

claret. Next morning, on awaking, he was attacked with a

severe fit of difficult breathing, which ' almost suffocated him.'

He had felt exhausted and weak ever since, and had been able

to take very little solid food. This morning he awoke feeling
faint, and on rising had another severe attack of ' choking '

difficulty of breathing, which so much weakened him as to

oblige him to postpone his journey for two hours. He said

Ithat he had borne the journey pretty well.

     On listening to the chest, heard the inspiratory sound

loud in every part, and somewhat harsh in tone, especially at
the upper parts of the chest, as if from some constriction of

the trachea; but there was no laryngeal stridor, or even

hoarseness (such as would be present in laryngitis). The

Itubular sounds were still distinct above and within the left

shoulder-blade, but could neither hear nor feel abnormal

pulsation in any part, which would give conclusive evidence of

the existence of aneurism.

Still the increased harshness and almost tracheal character

of the breath-sound in the upper parts of the chest, and the

recurrence of fits of difficult breathing, which, from the last

description, seemed more clearly to have been laryngeal (in
the throat), increased my suspicion as to the existence of an
Iintrathoracic tumor. 1
                            expressed my apprehensions to the

Duchess, and proceeded to explain that her son's condition

Iwas so serious as to require much more care and attention
than he had hitherto received.  ascertained that he had seen

Duchess that in future he must be constantly watched by a

cause cough and more or less permanent difficulty of breathing, by impeding
the passage of air to the lungs ; and by pressing on certain nerves which
regulate the muscles which open and shut the glottis (or opening into the top
of the windpipe) may also cause spasm of the glottis, a more severe difficulty
of breathing in fits, which, when intense and prolonged, often prove fatal.
SUDDEN SUMMONS AND PROMPT ATTENDANCE. 355

Iincreasing in severity.  urged that he must be strictly

restrained from all exertion, not only from the long walks

which had been so injurious to him, but even from the exer-

tion of going up and down stairs, and therefore that all his
Iapartments should be on one floor.
                                     pointed out the need of

his having frequent supplies of such food and light wine as he

was able to take. His inability to eat much solid food had

Iadded to his weakness, and advised that more of the soups

and such nutriment should be supplied. To prevent the

faintness which seemed to have brought on the severe spasm

Ion the morning of this day, recommended that some egg-

flip (an egg beaten up with a dessert spoonful of brandy and
a little boiling water added) should be given him on first
awaking in the morning.

    In reference to my requisition that Lord St. Maur should

have more regular and constant medical attendance, the

Duchess asked me to find for him an experienced medical
Iman to reside in the house.
                                replied that it might not be
Ieasy to find one immediately, but that would make inquiries,
Iand, if possible, get one to come on the next day (Sept. 30)

in time for my visit, which arranged to be at three o'clock.
I told the Duchess that Lord St. Maur must not return to

IBulstrode, as he was obviously very weak, and required rest ;

and it was necessary that should have a further opportu-

nity of investigating his case, which was still one of some

obscurity.

      The Duchess showed me a back room on the ground floor

where a bed might be prepared for him. It was small but

Ilofty, and said it would do for the present; and having

prescribed a tonic of ammonia and citrate of iron, and an

anti-spasmodic pill of stramonium and compound galbanum,

I took my leave.

On the morning of the 80th of September, at a quarter

before nine, a message was brought to me, written on a scrap

of paper, to the effect that Earl St. Maur had fallen on the

floor in a fit of difficult breathing. I immediately went up-
Istairs for a bottle of chloroform, and then taking a cab

arrived in Dover Street before nine.

     think it well to mention that my statement can be proved

by the testimony of two of my servants, who received the

message, and two of my daughters, who were at breakfast with

me when the message was given to me, and saw me leave the

house. My return to my house at ten can be attested by two

of my servants. Also Dr. Hardinge, in a letter to me, writes :

I I I' was sent for about 8.15 ; you came about 9.' This tho-

roughly demonstrable fact, that went as soon as received tlie

summons, entirely refutes the charges of neglect made and

reiterated several times throughout the libel. There are

several other errors with regard to time; showing that the
mind of the Duchess must indeed have been a ' chaos ' when

Ishe wrote the libel.)

     On my arrival, learned that Lord St. Maur had passed a

quiet night, and on awaking at eight, the egg-flip had been

brought to him, and it appeared that enough water had not

been added, for it was too strong; and, in swallowing

some distance), the spasm attacked his throat with such diffi-    ;

was found by the servant almost insensible.              Ifound Dr.

he told me that after applying the fumes of sulphuric and

chloric ether, mixed with chloroform, to the nostrils, the spasm

soon relaxed, and the patient regained his consciousness.

confirmed my previous suspicions and told Dr. H. that feared

that the attacks were caused by mediastinal tumor, probably

aneurismal, pressing on the windpipe and recurrent (or inferior
laryngeal) nerve. added that the cause could not be laryn-

mation, but only several milder fits of dyspnosa like that just

passed. To this Dr. Hardinge made no reply; and after

few minutes' further conversation, during which said that

was glad he had been able to give prompt assistance, and give

me an account of the attack, we parted on quite friendly

terms.
ABSURD IMPUTATIONS.  357

     (I mention this, because the Duchess, in the libel, has taken

Iup and dwelt much on a strange misconception that had

quarrelled with Dr. Hardinge, and ' behaved icith womanish
rudeness ' to him, which is totally without foundation. When

I Ifirst saw him, did not recognise him, not having met him

for many years, but when he told me who he was, I recollected

him, and spoke to him as an old acquaintance. So far from

being annoyed at finding him with my patient, I thought it

most natural that, residing so near, he should be called in at

this sudden attack, even before any message reached me ; and

I should have advised his continued attendance for the same
Ireason, but that, at the request of the Duchess, was in a few

hours to bring a competent medical attendant to remain con-
stantly with the patient. Dr. Hardinge, in a letter to me

/ Idated 19th November 1869, writes : ' assure you teas not at
Iall aware of any incivility on your part -when met you on the
I30th September, at the Duchess of Somerset's ; indeed, my feeling

on the subject teas quite the contrary, and have said so.' Yet
this fancied rudeness on my part towards Dr. Hardinge seems

to have originated the erroneous notion which pervades the

Ilibel, that entertained and acted under a feeling of jealousy
or rivalry towards him, and that I sacrificed the life of the

patient to this feeling a charge than which nothing could be

more absurd or more utterly without foundation. It is well

that such charges have now been ' utterly, absolutely, and un-

Ireservedly withdrawn.')

        remained after Dr. H.'s departure, and found the patient

quite free from cough and spasm, lying on his left side, with
his head quite low, and able to speak in a weak voice. The
pulse was steady, and the breathing tranquil, but it was now
accompanied with a laryngeal sound. He told me that he had

neglected to take the anti-spasmodic pill the night before, but
had slept pretty well, and felt no difficulty of breathing until
the too strong egg-flip set him coughing, and as he was alone,

he made a great effort to reach the bell-rope, which brought
on the spasm, under which he fell out of bed, and lost his

recollection, remaining on the floor till Dr. Hardinge arrived.

IHe said he was now quite easy, and did not think it right to

disturb him with any further examination.
358 DANGER OBVIOUS CAUTIONS.

The Duchess seemed so fully aware of the serious nature

of this formidable attack, that it appeared to me quite unne-

cessary to make a formal announcement of it. In fact, the

that he should not again be left alone, as he was in the morn-

from which he was suffering was a deep-seated tumor in the chest,

most probably aneurism, which, by pressing on the windpipe,

caused the habitual shortness of breath, cough, and pain of

early in August, and the last of which was that which hadI;

just taken place, and was witnessed by medical man for the

first time.

St. Maur was the subject of formidable and intractable

                                        a
disease, had to consider how could best perform the painful

duty of fully communicating my fears to the Duchess and

other relatives.                had already begun to prepare her Grace by

saying that feared that the cause of the attack was tumor

Iin the chest, pressing on the windpipe and its nerves, and
again expressed this apprehension this morning; but I had

not explained the formidable nature of the suspected malady,
and of the fearful results to which it would probably lead. On

consideration, I thought it better to defer the complete an-

nouncement of my opinion of the probable nature of the case

Iuntil my visit in the afternoon, when expected to have an

opportunity of further examination.
     Another reason for this delay, was that the Duchess,

although greatly alarmed at the morning attack, supposing

her son to be dying, yet asked me no questions as to the reality
or amount of danger, and as her Grace complained of con-
fusion in her head, her heart complaint, and the fatigue and

Ianxiety which she had gone through in the last two hours,

judged it unadvisable prematurely to increase her alarm.
Further, there appeared to be no relative or friend with her to

Icomfort or support her, only servants, and those few and by

no means efficient. In the afternoon, expected that there

would be the comfort of having a medical attendant constantly
at hand, to give aid and direction in all the serious contingen-
cies which the suspected disease might entail in its course.
These considerations led me to defer till the afternoon the full
announcement of my opinion. Did the nature of the malady
and the particular course of this case justify me in this delay ?
Could the speedily fatal result have been foreseen, or had it

been even probable, the unfavourable opinion should have been

announced without consideration of feelings or convenient
seasons. But, in addition to the uncertainty as to the correct-

ness of this opinion, my experience and reading with regard

to cases of the supposed disease enable me to affirm, with some

confidence, that so speedily fatal a result could NOT have been
foreseen ; and that it was not a probable, but an exceptional
result. Even the most rapidly fatal of intrathoracic tumors,

aneurisms of the aorta, commonly last, with symptoms more
or less urgent, for several weeks, and sometimes for months,

before they destroy life ; and other tumors, glandular and

malignant, are usually still slower in their course. In Lord
St. Maur's case, on the other hand, except one severe attack
in August, for which he saw Dr. Fail-bank only three times,
360 ARRANGEMENTS AND LAST VISIT

there had been no urgent symptoms until after his long walk

on the 27th of September, only three days ago. There had
been only a few slight attacks before this period ; and in the

last two days there had been only one on each morning, more
severe certainly, but in each case it had passed off without
any special treatment. Even the much more formidable spasm
of this morning, intense and dangerous as it must have been,

yielded readily to the simple remedy of applying to the nostrils

the vapour of ether and chloroform ; and might be ascribed
rather to the aggravating circumstances that brought it on,

than to the advancement and extent of the organic disease.

IBy the careful avoidance of all such circumstances, had

reason to hope that the attack might be averted, at least till

the following morning, that being the time of the day in which

it had hitherto occurred. Therefore, not anticipating any

Iearly return of the dangerous symptoms, judged it safe, and

more considerate to the feelings of the Duchess, to defer the

full announcement of my opinion, and of the nature and
prospects of the case, till the afternoon. After watching the

patient for some time, and observing his tranquillity and the

Iease of his breath, prescribed a composing anti- spasmodic
Imixture of Valerian, ether, and chloroform, and left him about

ten, promising to return soon after three, when expected to

provide his special medical attendant.
IAbout noon, when
                       was engaged with my morning

patients, the following note (unsigned) was brought from the

Duchess :                               20 Dover Street.
   DEAR DB. WILLIAMS,

            St. Maur has vomited much, and got hardly anything down.
He complains of faintness.

   I immediately wrote in reply, to the effect that if the

breathing was easy, the vomiting had probably been a relief ;

and that the faintness would subside on giving chicken broth,
and arrowroot with a very little brandy, in small quantities,

at frequent intervals. As the symptoms did not indicate

I Idanger, and was engaged in important consultations, did

not think it necessary to visit the patient before the time

Iappointed, and sent word to that effect.
BEFORE SUDDEN ATTACK.        361

IAs soon as I had finished with my morning patients,

drove to St. George's Hospital to find a medical attendant for
Earl St. Maur. After making inquiries, Mr. Jones, the resi-

dent medical officer, strongly recommended to me Mr. Barker,

who had formerly been house surgeon, and had subsequently

I Ihad much experience in both medicine and surgery. To him

  mentioned that suspected intrathoracic tumor in the case,

which he would have charge of; and appointed him to meet

me in Dover Street at half-past three.

    I arrived in Dover Street about a quarter after three. The

Duchess told me that she expected me at twelve, and that she

had again sent for Dr. Hardinge, and that he remained a long
Itime expecting me to come.
                             reminded her Grace that both
Ithis morning and on the evening before, had fixed the time
Iof my visit at or soon after three, and that had been so much
Iengaged with important consultations that could not come
Ibefore. Her only reply was, ' My head is so confused, am

losing all my memory.'

Her Grace said that Lord St. Maur had had no return of

the difficult breathing, and that the vomiting soon ceased. She

did not tell me what remedies Dr. Hardinge had used, but said

that he had expressed his opinion that the case was one of

I Ilaryngitis. On this remarked that did not think that he

would hold that opinion if he were made aware of the previous

history, and of the total absence of the usual symptoms of

inflammation of the larynx. 1 But I neither expressed nor felt

any displeasure or dissatisfaction at his having been again called

in ; and so far from being jealous of him, if his presence could

be a comfort to the Duchess in my absence, and before the

   1 I really did not at that time suppose that Dr. Hardinge could maintain

this opinion, formed only from this day's observation of the case, when the
recent attack made the patient unable to bear a proper examination. The
whole previous history of the case, the absence of hoarseness or other per-
manent affection of the voice, except in and after the paroxysms of dyspnoea,

the absence of any laryngeal cough or breathing, and of pain or tenderness in
the larynx, and the possession of a clear, strong voice, completely negative the

notion that the case was one of laryngitis. Many of the most eminent
physicians and surgeons in London, who were to give evidence at the trial,
unanimously agreed on this point, that whatever doubt might remain as to
the true nature of the disease, it certainly could not be laryngitis or laryngeal

ulcer.
362 DESPERATE SUFFOCATION.

Iarrival of the permanent medical attendant, was rather

Ipleased than otherwise that he had been there.
         found the patient stronger, and able to sit up in bed.

He told me that the vomiting was brought on by his drinking

too much mulled claret a beverage not ordered by me, and

not proper for him, if made, as usual, hot with spice. On

making a further slight examination of the front of the chest,

I heard still the slight laryngeal sound noticed in the morning,
and the harsh inspiratory sound down the chest. I also with

one finger gently touched the outside of the larynx, asking if

it was tender. He replied quietly, ' a little on the left side.'

The breathing was then quite tranquil. Finding his pulse

I Iflagging, advised him to take some chicken broth, and went

into the adjoining room to Mr. Barker, who had just arrived.

I believe that the Duchess alone was with the patient. After
I had been three or four minutes conversing with Mr.

Barker, we were hastily called to Lord St. Maur, whom we

Ifound struggling with the most severe laryngeal spasm that

ever witnessed. He was breathing with tremendous eifort,

with a tight hissing noise in the larynx, and throwing his arms

about in great distress. In a hoarse whisper, he said, ' Do

Isomething for me, or shall die.' These were his last words.

Immediately after, the eyes were fixed in a wide stare, with

pupils largely dilated, 1 and the whole powers and consciousness

seemed concentrated in the violent efforts to breathe through
Ithe almost closed glottis.
                                  tried to give him ether and water,

which was at hand, but now the swallowing was difficult, and

Isoon could get nothing into his mouth. Mr. Barker and
I then plied the nostrils with ether vapour from a handker-

chief, which is well known to be the most effectual way of

applying it.

     Seeing no symptoms of relief, and feeling sure that the

spasm must soon end in suffocation, I said to Mr. Barker,

' Tracheotomy is the only chance.' He assented, and, going

1 This remarkable dilatation of the pupils continued till the patient's
Ideath ; but after the operation
                                  observed one pupil (I think the left) much
Imore dilated than the other, and pointed this out to Mr. Holmes, as having

been described as a symptom of intrathoracic tumour, pressing on portions of
the great sympathetic nerve. Dr. John Ogle, Medico-Chirurg. Trans., Vol. 42,

TRACHEOTOMY ONLY CHANCE.  363

Ioutside the door, begged him to go as quickly as possible for

the nearest, operating surgeon of eminence, mentioning Mr.
Caesar Hawkins and Mr. Pollock, in Grosvenor Street, as the

Inearest which could think of. On his way, Mr. Barker
I Irecollected Mr. Holmes, of Clarges Street, as nearer.

     In the meantime, was doing all that could do to sustain

life ;' applying ether vapour to the nostrils ; wetting the throat
and upper chest with ether, and covering it with my hands to

cause a strong burning sensation on the surface ; pressing the

chest at each expiration to help the now shortening breath :

for the insensibility was now complete, the face ghastly pale

and covered with cold sweat, the pulse very weak and irregular,
w'hilst the hissing noise in the larynx showed that the spasm

was as tight as ever. Then returned Mr. Barker, and an-
nounced ' Mr. Holmes, surgeon to St. George's Hospital,' who
was accompanied by Mr. T. H. Smith, surgeon, of John Street,
Berkeley Square. As these gentlemen, breathless with haste,

went to the other end of the room to make preparations for

Ithe operation, turned to the Duchess, who was behind me,

and said, distinctly and emphatically : ' The only chance of
MI ring his life is by making an opening in the windpipe, and Mr.
Holmes is come to do this.' 2

     1 The nurse can attest this, in refutation of the assertion in the libel that
' Dr. W. did nothing, said nothing,' &c. She also, as well as myself, positively
denies the truth of the statement that we ' let the patient drop back like a log

of wood.'
   2 The nurse (Mrs. Burfoot) who was with me, tending the patient, distinctly

Iheard me say these words, and can attest the fact. It may be asked why

did not earlier apprise the Duchess of the proposed operation before Mr. Barker

Iwent for the surgeon. One reason for not doing so was, that was so en-
Igrossed in watching, and, so far as was possible, ministering to the almost

dying patient, that dared not turn from him for one instant to explain and

Idiscuss the question of the operation. A second reason was, that really

thought that it would be more painful and agitating to her Grace's feelings to

be told of the operation beforehand, and to be kept in dreadful anxiety lest the

surgeon should not arrive in time, than to be made acquainted with this last

resource of art only on the arrival of the surgeon, with the certainty that his

aid was at once available. When after death the Duchess reproached me with

Inot having asked her permission for the performance of the operation, re-

minded her Grace of my having given her this intimation. Her Grace was

understood, both by Mr. Holmes and myself, to admit the fact, her Grace's

complaint simply being, ' But you did not tell me it was an operation.' I

replied to this effecj;, ' was this a time for explanations when your son was, so
far as we knew, dying ? '
364 RELIEF ONLY PARTIAL.

   I then turned round immediately to attend to the almost

dying patient, and I did not hear the Duchess make any reply

there was neither word nor sign of objection and im-

mediately the Duchess joined us in giving directions for the

operation, and for moving the bed on which the patient lay,

to the window at the other end of the room.

When the incision was made into the windpipe, the patient

showed not the least sign of feeling, as all the surgeons can

Itestify. His features were unchanged, and his hand, which

held, was motionless. Little more than an ounce of blood

flowed from the wound a trifling amount for this operation.

At first little air passed by the opening. Mr. Holmes then

applied his lips to the wound to suck out any blood that might

have flowed into the trachea, but little came. After a few

minutes, the air passed more freely, and the laryngeal breath-

ing ceased, and there was now a manifest improvement in all

the symptoms. The pulse improved in strength and steadi-

ness. The livid pallor of the lips and cheeks gave place to a

little colour. The face and hands, which had been quite cold

and clammy, regained some warmth. There was no return of

consciousness.

   IStill was grieved to see that the relief, although apparent,

was by no means so complete as it usually is in successful

cases of tracheotomy. The breathing was still laborious ; !

the spaces between the ribs and above the collar-bones (techni-

cally termed the intercostal and supra- clavicular spaces) were

drawn in at each inspiration, proving that there was an ob-

struction in the windpipe below the artificial opening such,

in fact, as could be produced only by an aneurismal or other
Itumor pressing on the lower part of the windpipe.
                                                    expressed

to Mr. Holmes my fears thus unhappily confirmed, and that

we must not look for complete or permanent relief, and he

    1 Messrs. Holmes, Barker, and Smith all attest that the breathing was still
laborious. Mr. Barker observed the drawing in of these intercostal and supra-
clavicular spaces. Mr. Holmes remembers observing that the first intercostal
or infra-clavicular space was drawn in. This laborious state of breathing
made it necessary to supply air as pure and fresh as possible from the open
window, as in all cases of extreme difficulty of breathing. The exposure to
cold thereby, (complained of in the libel,) was too short to be injurious, and
was counteracted by warm flannels, which were applied as soon as they could

be procured.
DEATH RETROSPECT.  365

took the same view, both as regards the existence and nature

of the obstruction, and the probable result.

      The spasm of the glottis had been completely relieved.
There was no longer the hissing noise in the throat ; and by
a lighted match we found that air passed both by the wound
and through the nostrils, but there was an insufficient supply
of air to the lungs. The jaws were no longer firmly clenched,

Iand some power of swallowing was regained, so that was

enabled to give in spoonfuls warm chicken broth, and brandy
and barley water ; l and these supplies had a manifest effect

in restoring strength to the pulse and warmth to the surface,

after intervals of flagging, which recurred several times.

About an hour after the operation, the closure of the jaws
returned, and prevented the supply of nourishment : we
endeavoured to remedy this by introducing a cork between

the teeth, but with only partial success ; and the flagging of
the pulse and inequality of the respiration became more
evident. At about a quarter after five, there was a slight
indication of returning consciousness. The patient turned

 his head first on one side, then on the other, and the Duchess
 then spoke to him a few words in a loud voice, and he looked
 round with something like intelligence. 2 But this was but
 the flickering of the lamp before its final extinction, for hi a

 few minutes the pulse became weaker and slower, and then

 stopped ; and lastly the respiration slackened, and, after a few
 gasps, ceased, about an hour and twenty minutes after the
 performance of the operation.

     On taking a retrospect of this melancholy history, thus

   1 (The assertion in the libel that I clicked tlie patient ivith chicken broth is

an absurdity ; as every medical man knows that the artificial opening below

Iin the windpipe rendered choking that is, stopping the breath in the throat

impossible. It was equally false that ' choked every effort to speak.' There

was neither power to speak, with a hole in the windpipe, nor even conscious-
ness, to make the effort.)

     2 The partial or complete restoration of intelligence shortly before death
has been noticed in several diseases. Supposing this case to have been one of
aneurism of the arch of the aorta, and that the suffocation was brought on by
the sudden swelling of the aneurism, that swelling would diminish when the
failure of the heart's power reduced the arterial pressure ; and with this
diminution there might be a partial recovery of consciousness.
 366 FATAL TRUTH PROGRESSIVELY REVEALED.

terminating in death with such awful rapidity, I can explain

 its course and its symptoms throughout, only on the sup-
 position that there was an aneurism 1 of the arch of the aort<t,
 probably at its posterior aspect, which by pressing on the
 windpipe and left recurrent nerve, produced difficult breath-
 ing, both constant and in paroxysms, and that this aneurism,
 in the last three days of the patient's life, increased with such
 fearful rapidity as to give little time for investigation or warn-
 ing, during the short period of twenty-four hours, when the
 patient was under medical care ; that is, from six P.M. of the

I29th, when saw the patient for the second time, to half-past

 five P.M. of the 30th, when he died.

       The existence of an intrathoracic tumor was recognised as
a possibility on my first examination on the 21st, but it

Ibecame probable only when first heard of the slight attacks

of difficult breathing becoming somewhat of a laryngeal or
choking character (about the 23rd or 24th). The fatal walk
of three and a-half hours on the 27th obviously gave a sudden
increase to the disease ; the fits of difficult breathing becoming
more intense, and the general health and strength suffering
more in consequence. Therefore, when the patient came
under my observation for the second time, on the evening of
the 29th, although the physical signs were still not conclusive,

yet the fits of decided laryngeal dyspnosa (difficult breathing),
made them more significant, and warranted me in entertain-
ing and expressing my fears as to the existence of a tumor,
and in insisting on the necessity of more constant medical
attendance, and of more rigid injunctions to avoid all undue
exertion and exhaustion in future. On my third visit, at nine
in the morning of the 30th, when the attack of laryngeal
dyspnoaa had been witnessed for the first time by a profes-
sional observer, the probability of its cause being a tumor

     1 An aneurism is a swelling of an artery into a pouch or sac, from the yielding
of a portion of the coats of the artery. Such swelling or tumor pulsates with
each beat of the heart, which keeps it always distended with blood ; and this
distension tends to enlarge the tumor, which, pressing on the adjoining parts,
may irritate, compress, and displace them in various ways, and may thus
cause distressing and fatal disease, or may end by the rupture of the tumor
and sudden death by hemorrhage. Aneurism affecting the aorta, the great
artery of the body, is one of the most intractable and fatal of diseases.
FAILURE OF LAST RESOURCE.                                                                              367

within the chest was increased; and although its greater

intensity might be in some measure ascribed to the unfortu-

nate accident of the patient's falling out of bed, in his effort

to ring the bell when choked with the strong brandy and egg,
yet the severity of the paroxysm, and the persistence for the

first time of a slight laryngeal breathing after
a                                                                                                      seemed to
                                                                  it,
point out progressive increase of the disease.

     But the strongest evidence (short of post mortem inspection)
of the seat and fatal nature of the disease occurred during my

fourth and final visit, after three P.M. on the same day, 30th.

Outstripping all calculation, this strangling spasm this awful

death-blow fell after an interval of seven hours only from

the last attack, instead of twenty-four, as in former instances.

Nothing could exceed its overwhelming intensity, for in the

course of two or three minutes of frightful struggle for breath

through tight hissing glottis, the voice was reduced to
a                                                                                                      aa

              ;
                                                                            ;

                                                                                 ;
                                                                                                    ;
hoarse whisper, then silenced for ever; the eyes fixed in

ghastly stare, with widely dilated pupils the face overspread

with the pallid hue and clamminess of death the features

set in rigidity the jaws firmly closed and consciousness so

suspended that even the surgeon's knife elicited neither move-

ment nor sound.

     And the operation gave yet another proof of the real seat

and nature of the disease. It analysed that state of suffoca-

tion, and proved that had twofold cause. No sooner was
                 it

                             a

air admitted through the opening in the windpipe, than the

laryngeal hissing ceased. There was no longer spasm of the

glottis, and air passed by the nostrils as well as by the new

aperture. And hence there were some signs of returning life.

The pulse gamed strength and steadiness, some colour and

warmth returned to the lips and face. The jaws relaxed, and

liquids put into the mouth were distinctly swallowed. But

the breathing, although not stridulous (hissing), was laboured

still. At each inspiratory effort the spaces between the ribs

and above the collar-bones became concave from atmospheric

pressure, which found no sufficient entrance to the lungs

through the windpipe, being still obstructed by something

below the artificial opening. What could this be but the
368 HISTORY RETRACED.

tumor still pressing on the lower part of the windpipe ? 1
The operation had relieved the spasm of the glottis, caused
by the pressure of the tumor on the recurrent nerves. But
it could not resolve another element of the strangling disease,
the tumor bodily compressing the tube of the windpipe itself.
This remained beyond the reach of any remedy ; and to its
continued impediment to respiration, together probably with
exhaustion of the powers of the heart, "weakened by the long
struggle, must be ascribed the inadequacy of the operation
and the death of the sufferer.

     But in tracing the evidences of the unusually rapid and
unexpected increase of the disease in this case, do we not go
far to prove that nothing but aneurism could run such a
course ? Other intrathoracic tumors, simple or malignant
growths, or glandular swellings, do not increase with anything
like such rapid strides. But aneurism may be quick or slow
in its increase, according to the influences to which it is
exposed by the constitution and habits of the patient. Ex-
cessive or long-continued exertion, excitement, and irregular
living, will most surely hasten its course. Quietude of body
and mind, with healthy but careful habits, generally retard
the increase and fatal tendencies of aneurisms, and in a few
cases lead to their obliteration and cure.

     My distinguished friend and colleague, Liston, the surgeon,

Iwas carried off in the prime of his life and reputation by the

same kind of aneurism as that which believe to have been
the disease of Earl St. Maur. Of robust frame, and delight-
ing in his strength, he indulged his passion for athletic exer-
cises in no measured degree, and was also what may be called a

high liver. In this career he was attacked with choking fits,

more than once relieved by haemorrhage. Although strongly
and repeatedly warned, he would not abandon his favourite
exercises, and in six months the strong man was a corpse. 2

    It is not improbable that Lord St. Maur's disease may

have had its origin in that hard ride, in a fit of anger, in
Morocco, eighteen months ago, which he mentioned to me in

     1 The reader will observe that my letter to the Duke of 30th September,
given further on, supplies documentary evidence that such was my opinion.

his first visit. It brought on violent palpitation, to which he

was not otherwise subject ; and he thought his breath shorter

from that time. Some time later succeeded the dry cough
and frequent pain in the chest, and which yet did not deter
him from persevering in long wralks and rides, which he fancied
wore good for him. Then came the first warning, in the fit
of suffocation, brought on by rapier exercise, in which he felt

' as if he must die.' It can hardly be doubted that this was a

laryugeal spasm. Wisely warned after this by Dr. Fairbank,
he seems to have been afterwards more quiet in his habits,

until the 27th of September, when, regardless of the warnings

Iwhich had so recently repeated, he took that fatal walk of

three and a-half hours, which, in all probability, caused an in-
crease of the aneurismal tumor, and brought it into a state

of dangerous activity. Each successive attack of spasm with
laborious breathing would be likely to further distend the
tumor, especially that of the morning of the 30th, aggravated,
as it must have been, by his violent effort to ring the bell, and
his consequent fall on the floor in a senseless state. Yet, even
after this, the breathing was so easy, with only a slight laryn-

geal sound, and the voice so clear and strong, that there was
no obvious evidence of the impending danger up to the moment
of the last attack. That attack, commencing with intense

laryngeal spasm and breath-struggle of tremendous force,
must itself have caused a sudden increase in the size of the

aneurism, so that when the operation removed the laryngeal
spasm, there was evidence of the tumor still pressing on the
lower part of the windpipe with fatal persistence, and destroy-

ing all hopes of a favourable issue.

    It was only the overpowering violence of that attack that

drove me to the necessity of advising the operation, as the last

and only resource. It was not a case in which much could

be expected from it ; and in the absence of urgent symptoms,
its performance could not be contemplated. In the morning

of the BOth, I had no expectation that it would be required ;

and in tho afternoon, when the last attack came on so unex-

pectedly and overwhelmingly, I recommended it as the last and

only chance of prolonging life. Death was imminent. This
offered the only means of averting which possibly might

do, unpromising as the case was, for a few hours perchance,

Ieven days.

        knew that the operation, skilfully performed, was free
from danger. In the then state of the patient it could give
but little pain. As it proved, it gave no pain whatever ; and
it assuredly did prolong life for more than an hour, more
than enough to have saved the patient, but for the existence
of deeper disease, which lay beyond the reach of any
remedy.

It may be observed that in the preceding narrative, which

has been most scrupulously and carefully recorded, there is

no mention of any manifestation of dissatisfaction or distrust

on the part of the Duchess towards myself. Nor was I aware

in the least degree that Her Grace was not fully confiding in

the good faith and skill of the physician, who was entrusted

with the care of her only son suffering from a very obscure and

dangerous malady, and who spared no pains, and wrought to

the best of his ability, to do what the resources of art enabled

him to do. Throughout this short but anxious and painful

history, my conscience is clear that I acted with good faith,

from pure motives, and -to the best of my judgment. The

case was very obscure at first ; but during the very few days

when it was brought under my observation, its serious nature

was discovered and distinctly announced ; and in its rapid
                           it
                                                                if,
strides to its fatal end,  outstripped all calculations, and

gave no time for adequate warning or preparation, this must
be referred to the inscrutable decrees of Him who holds in

His own hands the issues of life and of death.
    It was, therefore, to my utter astonishment that, when all

was over, and was beginning to express my heartfelt sympathy

with the Duchess under this dreadful stroke, Her Grace began

to upbraid me in such terms of accusation and reproach as

do not think proper to repeat. Suffice      to say, that thus

began some of those absurd and groundless charges which
were afterwards repeated and enlarged on, in the libel, charges

arising from ignorance and misconception at time when, as

Her Grace's learned counsel says, her mind was frenzied,'

and was chaos incapable of fixed thought.'
POST-MORTEM INSPECTION REFUSED.  371

     These charges have now ; been ' utterly, absolutely, and
unreservedly withdrawn.' Having become convinced that the

impressions on which these charges were grounded were erro-
neous, the Duchess of Somerset assures me, through her

Icounsel, that she no longer believes them ; and he adds, ' do,

therefore, on her behalf, frankly and freely, and most unre-
servedly withdraw all those imputations which reflect on the
professional honour and character of Dr. Williams. '

      The narrative cannot be brought to a close without the
mention of one act on the part of the Duke and Duchess

which cannot be too deeply regretted under the circumstances
   they refused to permit an examination after death. This

procedure is one which ought never to be omitted in any case
of obscurity or doubt, being proper not only for the interests of
science, but also for the object of supplying information which
is valuable in the physical history of a family. But in a case
involving serious questions reflecting on the character and
skill of the medical attendants of the deceased, an examination

after death offers the only conclusive means of demonstrating
the true nature of the case, and the real cause of death. Its
performance, therefore, in such a case, becomes a positive duty,
and the refusal to permit it incurs a serious reprehensibility.

    In the presence of Mr. Holmes and Mr. Barker, I urged on

the Duchess the duty and necessity of her allowing this ex-
amination to be made. My application wras refused ; and a
message to the same effect, conveyed to the Duchess through
her daughter, Lady Ulrica Thynne, was equally negatived.

    IIn the evening of the same day, wrote the following letter

to the Duke of Somerset :

               49 UPPER BROOK STREET : Sept. BOth, 1809.

MY LORD DUKE,

Nothing less than a strong sense of duty induces me to

Iintrude on your Grace's attention in the moment of severe affliction ;

but think that your Grace must perceive how important it is for
the family and all concerned, that the real nature of Earl St. Maur's

disease should bo jistvrtiiiiied by post mortem inspection. That the

death was caused by an obstruction to the free entry of air into the

lungs, is certain ; and it was not less evident to those who wit-

nessed the last attack that nothing less than tracheotomy could give

               J! 11 2
372 VINDICATION BY LAW NECESSARY.

a chance of relief. The failure of this measure leaves little doubt

I Ithat the obstruction was below, out of reach of the operation, being

caused by what mentioned to the Duchess was fearful of a deep
seated tumor, pressing on the windpipe and its nerves.

     But certainty cannot be attained without examination, which
would cause no disfigurement or mutilation of the corpse ; and
the knowledge to be thus obtained is valuable, not only to medical
science, but especially in the history of a family, as showing the true
nature of the diseases to which it is liable.

   I trust that these considerations will induce your Grace to
Iacquiesce in my proposal ; and with sincere condolence, remain,

                                           My Lord Duke,
                                                     Yours faithfully,

                                                      C. J. B. WILLIAMS.

    To his Grace the Duke of Somerset,
              Bulstrode Park, Gerrard's Cross.

   ITo this letter received no reply.

    IIn concluding this pamphlet, have now only to say a few
Iwords to explain why it became necessary that should bring

this action against the defendants. No one who has read the
libel (and as the Solicitor-General thought proper to read it
entire in Court, it has been reported and spread through the
length and breadth of the land) can fail to agree with the

learned Judge (Mr. Baron Bramwell), who said : ' Dr. Williams

certainly could not have done otherwise than bring the action
he lias done, because, as you must have heard, really it is a
libel upon him in every way, one may say, as a professional

gentleman.' And knowing as I did for a certainty that not

only would the defendants be wholly unable to justify their
charges, but also that the facts and assertions on which these
charges were founded could in every instance be proved to be

utterly erroneous and untrue, I considered that a court of law

would afford the only satisfactory means of completely vindi-
cating my character from the attack which had been made
on the gravity of which, as has been withdrawn, need not
now be dwelt on.

      One concluding word on the personal and professional
bearings of such case of libel on the conduct, skill, and
it,

character of a medical man. I have now been practising

my profession as a consulting physician during the last forty
years, and never, among the thousands and tens of thousands
of patients who have been under my care, has there occurred
one instance in which, not merely has any such unheard-of

charge as this recent one, but has any serious complaint what-
ever, been made, against my professional character and skill.

I have been called on to minister in scenes more heartrending,

and amid sufferings far more agonising, than those of the

death-bed of the heir of the house of Somerset ; and although
not less successful than others of my brethren in mitigating

Iwoe and in warding off the stroke of death, yet, in common

with others, have had to struggle unsuccessfully with the
destroyer in those, in this mortal life, common cases of intract-

able and fatal disease, where vain is the help of man ; and my
endeavours, having been faithful and earnest, have been always

Iappreciated, however unsuccessful. And this, believe, is only

what is the common experience of my professional brethren,
and it is what we all have a right to expect from those who
entrust their health, or that of their relatives, to our care,

that there should be, between the physician and the patient
and his friends, that mutual candour and confidence which

prevent all concealments and misunderstandings ; and whilst
all means are used which human skill and attention can apply,
we should all be ever ready to acknowledge that results are

determined by an overruling and an allwise Power.

                   PREFACE TO THE ' AUTHENTIC NARRATIVE.

     The trial in the case of Williams v. the Duke and Duchess of
Somerset having been brought to a sudden termination by the
Defendants, through their counsel making, and my leading counsel
accepting, their complete and unreserved retractation of, and apology
for, all the charges and imputations in the libel circulated by Her
Grace the Duchess of Somerset, no opportunity was afforded to me
personally to explain the real history of the case, and to disprove in
detail the serious mis-statements of facts which the libel contained.

IIf and my witnesses had been examined in Court, this explanation

and correction would have been complete ; but my leading counsel
undertook by himself to represent my case in his opening speech,
and when this speech was made, it appeared to myself and to all my
friends who were in Court, a very imperfect statement of the case,
and quite insufficient to supply the place of such evidence as myself
and witnesses were prepared to give.

     ' The Complete Ketractation and Apology were accepted with nominal
Damages, in lieu of Full Damages, which were laid at 15.000Z. Defendants
had to pay all costs, amounting probably to between 2.000Z. and 3,0002.
376 COMPLETE VINDICATION NECESSARY.

     The want of this evidence is the more to be regretted, as the
libel, with all its errors and mis-statements, written as it was, when

the mind of the writer was, as her learned counsel states, ' a chaos

incapable of fixed thought,' was published in full in several of the

daily journals, and in one without even the interspersed comments

of the Solicitor-General. This renewed and extensive publication of

the libel, notwithstanding its complete retractation in Court, and in

the presence of the Duke and Duchess of Somerset, has produced,

on the minds of some persons, an erroneous impression that my
conduct may have been such as to afford grounds of complaint.

    It is to correct such erroneous impressions, and to supply to the

medical profession and to the public those explanations which the

I ISolicitor- General informed the Court was about to give, that

have drawn up the following careful statement of the case. It will

be found to contradict, on ample evidence, all the statements in the

libel on which the chief charges are founded.

     The Narrative details the full particulars of my attendance on
Earl St. Maur, which consisted of four visits ; the three first, each

of about an hour's duration ; the last of more than two hours,

besides an interview of about an hour with the Duchess alone. It

describes the careful examination, the anxious consideration, and

the minute instructions and warnings which were given to the

patient on each and every occasion. The nature of the disease,

obscure at first, became gradually more apparent, through the

scrutiny of scientific investigation ; and was approached, if not

quite determined, by a diagnosis, which would account for all the

symptoms, and especially for the last unexpectedly rapid strides of

the disease to its fatal end.

     My conscience is clear that throughout this short but anxious

Iand painful charge, acted in good faith and to the best of my
Iability and judgment ; and have no doubt that the verdict of my
Iown profession will be in my favour. It is with feelings of deep

satisfaction that refer to the statement at the end of this Preface,

which expresses the deliberate opinion of some of the most eminent

and enlightened physicians and surgeons in this country.
     The retractation and apology of the Duke and Duchess of

Somerset in Court has ' frankly, and freely, and most unre-
servedly withdrawn ' all those imputations in the libel which

reflect on my professional honour and character. This is so far

satisfactory to me, as an act of justice, albeit somewhat tardy. It

is still more satisfactory to me to prove that all the charges and

Iimputations were, from the first, absolutely without foundation ;
but it is far more gratifying to me  feel it to be a positive honor
       PROFESSIONAL APPROVAL.                               377

   that throughout this painful and embarrassing trial, and amid

Iopposing influences of high rank and noble birth, have received
Ithe hearty support and approval of those whom most esteem and

venerate in my own honourable profession, and of my numerous

other personal friends.  CHARLES J. B. WILLIAMS.

49 UPPER BROOK STREET : March 12, 1870.

     WE, the undersigned, after a careful and anxious consideration
of the case of the late Earl St. Maur as described in detail by Dr.
Williams, desire to record our unanimous opinion that Dr. Williams's

view of the most probable nature of his Lordship's disease was
correct, and his treatment of it skilful, appropriate, and in strict

conformity with the established teachings of medical science.

DR. WILLIAMS AND THE DUCHESS OF SOMERSET. LETTER FROM

                       DR. C. J. B. WILLIAMS.

[To the Editor of the ' Medical Times and Gazette.']
ISIR,
       shall feel greatly obliged tf you will permit me, through

your columns, to offer my sincere thanks to the very many members

of the Profession, in town and country, who have favoured me with

Iletters on the subject of the late action for libel which deemed it

my duty to bring against the Duke and Duchess of Somerset.

My kind correspondents, who are too numerous to be answered

individually, have much gratified me by their unanimous expression

of approbation of my conduct, and by their general agreement with
my views in relation to the case of the late Earl St. Maur. A very

large proportion also give me the credit not only of having vindicated

my own character from the groundless and unjustifiable charges

made against me in the libel, but also of having upheld the

character of our Profession by bringing before a legal tribunal this

grave outrage on its sacredness and honour.
378 THANKS TO PROFESSIONAL FRIENDS.

     And assuredly, although in the patient exercise of our humane
calling we may be required to make due allowance for ignorance and

for infirmities of temper during hours of grief and bewildering

affliction, yet for a Practitioner who has conscientiously done his
duty in a very difficult and critical cas.e, and has acted to the best

of his abilities and judgment, to be made an object of ungrounded
reproach and atrocious calumny, is a gross breach of justice and of

good feeling, which, if allowed to pass unrebuked, would tend to sap

all that confidence and those kindly relations which ought to subsist

between a Medical man and his patients and their friends.

     Happily such cases are very rare. None such has ever occurred: if,
to me before during the forty years of my active practice. And they
will ever be rare if our Profession remains true to itself ; rising

far above that despicable servility that cringes and bows down before

rank or riches, and submits to be insulted and trampled on by arro-

gance and caprice rising, say, far above such derogatory subser-
viency, will take its proper stand on its own aristocracy of science
;

   it

                    ;I
and Christian beneficence true to the nobility of its nature and of its

aims true to the interests of its own fraternity, all its members

supporting each other and uniting for their common good thus

firmly standing and self-supporting, our noble Profession may thus
well bid defiance to all unjust and unbecoming attacks, which will

only recoil on their originators with the disgrace which they deserve.;a
     Not few of my correspondents express regret that the trial did
        I
not go through its whole course, even to the award of fitting damages
                 it                            if
by the verdict of the jury. The possibility of claiming damages was
set aside by the acceptance of the full retractation and apology made

in court but feel, in common with all my correspondents and
other friends, that would have been much better the trial had

not been stopped until the evidence of myself and other witnesses
had been heard, so as fully to refute the charges in the libel, which

was very insufficiently done in the opening speech of my leading

counsel.  I  have consequently been obliged to publish my narrative

as full contradiction to the libel, now so widely disseminated by
Ia
the Solicitor- General having read through in Court.
                        it

    have further to express my hope that the sincerity of the re-

tractation will not be vitiated by any renewal of false charges, which

Review of Libel Case. First impressions Shared by Friends Meetings for
    verification of facts Unanimous resolutions in approval of Plaintiff's
    views and treatment ; and to support him by testimony at Trial. Plaintiff
     also confident, but gratified by noble support of Friends. Defendant's
     Counsel, finding all evidence and highest authorities against him, makes
     no defence ; but offers unreserved retractation of the libel, and apology for
     its offensiveness : only pleading in palliation the mental distraction of the
     author of the libel. Publication of libel without contradicting evidence,
     rendered necessary publication of ' Authentic Narrative,' which was widely
     circulated and generally approved of as quite satisfactory. Numerous
     special congratulations and expressions of approval.

IN taking leave of the chief subject which occupied the last

Ichapter, would add a few lines to review the various feel-

ings excited by the onslaught perpetrated by this libel. As-
tonishment and indignation were my own first feelings, and
these were fully shared by all my friends and others, when
they came to know the injustice, the untruthfulness, and the
ignorance displayed in the . attack. The true facts being
made known, and the real case clear, friends soon rallied
around me. Among the first to move, were Sir Thomas
Watson, Sir George Burrows, Sir James Paget, and Dr.
 Quain ; and they were soon joined by Sir William Gull, Sir
380 VICTORY TEMPERED BY SYMPATHY AND PITY.

William Fergusson, Mr. Erichsen, and Dr. Sibson, (the last
having made aneurism of the aorta a special study). Those

eminent men held several meetings at which all the de-

tails of the case were minutely examined and discussed,

with the general result of an unanimous approval of my con-

duct throughout the case, and an agreement to give at the

trial their testimony to that effect. Sir William Jenner was

not present at the meetings, but signified his adhesion to the

conclusions, and signed the declaration.

     The comfort and satisfaction afforded me by this noble

I Isupport was more than can describe : for although had

the fullest confidence in the good faith of my intentions

and a conscientious conviction that I had acted throughout to

the utmost of my abilities, yet the blows of the attack were

so astounding in their violence, and the false accusations so

Istartling and outrageous, that to be assured by faithful and
truthful friends that     was quite in the right, was most

gratifying and cheering.

The Counsel for the Defendants, finding such an irresistible

array of facts against him, supported by the unanimous

opinion of the highest medical authorities in the country,-

made no attempt at defence ; but after the opening speech

from my leading Counsel, which concluded by declaring, with

more coarseness than dignity, that ' the plaintiff does not
want to put money in his pocket ' he makes his reply, by

'utterly, absolutely and unreservedly' retracting all that is

offensive in the libel, with an expression of extreme regret

for the pain which it had caused. That there should be an

attempt on his part to combine with this retractation and

apology, words of excuse for the writer of the libel, in con-

sideration of the distraction of her mind under the agonising

affliction of the occasion, was but natural and proper, pro-

vided it did not impair the force of the retractation ; as, apart

from her language of unfounded incrimination, the unhappy

mother in her grievous affliction must be an object of com-

miseration to all.

The trial having been brought to a sudden termination by

the Defendants through their Counsel making, and my leading

Counsel accepting, their complete and unreserved retractation

of and apology for all the charges and imputations in the libel

no opportunity was afforded to nie personally to explain the

real history of the case, and to disprove in detail the gross mis-

Istatements of facts which the libel contained. If and my

witnesses had been examined in court this explanation and cor-

rection would have been complete ; but my leading Counsel by

himself undertook to represent my case in his opening speech,

which in the opinion of myself and friends in court he did very

imperfectly ; and then (as we thought indiscreetly) read the
whole libel in court ; so that it was published with all its gross

language and false statements in the public journals through-

out the land. It became therefore absolutely necessary to

counteract the misrepresentations and false accusations thus

circulated by publishing a true statement of the facts ; which
was done in the ' Authentic Narrative ' already quoted, and

from extracts from which the preceding account has been

Icompiled. This pamphlet had a large circulation not only

among my own friends, to whom alone sent copies, but

there was a considerable demand for it in various quarters

where the matter had excited interest ; and the publication

went on to a second edition. In this was noticed a silly

attempt by a letter to the ' Times,' signed in the name of the

Solicitors of the Duke of Somerset, but disavowed by them ;

(therefore fon/cd}, impugning the accuracy of some of the
statements of the ' Authentic Narrative.' With the following

quotation from the preface to the second edition I will con-

clude the subject, of which the reader can be scarcely more
Isick, than am myself :
                             " Authentic  Narrative," in com-
     * Of the success of my

pletely vindicating my character and professional conduct

Ifrom every imputation on carefulness, good faith and skill,

have received very many most gratifying assurances from

correspondents in all parts of the country, who are unani-

mous in their approval of my proceedings ; and many also

applaud the moderation and forbearance which I have shown

in defending myself against an attack which was by no

means remarkable for those qualities. But my correspondents

generally agree that my Narrative was positively required to

clear my character in the mind of the public from the charges
382 CONGRATULATIONS DAUGHTERS ILLNESS.

which the gross mis-statements of facts in the libel would
imply, and which were neither sufficiently refuted in the
speech of the Solicitor-General, nor satisfactorily explained

Iby the terms of the retractation. Many regret (as do my-

self) that the trial did not go on, through the hearing and
sifting of evidence, to the direction and decision of the Judge
and Jury ; this would have elicited the truth, and settled the
matter far more conclusively than any retractation or apology.

      The congratulations and expressions of approval and satis-

Ifaction which received at the termination of this affair were

too numerous for record ; it was most gratifying to me to be
assured both by these and by notices in the Medical Journals

Ithat by my action and the testimony which sustained it had

vindicated the dignity of the profession, and given a salutary
lesson to all of whatever station who would dare to insult
 or calumniate it through evil temper, arrogance or ignorance.
 Others, especially among my clerical friends, pointedly ap-
 plauded the moderation and absence of mercenary considera-
 tions evinced in the termination of the trial. There were indeed

Imore calls for Christian forbearance than it is necessary to

 disclose ; and was thankful for messages of peaceful ap-
 proval sent to me, among others, by the Rev. Dr. Miller, Vicar
-of Greenwich, and by an eminent and excellent barrister, since
 Lord Chancellor, through my dear friend and patient, Miss
 Laura Oldfield.

       Satisfactory as the issue of the trial was considered to be,
 the whole affair was truly a trial to both mind and body, and my
 health was none the better for the worry, anxiety and fatigue

 which it entailed on me during several months. Happily, I

 soon became deeply engaged and interested in the completion
 of the work on Consumption, in conjunction with my son.
 This, together with the ordinary engagements, soon diverted
 the mind from unpleasant recollections, and things went on
 smoothly ; until during the summer, one of my daughters
  returned from the country with an attack of erythema nodo-
  sum, which in a few days turned to severe rheumatic fever,

 affecting many joints, and with very high temperature. It so

happened that I had then a dinner party, and Sir W. Gull

was one of the guests. On mentioning to him my daughter's

illness, he said ; ' Ah well, you must have patience, and let

the disease run its course ; and all will be well in four or five

weeks. It is useless to try to cut it short.' My experience
had been different. For many years past, both in hospital

and private practice, I had rarely failed to reduce rheumatic

fever in from three to six days, by frequent citrate of potass

and ammonia salines, and within a fortnight to complete

the cure by the addition of bark or salicine. In the present

Iinstance, by God's blessing, was equally successful. In

three days all swelling and fever had subsided the only

remaining pains, in the chest and in one hand, were relieved

by one hypodermic injection of morphia ; and within a fort-

night she was accompanying me in a tour in Scotland.

This tour was commenced by a visit to Drummond Castle

in Perthshire, which our friends, Mr. and Mrs. Winans, had

taken for the season. Mr. W. J. Winans, with his brother

Kobert, were the great American Engineers, who during the

Crimean War, constructed the principal railways in Russia, and

made a large fortune. He had been in bad health, and under

several German doctors was considered consumptive. He was

recommended to me by Dr. Rogers of St. Petersburg, and

entirely recovered his health. He was now with his family

enjoying the shooting season in the Highlands. Messrs.

Winans were the inventors and constructors of the subaqueous

I' Cigarship,' a bold and ingenious enterprise ; but have not

heard that it has ever been brought into successful operation.

After enjoying the luxurious hospitality of Drummond

Castle, we had to rough it in the crowded and not very com-

fortable hotels of Pitlochrie and other places in the Highland

route ; but having already noticed that subject, it is needless

to dwell on it further here. Suffice it to say that we returned

refreshed by the excursion of three weeks : but after the trying

time which we had passed through, we all felt that we needed

further holiday and change. This was more practicable now

on my part, us my son proved himself quite competent to take
Imy place during my absence.
                              therefore arranged to devote

a month to a short tour with my daughters to Italy, in the
384 WINTER TOUR IN ITALY.

beginning of winter. They had with their mother visited

IItaly before : but had never been further south than Milan,
Iand had yet to witness the sights and treasures of Florence,

Eome, and Naples. My time, and the limits of this volume

Ientirely forbid my attempting even a notice of them ; and
Ishall merely give a brief outline of our journey, undertaken,

think in the beginning of December 1870.

It was during the Franco-German War. Paris besieged ;

and France hardly traversable. We crossed to Ostend and found

ourselves during the journey in company with some who had

been my patients, travelling south for the winter. Sir George

Elliot, and the Archbishop of Canterbury (Tait) ; and after-
wards Professor Owen and Mr. George Pollock, bent for

Egypt. In passing Bonn, Cologne, and several other towns,

we saw plenty of French prisoners ; and the military element
bristled up at every station. A year or two before we had

passed by the Luxembourg line to Switzerland through Saar-

bruck and other towns, the thickest seat of the war : but now

we took a more northerly route to Munich, whence by the

Brenner pass over the Alps we entered Italy, and halting

successively at Verona, Mantua, and Padua long enough to

see their chief objects of interest, proceeded to Florence, the

Igalleries of which riveted and charmed us for several days.

Without attempting to describe these, would only mention

two incidents which occurred. One was a procession of

Spanish delegates in superb dresses, come to invite Prince

Amadeo to accept the Crown of Spain an affair more re-

markable for pomp and show, than for earnestness of feeling ;
   the attempt eventually ending in failure. The other occur-

rence was intense cold with a fall of snow, which made the

streets so slippery, that no carriages were to be had to take

folks to church           was Sunday). This appears to have been

but gave an unfavourable impression of the climate of

Florence. The country around was covered with snow but

disappeared as we approached Home, which we found mild and

calm enough but without the bright and brilliant sky of the

the Caesars left one of those abiding impressions never to be

erased from the memory. In the foreground were the several
masses of ruined grandeur, some in deep shades, some catching
rich orange tints of radiance from the sun, which were more
fully displayed by the cupolae and domes of the city in the

middle distance : beyond these spread the deep blue of the
Campagna, out of which, but further still, rose the fairy forms
of the distant Apennines, with shades of grey, or blue-grey,
and tender traceries of roseate light. Above, the soft Italian
sky, blending its graduated tints in harmonising glow.

     At Naples we had finer and brighter weather ; but not
without visitations of cold winds. During the week or ten

Idays of our stay there and in its neighbourhood, never saw

any smoke issue from Mount Vesuvius : only steam in vary-
ing quantity; and its cloud vanished into air at no great
distance from its point of issue. So likewise of the jets
proceeding from the fissures of Solfatara. They appeare*d
to be only steam carrying some sublimed sulphur, which
crystallised about the orifice, with an odour of sulphuretted

Ihydrogen diffused around.

        had heard before, and we were told on the spot, that in

Ia field adjoining this volcanic fissure, the ground when struck

yielded a hollow sound ; and had read somewhere, (I think

I Iin a cyclopaedia) that this was an acoustic phenomenon that

had never been explained. think that succeeded in solving

the problem. It was quite true that on smartly striking the

ground with a stout stick, the noise of the stroke seemed to
be reverberated, as by an echo : this, it was said, was from
a hollow under the ground. But the existence of any such
hollow seemed improbable. The ground consisted of earth
and loose stones, partially covered with turf without anything

like a lamina of rock to cover a hollow. I soon found that,

without striking the ground, but striking one stick against

Ianother, or clapping the hands, would produce the same

reverberatory noise. Then looked around to see if there

were any other cause for this echo ; and, sure enough, there
were several low perpendicular rocks at little distances around

the ground, and quite capable of echoing back the stroke, and
these echoes in rapid succession are sufficient to cause the

reverberatory noise in question. Any one who has noticed
the echo of his steps in walking along a narrow passage

Ibetween two high parallel walls will understand what mean.

A similar echo is heard when any short loud noise, as the

crack of a whip, is made at one end of a row of railings. So

I believe that the noise in the Solfatara field was not from

the ground at all, but from the surrounding rocks.
     We successively reconnoitred Baiae, Pozzuoli, Pompeii,

Sorrento, Salerno, and Amain. The roughness of the sea

prevented me from studying the submarine colours of Capri.
On our return from Naples we viewed from the train the chief

phenomena of the remarkable solar eclipse which heralded
our return to the cold and sunless regions of the north. We
spent our Christmas at Pisa, under the gathering of the snow
clouds, and on pushing on were snowed up for two days
at Pistoja ; blocked out from returning by Spezia and the
Riviera ; struggled through deep snow at Parma ; at night
crossed the Alps again by the Brenner Pass, with less snow
but more severe frost, and in intense cold arrived at Munich
early on New Year's Day. There we found that, by ill-luck,
our luggage had been left at Kufstein, the Bavarian frontier,

from our not having understood the notice that it was to be
examined there. We telegraphed for it to be forwarded ; but

Ieveryone was so engrossed in the fete of the day, that there

seemed little chance of getting it : so started off by the next

Itrain back to Kufstein, a distance of 40 or 50 miles ; and a

pretty day's work had of it ! The same feting and carousing
was going on at every station, in which the conductors, porters,
engine drivers, and stokers joined, whilst the poor passengers
were kept shivering in the long stoppages, without hot water

Ifor the foot warmers, hardly able to get a morsel of food by

the way. It was late evening when got back to Munich,

and it was only by a brisk walk from the station that I was

I Iable to get warmth in my tired and half-starved body.

         think that never experienced such cold as that of the
journey in which we returned through Germany. There was
 a long stoppage at one place from the breaking of a spring ;
 (the same thing had happened in a tunnel in the Apennines
 in Italy) from the intensity of cold, which renders steel brittle.
INTENSE COLD AT WURZBURG. ENGLISH THAW. 387

Through this delay we did not reach Wurzburg till midnight ;
and frigid indeed was our reception. After a tardy admission

to the hotel by the drowsy porter, we asked in vain for a fire,

hot water, or food. There were our cold beds, and we must

make the best of them. But we had lighted candles, and to

Igot the benefit of their heating power devised the expedient

of putting them into the beds, with chairs to raise a safe

frame around them, and then throwing the bedclothes over

the whole. In this way in a quarter of an hour the body of

air in the bed was warmed, and the bed well aired, and we
Igot rest and comfort.
                        need hardly add that to make such

a contrivance safe, the greatest caution and circumspection

Iwas necessary, and W7ould by no means recommend it for

common adoption.

     This was an unusually severe season ; but this experience
of a winter tour made me resolve never to attempt another.

From the time of our starting from Pisa, throughout Italy,

Germany, and Belgium, we were passing through snow and

more or less intense frost ; and without sign of thaw, till we
reached Ostend. In England we found the thaw universal ;

and we quite enjoyed the soft mildness of a Gulf- Stream south-

wester. People may abuse the dampness and changes of the

English climate ; but a genial rain is a comfort, and change

to a warm fog a blessing, compared with the iron hardness

of a continental frost enduring for months with merciless

intensity !

ALTHOUGH our winter tour proved far from agreeable in the
journey home, on the whole it afforded much refreshment and
enjoyment to both mind and body. Space permits me not
even to mention the rich treasures of art which we explored
as diligently as time would permit in the several places which
we visited : but the aesthetic impressions which they produced,
and the new material which they supplied to imagination and
memory, proved a recreation preparatory for new professional
work.

    I took up the subject of the Work on Consumption, and

with my son's aid the publication was completed by the end
of the summer.

      The book comprised a preface, and thirty chapters, of which
twenty- four were composed by myself, and six by my son. Of
those written by myself were : One on the Definition and
Nature of Consumption : seven chapters on the Pathology of
Consumption : six chapters on Clinical and Pathological

Varieties : one chapter on the Physical Signs of Varieties and
Stages of Pulmonary Consumption: six chapters of Abstracts of
Cases, illustrating the Nature, Varieties, and Treatment of Con-
sumption: and three chapters on the Treatment of Consump-
tion ; including, Summary View ; General View of Treatment ;
Antiphlogistic, Tonic, Antiphthisical, and Antiseptic Measures.

       The chapters contributed by my son were respectively, on,
Family Predisposition and Other Causes of Consumption ; Hemo-
ptysis, and the H&morrhagic Variety of Consumption ; On the
Duration of Pulmonary Consumption ; On the Palliative Treat-
ment of Consumption ; On the Treatment of Pulmonary Con-
sumption by Dietetic and Hygienic Measures; and Treatment

of Consumption by Climate.
     The work was very favourably received, both in this

country and America, and has now been for some time out of

print. 1 As my son is engaged in preparing a second edition

     1 The following are a few out of many notices of the work which have
appeared in British Journals :

    ' The profession will naturally read with care and great respect the writings

of an author of such high distinction as Dr. Williams, and upon a subject to

which he has devoted the best years of a long working life  Dr. C. T.

Williams contributes very valuable chapters, also, on palliative, dietetic, and

climatic treatment          The general conclusion arrived at by the authors,

and fully borne out by their carefully arranged statistics as to the duration of

phthisis, is a very encouraging one, and shows that the gradually improving

treatment of the last twenty years has done much to prolong the life, as well

as to mitigate the sufferings, of those who are afflicted with this terrible dis-

ease.' BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL, Oct. 5, 1872.

* Among the physicians who have taught the profession to take a more

hopeful view of consumptive disease none speaks with more authority than
Dr. Williams.' . . . . ' The great step to a better treatment of phthisis has

been the recognition of the low vitality of the bioplasm, or as he proposes to
call it, the phthinoplasm (wasting or decaying forming material) of the tubercle ;
and Dr. Williams's description of the nature and source of this substance must
command general attention.' ' The statistical chapters and the tables by Dr.
Charles Theodore Williams are of great value and will repay a careful atten-
tion.' ' The grand teaching which Dr. Williams has for the profession is to be

found in his therapeutical chapters, and in the history of individual cases ex-

tended by dint of care over 10, 20, 30, and even 40 years. The extension of

the average duration of phthisical cases from two years to eight is only, let us
hope, an earnest of a still more successful treatment yet to come, based on

that so authoritatively and amply illustrated by Dr. Williams, who may be
congratulated on finding so much in his early teaching established, to set

against much in his early treatment which has had to be altered, and on

having a son to perpetuate  his labours  and  his name.'   LANCET, October 21, 1871.

Williams, was received with much interest by the profession ; and we are

I do not deem it necessary to give abstracts, (as in the case of
Ithe Principles of Medicine which could not undertake to re-

bound to say that these anticipations, high as they were, are amply justified in

the volume before us. That Dr. Williams would bring forward the results of a

practical experience, which few or none of his contemporaries, perhaps, could

equal, was to be expected ; and it was to be expected, moreover, that he should
set these forth as a man of candour, acuteness, and steady judgment. It was

scarcely anticipated, however, unless it were by Dr. Williams's own personal

friends, that to these claims upon our attention he would add those of a thinker

familiar with the most recent researches and speculation    Most fortu-

nately Dr. Williams has retained that mental flexibility and openness to new

teaching which enables him to speak authoritatively from both points of view.'

WESTMINSTER REVIEW, Jan. 1872.
' In the first of the works which we have placed at the head of this article,

we find a mass of information and evidence on the whole subject of consump-

tion which could only be the result of the most patient investigation, coupled

with the ripe experience of a long life spent in the industrious study of the

disease, and in the collection of every fact which could in any way be brought

to bear upon its pathology, etiology, or treatment. Thus we are told that

for upwards of thirty years Dr. Williams has been in the habit of keeping

....notes of every case of any gravity in which he has been consulted in private
practice  amounting in all to about 25,600 cases. Such an experience in

the observation and treatment of one particular form of disease, falls to the lot

of but few medical men, and we feel, therefore, more disposed to study with

impartial care and attention the records of such a life -long experience than to

take up the pen of the critic        We cannot close the volume without ex-

pressing our thanks to both gentlemen for their very interesting work ; we

have no hesitation in saying that it is one of the most important additions to

the literature of phthisis which has appeared within the last thirty years.'

GLASGOW MEDICAL JOUBNAL, Feb. 1872.

' Dr. Williams, sen., is a man who for forty years has probably seen more

of phthisis than any other man in Britain : for more than fifty years he has

been in the profession, for the practice of which he was prepared by the teach-

ing of such masters as Alison, Laennec, Andral, and Chomel, and now he has

given us the most valuable gift he could bestow, the record of his lifelong ex-

perience. We thank him most gratefully for the gift, as a further proof of his

love to mankind, in whose service his life has been spent. It is, however,

hardly a book to be criticised ; it is a work to be studied ; and we can assure
our readers that it will well repay a careful and studious perusal. The

chapters on treatment we cordially recommend, and the whole work is alto-

gether one of the most instructive we have ever had occasion to peruse.'

EDINBURGH MEDICAL JOURNAL, November 1871.

' To ourselves, Dr. Williams's chapters on treatment are amongst the most

valuable and attractive in the book, and would alone render it a standard work

of reference. We can scarcely give Dr. Theodore Williams's chapters higher

praise than when we say they are worthy to be placed side by side with the
chapters contributed by his father. In conclusion, we would record our

opinion that Dr. Williams's great reputation is fully maintained by this book.

It is undoubtedly one of the most valuable works in the language upon any

special disease.' MEDICAL TIMES AND GAZETTE, Nov. 4, 1871.
ABSTRACT OF VIEWS.  391

Ipublish), but will quote a few of the most characteristic

passages, in reference to certain modern researches, which,

interesting and valuable as they are, by no means invalidate
the truth of previously ascertained facts, but on the contrary
throw additional light upon them, especially in connection with

the causation of the disease. The following extract from the
Preface will serve as a forecast of the general subject :

   I' It is not easy to convey in a few words the views of the nature

of phthisis to which have been led by observation and reflection
on the facts and opinions of others, as well as my own ; but the

popular terms decline and consumption are the most significant

Iwhich can propose to represent them.

   I' believe Pulmonary Consumption to arise from a decline or

deficiency of vitality in the natural bioplasm or germinal matter ;
and this deficiency manifests its effects not only in a general wasting
or atrophy of the whole body, but also in a peculiar degradation,
chiefly in the lungs and lymphatic system, of portions of this bio-
plasm into a sluggish low-lived, yet proliferating matter, which
instead of maintaining the nutrition and integrity of the tissues

(which is the natural office of the bioplasm,) clogs them, and
irritates them with a substance more or less prone to decay, and

Ieventually involves them also, in its own disintegration or de-

struction. This degraded bioplasm, which will call phthinoplasm

(wasting or decaying forming material), may be thrown out locally
as a result of inflammation ; or it may arise more spontaneously in
divers parts of the bioplasm in its ordinary receptacles, the lym-
phatic glandular system ; and then it commonly appears in the
form of miliary tubercles, scattered through the adenoid tissue of

the lungs.

     4 1 would characterise all consumptive diseases heretofore classed
under the terms Tuberculous or Scrofulous, together with tbe products
of low and chronic inflammations, as instances of lowered vitality

Iof the bioplasm ; and would strongly insist on their being totally

distinct, on the one hand, from cancer and other malignant diseases,

tbe characteristic of which is a new kind of vitality, a new growth,
perhaps parasitic, with new organic elements foreign to those of tbe
tissues which they invade and destroy and on tbe other band,
distinct also from total loss of vitality, death of tbe bioplasm, wbich
would speedily result in decomposition, gangrene, and putrefaction ;

to such a result phtbinoplasms do occasionally lead, but it is not a
part of their common history.
392 PROSPECTS. ENCOURAGEMENTS. WARNINGS.

   I' The preceding imperfect sketch will, trust, make it apparent

that the views thus offered are not barren speculation ; but if they

prove to be well founded, they are largely suggestive of practical

measures. The great indication to sustain the vitality and suffi-

ciency of the bioplasm, by all available means, medicinal, regiminal,

and climatic, will be the first suggestion for the prevention and

treatment of consumptive disease. A second, equally obvious, will

be the avoidance of all influences which may injure the bioplasm,

generally, by deleterious action on the whole body, or locally,

by exciting low inflammations in the lungs and other organs. A

third indication, more difficult than others in its fulfilment, is to

counteract the injurious effect of the phthinoplasms already formed,

and to promote their quiescence and removal.

    ' It has been our endeavour in the chapter on the Treatment,

and in those containing the illustrative Cases, to show how these

indications are carried out ; and although in the worst and most

rapid forms of disease, we have still to confess that medicine is

almost powerless, yet in those less overwhelming, and in those more

chronic, which happily constitute by far the greater number of cases,

we have been able to adduce many proofs (and these might be
largely multiplied), that much may be done to mitigate, to prevent,

to retard ay, and even to arrest and to cure, this most destructive

of all human maladies.

' And here occurs an opportunity, which must not be lost of

saying a strong word on what renders the practice of our art much
Iless successful than it might be if it had a fair chance :
                                                             mean the

indocility of the patients or of their friends. Our recorded cases

may be dry to read, being neither polished in diction, nor sensational

in narrative ; but they teach this lesson, that those patients bene-

fited most surely and most permanently, who early, and at reason-

able intervals, sought for advice, and who implicitly and faithfully

followed it to the best of their ability, during the months or years

required by the nature of their cases. On the other hand, only

irregular and uncertain improvement ensued where the advice was

imperfectly carried out ; and relapses, serious and even fatal,
resulted often from its neglect. This is an old grievance, and we

must not cease to raise a warning voice against it. The cause very

much lies in the ignorance and conceit of even the educated classes

in medical matters, especially of the aristocracy, many of whom

think themselves better judges than medical men ; and if they seek

advice, neglect to follow it, or capriciously decide to discontinue the

treatment to change the doctor or, it may be, to try homoaopathy,

or some other equally absurd form of quackery at the very time

when the patient's life and recovery depend on the steady continu-

ance of a plan of rational treatment. It is awful to reflect on the

numbers of valuable lives that are sacrificed to such ignorance and
caprice ! and until the public intelligence becomes enlightened to
discern the wickedness and folly of this reckless tampering with
health and life, our own profession at least should not cease to
protest against it. We have difficulties enough to contend against
in our endeavours to correct and control the decaying tendencies of
the frail body, without having them fatally aggravated by the
officious interference of ignorance and prejudice. The treatment of
Pulmonary Consumption involves a long watchful struggle with a
strong, subtle, and insidious enemy ; and to secure any amount of
success, the will, the faith, and the hopes of the patient must be
persistently and patiently enlisted on our side.'

    IThe grounds on which had been led to take this decided
Iattitude with regard to the nature and treatment of consump-

tive diseases, were formed of what could find to be the best
ascertained facts in modern physiology and pathology, arranged
and confirmed by the extensive clinical experience of myself
and others. That experience had already received the stamp
of approval, by the steadily increasing success of its results ;
but it was open to still further extension or correction by the
progressive advancement of knowledge. An example of such
new extension has occurred in the recent discovery of the low
organism, supposed to be peculiar to tubercle, termed a bacillus,
an extremely minute staff-shaped body, of a vegetable nature,
and which propagates itself by division, and which is said to
be capable of producing tubercle in other parts of a living
animal. The subject is undergoing extensive and searching
investigation at the hands of many able observers : the note
below will direct to the most recent information on the sub-
ject. 1 The following extract will show that in 1871 my views
contemplated the possibility of organic germs being concerned

    ' It remains a question open for further inquiry, what is the

influence in the inoculating matter or open wound which appears
thus to affect the vitality of the sarcophytes in the part, and make
them proliferate in a concrete perishable form, and communicate a
like tendency to other sarcophytes in the adenoid tissue of the body
through which they circulate ? From its infective power it would
appear to be of a zymotic nature, whatever that may be, whether
a chemical catalytic force or an organic spore, or germ. And the
notion has been propounded, even recently, by Dr. Madden of Tor-
quay, and Dr. W. Budd of Bristol, that tubercles are the result of
a specific poison, like scarlatina, typhoid fever, and other zymotic
diseases. We are perhaps as yet hardly in a position to accept, or
to reject this notion, for there are many facts for and against
which we cannot afford space to consider at length but at present

    seems to me more probable that the influence which causes
tubercle something more common than specific poison some-
thing more analogous to putrefactive matter, which may proceed
from various materials, and even from the decomposition of part

of the body itself. It may indeed be said that putrefaction and

other low kinds of decomposition are promoted, not produced, by
the presence of vibriones, bacteria, and other septic organisms but

   so, in the way of common corruption, and not through any
specific agency engendering, or engendered by, disease.'

On taking retrospect of an experience of forty years in the

treatment of Pulmonary Consumption, can trace remarkable

improvement in its success, as judged by the results. During the

first ten years of that period, the beneficial results of the treatment

were very limited, being chiefly confined to the incipient cases, and

to those patients who were able at an early stage and for long

continuance to resort to more favourable climates, such as can be

obtained by voyages to Australia or India. My general recollection

of the histories of the developed disease at that time            is  that of

distressing tragedies, in which no means used seemed to arrest the

malady the tardative and palliative treatment employed was little

satisfactory and life was rarely prolonged beyond the duration of

' In the next period of ten years (from 1840 to 1850) a marked
improvement took place in the results of treatment, apparently in

connection with the allowance of a more liberal diet, and the

habitual .use of mild alterative tonics, as they might be termed,

particularly iodide of potassium with sarsaparilla or other vegetable

tonic. It was in the latter half of this period that chemists began

Ito produce cod-liver oil of sufficient purity and freshness to be fit

for the human stomach ; and have 110 hesitation in stating my

conviction that this agent has done more for the Consumptive than

all other    means put together.      And so far    is this                    remedy from
having "   had its day, and gone out  of fashion,"  that in                   my experience

its usefulness and efficacy have gone on increasing in proportion to

the greater facilities for obtaining it in a pure state, and to the im-

provements in the manner of administering                                     in combination with

The following may be given as brief general view of my

usual plan of treatment. As we have been led to conclude that

consumption essentially disease of degeneration and decay, so

may be inferred that the treatment for the most part should be of

sustaining and invigorating character. Not only the most nutritious

food aided by judicious use of stimulants and of medicinal tonics,

but pure dry air, with such varied and moderate exercise in as

the strength will bear, and the enlivening influence of bright sun-

shine and agreeable scenery, and cheerful society and occupation,

are among the means best suited to restore and repair the defective

functions and structures of frames decaying and prone to decay.'

Ihowever important its subject.               trust that they may find

some relief in a brief notice of some points of interest in an
Iexcursion to Eastern Germany which took at the end of that
Isummer, (1871).
                       joined my daughters at Franzensbad,

where one was under the care of Dr. Cartellieri, a principal

physician of that watering place and proprietor of an estab-

lishment of Mud-Baths. He was introduced by my friend

IDr. Sutro, 1 but found that my name was quite familiar to

Ihim, for my works were text-books at the schools when he
studied auscultation.  suppose there must be something very

efficacious in the waters and baths of the place ; for there is

nothing attractive in the scenery. The country, almost flat,

or with only low hills, and a few tumuli, which have the credit

of being extinct volcanoes, has its only charms in gardens

and some pretty woodlands in the neighbourhood. The

efficiency of the wrater, as a mild aperient, depends chiefly

on the Sulphate of Soda, in which it is far surpassed by

Marienbad, also a cold spring, but with more interesting

scenery around it. The chief characteristic of Franzensbad

lies in its mud-baths, composed of bog earth carefully mixed

with the water of the mineral spring, and made comfortably
warm. Dirty as this ' wallowing in the mire ' must seem, it

is said to be quite luxurious to the feeling poised in a medium

of velvet softness, and excluding all that can worry or irritate.

The doctors do not seem to be very profound or exact in the

philosophy of the subject. They have a vague notion that

besides their balneological effect, the baths may owe some of

their efficacy to the absorption of some of the elements of the

bog earth and mineral water. That iron is ever absorbed

seems very doubtful. More probably a nascent sulphuretted

hydrogen may be evolved from the decomposition of the sul-

phates of the water with the hydrocarbons of the bog earth.

The equably warm feeling from the mud may be explained by

the somewhat similar effect of bran or gelatine, in retaining

the temperature of baths. Carbonic acid gas is evolved in

chiefly in the city, where he resides, and has a large practice. He wrote an

Iexcellent work on the spas and health resorts of Germany and other countries,
which he was so good as to dedicate to me.    used to refer to him as one of

the best London authorities on that subject.

such large quantities at one of the springs, that it is used as

an air bath, by being allowed to accumulate in a sunk floor, on

which the patients take their seats, whilst the gas rises up to

their waists. Dr. Cartellieri told me that he found these gas

baths sometimes locally useful by an operation, soothing to

the nerves, and stimulating to the blood-vessels. It was neces-

sary to strengthen the faith of sceptical patients by demon-

strating the existence of the gas, by extinguishing in it a

lighted match, or by making its surface visible by smoke from

damp brown paper.

We found hardly any English visitors at Franzensbad ;

my friend the Duchess of Buccleuch was the only one we

knew.

   ICarlsbad found much more interesting both in physical

conformation and in scenery. The whole place seems to take

you by surprise, as with a turn or two you descend into its

deep and narrow gorge, and find a close aggregation of build-

ings terracing its sides, and the crowded houses clustering on

either bank of its rocky river-bed, from beneath which spring

up its geysers sputtering and steaming like something full of

activity and power. The motley strangeness and variety in

the costumes and features of the inhabitants strike you at

every turn. With a strong predominance of the Hebrew

element, you have not only the Bohemians of the country,

but Hungarians, Poles, Russians and sundry other samples of

the peoples of Eastern Europe. The place enjoys -great repu-

tation, and is always overcrowded in the season. The waters

are supposed to cure everything ; but they are really potent

for good or for harm, according to the skill with which they

are used. Gout and liver diseases are the maladies in which

Ithey are most successful ; and yet have known not a few

cases of both these complaints which have only become worse

at Carlsbad, but eventually recovered under careful medicinal
Itreatment at home.
                     found Professor Seegen a courteous

and intelligent expositor of the practice of Carlsbad.

On quitting these Bohemian watering places, we visited

the picturesque country of the Salzkammergut in the Austrian

Tyrol, passing by Gmunden, with its beautiful Traun lake and
mountain, to the picturesque variegated highlands of Ischl,
398 TRAUNSEE. SHOOTING THE RAPIDS.

IThe country abounds in salt mines and salt baths. By in-

vitation visited Dr. Schreiber's Sanatorium at Aussee, which

comprises establishments for salt bathing, for milk-cure, and

for residence in mountain air. The house stands on a pleasant

slope near a little lake, well sheltered, with woods and rocks

behind, at a little more than 2,000 feet above the sea. Dr.

Schreiber told me that it was a favourite resort of Professors

Skoda and Rokitansky of Vienna, and is conveniently placed

for patients from that city.

On returning to Gmunden by the lake, we got the oppor-

tunity of descending the rapids of the Traun river in a salt-

barge, and quite panted with delight in the adventure. These

barges, in which the salt from the mines is sent down the river,

are little better than rafts, rather loosely put together, to give

them pliancy for sliding over the rocky shallows, and in yield-

ing to the turns of the current. Seated on a plank resting on

the salt-cones, (shaped like sugar-loaves), my daughters, with
their maid and myself, prepared to ' shoot the rapids ' of the

Traun-fal. Four men are fore and aft with long poles to

guide the barge ; and off it goes ! at rapid rate, swiftly dart-

ing down the straight stream, bumping over the shallows,

whirling round the windings, and darting with breathless

haste down the steeper falls till floating smoothly to a level,

in an incredibly short space of time we were sped to our

torrent journey's end, and except a little timidity in the maid,

we all (as my dear youngest daughter expressed  it)    exceed-
ingly enjoyed the fun

No doubt slight tinge of danger may have given zest to

the adventure, and the bumpings against the sides and shallows

were by no means gentle, but what ^vas delicious and inspiring

in the motion was to be thus borne through such beautiful

scenery so swiftly and yet so silently, that but for momen-

I will briefly allude to the Bavarian Alps, close at hand, which
               a
we visited not now, but in a former tour. There is no scene
in the whole of Switzerland, which, in my opinion, equals

in beauty the Konigsee. After a drive of sixteen miles from

Saltzburg to Berchtesgaden, overtowered by the snow-capped
mountain, the Watzmann, we come by a narrow defile to the
lake, and are rowed by women in a large boat. The speed

lately described as so delightful we have not nor do we want
     for the scene on which we enter so entrancing, that we

love to linger in its solitudes. On the right the cliffs rise
higher in perpendicular walls, fringed here and there with
lofty pines. On the left the land first slopes in lovely pastures
of varied tints, but these soon give place to richly wooded
hills and then the lake landlocked all around, with colossal
walls of limestone cliffs terraced by verdant turf, and over-

topped by the grey shadows of the Watzmann, patched with
snow. At the far end of the lake seen the small hunting
chateau of the King of Bavaria, reflected in long vanishing
lines in the still lake with the deep blue shade of the lofty
mountains behind. We rowed to this upper end and found

turn into second small lake beyond, with lower banks, but
lovely beyond description in the varied tints of its trees of
autumnal foliage. The special points which give transcendent

features to this charming scenery, are the abrupt and varied
elevation of its stupendous cliffs, the contrast of deep shades
with lively lights and colours, and the calm stillness of its
sheltered lake, reflecting surrounding objects in exquisitely
softened beauties. We found minor charms but interesting
features, also in the Tegernsee and Achensee.

      My chief objects in Vienna were to see Professors Rokitansky
and Skoda, but unfortunately was unsuccessful. Our calls

were made and returned, but we missed each other, and had

Concluding reminiscences of the College List.

MY dissatisfaction with the constitution and management of
the Royal College of Physicians has been particularly recorded
in Chapter XX. Several changes for the better had taken
place since then ; and although the College had been deprived
altogether of its executive and compulsory powers, it had
extended its operations as a licensing body by undertaking
the examination of a new order of Licentiates, such as those
who had previously obtained a qualification from the Society
of Apothecaries. The former order of Licentiate physicians
were now to be termed Members, a concession unavoidable
on the admission of a lower order, who might or might not
be physicians, but were supposed to be qualified for general
practice. The change of name from licentiate to member
might be supposed to be satisfactory to the physicians con-

                                                                  DD

cerned ; but the satisfaction was qualified on its appearing
that the name brought with it no privileges of membership.

Although called members they had no voice, no vote, no
admission to the deliberations, or share in the offices or

management of their own corporate body. All these were
still reserved as the exclusive privileges of the fellows. They

were admitted to the library and to the lectures ; but so were

the licentiates. The only one point in which the new members

had any advantage, was that possibly they might be chosen
for the fellowship. But where lay their chance of getting that
privilege ? Might not the members at least represent them-

selves, and vote for the most worthy out of their own body ?

are to be absolute autocrats in the whole transaction And

what community of feeling to be looked for from those who

had hitherto so long prided themselves on their own exclusive

privileges

     For several years held aloof, watching how the change
would work; but took foremost part in recommending

deserving members for election to the Fellowship. There had

been year or two of grace (the exclusives called disgrace]
in which large number of physicians of certain standing

were elected members without examination to replenish the

scanty ranks, and gave opportunity for further increase of
fellowships. But there existed still much of that spirit of

exclusiveness which aimed at limiting the honours and powers

of the College to few, instead of distributing them as widely
   if
as possible, wherever they were really merited. Then there;
were complaints of partiality and unfairness as to those whoa
were elected deserving seniors being passed over, and juniors

preferred, they happened to have friends among the Fellows.
Not above half of the members proposed by myself and other

fellows, were elected. The whole number of new fellows

elected, which in 1870 had risen to 24, in 1871 and 1872
fell to and 13. And this for all England Could be

qualified physicians of the country The question drove me to
CONTENTS AND NON-CONTENTS,                    403

statistics so far as they could be found in lists of the College
of Physicians and the British Medical Directory.

     The College list comprised :

254 Fellows.
535 Members.

  54 Old Licentiates.
131 Extra Licentiates.
719 New Licentiates (General Practitioners).

The numbers of Doctors of Medicine registered in the

British Medical Directory amount to thousands ; but the

greater number of these, although nominally physicians, are

in fact general practitioners, combining surgery, midwifery,

and pharmacy with medicine in their practice. Such are

not the physicians answering to the description of those of

the Koyal College. And- they may be distinguished by their

having some or all of these initials appended to their names :

L.S.A. (Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries), M.E.C.S.
(Member of the Eoyal College of Surgeons), or L.E.C.P.
(Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians) ; all such, and
also Officers of Unions, should not be entitled to rank as

Physicians. But all others designated as doctors of medicine,
especially if also Physicians to Hospitals, have a fair claim to

Ibe considered as physicians, and to be affiliated to the Eoyal

College. But, as a matter of fact, found no fewer than 682

names, answering to this description, who did not belong to

the College at all. Of these, between sixty and seventy were

known to me, either personally, or by repute, to be practising

physicians. Many were Physicians to Hospitals, and other

public Institutions ; many were authors of published works ;

several were Fellows of the Eoyal, and other scientific and

literary societies ; and not a few were Justices of the Peace
Iand Deputy Lieutenants of their counties.
                                            could perceive

no reason why these should not all belong to the College of

IPhysicians ; and although had not the same knowledge of

the remainder of the 682 doctors of medicine named in the

Directory list, there was nothing mentioned in that list which

ought to disqualify them.

    It seemed to me quite anomalous that whilst nearly a

DD2
404 OUTSIDE OBJECTIONS TO THE COLLEGE.

thousand physicians were embodied in the College that yet

there were more than half that number of doctors of medicine

practising in England as physicians, without any connection

Iwith it. By way of inquiring further into the matter, wrote

to some half-dozen of the most distinguished of these pro-

Ivincial physicians, with whom was acquainted, to ask them
their reasons for holding aloof from the College, as I was

anxious to make a movement towards devising measures for

making the College the representative head of the Physicians

of the country. One of the replies was as follows : ' My

reasons for not caring to join the College of Physicians were

simply, 1st, that it was a costly process ; 2nd, that it was
Ia useless one.
                 did not know of any advantage, or even

...honour, which would accrue to a provincial physician by
belonging to that body.  I wish success to your attempt

to move this inert mass.' Other replies urged sundry causes

of dissatisfaction with the constitution and management of the

College, but intimated the possibility of a change in their views,

if they should see signs of improvement in the spirit of the

governing body less exclusiveness and self-aggrandisement,

and more liberal consideration for the members in general,

and for the scientific and benevolent objects of the profession.

   I was far from sharing the opinions of those recusants

who condemned the College as useless and incorrigible. On

the contrary there had been many changes for the better

in its management, and several attempts had been made

to conciliate the feelings of the profession and to extend its
Iinfluence.
             felt strongly that much more ought to be done

in the same direction. But there were a few among the

fellows, and those the most active, who under the plea of

keeping up the dignity of the College, and making it select

and refined, generally opposed all liberal concessions, such

as the raising of members to the fellowship, and were for

reserving that   honour only for   physicians  of the highest
                 was in vain that              them that the
distinction. It                    I reminded

College was established to comprehend and incorporate the
physicians of the country, not to be only an inner circle,
like an exclusive club among them ; and that so far from
limiting the numbers, it ought to be ready to receive all who
             COLLEGE HISTORY AND ABUSES.  405

should prove themselves to be thoroughly qualified and worthy

physicians.

     My excellent friend Sir George Burrows was at that time

President of the College, and just and liberal-minded as I had
always found him in spirit and in act, I made known to him

some of the results of my inquiries on this subject, and of the

views which I had been led to entertain respecting the affairs
and duties of the College. In his reply he begins ' I have read

your important communication with great interest, and assure

Iyou that am by no means averse to the principle advocated

by yourself viz. the admission of a large number of members

to the fellowship.' He promised to make my views known to

the council, but without committing himself to any decided
Icourse of action.
                    had to follow this up by bringing forward

motions at the meetings of the Fellows, on several subsequent

occasions ; but without publishing these and the consequent dis-

cussions, which are supposed (but not declared) to be among the

I I' secrets ' of the College, insert a summary which wrote at
the time, and which gives an outline of the Icase as viewed it.

     The Koyal College of Physicians of London was originally in-

stituted to ensure proper qualification and regulation of those
practising medicine in London and provinces, for the good, as well
of the public, as of the profession. Although worthy and distin-
guished names have adorned the College list from its foundation to

the present time, yet as a college, soon and ever since, the power
and privileges conferred on it have been abused by restrictive and

exclusive by-laws, to the advantages of few fellows to the dis-
advantage of the many practitioners, and to the neglect of
the wants of the public. Consequently physicians always re-
mained few ; and care of the public health devolved on a lower

grade, of whom the College disdained to take cognisance, surgeons

an<l apothecaries (originally barber-surgeons, x LPovP7 ^ hand-
workers) and aTcoO^Kapioi shopmen drug-sellers. These in course
of time, educated up into general medical practitioners, supplied to
the public the skilled aid, which the College of Physicians bad
failed to furnish. The College in the meantime, instead of leading
and directing the whole medical profession, was engrossed with

enhancing and enforcing their own collegiate privileges. Among
other dubious enactments were the election of the President by the
Elects, and the restriction of the fellowships to a few generally
406 COLLEGE REFORMS.

graduates of Oxford or Cambridge. The consequence of this

exclusive policy was that not only the chief practice of the country
passed into the hands of the surgeons and apothecaries, but that

numbers of other physicians, graduates of Scotch and other Univer-

sities, established themselves, in defiance of the College, throughout
the provinces and even in London itself ; so that the corporation

was forced to call the law to its aid to defend its privileges, and by
no means with a conclusive result. At this period, between forty

and fifty years ago, the College was at its lowest point of popularity

and influence, and at one time became so straitened in finances,

that a subscription among the Fellows became necessary to meet

its current expenses. After this there were some signs of a more

liberal policy. A few of the most distinguished Licentiates were

admitted to the fellowship. In a few years this number was in-

creased, and the exclusive privileges to Oxford and Cambridge

graduates abrogated. The effect was an increase of the number of

entries to the College ; but the change came too late to enable it to

retain the privileges of its original charter. The change of title

from licentiates to members was merely nominal, for it was accom-

panied by no privileges of membership, except the possibility of being

Ipromoted to the fellowship, which has hitherto been too sparingly

acted on, and this is the point to which particularly wish to direct

the attention of the Council. The College acted wisely in two of its

most recent acts : 1. The free admission of many members during

a year of grace : and 2. The resumption of its original functions in
establishing examinations for a lower order of practitioners, under

the title of licentiates. But there is a risk of this latter measure

acting injuriously on the members, unless the superior privileges of

these are maintained by their being freely admitted to the fellow-

Iship, as soon as their standing in the College and their position
in the profession entitle them to it.  maintain that the admission

of members to the fellowship is to be regarded not as an exceptional

distinction to be attained only by a favoured few, but as an honour

open to all who, during a certain number of years, by their skill
and success as physicians, and by their general unexceptional and

Ihonourable conduct, prove themselves worthy of it.
        propose therefore in the first instance to carry out this prin-

ciple by nominating as many of the members of ten years standing

and upwards, as in the opinion of the Council have proved them-

selves able and worthy physicians. As much as possible should be

avoided the invidious practice of nominating juniors to be placed

over the heads of those who have grown grey in the cold _shade of
exclusion. There may be a few exceptional cases of transcendent

merit deserving such distinction ; but as a matter of justice and
policy, honours should be first conferred on the seniors in the pro-
fession : the deserving juniors will be sure to succeed in due time.

.... IFrom communications which during several years have

Ihad with physicians in the College and out of the College am con-

vinced that the present mode of election to the Fellowship niggardly,
capricious, and open to imputations of partiality of favouritism

Ihas been the chief cause of discontent within the College, and of

repulsion of physicians without ; and would strongly urge on the

Council that the Fellowship ought to be viewed not as an honorary
distinction to be conferred only on physicians of transcendent merit,
but as the full completion of the membership to which all may look
forward to attain by a sufficient standing and an honorable career

in their profession as physicians. If it is thought desirable to elect

Ialso to the Fellowship younger physicians of exceptional merit,

would open another door to them by examination, after the example
of the College of Surgeons, but it would be expedient to restrict such

admissions to a small number annually.

     By the adoption of such liberal and conciliatory policy, the College

would do much to satisfy its present members and offer inducements
to other physicians to join its ranks so that it may become a
national institution, fairly entitled to stand at the head of the

Medical Corporations of the country and to acquire the authority and
influence in the State that should properly belong to the represen-

tative head of the most learned and scientific branch of the profession.

     My movement caused no small stir in the College, and
brought on me from some quarters the imputation of a desire

to make the College too common, and to promote a lerelliny

doicmcards, which would certainly be the very reverse of my

intention. I had always advocated a high standard (and

strict examinations on essential matters for all junior candi-

dates) for admission to the membership ; but being admitted,
let there be no bai to the members to rise in due course to
their full proper dignity.

    Although I did not succeed in effecting any great change

in the restrictions which had been complained of, yet there
was a general acknowledgment that it was the duty of the

Fellows to do all in their power to encourage the admission of

deserving members into their body and so to sustain and

increase the influence of the College : and resolutions were
408 DEAFNESS ORIGIN AND REMEDIES.

Ipassed to issue periodically addresses to that effect.  had

also the satisfaction of seeing a great increase in the ad-

Imissions to the fellowship, which were about 20 annually, in

that and the following two years : had myself recommended

as many as one-third out of the whole number.

    It was during these debates at the College of Physicians

Ithat began to experience the inconvenience of an infirmity

which would soon deprive me of all further capacity to take

part in such proceedings. My hearing had been brought into

extraordinary requisition during my whole professional life,

and through God's goodness it had been granted me in fail-
perfection during the greater part of that period. In my

Ichildhood was subject to attacks of inflammatory earache

which often left a temporary deafness; but this tendency

Idiminished when grew up. It did not however pass away

Ientirely ; and both in Edinburgh and afterwards in London,
   had several attacks, which sometimes affected both ears,

with a succeeding deafness lasting two or three weeks. I soon
learnt how best to prevent or arrest them; and I did not

shrink from resorting at once to very strong measures,

Ifor with the warning of a deaf mother before me, knew that
I was in danger of deafness for life. How great the mercy of

God to save me from that trial ! But for that mercy how

would all my prospects have been blighted ! . . . .

The first effectual remedy was prescribed to me by Dr.

Andrew Duncan, junior, Edinburgh, himself a sufferer from

the same complaint. It was the Tartar Emetic ointment of

Autenrieth, which had just been brought into use (1821).

But to make it effectual to bring out pimples on the skin by
Ifriction in two or three hours
                                 found it necessary to in-

crease its strength or better, to use a saturated solution of

tartar emetic in hot water and with this to rub freely on

the neck behind and below the affected ear, and to repeat the

rubbing in two hours if necessary. Generally after one rub-

bing, in an hour or two the skin becomes of a vivid red, and

in two or three hours numerous pustules break out, and the

relief is complete. Of course there is a very sore neck after,

which may not heal for several days ; but what is that in

comparison with dreadful earache for two or three days, and
Iprobably deafness for weeks after?
                                     had already tried all
Isorts of common remedies, and proved their impotency.

afterwards substituted for tartar emetic, croton oil, but not
with equal success. But by the advice of Mr. Maule, the aurist,

1 tried cupping behind the ear, and that proved quite effectual

in both relieving pain and preventing deafness, provided it
were used within an hour or two from the commencement of

the attack. The abstraction of 6 or 8 ounces of blood was

sufficient. It entirely removes the inflammation and there is

no discharge after : but under the slower action of tartar

emetic, there is sometimes discharge but no pain.

    One of the last attacks of this kind which I had was in the
Iwinter of 1841 or 2. had driven to see a patient at Moulsey
opposite Hampton. The Thames had overflowed, and I had to

walk some distance in the wet. In returning in the carriage

IIwith wet feet, began to feel my enemy as approached town.
IInstead of going to my lecture which was due, drove straight

to Watkins the cupper, got complete relief, and then delivered

my lecture. I think that I got rid of the tendency to these

attacks by constant care, to protect the ears, to keep the feet
dry and warm, and in case of incipient colds, to resort at

once to one or other of those remedies for colds described in

Chap. X.

After all these early attacks, my hearing was good for all

the purposes of auscultation for upwards of forty years. It
Iwas never very keen for very distant sounds. Neither do
Iconsider that my ear was finely musical.
                                           had enough ear

for music to enjoy it and to be able readily to learn a tune by

Iear, and to quickly detect anything out of tune : but seemed

to lack the fine musical sense which enables one to pitch a

note exactly, and to execute a succession of notes with perfect

correctness without an accompaniment. On the other hand,

I seemed to have a perfect appreciation of common noises, or

non-musical sounds. My puerile faculty of imitating the
language of the poultry yard, 1 and a turn for the mimicry of

odd notes and inanimate noises seemed to give the ear a

familiarity with them that made them not only audible but

          1 See Chap. I.
410 COLLEGE REMINISCENCES.

intelligible. This is a faculty hard to describe ; but it
seemed this which gave me so keen a ear for the signs of
auscultation.

     The deafness came on first in the left ear with loud
tinnitus or ringing, which has been already mentioned in

Chap. XXXIV. I had hardly ever used it in auscultation,

and its more complete closure, by shutting out all external
sounds, rather helped the hearing of the sound ear ; but it
debarred me from the use any) of the binaural stethoscope.
And although in public assemblies and lectures, began to
find general difficulty in hearing during this year, 1872, did
not lose the auscultatory power of the right ear until several
years later.

My excellent friend Dr. John McLennan was another

retired physician, who after very distinguished career in the

Bombay presidency in India, still found keen interest in pur-

suing the science of medicine in University College. With

several members of his family, he was also my patient, and

was remarkable example of the efficiency of bromide of

suspended for some years by the remedy till the fatal apo-

plectic seizure which eventually carried him off.

     Sir John Rose Cormack passed through a long life

chequered with many chapters. After serving for several

years as surgeon in the army, he settled in Edinburgh and

established a monthly medical journal. He then quitted the

North and took the general practice of the late Dr. Charles of

Putney, disposing of his journal to the late Professor Hughes

Bennett, who carried it on for many years. Industrious with

his pen and fond of journalism, he started the London

Monthly Journal of Medicine, and laid me and many friends

under contribution to help him : but after two or three years

of good promise, he was obliged to give it up. Subsequently

for a time he edited the Provincial Medical Journal. One of

Ithe modes in which gave him efficient aid was by introducing

to him as assistant my former diligent pupil and clinical

assistant Dr. Alexander Henry, whose unflagging intelligence

and industry has been ever since most serviceable in co-

operating in the publication of the British Medical Journal,

now become a gigantic National Institution, under the able

editorship of Mr. Ernest Hart. Dr. Cormack did not

succeed well in practice, and soon left Putney. After trying

other places in France, he settled in Paris, with some better

success. But what seemed most propitious to his flagging

fortunes, was the siege of Paris, wherein he partook of the

privations and trials of that distressing ordeal : and they

drew forth his energies and resources with such effect, that

he and his colleagues became quite heroes of the occasion,

and he won many honours and acknowledgments. With

the eclat thus worthily earned, and an improved position in

connection with the British hospital founded by Sir Richard

Wallace, he seemed in fair way of more success in his declining

years, but they were darkened by family afflictions, and soon

terminated in death. An amiable man of enterprising and

industrious disposition, he wanted firmness and strength of

character necessary to ensure success.

Among the more liberal-minded of the original senior
IFellows of the College

THE aphorism of Hippocrates would be a better motto for the
Royal College of Physicians, with an addition : ( 'O ftios
^pa^vs, TI Bs Te%vr) n,aicpr] ' teal fjisyaXr). The brevity of life,
compared with, not only the length, but also the breadth
the largeness of art, inculcates the lesson : the shortness
of life warns us that ' whatsoever our hands find to do,
we should do with all our might,' activity in well doing
superseding all idleness, apathy, and self seeking. The
length and amplitude of art should open our minds to the
greatness and endurance of its objects, and shut out narrow
and short-sighted views. When the infirmity of deafness crept

Ialtogether laboured in vain apart from personal considera-

tions, could not but feel interest in the success of the future,

and be ready to promote and bid God-speed to any plan or
proposal for the advancement and enlargement of our art.

   IIt was with these feelings that welcomed the proposition,

first brought forward by Dr. Headlani Greenhow, to establish
a Clinical Society in the year 1867. Himself a hospital
physician, and in extensive private practice, he had felt, in
common with many of us, that clinical medicine, almost a new
development of the healing art and one which, mounting on
the wings of advancing science, had attained wonderful dimen-
sions and capacities also ought to have its proper arena of de-
bate, and its medium for the publication of its proceedings. The
venerable Eoyal Medical and Chirurgical Society was already
fully occupied with its sundry profound and elaborate subjects;
and valuable as both its Proceedings and Transactions are, they
must be admitted to be somewhat of the slow- coach character,

Iand hardly fit for the quick and ready reports of clinical practice.

the London Medical, the Harveian, and the Hunterian, and
most interesting and serviceable they all are in their way,
but this is rather of the quid mine or omnibus character, for
the casual topics of the day, than as exponents of an impor-
tant department of medicine which was }rearly advancing in

Iactivity and precision.

    Early initiated as had been in the regular and systematic
study of clinical medicine both in Edinburgh and in Paris,

I was surprised at the backwardness of the London schools in
Ithis particular when first visited them. 1 But for many years

they had fully retrieved their character, and were now second
to none in the world in the knowledge and practice of all the
most improved methods of investigation. Not only are divers
new instruments now required in the investigation of disease

for the purposes of auscultation (stethoscopes, plessimeters, &c.)

mensuration, and weighing (spirometers, stethometers, cyrto-
meters, hydrometers, and other meters of size and weight) ;
eye, ear, and throat inspection (ophthalmoscope, otoscope,
rhinoscope, laryngoscope, endoscope, and other specula) ; heat
and pulse measuring (thermometers, sphygmograph) ; chemi-
cally and electrically testing (chemical apparatus, galvano-
meters, &c.), and so forth ; but also plans and charts of regis-
tration, enumeration, tabulation, calculation, and correction

    are necessary, to deal with and work out- the results, according
to the most approved numerical and statistical methods. This
is the work that conscientious and diligent medical men now

have to do ; and who can refuse them all the aid, comfort, and

encouragement they can get from frequently bringing their re-
ports and cases for discussion and publication through a society
expressly constituted and established for the purpose ?

     Dr. Greenhow did not make his appeal in vain. One
hundred members were enrolled in the first year, and more
than double that number have since joined its ranks, almost

all being also Members of the Pathological Society, of which
this was, so to speak, the more lively complement. The

acceptance of the office of First President by the acknow-
ledged head of the Profession, the venerated and beloved Sir
Thomas Watson, stamped its success ; and it became at once

as popular as the Pathological Society had been at its founda-
tion. The subsequent presidents, each elected for two years,
were Sir James Paget, Sir William Gull, Mr. Prescott Hewett

and Sir William Jenner, before I left London. Dr. Greenhow

with paternal care watched over the interests of the Society
as Treasurer ; and has recently accepted the office of Presi-

dent, which as founder, was eminently due to him. The
Council of the Society did me the honour to place my name

Iamong the Vice-Presidents ; and at a later period was

elected one of the six Honorary Members of the Society. It

is much to my regret that the state of my health and my
engagements with another Society prevented my taking mi
active part in the meetings, but 1 can bear testimony to the
interest and liveliness of the discussions. The annual volumes

of Transactions have produced a large collection of remark-
able cases, generally highly commendable for their conciseness

as well as their precision ; and the occasional discussions on
special subjects selected for the purpose, have introduced a
novel mode of inspiring with interest doubtful and important
questions.

In the year 1873 my good friend Thomas Blizard Curling

(since President of the Eoyal College of Surgeons) called to
announce to me that the Council of the Koyal Medical and

Chirurgical Society had nominated me for election as Presi-

dent for the ensuing year. He was the retiring president;

and had long been on terms of intimacy through my having

attended his invalid son ; who, like my youngest son, had

sought and found relief from an asthmatic affection in the

Argentine States of South America. The proposal from the

Medical and Chirurgical Society was quite unexpected, as I

was late in entering the Society, and had hardly attained the

seniority which has usually been considered a chief claim.

IThe honour was therefore the more flattering, and was the

In accepting the office, in addition to my acknowledgment of

the high honour conferred on me, had to plead for indul-

gence in consideration of my advancing age, and especially of

the infirmity which was too plainly increasing on me. However,

distant and least distinct speakers.

I  had always great respect for the Medical and Chirurgical

Society, viewing  as an outgrowth of the vitality of the

science and art of medicine of past age, springing from

independent and individual effort, and owing nothing to

authority or endowment. It endeavoured to do what the

College of Physicians ought to have done, regularly publishing

its Transactions and accumulating its library with Astley

Cooper, Brodie, Travers, and other distinguished men among

its most zealous members, until grew into very important

IBritish Association for the Advancement of Science ; and

young as was he paid me the compliment of consulting me

respecting his own health. Although thus contemporary

with a founder of this Society, my usual associates were so

much in the van of progress, that we already looked upon it

Ias rather old-fashioned, and did not join it until 1840, when

its library became a necessity. This was too busy a time to

permit me to take much part in the Society's proceedings,
I Iand did not contribute to the Transactions.
                                                sometimes

joined in the debates, and was made Chairman of a Committee

appointed by the Society to make Eesearches and report on

Death by Drowning, and on the best mode of treating drowned

persons. The results were interesting, and the report was

Iconsidered practically valuable ; but have no documents by

me to enable me to give an account of them.

Under my presidency the meetings of the Society went on

much as usual. Attendance moderate. No lack of com-

munications ; and the discussions sober and sensible, if some-

what wanting in a spirit of enthusiasm. An effort was made

to arouse the energies of the Fellows by repeating the

Conversazione which had been held on a former year, and

this came off successfully. Such social gatherings not only

afford agreeable opportunities of reunion among town and

country Fellows, and persons of eminence in science, art,

and literature, but they bring under notice novelties and

objects of interest connected with science and art. An en-

deavour was made on this occasion to exhibit specimens of

the work of amateur artists in our own profession ; and the

number thus collected was very remarkable, and gave evi-

dence of the highest artistic talent and technical skill. 1 The

Society was under great obligation to the contributors to the

exhibition, to the Secretaries and other Members of the

Committee, and especially to the obliging and indefatigable

distinguished cultivators of the art of etching, were exhibitors. There were
eighteen pen-and-ink drawings on leaves from my case-books of 1836 and 1837,
showing the cases which first established the diagnosis of valvular disease
of the heart. Some were published in the Mcd. Gazette in March 1836, and

are referred to in Chap. XVI.

    'Baron Justus von Liebig, F.K.S., Professor of Chemistry at
Munich, Foreign Associate of the Academy of Sciences in Paris,

&c. &c., was elected Foreign Honorary Fellow of this Society in

I1843, being then in the zenith of his reputation as the greatest

organic chemist of the age. In the year before, was honoured

by his presence at my opening lecture at University College, in-

I Itroduced by my colleague Professor Graham. Then, thirty years

ago, paid a public tribute to his merits ; now have to record

his loss, with a bare mention of the inestimable obligations which

his labours have conferred and are conferring on Chemistry and on

Medicine.

' Liebig was born at Darmstadt in 1803. He studied at Bonn,

Erlangen and Paris, and took the degree of M.D. at Erlangen at

the early age of nineteen. At twenty-three he was Professor of
Chemistry at Giessen ; and in his laboratory established there,
aided by a crowd of students attracted from all countries, he

carried on many series of researches on the composition of organic

bodies, not more remarkable for their number than for their

ingenuity and accuracy. And in all this work he was likewise
schooling successive troops of pupils in his methods and mani-

pulations in analytic chemistry. To  quote the     words of          a pupil,

Baron ; and in 1852 be was invited to Munich to occupy the Chair
of Chemistry, which he held to his death, April 19, 1873, when he

had nearly completed his seventieth year.

     'Whilst by general consent the analytic work of Liebig is

admitted to be of the highest order, his theories and general views

in chemistry and physiology, bold and attractive as they are, have
been by no means so generally received. The principal objection to
them, especially when they were first propounded, was that they
were too exclusively chemical, and they too much disregarded the

I Inervous and other influences peculiar to the living body. Per-

haps may be permitted to mention that did not entertain this
objection ; for several years before either Liebig or Dumas had
published on the subject, in my inaugural dissertation, printed in

I1824, had adduced both experiments and arguments to prove

that, contrary to the opinions then generally held, oxygen is ab-
sorbed into the blood in respiration, and distributed through the
circulation, and through its chemical action, is chiefly concerned
in the removal of hydrocarbon from the blood, and in elaborating
urea and other materials of the secretions ; and that thereby, in
all these processes, is produced animal heat the Kara/x,op0oxrts

being also a process of ^pe/xa/cavo-cc. It was therefore not a little

gratifying to myself to find similar views afterwards advanced and
extended by Dumas, Liebig, and other leading chemists of the day.
Among these Liebig was the most daring and comprehensive in his
theories, which he applied with the strong force of genius to all
departments of organic chemistry, with full practical bearings on
dietetics and agriculture. We have no time even to glance at the
many important points in which the labours and reasonings of

Liebig threw light on physiology and medicine ; but his classifi-
cation of alimentary substances, dividing them into heat-producing
or combustive, and nutritive or blood-making, may be cited as a

grand generalisation of the highest utility as a general guide,
although subject to exceptions and modifications in its application
to details.' So likewise in the more practical instance of a special
kind of food, the essence of meat, to which he has given the sanction
of his name, although it has been found very useful in giving

flavour and digestibility to other kinds of food, its nutritive power

is proved to be very low, and not such as to do credit to its inventor.
We would rather look back, beyond these recent commercial

speculations, to the long catalogue of the past labours of this
eminent man, which fully entitle him to the highest rank among

organic chemists of the age.'
     ' The very day after the death of Liebig closed the life of one

                                                                          BK2

of his most distinguished pupils, Henry Bence Jones, M.D., D.C.L.,
F.E.S., F.E.C.P., Consulting Physician to St. George's Hospital.

He was elected Fellow of this Society in 1844.

' He was born December 31, 1813, at Thorington Hall, Suffolk,

soon after the return of his father, Col. Jones, from the Peninsula.

His education commenced at private schools, and was continued

at Harrow and Cambridge. Although steady in his student's life,

he seems to have distinguished himself more at cricket, foot-ball,

and boating, than in learning ; but he took delight in the study

of Euclid. He took an ordinary degree in January, 1836, and

after some hesitation in determining his line of life, between

divinity, commerce, and emigration, he was influenced by Mr.

George Babington, Surgeon to St. George's Hospital, to try the

medical profession, commencing in a department that few would

consider attractive, the Apothecaries' Dispensary of St. George's

Hospital, where for seven hours daily he was occupied in com-

pounding medicines for the patients. So, like Liebig, he began

with pharmacy, and this probably developed the bias in his mind

towards experimental chemistry which characterised his subsequent

career. In the autumn of the same year he became a regular

Istudent at the Hospital ; and it was in attendance in the medical

wards there that first became acquainted with him. He was

remarkable for his hair being grey at that early age, and he was

not less remarkable for an earnest abruptness of manner amounting

to impetuosity. He frequently availed himself of my experience in

auscultation, which at that time was undergoing an ordeal at

St. George's Hospital, being openly ridiculed by one physician, and

but imperfectly understood by others. But Bence Jones showed

no great aptitude either at the bedside or at the post-mortem

examinations ; and it was only after the private instructions in the

laboratory in 1839, under my then colleague Professor Graham

and Mr. Fownes, that he gave evidence of so mastering his subject

of study as to advance to original research, the first            fruits of        which
were communicated to this Society in a paper on                    "               Oxide
Calculi," which was published in the 23rd volume                      Cthyest"ic  Trans-
                                                                  of

actions." It is a purely chemical paper, proving the presence of a

large quantity of sulphur in cystine, which had been questioned by

Dr. Prout.   Several  papers  "onTrtahnesacchteimonisst,r"y   of  the urine follow in
subsequent  volumes   of the                                 all  bearing the stamp

of profound knowledge of analytical chemistry ; but it is only in the

more recent ones that the physiological and pathological reasonings

of the experienced physician become apparent ; and it is not sur-

prising that they are strongly tinctured with the views of the eele-

brated Professor of Giessen, for in 1841, before settling to practice

in London, be bad wisely availed himself of the teachings of this

school so celebrated for animal chemistry.

' All Dr. Jones's papers give evidence of a vast amount of exact

and patient work in the laboratory ; and some supply interesting
illustrations of Liebig's leading idea, in the share which oxygen has

in sustaining animal functions, by combining with the combustible

matter of the tissues.          of  our  "  Transactions  " on a " Contrast
     ' Thus in the 30th volume
between Delirium Tremens and Inflammation of the Brain," he

proves that the former is attended with a diminution in the phos-
phates in the urine, whereas inflammation of the brain greatly
increases them by the consumption of the phosphorised fat by the

flow of arterial blood through the organs. So likewise the restless

muscular movements in chorea and delirium tremens are attended

by an increased appearance of sulphates, from the oxidation of the

sulphur in the muscular tissues.
     ' Dr. Jones settled in London in 1848, and his chemical reputa-

tion soon brought him patients. The death of Dr. Prout and the

illness of Dr. Bright about this time had made an opening in his

line of practice, which he was not slack to fill, supported as he
was by the recommendations of Sir Benjamin Brodie, and by a

tide of fashion in favour of chemistry in medicine. Although still

young, his grey hair and positive manner were not without their

influence in gaining the confidence of patients ; and after his

appointment to St. George's Hospital in 1845, with opportunities

of experience and research by which he fully profited, he rapidly rose

into a large and lucrative practice of the highest class. But such

a practice, in addition to hospital work, and lectures and various
investigations continually going on in the laboratory, caused such a

heavy strain on bodily and mental powers as none but those of the

soundest and most robust constitutions can bear. It is not sur-

prising, therefore, that Dr. Bence Jones, in the year 1861, began

to suffer from palpitation of the heart ; and by aid of a flexible
stethoscope he found the signs of valvular disease, the foundation of

which was in all probability laid by an attack of rheumatic fever

from which he had suffered twenty-two years before.         first

   I' It is well known that the valvular lesions, to which

applied the terms obstructive and regurgitant, are not uncommon

Isequels of acute rheumatism ; but doubt that the profession are

fully aware of the fact that slight lesions of both kinds, with their

characteristic signs, may exist for many years without causing any

marked inconvenience ; until in middle or advancing age, under

the strain of bodily exertion or mental anxiety, the wear and tear

of life increases them, and adding other morbid conditions of the

muscular tissue, of the great secreting organs and of the blood, the

disease sooner or later tends to a mortal issue.

     ' Most wisely Dr. Jones resigned his office of physician to St.
George's Hospital in the year following ; but his ardour for science

drew him into another field, which, if less laborious and more

congenial, yet added to the responsibilities that were already
telling on his frame. He undertook the office of Honorary Secretary
to the Eoyal Institution ; and whilst he agreeably thus became the

intimate associate of Faraday, Tyndall, and other eminent professors
of that nursery of practical science, the superintendence of its
lectures and affairs devolved on him a laborious addition to his

private practice and scientific work. It is not wonderful that in

a few years his health again broke down : in 1866 we find him

dangerously ill with hydrothorax ; under skilful treatment, how-

ever, he again so far recovered that in 1867 he undertook the office

of Senior Censor of     the College   of  Physicians  ; and in  1868 he
delivered the Croonian   Lectures on      Matter and  Force."
                                       "                        In 1870

he received from Oxford the honorary degree of D.C.L. But his

work was becoming yearly more limited by increasing infirmities ;
and the usual sequels of prolonged heart-disease enlargement of

the liver, ascites, and anasarca supervening, he succumbed April

20, 1873.'

    1 Sir Henry Holland, Bart., M.D., D.C.L., LL.D., F.E.S.,

Physician to the Queen, President of the Koyal Institution, died
October 27, 1873, aetat 85. Elected Fellow in 1814, on the

Council 1817, 1833, 1834, Vice-President 1826 and 1840: he

declined nomination for the presidency.
     ' He was born October 27, 1788, at Knutsford, in Cheshire,

where his father was in general practice. He was educated at

private schools at Newcastle-on-Tyne and Bristol, and at the

Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, at which last he took the
degree of M.D. in 1811 ; having made the acquaintance of Brougham,
Walter Scott, Dugald Stewart, Jeffrey, Sydney Smith, and other

celebrities, which began that literary association which gave a
character to his whole life. Directly after his graduation he

joined a party going to Iceland, and thus commenced that series of
travels which he continued every year during a period of more than

sixty years.
     ' With a natural taste and capacity for literary pursuits, highly

cultivated by education and by association with kindred spirits ; in

manners particularly courteous and engaging almost fawning he

soon gained access to the best London society, and in an unusually

short time became established in a high grade of practice, which

continued with little variation for fifty years, in the course of which

he was brought into communication, and often intimacy, with

almost    every   person of eminence,   whether in rank, in  literature, in
science,   or in  art. Thus it is that  his " Kecollections  of past Life,"

written only a year before his death, introduce personal reminis-

cences of almost every notability of the last half-century. This

autobiography is so recent, and has been so generally read and

quoted both in and out of the profession, that it is unnecessary to

dwell on the details of the career of this celebrated man, of whom it

may be said that, as a physician, his practice, distinguished as it

was, was more aristocratic than extensive ; that his path in litera-

ture lay more in dilettanti criticisms than in solid authorship, and

that his contributions to medical and other sciences were more in

speculative and suggestive essays than in careful observation or pro-

found research. Variety and precocity of talent diligently cultivated,
and an engaging demeanour, characterised more by the siutmter in
modo than the fortiter in re, enabled Dr. Holland to make the best
of his rare opportunities, and to rise rapidly to the highest rank in

the profession without any of those hospital and professional labours

which are the more usual and safer foundations and preliminaries

to such success. But his case was quite exceptional, and by no

means to be held up as an example to be followed ; except perhaps
in the wise resolve with which, resisting the temptation to become

rapidly rich, he every year devoted two months to the recreation of

foreign travel, whereby in all probability the activity of both mind

and body was so wonderfully preserved to a ripe old age. But this

practice, however salutary, was carried to an excess ; the length and

rapidity of his journeys which were his boast became his snare, and

advanced as his age was, we can hardly doubt that it might have

been further prolonged had not his enthusiasm carried him, within

the last two months of his life, first to the north of Russia and then

to the south of Italy. He died only two days after his return home

from this last journey.'

St. George's Hospital, died December 18, aged 53. He was elected

Fellow in 1846, on the Council 1862, was secretary 1864-5, and

Vice-President 1868-9.

twenty-seven, through his father's powerful influence, he was elected

Assistant Physician to St. George's Hospital. In 1851 he took his

degree of M.D., and in the following year was made Fellow of the

Koyal College of Physicians. In 1857 he succeeded to the office of

death, having for some years been senior physician. In his hospital
duties Dr. Fuller was most industrious and painstaking ; and his

skill in diagnosis and his confidence in the action of remedies ren-
dered him a very popular clinical teacher. His communications to

our Society, as well as his more numerous separate publications, are

further proofs of his activity and intelligence as a practical physician,

and were the means of introducing him into extensive private prac-
tice. His treatises on rheumatism and gout, and on diseases of the

chest, are remarkable rather for the clearness and decision of their

views than for their originality or depth. As good summaries of

modern practice they have been so well received as to pass through

several editions ; and their lamented author was engaged in correct-

Iing proofs of a new edition of his work on rheumatism within a few
days of his death.  take this opportunity to add my testimony in

cause, cerebral pyaemia, apparently originating in an abscess in the

posterior mediastinum after a few days' illness, gives us another

example of the fatal consequences of overwork in our profession.

Eegular hospital duties, a large private practice, and continual

authorship, besides numerous engagements in the insurance offices

and societies with which he was connected, must have taxed his

powers to the utmost for many years ; yet we find him holding on
with his characteristic confidence to the last ; giving up nothing,
not even allowing himself the usual autumnal holiday ; it is not
surprising that both flesh and blood should be in a catamorphotic

state ; and that a partial suppuration induced by cold should spread

into the vessels of the overworked brain.'

   I' cannot conclude this imperfect tribute to our departed col-

leagues without one practical reflection which may bring a word of

Iwarning to the more ardent and ambitious of their survivors. Of

the eighteen whose lives have sketched, not more than five have
attained threescore years and ten, the natural age of man. At least

an equal number have prematurely fallen, too plainly the victims of
their overwork ; this overwork being the consequence and concomi-
tant of success, which excites to continued efforts in spite of warn-
ings of failing health and strength. The temptations are great and

call for unusual resolution and self-control to resist them. I, too,

have had to go through this struggle, and cannot but think that the
issue was a narrow escape worthy of mention. After ten years of

Ihonourable but very laborious toil in professional and hospital duties,
  made the wise resolve to relinquish them in time, and to forego

many public engagements, and was thus enabled to recover strength
for twenty years more of private practice, and now have lived to
receive the honour which you have conferred on me by placing me
in this chair.' . . .

    . . . (In reference to the competition of other societies.) ' If

we show ourselves to be liberal and enlightened, not tied down
by old rules and restrictions, but inspired with the spirit of
progress, and willing and eager to advance and expand with the
enlargement of our science and of our art, we need fear no rivalry
from other societies. The field is wide enough for all. The popu-

Ilation of London is nearly four times what it was when this Society

was young and almost alone ; and suppose that the members of
our profession have multiplied in like proportions. Still more, have
not enterprise, and trade, and commerce, and wealth have not

knowledge and letters expanded to enormous dimensions ? And
are our old societies and institutions to stand still and stiff in all this

swelling tide of development and progress ? If so, they must ex-

pect to be left aside and behind, and to see other societies spring up
to direct the expanding streams of knowledge, over which by timely

and liberal action they might have retained the dominion.
     ' Examples rise up in one's mind of what the Koyal Society, the

Royal College of Physicians, and other ancient institutions, might

have been had they, by timely activity, and liberal policy, assumed,
as they could have done, the functions of National Directories in
their respective departments. But to keep to our own case. Time

was when our Society, by lengthening its cords and strengthening
its stakes, could have expanded itself so as to include the growing
branches of medical knowledge within its own sphere of direction.
The idea was started and the attempt was made, but it was opposed

and failed ; the opportunity was lost ! You know the sequel. These
branches established themselves independently in distinct societies,

and all subsequent attempts at amalgamation have failed.

' Still, not only are some of these societies our tenants, but are

not many of their members our own flesh and blood ? Surely, then,

we may live with them on the most neighbourly and friendly terms,

and, profiting by the example of their energy and activity, let us

take our  part  in the onward march,  and  then with the prestige of our
history,  our   " Transactions," and  our  library, comprehending the

greatest names and the greatest works in our profession, we shall

not fail to maintain our position in the foremost rank among the

societies and institutions of our country.'

     The obituary notices continue in the address of the
following year, 1875.

' Francis Edmund Anstie, M.D.Lond., F. E.G. P., Physician to

the Westminster Hospital, died September 12, 1874.

' He was born at Devizes, and after education at a private

school, was articled to his cousin, a general practitioner in the
same town. In 1853 he commenced his medical studies at King's

College, London, with little remarkable in his career, unless in his

enthusiastic devotion to the teaching of Dr. Todd, under whom

he acted as clinical clerk, and had his attention specially called to

the use of stimulants, and to the study of diseases of the nervous

system. In 1858 he took the degree of M.D. in the University of

London, and began to practise as a physician, first in Onslow

Square, and after his marriage, in 1862, in Wimpole Street. He

had already been connected with the Westminster Hospital, and

in I860 he was appointed Assistant-physician and Lecturer on

Forensic Medicine. After contributing several essays on the

action of alcohol on the system to different journals, in 1864 he

published a work of considerable ability and research on stimu-

lants and       Lncaoannrccjuoentticc"tsi.oanndHwetiotwha"sDKrae.lysonLaoawldlssao'rgnSe,yshcteoenmtfroibuounftdoeMrdedttoihceitnhee"."pPargaIecns-

the management of his journal, but, as with other young journalists

of the present day, his criticisms were sometimes in excess of his

experience, for his hospital practice until the last year was limited

to the little-instructive class of out-patients, and his private

practice was very scanty until after the publication of his work on

neuralgia. He had himself been a sufferer from this malady, and

this fact, together with the previous direction of his studies, gave

him such a thorough knowledge of this subject that he soon be-

came an authority    and  "a   centre of        increasing   eMxepdeicriiennece".   In like
manner his articles   in      Eeynolds'         System of

unequal in merit, those on alcoholism and neuralgia being just as

truthful and masterly as that on pleurisy is deficient in accuracy

and information.

' Dr. Anstie was so well known and generally esteemed as one

    ' " Dr. Anstie contributed occasional articles on scientific sub-

jects to various non-medical papers, and was for years a member

of the editorial staff of this journal. In that capacity he was the

originator and the chief member of the ' Lancet ' Commission to

inquire into the state of workhouses, and not only laid down the

be carried on, but also took a principal part in conducting the

1865, and was soon recognised as a power in that venerable

institution, where his voice was raised in support of every pro-

posal which was calculated to increase the dignity or to extend the

usefulness of the College. He was much interested in the recent
improvements in the manner of electing the Fellows, as well as

in the negotiations for the conjoint scheme of examination, and he

was the prime mover of the petition to the Premier on the subject
of the overcrowded dwellings of the poor. In two directions,

therefore in the reform of workhouses, and in the limitation of

the powers of railways to sweep away needful habitations his

efforts led immediately to legislation for the public good."
     ' The untimely death of this able physician just as he was

attaining the prosperity due to his talents and devotion, has been

felt as one of the saddest events of the past year ; and the more

deplorable as being an accidental result of neglect of hygienic rules,

which are necessary for the safety of the profession as well as of the

public.'

     ' Sir James Banald Martin, C.B., F.R.S., F.E.C.S., Examin-

ing Medical Officer to the Secretary of State for India in Council,
428 MED. CHIR. SO C. SIR J. R. MARTIA.

Inspector General of Army Hospitals, Member of the Permanent

Army Sanitary Commission, &c. &c., died November 27, aged 81.
     ' Born in the Isle of Skye, of old Highland parentage, he

received his early education at Inverness, but his medical in-

struction was derived from St. George's Hospital and the schools

of Wilson, Bell, and Brodie, in Windmill Street, London. An

appointment in the service of the Hon. East India Company soon
determined his sphere of action. In 1817, he arrived in Calcutta,

and from that time until he finally quitted India, in 1840, he was

constantly engaged in various departments, military and civil,

and soon became highly distinguished by his zeal and ability, not

only in the routine of practice, but also in his investigations into

the causes and means of prevention of disease, and in devising

sanitary regulations for barracks and hospitals. Like my lamented

friend, Dr. McLennan, in the Bombay Presidency, so Martin was

one of the earliest sanitary reformers in the Bengal province ; and

the variety and extent of the experience thus obtained qualified

him to take a leading part in the Government Commission on the

sanitary state of the army in India, subsequently originated by

Sidney Herbert. After having taken part in several campaigns in

Orissa and Burmah, and suffering severely from jungle fever, in

1826 he settled in Calcutta, and soon had a large private practice.

In 1828 he was appointed surgeon to the Presidency and to the

Native Hospital of Calcutta. He thus gained a large experience

in the diseases of India ; and when the failure of his health

compelled him to quit that country in 1840, he brought with him

to London the reputation of being the highest authority on Oriental

maladies. This was further confirmed by his joining Dr. James

Johnson in producing a new edition of the well-known work on
" The Influence of Tropical Climates on European Constitutions,"

in 1841 ; and in subsequent editions in 1855 and 1861 it was
issued in his own name. Although in considerable consulting

practice during his residence of thirty-four years in London, it

appears from several notices of Sir Eanald Martin's life from

the pens of well-informed friends, that a large portion of his time

                              Journal     "

                                         :

' ' ' He took an active part in forwarding the great sanitary

movement in this country. He gave his time and his energies,

and his great business powers, ungrudgingly to the public in this

service ; spending days, and weeks, and months, sitting on Boards

and Eoyal Commissions ; inquiring into and reporting on ques-

tions of public health affecting the community, and the British and

Indian armies ; giving up time that might have been devoted to
adding to his fortune and making provision for his large family." '

' Although Sir Eanald Martin's numerous and eminent services

were acknowledged by honorary distinctions, there was little sub-

stantial return for the devotion of nearly sixty years of his life

to incessant and anxious toil, with great and frequent danger and

injury to his health. Merchants, planters, and civil officers of

high rank return from India with large fortunes after much less

labour and much shorter terms, but this most distinguished

military medical officer, when compelled by ill-health to return

after twenty-three years of active service, finds himself obliged to

resume practice for thirty-four years more ; he returns, not to otium,

but to labor cum dignitate, including a gratuitous work of sanitary

reform, begun in India, and carried out by himself and others in

England, the result of which has been to preserve thousands of

lives, and to save millions of money.

' The profession owe much to Sir E. Martin for his spirited

advocacy of its claims to consideration and distinction, especially

on two important occasions. When he was made member of the

Health of Towns Commission in 1842, whose report led to the

appointment of district officers of health, it was through his influence

that medical  men were appointed to   these offices,  piunbsltieshadedofhaistto"rnSeuyms-,

induced his friends, Sir Howard Douglas and Sir De Lacy Evans,

to bring the subject before the House of Commons, he was mainly

instrumental in causing the honours of the Bath to be extended to

distinguished medical officers, to whom they had hitherto been re-

fused. These signal services, and his achievements, early and late,

as a pioneer and promoter of sanitary reform, have won for the

name of Ranald Martin a foremost place in our ranks, whilst his

gentlemanly and genial nature endeared him to a large circle of

friends.

     ' Thus, during the past year we have lost from our ranks two
men who have signally reflected honour on their profession by their
noble and unselfish exertions in the cause of humanity. Nor are
their histories singular. Nay, do they not rather represent the
general character of the lives of medical men, who, hi their respec-
tive spheres, find themselves called on and do not refuse to toil
night and day, often sacrificing their health and sometimes their
lives, for the relief of suffering, without, or with very inadequate,
430 MAWS DOMINION DIVINELY APPOINTED.

remuneration ? Doubtless it is a noble and a godlike work, and as-

suredly they have their reward ; but this conies not from the grati-

tude of the public, nor from the appreciation of their services by

the upper ranks of society. Because, unfortunately, the numbers

and the needs of medical men are commonly so great that some are

ready to proffer their services at any or at no price, the public seem

to expect from them gratuitous work, which would not be thought

of from any other profession or trade. Against such injustice we

cannot too strongly or persistently protest.

' A recent communication from our Council to the Society gives

me occasion to notice what must be considered another indignity
offered to our profession. The Secretary of the Eoyal Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has addressed to our Secretary

a letter asking permission to be present with two other gentlemen

when any operations  on living animals are  appointed to                bethpaet rf"orimf ethde.
You know that the    reply of the Council   was explicit,

Society should undertake any scientific investigations rendering such

processes necessary, they would certainly decline the presence or in-

terference of any unqualified witnesses."
    ' In justification of this decision it would not be difficult to prove

that only those profoundly acquainted with physiology can be com-
petent judges of the necessity of making experiments on animals

and of the most merciful mode of conducting them, and that the

humanity of such experts being also practitioners of the healing
art, the great aim and constant object of which is the relief of pain

Iand the mitigation of suffering the humanity of such, say, may

be implicitly trusted, without being subjected to the espionage and
surveillance of impulsive and unqualified observers. In justification

of the practice of vivisection for scientific and humane purposes, it
has been fairly argued that if whole hecatombs of animals are

habitually and ruthlessly sacrificed, not only for food, but for luxury,
and for sport, and often with little or no consideration for their

individual tortures, there is a much more rational and cogent plea

Ifor the use of a few in scientific investigations which have intimate

bearings on the relief of suffering humanity. But would claim a

warrant on still higher grounds by reminding you that, long before

THE termination of my presidency of the Medical and Chirur-

gical Society took place in the spring of 1875 : but a few

events deserving mention had occurred previously. Early in

Ithe session of 1873-4 made a communication to that Society

' On the Acoustic principles and construction of Stethoscopes
Iand Ear-trumpets.' So far as regards stethoscopes
                                                       have

already made some remarks in the note on page 49 of the

present volume, and refer the reader to them, and to the
original paper in the 57th volume of the Medico-Chirurgical

Transactions.

But the continuance of my infirmity of deafness has given

me the opportunity of further experience with respect to

ear-trumpets, the results of which may well be introduced

here.

The acoustic principle of the ear-trumpet is quite different

from that of the stethoscope. Instead of being both a solid

conductor and a closed tube of air, as the stethoscope, it is an

aerial reflector and an open tube, to catch the waves of sound
CONSTRUCTION OF EAR-TRUMPETS.                     433

in the open air, and to concentrate them with increased force

into the ear. Sounds are ordinarily conveyed to the ear

through the air, and as this is both slower and weaker as a

conductor of sound than solids, we have but few means of

intensifying its sounds, and the chief of these is by reflection

and concentration. Aerial sounds are however also caught

by light rigid expanded solids, prone to vibration, as sounding

boards of musical instruments, the membrane of drums, and

the fan of the audiphone.

The best materials for reflecting aerial sounds are those

solids which most differ from air in hardness and density,

such as metals, glass, porcelain, &c. ; but the weight of some

of these, the fragility of others, and the intrinsic tinkling note

of all, form objections to their use as ear-trumpets. Still the

best instruments in common use are made of silver, plated

metal, or japanned iron. The lightness of aluminium might

Iclaim for it a preference. Ebonite, which formerly recom-
Imended, on further experience find inferior ; and its fragility

proves a further objection. Thin papier mache, as made so
cheaply and perfectly in Japan, would probably supply the

Ibest material ; and strongly recommend instrument-makers

to endeavour to get the forms of ear-trumpet here described,
manufactured in Japan. The ingenuity and enterprise of

Japanese artisans would soon be shown in a way unequalled

Iin any English fabrics. Since my retirement have not been

in the way of getting this accomplished. In the meantime

Ithe best substitute have met with is thin pasteboard, or

cardboard, as thin as possible consistently with sufficient

rigidity to preserve its proper shape in the conical or tubular

form now to be described.

     Deaf persons commonly require two kinds of ear-trumpet.
One for ii'tc-n-tttc conversational use, in which the speaker

talks into or close to one end of the tube, the other end being
applied to the ear of the hearer. This is the simplest kind,

requiring no strict conditions as to either material or shape.

A tube only is necessary, one end of which is introduced in

the ear; and it may be flexible or rigid, tortuous or straight.

without making much difference in its power of distinctly
                         sounds. For many

ear-trumpet of this kind has been sold by Creswick, Stationer,
12 Great Portland Street, London. For convenience in por-
tability and use, it is made in several pieces, to slide into each

other so as to lengthen or shorten, like a telescope. It is

rather roughly constructed, and costs only a few shillings, but

Iit is the best conversational ear-tube for a deaf person that
Iever met with. use it habitually, and prefer it to every other

kind. The sound of the voice is intensified by the length of
the tube, for it is louder than when spoken closely into the
unacided ear ; and what is most important, the articulation is
distinct, and wholly free from the confusing din or roar caused

by most ear-trumpets and tubes, to which I shall presently

allude. The mouth end may be expanded a little to facilitate
the reception of the words ; but this is not essential, provided

that care be taken to speak into, and not beside, the orifice of
the tube. But the use of this ear-tube is limited to conversa-
tion at close quarters ; it avails nothing for distant sounds :
therefore for hearing at the distance of a yard and upwards,
and still more at church, or in other public assemblies, another
kind is wanted.

     We come then to consider the form of ear-trumpet that
enables a deaf person to hear more or less remote sounds. The

simplest and most efficient reflector of sound is a hollow cone
with a wide base, open to receive as large a body of sound as
possible, to be reflected directly to the apex, and conveyed by

a short curved tube into the ear. All repeated or secondary
reflections of sound, such as those in parabolic or circular

cavities, are to be avoided ; because, being retarded, they con-
fuse the sound by an echo following, instead of coinciding
with it. Such instruments may increase the noise, but they
impair the clearness of articulate sounds, which hearing-
trumpets ought to convey to the ear pure, and unmixed with

echoes or reverberations.
      Now, in point of fact, these confusing sounds are heard,

more or less, in all ear-trumpets, as commonly constructed.
 They all have the conch-like roar, resembling that of the sea
heard in large shells, which confounds the distinctness of
words or other definite sounds. This noise is a reverberating
 echo of any adventitious sounds from without, and takes its
               FORM FOR A DISTANCE.      43$

tone from the note proper to the size of the cavity or tube.

Every tube has its proper note, resulting from the longitu-

dinal vibrations of its column of air from end to end ; and

every cavity has its note, produced by repeated reflections

across its diameter ; and these notes respond to every noise

or impulse communicated to the tube or cavity. Moreover,

these noises not only confuse the original sound, but are often

painful to the ear, which may be sensitive in feeling, although

Iits hearing is impaired. It was therefore important to get rid

of them; and devised various means by which this could

Ibe accomplished in the conical tube which chose for my

I Iear-trumpet. Without dwelling on some of inferior efficacy,

  will merely state those which found most effectual. One

was to have the cone large, subtending an angle of from

twenty to twenty-five degrees. When narrower, the cone

takes in less sound, and has more internal reverberations.
IEven in wide cones much noise remains.
                                         got rid of this

by these two expedients : 1. By using a less perfect reflector,
such as cartridge paper or thin pasteboard for the expansion

of the cone at its broad end. 2. By opening one side of the

cone by oblique truncation, and prolonging the slit to within

Ia few inches of the ear end. No sooner had I thus obliquely

opened the cone almost from end to end, than was struck at
once by the resemblance that it bore to the ear of the ass, the

Ihare, and other quadrupeds, and was not a little pleased

I Iat this unexpected confirmation of the conclusion to which
had been led.  think that there can be little doubt that

this form of external ear is wisely designed to aid the hearing
of these animals in the simplest and most efficient way, by

directing and concentrating sounds, without the confusing

reverberation produced in complete tubes and hollows. It is

not improbable, too, that the hairs which fringe the margins
of the ears in these animals, may serve a like purpose, by

Imuffling stray and superfluous sounds.
        made some attempts to estimate the magnifying power
of my instruments ; but it was difficult to make accurate
observations in a city where disturbing noises are rarely

absent! Taking as a test sound the ticking of a small mantel-

Ipiece clock, by the aid of these tubes heard it from ten to a

hundred times the distance at which it could, be heard with
the unaided ear. A large cone of stiff cartridge-paper twenty-
two inches long and ten inches broad at its base, made the
ticking audible at a hundred- fold the distance at which the
unassisted ear could hear it ; but this was made for experi-
mental purposes only, and too large for common use. 1 Smaller
cones, fit for use, rendered the ticking audible at from ten to

Ithirty times the unaided hearing distance.

     During the last summer (1883) gave as a model to Messrs.
Creswick and Co., 12 Great Portland Street, an old ear-trumpet

Iof the best form that made myself some twenty or thirty

years ago, being an obliquely open cone of thin pasteboard as
described above, with a short curved ear-piece of tinned iron
covered with indiarubber tubing. From this pattern they
have succeeded in making very good instruments, which
magnify distant sounds without any roar; and in several
instances have enabled deaf persons to hear at church quite
distinctly. They answered with myself for some time; but
now my infirmity has increased beyond their power of relief.

     The superiority of these pasteboard cones over those of
metal, lies in their conveying the sound vibrations through
their light material by conduction as well as by reflection, and
in their being more free from the echoes and ringing sounds
developed by metals. The same property is possessed by the
fan or lamina of the audiplione. The utility of this instru-
ment seems to me to be limited to those cases of deafness in
which the cause lies chiefly in the outer ear, still leaving a
way for the passage of sound by the teeth to the inner organ

of hearing.

     In the case of all aids to hearing now noticed, the use of

the external ear, or pinna, is superseded by the small tube of
the ear-trumpet being inserted into the auditory passage.
But we ought not altogether disregard the aid to our hearing
which nature has provided in our outer ears, although less
bountifully to man than to many of the lower animals. Judging
from my own experience and that of others whose hearing is

Iimpaired, think that much help might be obtained from the

use of a sound collector behind the ear, and directing it forward

towards the sound, as we instinctively do with the hand,

and as we see many quadrupeds point their ears with good

effect. A light cowl of indiarubber or gutta percha, cf semi-

parabolic form, with a rounded notch to fit behind the ear,

and with a free margin projecting three or four inches in

a parabolic curve beyond the pinna, would probably prove a

Iconsiderable aid to the hearing ; but the ear, although directed
forwards, must be freely open in front.       commend these

suggestions to ingenious instrument -makers.

     In testimony of respect to the memory of the lamented

IPrince Consort, and at the same time as an indulgence in the

luxury of good .music, became a subscriber to the Eoyal
Albert Hall, and held seats in the front circle during the

remainder of my residence in London. On the occasion of its

Iopening (May 1871) wrote a letter to the Times, inserted

below, 1 complimenting General Scott, the designer of that

                                               1 THE ALBERT HALL.

                                    (To the Editor of the Times.)

                                                     May 4, 1871.

    ISir, While wo have reason to congratulate Colonel Scott on the compara-

tive acoustic success of the Albert Hall, think that this success may be
further increased by more attention to the acoustic principles of its construc-
tion. In his letter Colonel Scott does not appear to me to describe correctly
the sound-board action in musical instruments, or its application in the
wooden wainscoting of the Hall. He says :

    1 It is a matter of common observation that musical sounds often set up a

vibration in the sounding-board of a piano, glass drinking-vessels, and similar
resonant objects, and manifestly an interval must elapse between the actuating
sound and the sympathetic response.'

     But the vibration thus set up is that, not of the soundinj^|board, but of the
wires of the piano, or of the glass of the vessels, which happen to be in unison
or in harmony with the original musical sound, and yield their own correspond-
ing tones. The sounding-board receives and diffuses this sound by its large
vibrating surface ; but, unlike the wires or the glass, it has no note of its own.

It merely communicates to the air the vibrations which it receives from the

wire or string, and thus increases the volume of sound (vibrating air) which
reaches the ear. Sounding-boards are chiefly useful where the vibrating body
producing sound is a solid, as in the case of wired or stringed instruments, and
tuning-forks ; and they owe their efficiency to the rigidity of their wood fibre,
by which they promptly receive and transmit the vibrations, and to the light-
438 PREVENTION OF ECHOES.

Ibuilding, on its acoustic success, which considered to be due

to the liberal use of wood in the walls and galleries, which,
instead of reflecting sound, and so causing confusing and
disagreeable echoes, or after-repetitions of the primary vibra-
tions, take up the note and reciprocate it in the manner of a
sounding-board. But there were portions of the circular wall
of the upper gallery not thus covered, and these caused a

Idisturbing echo, marring the music at certain opposite points.
  suggested a remedy, by either drapery or wooden wainscoting
partially covering these naked walls and so either muffling

Ior retaining the vibrations. From a communication which
Iafterwards had with General Scott, it appeared that he had not

quite comprehended the explanation which had offered, and
that the success had been rather accidental than from design.

ness of their mass, which renders their vibrations more excursive and more

able to impress the air in contact with their large surfaces. The sounds of

wind instruments and the voice are not equally increased by sounding-boards,

and the same may be said of other sounds communicated through air. But

although we cannot greatly augment aerial sounds on this sounding-board

Iprinciple, we can do something in this way ; and believe that something to

have been successfully gained by Colonel Scott in his preferring thin wood to
other materials for the lining of the Albert Hall.

    If the walls had been faced with a hard, smooth, dense material, such as

stone, tile, or plaster, they would have so perfectly reflected the sound as to

produce distinct echoes, which, retarded by distance and repeated so long after
the original sound, would confuse the words of speakers ; and musical notes out

of time, and therefore out of tune would follow. Confusion and discord would

have been the necessary results.

    If the walls had been completely covered with a soft, flaccid material, like

drapery, which damps or deadens sound by completely neutralising the vibra-
tions, there would be neither echo nor resonance ; but although loud notes

might have been distinct enough, all weaker sounds would be as much lost as

if they were made in the open air.
     A lining of thin, light wood will neither reflect the sound nor damp it, but

will, in a measure, receive and participate in its vibrations, and thus increase

the body of sound in its vicinity, without any sufficient retardation to injure

time or tune. The general result will be to make the whole air of the amphi-
theatre, with its resounding wooden walls, vibrate in harmony or system with

the leading notes of the orchestra, without any stray notes or echoes to cause

confusion.

    If it should be found on further trial that any such echoes still remain,

Ino doubt they may be silenced by a judicious distribution of drapery; but

would suggest that the same correction might be obtained, with less sacrifice of

sound, by frames or diaphragms of light ornamental woodwork on the echoing

surfaces.  I am, Sir, yours faithfully,

According to my observations, architects are just as negligent
of the study of the laws of sound in providing for the acoustic

capacities of their buildings, as they are of the fundamental
principles of lighting and ventilating them. What is more

common than to find churches, and lecture and concert halls,

marred for their most important objects by the noisy echoes
that resound from every side within their walls ?

     The seat in the Albert Hall adjoining to mine was that of

the Marquis and Marchioness of Eipon, who had been my

friends after my long attendance on his father and mother,

the late Earl and the Countess of Eipon, from all of whom I

had received warm assurances of satisfaction and regard. In

Ireminiscence of similar sentiments (rather than that they have

any connection with my context, and may not have another

Iopportunity of recording them), would mention in addition to

several already spoken of, the names of other noble and dis-

tinguished individuals who have honoured me with their con-

fidence and with satisfying acknowledgments of my consequent
services : Lord and Lady Wolverton, Earl and Countess Cairns,
Earl Spencer, Lord Kilmaine, Lord and Lady Beaumont, the
family of the late Earl of Clarendon, Earl and late Countess
Granville, Lord Monson, Earl of Stradbroke, Earl of Ilchester,
Earl Bathurst, Viscount and Lady Maynard, Earl of Suffolk,
Earl of Stamford and Warrington, Viscount Strangford, Lord

Thomas and Lady Sophia Cecil, Dowager Marchioness of
Exeter, Viscount Sandon, Earl Fortescue, Dowager Viscountess
Galway, Countess Howth, Archbishop Sumner, Sir Thomas
Gladstone, H.E.H. Princess Frederick of the Netherlands,

H.I.H. Duke de Leutchenberg, Prince de Messina, Prince Louis

Lucien Bonaparte, and others which escape my recollection.
    In the autumn of 1874, knowing that this was to be my

Ilast season, determined to attend the meeting of the British

Association for the Advancement of Science which was to

Ibe held at Belfast, and this would give me the opportunity

of visiting the North and West of Ireland, which had not Keen.

      Accompanied by my youngest daughter, we started in the

Imiddle of August. Halting one night in Chester and another

in Dublin, did not get letters till arriving at Belfast. In the
train between Dublin and Belfast, which bore also Professor
440 APPOINTMENT TO THE QUEEN,

ITyndall and other members of the Association, taking up an

Irish paper, read an announcement to this effect: 'Dr.

C. J. B. Williams has been appointed Physician Extraordinary

to the Queen.'

   IThis honour was quite unexpected. Not only had never
Isought for any such distinction, but had never even been

presented at Court, and may have been considered wanting

in the loyal courtesy due to Her Majesty from one so much
Ifavoured by the public. But liberal though
                                             was, and
Iespecially opposed to pretentious tyrannies of every kind,

would yield to no man in loyalty and devotion to a sovereign

who with the beloved and lamented Prince Consort possessed

Ithe affections and the confidence of the whole people.

     But was somewhat shy and averse to the forms and

ceremonies of Court life, and thought that my more serious

occupations would plead a sufficient excuse for remaining in

private. However, through kind advice, Her Majesty found

me out and graciously bestowed on me an unsought honour,

Ifor which was grateful.
   IOn arriving at Belfast found the official letter from the

ILord Chamberlain announcing my appointment, which ac-

knowledged in dutiful and grateful terms.

   I had no communication of my own to make to the meeting
Iof the Association ; but was anxious to show in the natural

history section a fine collection of seaweeds from Jersey, which

had been beautifully preserved and displayed by an old patient

and friend of mine, Miss E. Dyke Poore of 31 Eoseville Street,

Jersey ; a lady confined to a couch by paralysis of her lower

limbs, but who had acquired such skill and dexterity in the

preparation and preservation of the marvellous colours and

diversified structures of these algse as to command the admira-

tion of all. The president, Sir Joseph Hooker, P.K.S.,

expressed the thanks of the section to Miss Poore for her

successful work in this department of botany.

   IMany years had elapsed since had been at a meeting of

the Association ; and this visit was saddened by missing so

many old friends who used to be the leading spirits Buckland,

Sedgwick, Whewell, Murchison, Taylor, Graham, all gone ; and

now followed by Phillips, the very life and mainspring of the

Association. The following remarks are extracted from a letter

Iwhich addressed to the Lancet on the subject of this visit :

    ' In the establishment of the practice of giving addresses, both

Igeneral and sectional, think a move has been made in the right

direction, and several delivered on this occasion were either valuable

summaries of the present state of their respective branches of

science, or presented important contributions of new facts. Dr.

Tyndall's Presidential address, although received with much eclat,

can hardly be placed in either of these categories. Publicly ap-

plauded, it was privately discussed with unmerciful criticism. In my

opinion he had wandered out of his element and out of his depth,

into the ideal and fantastic regions of ancient philosophy, so-called,

in. which men, instead of study ing and so interpreting Nature
through facts, sought hi their own minds systems spun from the

cobwebs of their fancy, to account for the phenomena of mind and

matter.

' Even Professor Huxley seemed to be partially led away by a

similar passion for  sopfec"ulTahtieon,nawthueren  in his most interesting and
masterly exposition                                of automatic movements of

animals" he delights to expatiate on the happy conjectures of Des-

cartes, and does not even mention Marshall Hall, who by positive

experiment first established the reality of those reflex actions on
which automatism depends. When speculation is thus exalted

above  aegxapienrsitm"enlot,gicital  is not surprising  that many   should raise an
alarm                                 consequences and  dangerous  tendencies," and

Ian outcry is set up against materialistic science. For my own part,
  see so little resemblance between the atomic doctrines of the pre-

sent day and the fanciful molecules and atoms of Democritus and

Lucretius, that they carry no conclusions in common. Eeligion
and science are wholly distinct ; the one being founded on faith in

divine revelation, the other on human observation and reason.
     ' The addresses of Professor Kedfern in the department of Ana-

tomy and Physiology, and that of Dr. Hooker in that of Zoology
and Botany, were both admirable, and strictly within the limits,

and marking the progress, of their respective sciences. Professor

Redfern adverted to the advances made during the last thirty years

in our knowledge of the nature of textural nutrition. The cell-

theory of Schwann and Schleiden transferred the process from the

body, as a whole, to its constituent molecules ; whilst more recent

researches, although substantiating the principle of molecular life

and proliferation, traced it to a protoplasmic matter independent of

cells, these being frequent, but not essential parts in the process.
442 ASSOCIATION ADDRESSES.

This change of opinion is the more interesting to myself, because as

Ilong as thirty years ago, in observations on the white blood-corpus-

cles as representatives of the plasma, first described them as little

lumps of jelly, adhering to the walls of the blood-vessels, within and

without, and not possessing essentially a cellular structure. Shortly

afterwards Dr. W. Addison made the remarkable discovery that

these corpuscles pass bodily through the walls of the vessels a fact
which, although reaffirmed by Dr. Waller, was not generally re-

ceived until rediscovered by Professor Cohnheim within the last

seven years. Subsequently, the wonderful amoeboid and migratory

Iproperties of these corpuscles have been more fully made out.

And here would emphatically point out that it is not pus -cells, or
white cells, or cells at all, that have this vital power of migration,

but morsels of protoplasmic jelly, and these only when alive ; for,

as proved by Graham, and noticed in Professor Eedfern's address,
dead colloids, even in solution, will not pass through membranes,

where crystalloids pass freely. Professor Eedfern did not refer to

Ithe application of these fundamental doctrines to pathology, which
   have endeavoured to open up, and which promises a rich field

for future investigators. He adverted to several recent researches

proving the passage of nerve-fibrils beyond basement membrane, so

as to come in actual contact with objects of taste and smell ; and,
according to Pfliiger, the same occurs in the secreting epithelium of

the salivary gland. Altogether, the last fifty years have been re-

markable for the great advances made in physiology, chiefly through

aids afforded by physical science.

' The address of Dr. Hooker, although on a limited subject,

' The Carnivorous Habits of certain Plants,' was replete with most

curious and interesting facts, which establish clearly that certain

genera, including dionaea, drosera, sarracenia, darlingtonia, and

nepenthe, are distinctly and designedly carnivorous. They present

various modifications of structure, comprising honey glands to

attract insects, and either contractile leaves to close on them, or a

narrow-mouthed cup or pitcher beset with reversed hairs to prevent

their escape ; an acid fluid by which they are digested, and an

Iabsorbent apparatus by which they are appropriated to the nourish-
ment of the plant.  am sure that many will agree with Dr. Hooker

in his concluding remark, that these evidences of intelligent design

of correlation of organs and functions between the several kingdoms

of nature, transcend in wonder and interest those of evolution and

origin of species.

     ' Equally marvellous and suggestive of infinite wisdom in design
were the interesting observations of Sir John Lubbock, proving the
ANCIENT IRISH CROACH PATRICK.                                                   443

dependence and mutual adaptations of structure between flowers

and insects ; and this not merely for the simple purposes of fertilisa-

tion, direct and cross, but also for the improvement of the species

on the principle of selection ; the brightest colours, the strongest

scents, and the sweetest honey, attracting most certainly and freely

the visits of insects, and thus making most sure the fecundity of the

best individuals. All this was most interesting and instructive, and

one cannot help remarking how it enlarges the theme of Watts's

                         How doth the little  busy bee,"  &c.'

      Nothing at the meeting interested us more than a lecture
by my old friend, Sir William Wilde, on the ancient Irish
races, whose early history he succeeded in illustrating by
reference to numerous relics and ruins scattered through the
West of Ireland, described in his interesting book on Lough

Corrib. The aborigines, the Fomorians, of a prehistoric period,

were supplanted by the Firbolgs, of Belgic origin, a small
and swarthy race, who in their turn had to struggle with
the Teutons, or Scandinavian Danaans, a large, fair or sandy-

haired people of superior knowledge and intelligence. Traces
of each of these tribes are to be found, not only in the mounds
and antiquities of the country, but also in the complexion and

characters of the inhabitants of different parts.
     After the meeting we made an excursion to Donegal and

IConnemara ; and should much more have enjoyed the wild vari-

eties of scenery, but that was tormented by a painful abscess
in the jaw which almost closed my mouth and half starved me
for several days, while jerked about in the open cars of the

Icountry. Arriving much exhausted at Westport, found my

friend Dr. Pye Smith there, also coming from the meeting of

the Association, and he prescribed a remedy which gave me
complete relief. This was a large tumbler of hot and not

weak Irish whisky and water. This gave me a sounder sleep

Ithan had enjoyed for many days, brought the abscess to an
Iend, and two days after made the ascent of Croagh Patrick,

from the top of which the saint is said to have taken his flight,
after having ' guv the bugs and toads a twist and banish'd all

and decent ; but one thing struck me as extraordinary, that

during the week of our stay we never had the offer of a taste

of fish ; yet Westport is on a creek of the sea, and from

ICroagh Patrick could see the capes and sinuosities of the

shore, with Achill Island beyond, offering such facilities for

Ifishing, and, as learnt, abundance of fish in the sea, as to

suggest an unlimited supply of food and profitable traffic ;

yet there were numbers of miserable peasants, half starving

on potatoes and buttermilk ! We halted a few days at

Leenane, a Protestant station in another creek to the south.

Here we were well supplied with salmon not from fishermen,

but from the amateur anglers who resort there for the pur-

pose ; but we had evidence of the richness of the waters, in a

gigantic crab, which by some chance was caught, and supplied

enough for a dozen public car passengers who stopped to

Ilunch ! The only sign of industry in this branch that

witnessed was in several carts conveying sacks of periwinkles ;

Icollected by children among the rocks ; these, was told, were

going to London. One would think this might suggest how

much more could be done in the fishing way, with a little

more enterprise and industry, among this wretched people.

   IIn each of my four or five visits to Ireland have also been

struck with the prodigious prevalence of boy throughout the

Icountry ; and in the cursory manner in which have passed
Ithrough, this prevalence seemed to be on the increase. In the

Shannon and its series of loughs, believe this is admitted

to be the case ; and unless some gigantic measures be taken

     We visited Dr. Hudson in his cottage on a wild moor

Ivivacity of his former self, grieved to see that he was wear-

acoustics, -connected with his experiments on Fog-signals at sea on behalf

of the Trinity House. He found that certain states of the air which are

optically clear, are acoustically opaque, and the converse ; that is, that sound
will not pass straight through air in certain states, although there is no visible
obstacle, but is diverted in another direction. This he ascribes to reflection by
Ithe impervious, or acoustically opaque, portion of air, and causes what he calls
an aerial echo.  object that for reflection of sound (as of light) there must be
a sudden change of density in the medium, to form a reflecting surface, which
could not take place in air, in which such variations could be only gradual.

I had no opportunity of taking any part in the affairs of the

Society. But great as was the prestige of this learned body,

Iand profound as were its claims to our veneration and respect,

  could not but regret to notice how unpopular it was ; how

poorly for the most part its meetings were attended, and how

many expressions of dissatisfaction were heard, both within

and without its walls. The subjects of complaint were various

and too numerous to mention : but most of them seemed to

me to arise out of the spirit of exclusiveness which now pre-

vailed in the councils of the Society. This, if it did not

originate from, was annually kept up by, a regulation new in

the history of the Society and opposed to the terms of its

charter that of limiting the election of Fellows to the num-

ber of fifteen annually. At the time when this innovation was

introduced, there seems to have been an avowed design to

permanently reduce the numbers of the Fellows, not to pro-

mote the objects of the Society, but for the sole purpose of en-

hancing the dignity of the Fellowship. And the numbers were

diminishing year by year ; the majority of the candidates for

admission were rejected; and many deserving and eligible

persons were deterred from becoming candidates by the small
Ichance open to them in so scanty an election.
                                                                  resolved to

bring the subject before the Fellows at the annual meeting

in November ; and having obtained necessary information
by reference to the ' Proceedings,' and to Weld's ' History of

the Society,' without consulting with anyone except Colonel

Strange, whom I knew to be an independent Fellow, I pro-

ceeded as described in the following statement :

     ' At the last Anniversary Meeting of the Royal Society on
November 30, 1 thought it my duty to call the attention of the
Fellows to the present limitation in the election of new Fellows,

and its injurious effects on the usefulness and resources of the

But such gradual change of density (as might bo caused by heat, or by watery

Isociety, and concluded with a motion (which was seconded

by Colonel Strange), recommending the subject to the con-
sideration of the Council. As there seemed- to be some
difference of opinion among those who spoke, it was thought
better to leave the matter in the hands of the Council, without

Ipressing the motion ; it was therefore withdrawn ; but think

it right to bring the substance of my address before the Fellows
at large, with some additional matter bearing on the subject.

     ' Mr. PRESIDENT,

      I' If feel myself called on to offer an apology for occupying

your attention in tins, the fortieth year of my Fellowship, it is chiefly

to express my regret that professional engagements (professorial and

Ipractical) have so much engrossed my time and strength in past

years that have been unable to take any active part in the pro-
ceedings of the Society. What brings me now before you is the
subject of the present limitations in the election of Fellows. We
now have every year long lists of candidates for the Fellowship,
varying from 45 to 60 in number, and from these only fifteen, from
a third to a fourth, are recommended by the Council for election,
the rest waiting until increased merit, or perchance increased
interest, may make them more fortunate in future years. But still
the general result of this limitation has been the rejection of the
majority of the candidates. Such a restriction in the election of
Fellows was not contemplated in the original constitution of the
Society, nor can any warrant be found for it in its charters, or in
any of its proceedings, until the year 1847. Before that date,
candidates were proposed at ordinary meetings, and after their certi-
ficates had been suspended during five ordinary meetings, they were
ballotted for by the Fellows. About that time this mode of election
was considered unsatisfactory, being often determined less by the
scientific merits of the candidates than by personal interest, which
led to much canvassing and interference with the proper business
of the Society. Then were enacted the present rules, which restrict
the election to once in the year, and refer the list to the Council to
select not more than fifteen, to be recommended to the Society for
election. A reference to the Council is both fair and judicious, as
thereby the claims of the candidates are submitted to the deliberate
consideration of men chosen for their character and eminence in
their respective departments, and therefore the more likely to be
correct and impartial in their decisions.

      ' But the limitation of the selected candidates to fifteen, or to
ROYAL SOCIETY AS FOUNDED.                                 449

any fixed number, appears to me neither judicious nor just. It is so

entirely unwarranted by the terms of any of the charters, or by the

original plan of the society, that it is at least doubtful that such

Ilimitation is legal ; l and that it is injudicious and injurious to its

best interests, will, think, be obvious, when we compare the con-

stitution and objects of the Society with its present position and

prospects.
     The Eoyal Society is a voluntary association of private gentle-

men, formed for the purpose of 'improving natural knowledge;' 2
and the only necessary restriction in the election of candidates for

Ithe Fellowship is, that by their works they should have proved that
they are able and willing to promote this end.  would abate

nothing in the standard of qualification, which should require of

the candidates evidence of their industry as well as of their sound

scientific attainments : and as these may be more accurately judged

of by the Council than by the Fellows at large, it seems proper that
the Society should be thus advised as to the eligibility of the can-
didates. But surely as many as may, in the judgment of the

Council, come up to a fitting standard, deserve to be received into
the society, without limitation of numbers. In this age of progress

and expansion, when population, commerce, enterprise, and wealth,
increase in enormous ratio when letters and knowledge spread like

a mighty flood and when the cultivators of science in the course

of fifty years have multiplied a hundredfold in this age of teeming
inventions and discoveries and gigantic applications of science is
this a time for the Koyal Society to limit its numbers and stand still

   nay, even to dwindle down by the yearly losses from its ranks ?
losses which since this Procrustean process was put in force, have

reduced the numbers of Fellows from 841 to 572, a falling off of

more than one-third in 27 years. 3

    It may be fully admitted that before the restrictions were made,

the elections went on without due discrimination, being often
carried more by personal influence than by merit. A process of

selection became necessary ; but its object should have been to
improve the quality of the renovating material ; not to reduce its

Iquantity.
        know that there has been a prevalent outcry about keeping up

the dignity of the Fellowship by diminishing the numbers, keeping
it select, and so exalting the honour attached to it. Then the
example of the French Institute is cited as worthy of imitation by the

Royal Society. It is hardly necessary to point out that the Institute

is totally different from the Royal Society in its origin, in its constitu-

tion, and in its objects. It was instituted and endowed by the French

Government for the purpose of conferring distinction and emolument

on a few persons of the most exalted merit ; and although the

Ielections are nominally by the votes of its members, they are subject
to the control and decision of the Government.  repeat, the Insti-

tute of France is a national establishment under the Government.

The Royal Society of London is an independent association of private

individuals, incorporated by Royal Charter, for the sole purpose of

' improving natural knowledge.'

   If the chief object of the Royal Society were to aggrandize the

dignity of the Fellowship, by reducing its numbers and reserving

its honours for a chosen few, on the plan of an exclusive club, there

would be some pretext for the present restriction ; but when we call
to mind that the real purpose of the Society is to ' improve natural

knowledge,' we can see no reason to exclude any number who have

proved themselves to be (qualified to promote this end ; and so far

from the Society being lowered by such a mode of filling its ranks,
it would rise in power and in dignity to. a wider and a higher sphere

of action, and thereby maintain a more exalted position at the head

of advancing science.

Can it be said that we are not already straitened by our past

restrictive measures ? Last year one of our most distinguished

Fellows, who has enriched our Transactions with many inestimable

contributions, complained of having been ' warned, if not remon-

strated with, on the score of cost of illustrations ; ' implying financial
difficulties in the way of his labours to ' improve natural knowledge,'

Iand prompting him to suggest measures of economy by retrenchment
in the Secretaries' salaries.  would rather recommend, by more

liberal policy in the admission of Fellows, to improve the finances,
as well as increase the strength of the society ; then the salaries

of those officers would be counted as a proper indemnity for their

time, in addition to the honour of position which their valuable

services deserve.

     And are there no difficulties in finding among the Fellows those

qualified and willing to perform the arduous, albeit honourable,
offices of members of the Council, and of members of the several
scientific Committees, which form the working body of this society ?
The increasing number of trusts devolving on the society, as men-
tioned in our President's address, shows enlarging responsibilities ;
and if this society is to hold its position at the head of the scientific
institutions of the country, these and other demands on its opera-
ORIGINAL PLAN RECOMMENDED.  451

tions will go on increasing, and requiring a larger constituency to
supply men able and willing to carry on the work. Fellows of the
society generally, know little of the constitution of the scientific

Committees ; but if they are to judge by the composition of the

Council, as presented in the annual house list, the choice seems

limited, for the same names crop up so repeatedly, as to suggest the
idea that the management of affairs is in the hands of a few, and

but for the high character of the parties concerned, might be open
to an imputation of favouritism or cliquism.

     To avoid all these straitening embarrassments, it is only
necessary to return to the liberal and expansive principles of our
founders and predecessors, and without any limitation of numbers,

admit to our ballot every candidate whom our Council shall judge

well qualified to contribute to the great object of the society, the
improvement of natural knowledge. The average number of candi-
dates for admission during the last ten years has been above 52, and

in all probability the number would increase if the limitation were

removed ; for (as remarked by Colonel Strange) many deserving
men are deterred from coming forward, by the certainty that a large

proportion of candidates must be excluded under the present restric-

tions ; but whether increased or diminished, the selection would be

more equitably determined by merit, without any reference to
numbers.

    It has been objected that the Council, although willing to select

15 as the most eligible out of 50 or 60, would not like to incur the

odium of passing judgment on any as ineligible ; but the objection
is more apparent than real. The selection of 15 by the Council,
practically involves the rejection of the rest by the Society for that
year ; and the keeping the candidates on the list for subsequent
years, does but enhance the humiliation by repeated rejections of
those who under the present limitation must always form a majority.

 Speedy justice to the deserving, and a prompt and frank refusal to

those who fall short in their qualifications, will place the former in
their proper rank of usefulness in the Society, and will teach the
short comers, if they have it in them, to work up to a higher
standard for ' the improvement of natural knowledge.' Doubtless this
must prove a serious and arduous duty for the members of the

 Council ; but an office, high and honourable as theirs is, must
 involve grave responsibilities in the interests of the Society and of
 science at large ; and it is in the firm and conscientious fulfilment
 of their trust, without fear or favour, that we may be entitled to

 expect the Royal Society to assume its proper dimensions, and so to

                                                                   aa2

                      NOTE A, page 449.

     Only in one of the earliest meetings of the Society, 12th December, 1660, it
was voted ' That the stated number of this Society be five-and-fifty ; ' and that
Peers and Fellows of the College of Physicians, if they so desire it, may be

admitted as Supernumeraries ; but neither in any of the charters nor in any

subsequent proceedings of the Society is any such limitation mentioned.
Weld's History of the Society, vol. i., page 68. In the same volume, page 459,
will be found the following passages relating to the legal bearings of this

subject :

    ' In the early part of 1728, Sir Hans Sloane brought forward several pro-

positions involving considerable changes in the constitution of the Society.
One of these was, " To make it compulsory for every candidate to be approved

by the Council, and recommended by three Fellows, one of whom, at least, was
to be a Member of Council, before the candidate could be put to the ballot."

This proposition was passed into a statute, and acted on from 1728 to 1730, all

the candidates being approved by the Council before being put to the ballot.
In the latter year, the expediency of limiting the number of Fellows was taken

into consideration ; but before making any statute on this subject, a case was

d"rWawhnetuhperfoitr  the opinion of the Attorney-General, embodying these queries :
                      is any infringement of the rights and privileges of the Fellows,

that a candidate should be approved by the Council before being balloted for

by the Fellows generally, considering that the rejection of a candidate by the
                                                       up again?"
Council does not disqualify him   from being put                      and, secondly,
" Whether the Council cannot, by  virtue of their      general power   of regulating

the body, limit the number of members thereof ; or, at least, make such laws

as may check the too great increase   ?o"f  the  body  with new members  unfit for
answering the end of the Institution
' The opinion of the Attorney-General on the first query was, that " The

Charter having joined the President, Council, and Fellows together in the

elections of Fellows, as members of the entire body, and having directed such

elections to be made by a major part of them all, without giving any preference

in those acts to the Council, I think the Council should not make a statute

Iwhereby to assume a negative to themselves, which seems to me to be the effect

of this statute. Therefore, apprehend, this statute not to be warranted by

the Charter."

      ' The opinion on the second query was : " Considering that the Charter hath

left  the body at  large without limiting the    number of Fellows, and considering
also  the nature                                  the Council cannot make a statute
                   of this foundation, I think
to limit the Fellows to a certain number. But they may make reasonable

statutes, or bye-laws, to describe and ascertain proper qualifications of persons

to be elected Fellows in such manner as may best answer and promote the

ends of an Institution so useful to the learned world."

      ' This opinion, emanating from so profound a lawyer as the Attorney-
General, (afterwards Lord Chancellor Hardwicke,) led to the repeal of the
statute requiring candidates to be approved by the Council." Again, in Nov.

1846, the  opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General (Sir John           Jervis    and
Sir David  Dundas) was requested and obtained to a similar effect :          " That    the

Council cannot, by virtue of the general power of regulating the body, given

them by the Charters, pass a statute limiting the number of ordinary Fellows

to be elected in any one year."
     ' Notwithstanding this opinion, the limitation was practically effected in

1847 by the Society requiring the Council " to recommend to the Fellows the

most eligible candidates, such selected candidates not exceeding fifteen in any

one year." Thus, without breaking the letter of the law, its spirit was frus-

trated by this limitation of the Council, which, although not binding to the

Fellows, could not be evaded without a canvass in opposition a proceeding

disagreeable and vexatious, which would not be conducive to the peace of the

Society.'

    The following opinion of Baron Cuvier (quoted by Mr. Weld in his ' History
                           '
of  the    Royal  Society    )  adverts  to the  constituency of the  Eoyal  Society,  as

necessarily very numerous.

    ' La Societe Royale de Londres, la plus ancienne des Academies des

Sciences qui subsistent aujourd'hui, et, sans contredit, 1'une des premieres

pour les decouvertes de ses membres, ne recoit aucun secours du gouvernement,
et ne se soutient que par les seules contributions de ceux qui la composent ; en
consequence, il a et6 n6cessaire qu'elle fiit tres nombreuse, et, par une conse'-

quence non moins necessaire, comme dans toutes les associations politiques ou
la participation des citoyens au gouvernement est en raison inverse de leur
nombre, les homines auxquels elle confie son administration exercent sur ses

travaux, et, jusqu'a un certain point, sur la marche et sur les progres des

sciences, une influence plus considerable que nous ne pourrions nous le figurer
dans nos Academies du Continent.' Memoires de I'Institiit, 1820, page 219.

     The title of the Society, given in the second Charter (1663), 'Regalis
Societas Londini pro Scientid Naturali promovendd : ' ' The Royal Society
of London for Improving Natural Knowledge,' and retained ever since, is
remarkable for the precision and aptitude of its meaning, considering that it
was adopted more than two centuries ago, when the English language was not
used with the exactitude which it has since acquired. The object of the
Society was to improve natural knowledge, in quality as well as in quantity to
increase its accuracy as well as its extent ; and the word natural was probably
used, not only as Dr. Paris has suggested, in contradistinction to supernatural,
but also in the same sense as the corresponding Greek term r6 Qvfftxbv, and
the French and English synonyms, physique and physics, which are equally
distinguished from metaphysics. Thus the business and design of the Royal
Society are denned by Hooke, its first experimentalist :

     In truth, the distinctive object of the Royal Society at its foundation was to
promote the study of nature through observation and induction, the methods
recently developed by Bacon, to the exclusion of the Aristotelian philosophy,
and other metaphysical systems which had hitherto been taught in the Schools.
Its success displayed in its Philosophical Transactions, series of Scientific
Essays without parallel in history, but essentially progressive and expansive
in their nature, and requiring continually enlarging contributions and means
to sustain their character.

ELECTION STATUTES COMMITTEE.  455

     In the above list, the Foreign Members are not included in the elections
and deaths ; but they are counted in the total numbers of Fellows, and as they
amount to about fifty, that number should be deducted from the totals of each
year to represent the number of Ordinary Fellows. The number by which the
elections exceed fifteen, represent the privileged Candidates (Peers and Privy
Councillors) who are not subject to limitation. The obsequiousness to title
and rank, which may have been politic in the infancy and poverty of the
Society, is hardly consistent with its present position and dignity. But as the

facile admission of the privileged classes is clearly authorised in the statutes,
and yet does not operate largely, it hardly calls for interference : yet the un-

restricted election of these candidates, sometimes with little or no scientific pre-
tensions, is an additional argument against any numerical limitation of those
whose claims are founded on scientific work.

    IBefore the end of the year received a letter from the

President, Dr. Hooker, informing me that a Committee had

been nominated to go into the matter of the election of candi-

Idates for the Eoyal Society. He adds the remark, ' am

always glad to find the Fellows taking a good share in the
working of the Society.'

     The resolution of the Council was : That a Committee be

appointed to consider and report to the Council upon the

Statutes relating to the selection of candidates for election to

be recommended by the Society : the Committee to consist of

the President and officers, and Mr. Evans, Dr. W. Fair, Sir
W. R. Grove, Dr. Guy, Mr. Merrifield, Dr. Sharpey, and Dr.

C. J. B. Williams.

     The Committee met January 15th.

      The details of the proceedings must be considered con-
fidential : but the general result was a total rejection of my
views on the subject, and a reaffirmation of the limiting innova-
tion of 1847. This becomes less surprising when it is known
that two members of the Committee had also 'taken a very
prominent part in the discussion ' which terminated in the
adoption of this mode of election, and were naturally in its

favour. In private conversation afterwards, Dr. Sharpey said
to me, ' No doubt your view is right in the abstract, but it
would not work for the greatest advantage for the Society.' And

here lay the difference : the other members were all intent on

the Society, its status, its dignity, its distinction and exalted

position, and the select appropriation of its honours. I had

ventured to point to the object of the Society the improve-
ment of natural knowledge, as something above the Society
itself. But as it would be vain to discuss the abstract question,

I will pass to the report of the Election Statutes Committee,

with a few comments on some of its clauses.

          'BEPORT OF THE ELECTION STATUTES COMMITTEE.

     ' The Committee appointed to consider whether it is desirable or
not to make any alterations in the Statutes relating to the Election
of Fellows, have given to the subject referred to them the careful
consideration which is demanded by the importance of these Statutes,
not only to the Koyal Society, but to the general body of workers in
science in the kingdom.

     ' The status of the Koyal Society and the widespread recognition
of the value of its Fellowship render it highly desirable that, on the
one hand, no one shall be admitted to the Society but those who
are worthy of the honour, while on the other, no one who is worthy
shall be excluded from the Society, nor even suffer undue delay in
entering it.'

     Comment. The primary consideration is not the great
purpose of the Society, and the efficiency of its u-ork but its
* status,' the ' widespread recognition of the value of its Fellow-
ship,' and the ' honour of admission.'

     1 At the outset of the deliberations, the Committee unanimously
agreed to recommend the maintenance of the principle of the exist-
ing Statutes ; that is to say, to leave in the hands of the Council, as
at present, the duty of selecting the Candidates to be presented to the
Society for election.

     ' They further agreed, nemine contradicente, that the number so
selected annually ought to be limited.'

    IComment. To this clause, as may be supposed, did not
Iagree ; but being alone, said it was useless to vote. This

was expressed by the phrase, nemine contradicente.

      ' The only questions that remained therefore were, ought the
number thus limited to be less than at present, greater than at
present, or to remain as it is '? And, practically, the choice was
limited to the last two.

      ' As a preliminary, to the discussion of these alternatives, the
Committee thought it desirable to ascertain what may reasonably

isbe expected to be the strength of the Society if the present limita-!

       'tion remains in force.
     ' The answers of the Fellows of the Society to a circular addressed

to them by the Committee, together with other statistical evidence
as to the value of life at Election, and the average duration of life
of the Fellows, have been carefully considered by several Members
of the Committee who are specially qualified to form a judgment on
such matters ; and their conclusion is that, under the present mode
of Election, the average number of Fellows, exclusive of the Foreign
Members, may be expected to be about 430.'

      Comment. These clauses show that the Committee or their
more active members contemplated the reduction in the
number of the Fellows as a normal result of the present mode
of election ; and only wished to determine its ratio.

      ' Considering that the Eoyal Society is no longer, as at the time
of its foundation, the only scientific corporation in the kingdom, but
that numerous Societies have arisen which are devoted to one or
other of the sciences, and subserve the purposes of the specialist,
and of those who simply take an interest in scientific subjects, it
appears to be thought generally desirable that the Koyal Society
should be distinguished by consisting of those persons who may be
regarded as the representatives of, or the most active and successful
workers in, the different departments of science ; in association with
promoters of scientific research and with men of signal eminence
in statesmanship, art, or letters.'

    IComment. So far as can interpret this not very lucid

clause, it seems to intimate that inasmuch as ' numerous other
societies have arisen which are devoted to one or other of
the sciences,' the ground which they have taken should be
 abandoned by the Royal Society (although all belonging to its
 domain of ' natural knowledge and that the Royal Society
 should have a new distinction as consisting of representatives
 of, or the most active' and successful workers in, the different

departments of science,' &c. In other words, the Royal Society

that no change be made in that number at present.'

I IComment.
cannot recollect that was present during
I Ithe consideration here alluded to : if was, certainly should

not have agreed to recommend 'no change," and the word
' unanimously ' is incorrect. For any proceedings of the

ICommittee which took place after quitted London in Septem-
Iber 1875, am not responsible. It was consistent with my

knowledge that several deserving candidates had been griev-

ously disappointed at the postponement of their claims.

    In the President's address of the next year, November 30,

1875, the subject was noticed as follows :

     ' The Election Statutes. At our Anniversary of last year the
attention of the Meeting was called by Dr. Williams to the present
limitation in the election of ordinary Fellows ; and though no action

was taken at the time, the subject appeared to me to be one so deeply
affecting the interests of the Society, that 1 did not hesitate to take
the earliest opportunity of submitting it to the deliberations of the
Council. This resulted in the appointment of a Committee to con-

sider the whole question of the "Election Statutes."
     ' In the mean time Dr. Williams addressed to myself a letter

embodying his views on the subject, which, having been printed and
circulated throughout the Society, requires my acknowledgment
from this Chair, and is entitled to the most full and careful con-

sideration. Therefore, while disclaiming the slightest intention to
criticise the letter in a hostile spirit, and while fully appreciating the
interest in the Society's welfare which caused Dr. Williams to raise

Ithe question of a revision of the Election Statutes, feel bound to
Iremark that cannot think he had considered the question in all its

aspects, or made allowance for the effects of that inability on his
part, which he so candidly admits and regrets, to take, during forty
years' Fellowship, any active part in the proceedings of the

Society.
     ' Had it been otherwise, he would surely not, without some

reservation, have instanced the reduction in the number of Fellows
since the present rules have been in force as a loss to the Society
which had not been anticipated ; he would have been aware that the
rules now in operation had been approved by the Society individually

and collectively, and with ample deliberation, before their embodi-

ment in the Statutes. He would also have known that it was with

the full knowledge and intention that such a reduction would and

should result from this step that the rules were adopted, and that

the rate and amount of reduction formed the subject of investigation

and report by an eminent Fellow and Statistician, Mr. Galloway ;
and lastly, that the rate of reduction, as then anticipated and taken

into account, has been slower than was calculated, and that our

Inumber for some years to come will still be in excess of that which

in 1847 was, and have reason to believe still is, thought large

enough by the great majority of our Fellows.

more of the candidates." The fact is that (putting aside the appli-
cation of the term "rejection" to that which, in the majority of

cases, is merely "postponement") two thirds of all whose names

have been suspended have actually been elected, not rejected ; and

the average duration of suspension of the elected candidates has
been under two years. Furthermore, from the one third who have

not been elected are to be excluded the deaths, the withdrawals, and

of the Committees and the names of their members are detailed,

experience of these Councils, and never knew a year in which, of

the ten Members of the Council who, in accordance with the Charter,

have to be replaced, there were not some who had attended a very

limited number only of its meetings ; and as by a Minute of Council

five names of Fellows who have never previously served must

annually enter into the composition of the new Council, and as

these five are, for the most part, chosen from comparatively new

Fellows, it cannot be said that sufficient fresh blood is not annually

incorporated. But for the punctual attendance of the Members

of Council, the officers could not carry on the Society's business.

These latter meet punctually at 1 P.M. on every Council-day (some-
times at intervals of a week), and sit continuously until the Council

breaks up, which is rarely before six.

    ' And if it is difficult to obtain Members to sit in the Council, it

is in my experience far more difficult to secure attendance at the

Committees, which in many instances include no Councillor among

their number. To go into the reason for this is here not necessary ;

it is sufficient to say, that additions to the number of Fellows

Iannually elected would not overcome the difficulty now in question.

   IAt the time of the delivery of the preceding Address had

left London, and was residing at Cannes, and did not receive

Iit until some months later. My interest in the matter was

obviously not personal, as was about to withdraw from the

Iscene ; but having been led to entertain these views from what

had witnessed during several years of the working of the Society,

Iand further confirmed by special reading and inquiry, con-
Isidered it my duty to bring them forward as had done. But

ments, was not disposed, in my peace -seeking retirement, to

agitate the matter further. I took leave of it therefore in the

following letter to the President.

       Villa L'Olivette, Cannes : March 8, 1876.

     Dear Dr. Hooker,

         IYour Presidential Address did not reach me in my retire-

ment until some time after its publication ; and as did not feel

disposed to pursue the subject after the decision of the Committee

Iand its adoption by the Council, have delayed writing a reply,
Iwhich nevertheless owe, as much to your courtesy in the earnest

manner in which you have entertained the question, as to the abiding

issue of my own deliberate convictions.

   IIn answer to your remark that you cannot think that had con-
Isidered the question in all its aspects, and that ought to have

known that the reduction in the number of Fellows since the present

Irules were in force, was calculated and intended, with the sanction

and approval of the Society my reply is that was aware of this
intention, and disapproved of both it and its results, as contrary to

the letter and spirit of the foundation and constitution of the Society,
and as injurious to its best interests. The reduction and Ijfnitation
of this first of scientific societies, at a time when science itself, in

its growth, and in its cultivators, is enlarging yearly at a prodigious

rate, and when so many other scientific bodies have sprung up and
are expanding in unrestricted freedom, does seem a solecism and an

anomaly unworthy of the age.
     And when you complain of the difficulty of getting a sufficient

number of resident members of Council and of Committees, it does

appear to me obvious that an enlarged constituency would prove

I Ithe best means of supplying men able and willing to carry on the
work.  confess that cannot understand your opposite conclusion

' that additions to the number of Fellows annually elected would

not overcome the difficulty.'

     With respect to the finances of the Society, your statement given
on the Auditors' accounts in your Address of the previous year, that
' there is no want of means for providing illustrations communicated

to us for publication,' did not escape my attention ; but although
encouraging for the future, it did not set aside the positive fact

Icomplained of by one of our oldest and most eminent Fellows.

    In conclusion can only express my surprise and regret that the

Election Statutes Committee have entirely disregarded the original
liberal constitution and object of the Society, as declared at its

foundation, and confirmed by charter, as consisting of an unlimited
462 PROTEST FOR ROYAL SOCIETY AS FOUNDED.

number of Fellows, elected for the purpose of improving natural
knowledge ; and have enacted for it a new constitution, (with con-
tinued restriction of numbers,) in these terms : ' Considering that

the Royal Society is no longer, as at the time of its foundation,' &c.

(See above in Report.)
     Thus the leading object of the Society is to be no longer the free

advancement of science, but the distinction of the Royal Society

from the numerous Societies which have arisen devoted to one or
other of the sciences, and a selection of representatives of the
departments of science, in association with promoters of scientific
research and men of signal eminence in statesmanship, art or letters :

its source of supply being still restricted to the number of fifteen

per annum.
IAgainst the illiberal and exclusive spirit of this innovation, would

                                               have now only to

relieve my conscience by protesting my abiding conviction that the

great object of the Royal Society of London should be its original

one to improve natural knowledge with a liberal spirit, and not to

aggrandise the honour of the Fellowship by reducing its numbers

and efficiency. Yours faithfully,

                                   C. J. B. WILLIAMS.

THIS was the year of my retirement, after forty-five years of
London practice, and fifty-five years of professional life. The
grey-paired brougham with striped-grass wheels was no longer
to be seen in the London streets. Although rarely laid by with
illness, my health had become so much impaired of late years,

that I had not much prospect of long enjoying the rest from

my labours. The smoke and fog of London during more than
half the year told on me, and quite determined me not to pass

Ianother winter in it. Through God's mercy have been

spared now nine years longer, and during that time have re-
covered much vigour of both body and mind; and making

allowance for the infirmities of age, I have cause to be thankful

for much enjoyment of life.

   IHaving made climate a subject of special study, had long

made choice of the Riviera as the most eligible place for retreat.

I knew from several visits, as well as from general report, that

the skies were brighter, the scenery more varied, and the soil

Igenerally more salubrious than at other places of winter resort,

even at a greater distance. had been in the habit of sending

patients to several chosen spots, and advantages as well as

Idisadvantages were found in each. Hyeres, as the nearest,

and yet most southerly, generally put first in the list : but

Ifor a long time it was better known to the French than to the

English. Since however sent my friend Dr. Griffith there,
more than twenty years ago, very much to the benefit of his own

health, as well as of the many whom he has had under his
 charge, it has been one of the favourite winter retreats, par-

 ticularly suited to those preferring a quiet life. Nice being a
 city, and long famous for its climate, had more attractions for
 those who needed variety and amusement. Mentone and

 ICannes were more recently noticed, and soon found favour

 with health-seeking travellers. But have not space for

 further mention of other places of resort. The special works
 on climate, by Dr. Henry Bennet, Dr. Marcet, my son, and
 other writers will supply ample information.

       My attention was drawn to Cannes, chiefly by Mr. Bellen-
. den Ker, long my friend and patient, who was also one of Lord

 Brougham's most intimate friends. In passing through it on
  a tour nearly thirty years ago, its advantages had not struck
  me as remarkable. Early in autumn, we found the roads

  dusty, vegetation parched, only two second-rate hotels, and
  very few villas. Compared with Hyeres, Nice, and Mentone, it

 Iseemed less sheltered, the hills behind being comparatively

  low. And would still say that, as a whole, Cannes is not a

  well-protected place. The best situations are quite so : but
   many are open to winds from several quarters, especially the
   north-west (mistral) and east, which often blow with great
   force. Still the place proved more and more attractive after
   visitors tried and in the course of few years outstripped
   all others in popularity, chiefly with English visitors and this
   popularity, and the afflux of good society, led to increase and
   improvement of accommodations and comforts at a very rapid
   rate. There can be little doubt that the beautiful scenery of
   Cannes and its vicinity, and the great extent and variety of its
   walks and drives, have proved its great attraction. Enjoying
    in common with other places in the Riviera, the brilliant skies,

VILLAS IN NORTH AND WEST CANNES.  465

the wide expanse of the Mediterranean in all its hues of vary-
ing loveliness, and the rich luxuriance of temperate and semi-

tropical vegetation, Cannes has the additional charm of the
beautiful Esterel mountains and the Lerins isles in front, and

an inland succession of ridges diversified by rocks, woods, and

gardens, forming an endless variety of picturesque foregrounds
to sea and mountains in the distance. And in point of salubrity,
although there may be less completeness of shelter than in
Mentone and other places hemmed in by higher mountains,
there is an invigorating purity in the more open neighbourhood,
and a security of dryness in the rocky character of the soil.

     Such being the attractions of Cannes, it is no wonder that

after a few weeks of reconnoitring we should choose this for

our new home. From the glimpses of our enjoyment during

our holiday tours, the reader may judge how delightful was

this change from town, smoke, and toil, to such a climate,

country, and repose.

   In the first year I took a furnished villa in North Cannes,

the ' Villa 1'Olivette,' amongst the olives, at a distance from
the sea, but within view, and of the Esterels also. This is in

the limestone district, with overlying clay, which renders the
air somewhat moister and softer than the granitic soil of

East and West Cannes. It was well sheltered, except from

the north-west, whence we sometimes felt the mistral severely.

I IAt first thought enjoyed the mistral, with its bright blue

sky and dark steel-blue sea, speckled with breakers. On one

such day, accosting a farmer, I said, ' Bon jour, monsieur ;

beau temps.' ' Beau temps ! par exemple,' said he ; ' pour

Imoi c'est tres mauvais temps ! ' And soon learned to agree

with him. It dries the throat, shrivels the skin, withers

leaves and shrubs, and blights flowers.

    INext year took the villa ' Ceres ' to the west, high on the

granite hill under the Croix de Garde. The air here was very
bracing, but there was good shelter from west, north, and
north-east. Only from the east was the wind sometimes keen ;
and there was Corsica, often plainly visible, especially before

sunrise, at a distance of 130 miles. The Esterels, with the bay
of Napoule, were close to our west. Behind was a wilderness

of pines and brushwood, and traversed by paths of schistose

                                                           HH

sand, always clean and sparkling with mica. In many parts

masses of rock are exposed and often take the form of red

porphyry. This is often seen in the neighbouring Esterel

mountains, forming beautiful features in the landscape, by

contrast of the rich red rock with the bright green pines, and

the blue tint of green in the transparent sea. Here were fine

opportunities for landscape studies, and now, time to turn them

to goed account.

   IIn the following year had the good fortune to secure the

freehold of my present villa in East Cannes, with between

three and four acres of varied garden and woodland, which

has fully answered all my wishes, and formed a delightful

abode, in which we remain nine months in every year, spend-

ing the other three in England or Switzerland.

The villa is small, but well built, facing the south, standing

at the foot of its rock of red porphyry, with gravel drive in

front, elevated above a cork-tree grove, with a frontage of

bright flowers. The property occupies a little mountain to

itself, being the foremost spur of the California!! range, with

a torrent ravine on one side, and the road on the other. Behind

the villa rises the rocky eminence containing the upper garden,

with its walks and shrubbery, and a portion of the wild wood

of California, consisting of pines, cork-trees, the tall white

Mediterranean heath, Erica arborca, &c. From a little kiosque,

or tower, a view is obtained of Cannes and the whole sea view

in front, from the Esterels and Basses Alpes beyond in the west,

to the distant mountain tops of Corsica above the eastern

horizon. Opposite are the Lerins Islands, with the Castle of
Ithe Man with the Iron Mask.
                              have lately added a lower

garden and entrance to the east, laid out with grass mound,

serpentine walks, and plateau on which stand a group of old

pines. In front below are violet and strawberry beds, and an

orange grove, with stables and coach-house.

The mere names of the several walks, will suggest further

the variety and description of this charming retreat. The

orange walk : the cork-grove walk, which leads hy the peri-

winkle path to the torrent walk, with which we began.

With such inducements and capabilities, it will not be
Isurprising that we all became gardeners.
                                           had previously
Ilittle knowledge or experience in that line. But found the

occupation both interesting and salubrious ; and not content

with mere superintendence, with my own hands I planted

Imany hundreds of geraniums and ferns. Roots of the latter

   collected from the Californian woods, chiefly Adianttnn

I<i*l>l'niin>i ni;iriini, trichomanes, and potypoditvm. Maidenhair,

too, brought in abundance from certain calcareous springs

near Isola Bella. For the first three or four years after coming

abroad, I had no lack of bodily strength for such exertions ;
Iand am sure the exercise was very beneficial and carried off

morbid tendencies, which had been increasing during a long

sedentary life. But in later years strength and activity have

declined more than mental vigour ; and I have entirely given
up the long walks and rides that I used to delight in. Of
Icourse this is the effect of age : have to be very thankful

Ithat my sight and mental faculties show no signs of failure.

     For some years after my retirement, gave my mind an

almost complete rest, so far as regards professional or scientific
writing. The only exception was in a not very profitable con-

troversy with poor Dr. Leared on the sounds of the heart.

With curious ingenuity he seemed to have got into a wrong

Igroove on this subject, and fell foul of a statement of mine,

which considered to represent the views commonly received,
Ifor which, in connection with my experiments on animals,
Iclaimed originality.
                           deem it unnecessary to notice the

matter further here, as it has been already discussed (see

Chapter XVI.), but some new facts and arguments may find

place in a second volume.

We were welcomed with much cordiality by many friends

at Cannes, several of them old patients ; and my name was
well known from my having sent so many visitors there. Mr.
and Mrs. Woolfield (he was designated ' Prince of Cannes '
by dear Dr. Edward Forbes, who introduced me) had been
residents coeval with Lord Brougham, and always led the

hospitalities, and by founding and fostering the first English

church, and in other ways, had promoted a happy Christian in-

fluence on the English colony at Cannes. Now there were three

English churches, all well filled in the season ; and a Presby-

terian service well supplied' by the Free Church of Scotland.

There was indeed such an abundance of agreeable and friendly

hardly seem to be abroad, except for the brilliant skies and

almost uninterrupted fine weather.

The increase of the. place during the nine years of our

residence is something extraordinary, hotels and villas having

much more than doubled in number, and new boulevards and

Istreets formed in every direction. On these dwell not : but

one feature of development deserves especial notice the exten-

sion of carriage roads around, over, and beyond all the neigh-

bouring hills, which supply drives and rides unsurpassed for

know of no place in Europe to equal it.         speak not
I Ifrom actual measurement, but do not think exceed the

reality in saying that there are eighty miles of good roads for

riding and driving within six miles of Cannes.

Another great advantage of Cannes is its abundant supply

of pure water, through the Siagne river canal, from a distance

of sixteen miles.

No such favourable report can yet be made of its drainage.

Cannes, in common with all continental towns, has no complete
system of drainage ; but in the last two years partial attempts

have been made to develop one, and the present Mayor and

Town Council have made many earnest endeavours to improve

Ithe sanitary state of Cannes. At the request of the English

physicians practising at Cannes, published in the ' British
Medical Journal,' on the 4th of February and 4th of November,

1882, statements on this subject ; which represented the state

of matters up to those dates, and the measures which had

been and were to be adopted in the way of improvement.

Typhoid fever had shown itself; but its amount had been
much exaggerated ; and it had been traced to defects in

drainage and other evils which might be rectified. There was
formed a ' Commission d'Hygiene ' under the presidency of

 the Mayor, to consider all questions relating to the public
health ; to take all steps necessary for its preservation ; to
bring the law to bear against all nuisances, and offences ; and
to carry out any further measures in the way of cleansing and

drainage necessary for the security of the town and its vicinity.

In 1882 the Mayor visited Paris, London, and other parts of

England, for the purpose of obtaining the most recent informa-

tion on the subjects of drainage, disposal of sewage, &c. And

in the following year Captain Douglas Galton, C.B. F.K.S.,

visited Cannes for the purpose of advising the municipality in
their efforts to improve the town. After full inspection and con-

sultation with the medical residents, he drew up an able report,
embodying a full consideration of the subject with details of
plans for the thorough drainage and purification of the town

and neighbourhood. These plans have been since under
deliberation, and steps have been taken towards carrying them
into effect ; but financial and other difficulties stand in the

way and render their complete fulfilment a work of time. Yet
the time must not be long ; and if the most strenuous efforts
are not honestly and energetically made, the reputation of

ICannes for salubrity will assuredly suffer. have had recent

experience of a most flagrant offence in the defilement of
streams denounced in the following extract from one of my
former papers in the ' British Medical Journal.' '

     ' Various endeavours have been made, and are still carried on,

to prevent the contamination of the ruisseaux, or streamlets, one
or more of which run down the valleys between the numerous little
rocky hills on which Cannes stands. These little brooks carry off
the surface water ; and, in the rainy season, convey a considerable
stream, which, in some places, is used by laundresses for washing

linen. In dry weather, they cease to run ; and the water, stagnating
in pools, is apt to become offensive, especially if containing soap-
suds. Several of these brooks have been cleared of stones and
holes, and the beds narrowed by masonry into smooth gutters, in
which there can be no stagnation. A public laundry, well supplied
with water from the canal, has been built at the back of the town,

it my duty to publish in the English journals a warning against the parties
 guilty of such outrages on the public health.

Ipotent cause of insalubrity in Cannes, would answer, without

reserve, the escape of the contents or effluvia of cesspools into the

houses and into the ruisseanx. Individual houses are poisoned by

the leakage of cesspools under or near them, or by the entrance

of their effluvia through inefficient water-closets ; or through

untrapped, imperfect, or unveiitilated soil-pipes, leading from the

closets to the cesspools. But  by overflow or leakage, throughif,

open ruisseau, the offensive matter grossly defiles the stream, which

diffuses its stench and pernicious effects throughout its long mean-

derings, with aggravated activity where lingers or stagnates in its

course.'

Captain Galton would abolish cesspools altogether; and

connect all closets directly with drains but until complete

would be, for the outlying villas with gardens, the best possible

supplement to an improved drainage of the town of Cannes.
     There are several most useful beneficent institutions which

deserve the support of the English visitors at Cannes, and
engaged the interest of members of my family. ' Les Amis des

pauvres,' for aiding and relieving the industrious poor in cases

of sickness or distress, is admirably carried on by a committee
of ladies, and does much good at a small cost. Schools have
been greatly needed in this country, for the education of the

children has been much neglected, and very many of the adult

population, and not the poorest only, can neither read nor
write. This evil is diminished by the communal schools which

are now generally established : but as no religion is taught in
them, earnest Christians may be expected to aid the Protestant

schools, which have been established chiefly by the efforts and
contributions of English visitors. The infant school has been

particularly successful: the children being taught by aid of
music, singing, gesticulations, and drilled movements, in a
manner that engages attention and amuses as well as in-
structs. These institutions are supported not only by sub-

scriptions, but by concerts and fancy bazaars, for which
ladies' talent and industry are taxed for drawings, fancy-

work, trap-door spiders' nests, and numbers of pretty devices
in flowers and other natural products of land and sea all

suggestive of ingenious and tasteful employment for truly

useful objects.

    It is unnecessary to notice further the various occupations

found for the agreeable leisure now at my disposal and which

never hung heavy on my hands. But in the last two years, in

Iaddition to daily meteorological observations of which keep

Ibut this gave to my third son Harry, who, having been a pupil

of Professor Challis, and being a Fellow of the Royal Astronomi-

cal Society, was more likely to turn it to a good account. 1 But

     1 He has, however, been better employed. He has retired from the practice

of the law ; and has entirely devoted himself to visiting and teaching among
the poor in a needy district of his brother-in-law's enormous parish of Swan-
sea; where he has established a school with upwards of 200 children.

the smaller instrument was a remarkably good one, and having

had it repaired and fitted with a new eye-piece by Browning, it
Ianswers my purpose very well.

The first astronomical object that riveted my attention

was the splendid comet of last year. Travelling and bad

Iweather prevented my seeing it till October 20, when was

astonished at its magnitude and brightness : and after making

careful observations and drawings, sent one with the following

description to ' Nature,' in which it appeared in the number

for October 26, 1882.

' For several mornings past we have bad fine views of the comet
Ifirst seen in England by Mr. A. Common.
                                               enclose a sketch taken
Ithis morning, as accurate as could make it with materials at band.
' It is chiefly remarkable (1) for the crescentic end of the tail,
the lower or eastern born being longer than the other ; (2) for the
Idistinctness of the shadow in the space beyond the tail shadow

obviously projected by the comet. Such a shadow have never

Iseen in any of the comets which have been under my observation
during the last fifty years, nor do  recollect to have seen it

described.

   I' presume that the propinquity of this comet to the sun is tbe

reason why the shadow is unusually visible, in contrast to the

luminosity around it : but probably the peculiar clearness of our

atmosphere renders tbe phenomenon plainer than it may be in
England. In any case the appearance is interesting, in relation

both to tbe nature of cometary matter, and to tbat of ligbt and

shade in space.                                ' C. J. B. WILLIAMS.'

     The woodcut in the journal was not a good copy of the
drawing, particularly in omitting all appearance of the re-

markable shade beyond the tail. The reality of this shadow

was questioned by Major Herschel in a subsequent number :
and in that for November 30 the following appeared.

atmosphere of this place give exceptional facilities for the continued

of so anomalous and surprising an object. Some windows of my

villa command an extensive sky and sea view (including at times

Ithe mountains of Corsica, 130 miles distant), and from my bedroom
    sometimes even from my bed have been able to watch the comet

with case for from a quarter of an hour to an hour, on each of those

twenty-one days ; using only a good field binocular in occasional aid
Iof a strong natural sight.

Ithis object they give no help ; and ana not astronomer enough to

avail myself of other instruments.

' The comet was seen in all its brightness on October 20, 21, 23,

and 24, with its nucleus like a star of first magnitude, but elongated

and nebulous its tail beginning with slender stem, slightly curved,

with downward convexity, and gradually expanding to its extremity,

the diameter of which was about five times that of the head. The

lower, slightly convex margin, was brighter, and more defined ; but

a strong nebulous light pervaded the length and breadth of the tail,
shaded along the upper margin in gradually diminishing haze. The

tail ended in an elongated crescent, the lower or eastern horn of which

was longer than the other. Both horns were prolonged in faint

lines, hardly perceptible, a few degrees further (as noticed by your
correspondent Mr. Larden). No such prolongation could be seen
from the hollow of the crescent, which terminated by a narrow

fringe of diminishing light, beyond which was an oval patch of

shade, obviously darker than any other portion of the visible sky.
IThis appeared to me nothing else than a shadow projected by the
comet on the    space beyond the                  end of its tail.  cannot admit the
correctness of  bMy acjoonr trHasetrscohnelyl's"  suspicions, " that this impression

                                                  (" Nature," vol. xxvii. p. 4). The
still greater contrast between the brightness of the lower margin

and the adjoining sky produced no such shade there at that time :

Ilater shall allude to such a shade appearing there also. The ultra-

caudal patch was obviously darker than any other spot of the sky :

so it appeared to me, and my experience in landscape painting has
Igiven me some skill in appreciating lights and shades.

aware of the difficulty of physically explaining the existence of

Ilight and shadow in the vacuity of space, but this is a question of

pure observation, to which invite further attention. Two of your

correspondents, Mr. Larden of Cheltenham, and                         Mr.  "  Cecil of
Bournemouth, describe "a black rift                                 and       a strong

and its form was changed. The upper margin from the head up-

wards had expanded and become more feathery ; so had the end of
the tail, which had lost its crescentic form ; the shadow beyond had

quite disappeared, and was replaced by an ill-defined luminosity,

losing itself in the darkness of the sky. The lower margin of the

tail had lost less of its brightness and definition ; and now if there

was a shadow anywhere, it was along this edge, down even to the

Ihead of the comet ; but the shade was much less marked than had

been that beyond the tail, and might have ascribed it to contrast

' The comet was well seen on October 30 and 31, and November

2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, gradually diminishing in brightness and in the

Idefinition of its outline, its light being now further paled by moon-

light. So faint was it that am not surprised at Major Herschel's

light only (as the testimony of others proves), but also to the gas-lit

Ihaze of the London atmosphere, which from fifty years' experience
  know to be, at its clearest, quite sufficient to mask a faded comet,

even although the brighter light of stars may still remain visible.

On the 8th the comet was seen before moonrise, more distinct,

although pale and hazy in outline ; lower margin still the brightest,

with a slight attendant shade. It was seen every day (except the

13th, 14th, and 15th) until the 22nd, with little other changes than
that it was gradually becoming fainter, although stih1 a conspicuous

Icareful portrait of it in oils, with its attendant stars, by the side of

was in its glory. The alteration which has taken place in the

month is such that it now seems the mere ghost of its former self.

in brightness and compactness, than in length and breadth. Is

    In a subsequent number, December 28, further observations

were reported up to December 21, that the comet was becoming
smaller and much fainter, with tail visible only in the absence

on December 6.

free from spots.  noticed only 4 small ones on the disk : quite a

contrast to the monstrous appearance a month ago.

   I' Being neither equipped nor qualified for technical astronomical

observations, did not attempt to do more than to give a popular

demonstration of the transit of Venus to between 80 and 40 friends

interested in the phenomenon. My experience of star-gazing was

Ichiefly obtained upwards of 50 years ago, before became otherwise
Ioccupied ; and then found for myself, that the best way of studying

solar phenomena, whether eclipses or spots, was by projecting on

white paper or cardboard, the image of the sun from the telescope,

focussed a little beyond the point for direct vision through the dark

eye-glass ; extraneous sunlight being shut out by a.napkin suspended

around the telescope. In this way with a small achromatic of 32

Iinches focal length, and 2^ inches aperture, we saw well all the

chief features of the transit (which need not describe, as this has
already been done by more competent observers), and this without

fatigue to the eyes, or the unnatural colouring, inseparable from look-

ing through the telescope with darkened glasses. Further, as the

time of sunset approached, at about 3.30 p.m., we had in our camera

view the additional charm of the colours of the objects in view.

As, in the Italian sky the golden orb sank with the dark planet spot

ou its disk, under brightly tinted clouds, shaded off in streaks of

tender grey into the azure above, with the blue rose-tipped moun-

tains of the Esterels beneath, the scene was one as fascinating in

beauty as it was interesting in science. All these tints appeared

distinctly, albeit faintly, in the telescopic image on the card.

' One point was remarkable, that whilst the shades of the moun-

tains were all blue, the dark round spot of the planet on the sun

Iwas almost black. It was the darkest object in the field of view.

     This original kind of reminiscence of a very rare event
was exhibited at the conversazione of the Eoyal Society in
London last siunmer, together with the oil painting of the
comet above mentioned. Several of the preceding observa-
tions have been translated into French in M. Flammarion's
' L'Astronomie.'

     Thus the desultory studies of my early youth have not
been without fruit, even in old age. More than sixty years
had elapsed between my earliest and latest astronomical
exercises. Some observations on the sun-spots are of more
permanent importance, and must be reserved for another
chapter.

AFTER the disappearance of the comet, my attention was drawn
to the spots on the sun, which were at this time generally in
great numbers, it being a majriminn period, which occurs in

Ievery ten or eleven years. But on February 28, 1883, was
Isurprised to find the sun without a spot. On March 3,

observed again, and still found no spot. The next day began
a fall of temperature of 6 Fahr., with a high wind from the
north-east, which continued till March 7, when there came
on a heavy snowstorm, covering the ground to the depth of
eight inches, and causing great destruction in my garden,
bearing down and breaking many valuable trees and shrubs.
 This was followed by a .fall of temperature to 5, G, and 7
 degrees below freezing, even in my sheltered situation : in
 478 UNPRECEDENTED COLD AND NO SUNS POTS.

 more exposed places it fell 4 and 5 degrees lower. Such cold
 had not visited Cannes before for 60 years ; and it was the

 more remarkable as the previous part of the winter had been

 quite mild, only two or three times reaching the freezing point.

 This severe weather lasted till the middle of March, when the

 sunspots began to reappear, and the average temperature to
rise in proportion. The destruction caused by this sudden

 and quite unexpected visitation of cold was unprecedented.
Hundreds of geraniums, heliotropes, and other tender plants
were killed in my garden, which usually here bear the winter

well. A fine Datura, which had been constantly flowering

summer and winter, perished ; and a noble india-rubber tree
15 feet high, with its fine fleshy green bronze leaves, was turned
in one night to a spectre of black rags. Extensive injury was

done to the orange, lemon, and olive trees throughout the

country. Enough has been said to show that this sudden
invasion of intense cold was an extraordinary event ; and the
coincidence of it with the absence of sunspots was at least re-

Imarkable and deserving of attention, and as such published in

' Nature ' of April 26 an account of it with a meteorological diary
during the period. On May 31 a second report appeared in
the same journal carrying on the observations till the middle

Iof May, when left Cannes. Erom March 19 to that time
I have made sketches of the sunspots on 49 days. The spots

had appeared in varying but considerable numbers ; and the
temperature had continued steadily to rise with the season.
Evidence was adduced that the intense cold in March was not
confined to the Eiviera, but had been felt throughout Europe
and even in North Africa and America.

     Observations of the sun not being easy in England, they
were not resumed till on my return to Cannes on October 1,

and some idea may be formed of our weather from the fact,
that from October 1 to December 1, drawings were taken of
the sunspots on 54 days ; and that the spots were always present
in fair proportions of numbers or size, until the last week in
November, when they disappeared in an unusual manner.
During November they have generally numbered from 12 to 28,
some very large, with umbra and penumbra, and sometimes
faculse. On November 29 there were ten : November 30, seven :
        COINCIDENCE OF COLD AND NO SUNSPOTS. 479

December 1, six : December 2, two : December 4, one : Decem-

ber 5, NONE. On the two following days (6 and 7) only one

very small spot had appeared on the eastern limb. Tempera-

ture had fallen from November 29, inin. 45 Fahr. max. 58'8

to December 7, min. 36 max. 49'8. But the chill in the air

exceeded the indications of the sheltered thermometer; and

although the barometer was rising, snow was predicted. The

prediction was verified, for on the night of the 6th was a storm

of lightning and thunder, with hail and snow, which covered

all the surrounding hills ; even the Esterels, close to the sea,

on which snow hardly ever lodges in the severest winters.

Another winterly sign on this day, was the appearance of

several flocks of wild fowl migrating in the sky. This resembled

only the extraordinary cold of the second week in March, and like
                                             sunspots. But this time

prove that these facts stand in relation of cause and effect

the sunspots have direct influence on the earth's heat.

     Opinions of natural philosophers hitherto have greatly
varied as to whether sunspots increase or diminish the sun's
48o DO SUNSPOTS INCREASE HEAT?

heating power. Professor Young in ' The Sun ' quotes these

words of Balfour Stewart written in 1878 : ' It is nearly, if

not absolutely impossible, from the observations already made,

to tell whether the sun be colder or hotter, as a whole, when
there are most spots on his surface.' Dr. Young cites further

opinions on both sides, without arriving at any definite con-

clusion.

My previous impressions on the subject were worth little,

inasmuch as they were not founded on sufficient facts, observed

Iby others or by myself. Nevertheless had the impression

that the sunspots are concerned in increasing the sun's heat.

Most observers, from the time of Sir W. Herschel, seem to
consider the spots as holes in the photosphere, through which

the darker interior of the sun shows itself. But because

darker, is it necessarily less hot ? If light and heat were

identical, or their vibrations mutually convertible, such might
be the inference, but as light and heat have different modes of
origin and transmission, it is quite possible that the heat of

the spots though darker may exceed that of the photosphere.
There are various signs of energy and activity in the history of

sun-spots which seem to betoken the working of a fiery force.

They have been observed to appear suddenly, as if by explosion :

their forms as represented by Langley, Secchi and others,

exhibit turns and sweeps suggestive of ideas of prodigious

rending and motion ; and movements have been actually seen,

in parts flying asunder, and bright patches rushing at the rate
of a hundred miles in a second ! l What notion seems more

probable than that they indicate stupendous stirrings and
stokings of the solar furnace ? And then the vast domelike

clouds of faculse which often hover over and around the most

active spots, how likely to be enormous bodies of magnesium
or other metallic vapour in a state of vivid ignition !

But all these are but speculations and surmises, and carry

no weight : nevertheless, they set me on observing, in my
Ihumble way, facts within ruy own reach.
                                             am quite aware

that observations have been already extensively made on the

subject of the sunspots, and hitherto with little but negative

Iresults : but would venture to suggest that the inquiry has

been under taken on too vast and distant a scale, to the neglect

of simple, close, frequent, and if possible, daily scrutiny.

Eernote as the sun is, we know that its rays reach the earth

in about eight minutes of time, and that we can feel and

measure their direct power, as well as estimate their indirect

and circuitous influences ; and this most readily in sunny

climes, where the sun and the earth are more constantly face

to face, with least of cloud, fog, or other terrestrial veil, to

intervene. So it is that in this sunny land, even with simple

means, we may get to know the source of light and heat, and

to estimate its power, better than can those in cloudy countries

with the most costly apparatus and the most profound calcu-

lations. Thus here at Cannes, in six days, on an average,
            I if,
in every week, can observe and count the sunspots, in con-

nection with careful registration of the temperature and

weather, may hope to learn more than more highly skilled

certain changes of colour in Prussian blue, Scheele's green,
and other pigments.

   IIn a letter received January 15, 1884, he writes, ' have

twice proved with my pictorial thermometer, that some of the
spots seen on the hot area, were much hotter than the rest of
the solar image.' . . . ' While big spots were passing, the tem-
perature rose : while there were no spots, or minute spots
only, the temperature fell.'

    IThus we have already accumulated several direct observa-

tions in support of the proposition which have advanced,
that sunspots, in proportion to their size and number, increase
the sun's heating power, and that their great diminution or
disappearance reduces that power, and is a direct cause of

Iterrestrial cold. My daily observations are continued ; and

have already succeeded in correctly predicting the changes of
temperature 6 or 7 days beforehand. 1 Still many further
observations are needed, and on a larger scale, to establish
these propositions on a satisfactory basis.

THE EXTRAOEDINAEY MORNING AND EVENING SuN- GLOWS.

As these remarkable appearances were first noticed before

the time of the disappearance of the sunspots in the beginning

Iof December, was led to suspect that they had some connec-
Ition, but soon had to give up that idea, as they have daily

continued to recur under varying circumstances of sunspots

and temperature.
     My first record is on November 30. ' Large red glow in

the west, half an hour after sunset, which had not been red.'

December 1. ' Same vivid glow in east half-hour before sun-

rise, crimson first, then passing into orange, and disappearing

before sunrise, which was not redder than usual.' These two

observations deserve attention, because they give the simplest

view of this unusual glow, without the complications which
Iappeared after, when clouds confused the scene.
                                                  thus

reasoned This glow must be caused by the sun's rays lighting

up something very high in the atmosphere half an hour (or

   I1 Thus on December 20 (after having given an intimation to the Pall Mall

Gazette of the cold on the 18th and 19th) telegraphed ' More spots appear-
ing, expect warm weather,' which followed and continued to the year's end.

Imore) before or after sunriso or sunset.  guessed the height

at 30 or 40 miles, but this is a matter which astronomers may

compute. The colours, consisting of reds and yellows, the least

refrangible rays, are such as may be expected to best find

their way through a translucent but refracting medium : and

Iwhat can this medium be at a height above the ordinary

region of even clouds ? At first was inclined to think it

must be ice-dust, deposited from the air, through the unusual

intensity of the cold caused by the absence of sunspots, and

which would first and most affect the loftiest regions of the'

atmosphere bordering on space. High and dry as the air

there must be, any remnant of water or ice vapour which it

may hold in solution would be condensed into ice by the more

intense cold ; and a nimbus or haze of the finest possible ice-

dust would be formed, of brilliant optical properties, sparkling

in crystal prisms and facets, refracting or reflecting each ray

from the realms of light. Such a cloud of ice- dust would

explain the abundant effulgence of light accompanying these

glows, or as they may better be termed glares. The sun may

have set with a very moderate radiance, and the grey shade of

twilight seems to be commencing, when there rises a new light

above the western horizon soon rising in height and kindling

to a glare, first golden, then orange, and passing through

different tints of red and crimson, until gradually extinguished

by the shades of night.

    The above description I believe to represent the constant

or essential features of the phenomenon ; but they become

infinitely diversified and complicated by the presence of clouds

in various forms, reflecting new lights and producing new

colours, objective and subjective, and even involving the moon

and stars in novel colours as if in a scene of phantasmagoric

enchantment. The pages of ' Nature ' were loaded with long

elaborate descriptions of numbers of these chromatic puzzles,

to their true physical causes.  was more successful in the

following observation.

On December 2, a day of minimum sunspots, half an

hour after sunset a bright glow of deep red light gradually

30, blending above with purple clouds, whose edges reflected
a rosy light. In the blue -grey sky a little above was the
moon, three days old, appearing plainly of a pea-green colour.

Guessing that this was only a subjective phenomenon, pro-
duced on the retina as the colour complementary to the adjoin-

Iing red glare, shut out this glare by looking at the moon

through a telescope : it then presented its own bright cream
colour without a tinge of green ! Yet after this observation,
which the editor of ' Nature ' refused to insert in his journal,

I saw a further controversy about the green moon. 1

     The long article by Mr. Norman Lockyer, which appeared
in the ' Times ' early in December, advocating Mr. Meldrum's
hypothesis, that the strange atmospheric phenomena were
caused by volcanic dust in the air, derived from the eruption
of a volcano near Java created a great sensation, and various

powers of the press were employed to strengthen the impres-
sion. The article being written for the public, was graphic
and striking in description of the prodigious catastrophe and
effects of the eruption of Krakatoa, but attempted no scientific
detail, nor to explain how what took place in August could
continue to produce such world-wide consequences in Decem-

ber. It attributed to the supposed volcanic dust an imponder-

ability and ubiquity incomprehensible. The submarine vol-
cano might by the explosive power of steam (which has no
limit) project the dust into the highest region of the atmo-
sphere, but what could keep it there and spread it over the
world in defiance of gravitation ? Answers were supplied by
Mr. Preece and Mr. Crookes, wiiose suggestions in the ' Times '
removed from my mind the chief objections to the Meldrum
hypothesis. Mr. Preece writes :

    If' we assume that the mass of volcanic matter projected with

 such force into the atmosphere in the Straits of Sunda was highly
electrified, then it must have been electrified with the same sign as
 that of the earth viz. negative. Therefore when the force of pro-
jection had exhausted itself, the cloud of matter would be subject
 to two other forces besides gravity the repulsion of the electrified

 several observers, and which have never seen : but they could be easily tried

earth, and the self repulsion of each particle of electrified dust.
The first would determine the tenuity of the cloud ; for the lighter

the particles, the further would they be repelled, and the heavier

the particles, the quicker they would descend. It is quite possible

to conceive that they might be so minute, and so highly electrified,

as to reach the highest confines of our atmosphere, where they
would remain as long as they remained electrified. The second re-

pulsive force would cause the particles to spread out continuously
in a horizontal plane until they would cover an area determined
only by their quantity.' ' Times,' December 14, 1883.

    Mr. Crookes refers to his paper read to the Royal Society
in 1879, in which he showed that at a rarefaction of a
millionth of an atmosphere, two pieces of electrified gold leaf

repelled one another at a considerable angle for 13 months
without loss of charge. Such a rarefaction exists in the

atmosphere at a height of 62 miles above the earth's surface,
and renders the attenuated air a non-conductor of statical

electricity, and therefore quite capable of retaining the self-

repellent property of particles of dust, which are much smaller

and lighter than the pieces of gold leaf ; so these electrified

particles, once projected 50 or 60 miles above the earth's

surface, might remain there for many years.

    It seems then quite possible that matter from an exploding

volcano may reach the highest regions of the atmosphere,
and in form of the subtlest dust remain and spread there by
virtue of its electric state, in opposition to the forces of gravi-
tation and aggregation. And some remarkable evidence has
come forward that such matter has been found in the deposit
collected from snow and rain. Mr. MacPherson at Madrid
and others in various localities have described traces of

mineral matters resembling those from volcanoes.

    But I still find a difficulty in understanding how volcanic

dust (of which powdered pumice stone may be supposed to be
a rough type), a comparatively opaque matter, can produce
the extraordinary exaggerations of light as well as of colour,

which are displayed by these glows or glares. Half an hour

or more after sunset, when twilight is beginning, the western
sky is lighted up with a new illumination, which enables one

to read for many minutes later, and the varying hues, although

they may be said always to have a dinginess in their aspect,

are flaring colours, impressing strongly the organs of vision,

Iand thus producing secondary or complementary hues on other
light objects.  incline strongly to the notion, before ex-

pressed by others as well as by myself, that a cloud or nimbus

of ice-dust is the chief cause of the phenomena, its formation

being promoted by the presence of the volcanic dust. A

similar view has been entertained by Mr. Aitken as to the more

ready formation of fog and cloud in the presence of particles

of soot or smoke, and not without reason.

But the formation of water-cloud in the highest regions of

the atmosphere must have this characteristic, that the particles

of water must be extremely fine, and in the state of perfectly

dry ice. Fine because the watery vapour at these heights is

extremely scanty ; and frozen because the temperature there

is far below the freezing point, and the more so during the
Inight, when the sun's rays are withdrawn.
                                            do not know
Iand doubt that any one exactly knows what is the state of

water in a frozen cloud. Probably it is a crystalline dioptric

solid of extreme minuteness, and possessing decided powers

of refraction and reflection with respect to light. Much of

this ice-dust must be continually forming and melting away

in the regions above the line of perpetual snow, and doubtless

is concerned in producing various atmospheric phenomena,

particularly those of sunrise and sunset. The approach of

winter cold will obviously increase the manifestation of these

phenomena.

So likewise if volcanic or any dust be present in the higher

regions, increasing the tendency to the deposition of ice-dust,

it will manifest its action most at the time of the loss of heat

at sunset and on approach of winter. This consideration may

explain why these appearances in the skies did not command

general attention till the approach of the cold season, espe-

cially in the sudden increase of cold at the disappearance of

the sunspots early in December. And should there again

recur a disappearance of sunspots with great lowering of

temperature, there would in all probability be an increase in
Ithese atmospheric manifestations.

the indications of the spectroscope, and may be in error, but

I cannot understand how some experts with that instrument

seem to deny the presence of water in any form in the high

Icolour clouds because there is no rain-band in them. fancied

that the rain-band indicated moisture, which can have no
existence in regions so high and dry. Throughout this month,

January 1884, the barometer has been high, and there have
been no signs of rain ; but there is often an appearance of
haze in the blue sky ; and in mornings and evenings, apart
from the glows, many forms of slight nimbus and cirrus may
be discerned high in the atmosphere. The glows display
themselves usually in a bank of nimbus from 10 to 30 high,
often with two or three rays, as if from the sun many degrees

below the horizon.

   I commend all these natural phenomena to the attention

of amateurs, and especially the study of sunspots, which

seems likely to prove very useful as well as interesting.

It may have been inferred from the contents of this and
Iof the preceding chapter, that since my retirement, had
Iundertaken little professional work; and that
                                                made no

attempt to republish new editions of former works which have

long been out of print, although much of the matter contained

in them was of such permanent interest that it could hardly

be said to be out of date, and during the interval there had

accumulated no small amount of new and original matter.

IBut found such comfort and refreshment from repose from
Ieverything like taskwork, that thought that my mind, which

Ihad certainly been overstrained in past years, needed longer
rest.  flattered myself too, that my past works would not

be altogether forgotten ; and that justice would be done to

Ithem at least by some of the many whom had taught, and

several of whom had now become teachers and authors. But

Iin this expectation, was for the most part doomed to dis-

appointment. What was taught in the schools was every one's

property, and required no recognition, which was reserved only

for the most recent novelties, however frivolous their character.

     Some years ago Dr. Quain mentioned to me the project of
the Dictionary of Medicine which he had engaged to edit, and

asked me to write some articles for it. But this was a kind

tirely opposed to the feelings and sentiments of many years duration,

caused me the deepest pain a pain increased by every subsequent

mental reference to the subject Hence the delay in replying to

your letter. However, the ordeal has sooner or later to be met,

I Iand shall try to put, in as few words as possible, all that have to
say in reference to the immediate subject of the Dictionary. The

Iwork is the absolute property of Messrs. Longmans, and was

bound to carry out as far as possible the plan on which the proposal

for the publication of the Dictionary was based. It was to be a

work which should present the Practitioner with a condensed view

of the present state of Medical Science without reference to the

agencies by which this had been arrived at. In the directions issued

for the  guidance of the several   writers, the   following paragraph
occurs.                           meant as a     rule to include much
          " The articles are not

historical matter, frequent reference to authorities, or the discus-

sion of unsettled opinions." Having obtained the services of the

best available writers in each subject, my duty coinciding with my

inclination was to interfere as little as possible with the several

authors leaving to each the responsibility of his own work. Some-

times it was necessary to ask writers to condense their work or to

sanction its being done, sometimes to alter but confess thatI it,   I it
                                                    I

specially made to the name of any particular individual, feeling

satisfied that each writer would do all that was needed for the com-

pleteness of his work. If had thought that you were anxious
         I
about reference being made to your name, most certainly your wish
                 a
should have been fully gratified, equally so had felt to be neces-

sary but to me your work has always seemed to me so important

and so complete constituting      large part of the modern history

of Pathology and Physical Diagnosis, that should as little have ex-I
pected reproach from you for not mentioning your name in con-

      anection with these subjects as from the shade of Harvey for not

mentioning his name in connection with disorders of the circulation,

At the same time, dear Dr. Williams, let me remind you that

quest, you would have had the most favourable opportunities of

bringing forward the essential features of your previous work.
PAST PRESENT FUTURE.  491

   I' In conclusion let me add that whatever you may feel or say on

this subject, shall hope to remain in the future, as in the past,
                                              ' Your grateful faithful friend,

     Whilst the readers of the Dictionary reap the benefit of

the imperative utilitarianism of the 'present writers,' I trust

that my readers will not find it unpleasant to recur to the
records of the past, nor unprofitable to draw from them in-

struction for the ivresent, and even for the future. History
repeats itself; and a retrospect of past progress will often
assist in further advancement, more than a dogmatic inculca-

tion of present knowledge, as if it were stationary and com-

plete. The most enduring as well as the most comprehensive
knowledge is that of principles ; and the development of
principles is for the most part historical work. But this

argument, to be continued profitably, should be pursued from

abstract into detail, which the end of the book forbids.

   If I have hitherto got little credit for the work of my

life, it matters little now : but seeing that it was falling into

Ioblivion, thought my duty was to make this effort to pre-

serve it for whatever it may be worth, for the benefit of

humanity.
     This chapter concludes secular matters past present

Iand future : but have a few thoughts on subjects of more
Ienduring interest, which reserve for the last chapter.

Grace and knowledge. Explanation of Greek words denoting ' Become

I PROPOSE to devote this last chapter to a few reminiscences

and reflections relating to the Higher Life and the work of

Grace. During a busy professional life I had little time or

opportunity for religious associations or exercises ; and except
in attending a few meetings of the Christian Medical Asso-
ciation, which has been already noticed, there is nothing

to record. It was always a refreshment to me to visit my

daughter's dear friends, the Rev. W. W. Andrew and his
family at Hethersett, whose devotion to the Higher Life and

labour of love was always exemplary and edifying ; and our
Bible readings together were a source of enjoyment and com-
fort. Since my residence at Cannes there have been also
profitable opportunities for Bible readings, especially at Mr.
EVANGELICAL CHURCH DOCTRINES.                             493

Iand Mrs. Cheyne Brady's meetings ; which attended until

increasing deafness incapacitated me.

   IOne of the principal objects to which looked forward in

my retirement was a course of Scripture study, more consecu-

Itive and complete than had been able to pursue in the midst

of professional occupations. Mention has been already made
of our customary readings of the Greek Testament, but little
was attempted beyond getting as literal and simple a transla-

tion of the text as possible, without going into the expositions

of learned commentators. We attended the ministry of that
sound and judicious preacher, the Eev. W. Reeve, of Portman

Chapel, for upwards of twenty years, and found much comfort

Iand edification in his thoroughly evangelical teaching and

ministrations. And the more studied them and observed

Itheir effect on the lives and conversation of men, the more

became attached to the leading doctrines of our reformed

Church as expressed in her llth and 6th articles, compre-

hending justification by faith and the adequacy of Holy Scriptures,
through the promised teaching of God's Holy Spirit, to make
us wise unto salvation through faith which is in Jesus. This
preference of spirituality and truthful simplicity of doctrine
implied also aversion to all forms of ritualism and sacerdotal-
ism; not only as signifying a tendency to relapse into the
errors and superstitions of the dark ages tares sown by the
enemy, but also as vitiating and destroying the unity and

sovereignty of the most fundamental truths of Christianity.

    In the study of the Holy Scriptures, especially their most

Ifully inspired and revealed portion, the New Testament,

found the writings of modern commentators of the greatest
use. Dean Alford's translation and exegetical notes proved
very instructive ; and one cannot but admire the candour as
well as earnestness that pervades them ; but the language of
the latter is often so much involved parenthetically that it is
difficult to catch its meaning; and not a few errors of the
authorised version escaped his notice. Bishop Lightfoot's
scholarly revisions of the Flpistles to the Galatians and Philip-
pians ' gave me much satisfactory help, as did also Dean

Vaughan's profitable and devotional commentary on the

Epistle to the Eomans. 1 Adolph Saphir on the Epistle to the

IHebrews, Hay Aitkin's ' School of Grace,' (Tit. ii. 11-13),

and some others of his works found very edifying ; West-

cott's Canon of Scripture proved satisfactory in settling the

mind in questions as to the authenticity of different parts of

Scripture.

    For an accurate knowledge of the language of the New

ITestament recommend the daily reading of portions in the

original Greek to those who have even a moderate knowledge
of that language. For others, the revised version may be

substituted, as decidedly more exact than the authorized

Itranslation, which in many instances fails to render accurately
the sense of the original.  am indebted to my friend Mr.

Arthur St. John Mildmay for a copy of a very elaborate work,

entitled, ' The Englishman's Bible,' by Thomas Newberry, of

Weston-super-Mare. In this the endeavour is made 'to put

the reader in possession of some of the precisions, beauties,

Ithe presumptuous thought that can suggest another rendering, more literal,
and more full of comfort in its meaning than this or the ordinary translation.

hold, dominate, have position over. T& uirepe'^oj/, the participle, means any-
thing holding position above, higher, Rom. 13. 1 ; Phil. 2. 3 ; 1 Pet. 2. 13. To

pass or surpass would be expressed by vvfpftd\\ci>, as in Eph. 3. 19, and 2 Cor.

9. 14. Tldvra vovv may be translated every mind, more literally than all

understanding. Then we have the following literal translation of the 6th and
7th verses. ' Be distracted about nothing : but in everything by prayer and

supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.

And the peace of God, overholding (or dominating) every mind, shall guard
your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.' The usual translation of the

article and participle into relative pronoun and verb which overlwldeth every

mind may be substituted, but is less literal. The thought of God's peace

specially superintending every mind, is surely more comforting than that of its

Ibeing something incomprehensible.

     1 Dr. Vaughan's commentary is the only one in which have seen mention

made of the omission of the Greek articles in certain passages, apparently with

the intention of emphasizing the expression of personality. It seems to me to

be more significant than even he makes it. When in Rom. 1. 17, the Gospel is

declared to be (not the power of God, but) God's power unto salvation to every-
one believing there is a force and directness of assurance which would be im-
paired by articles and prepositions. In like manner in Rom. 8. 16, and

1 Jno. 3. 1, 2, the omission of the article the before children, enforces the

strength of the union as God's children. There are many similar passages in

the Epistle to the Romans.

and hidden treasures in the Hebrew and Greek originals, and

to keep them before the eye of the Biblical student.' Varia-

tions in type, and a great number of marks and notes are used
to distinguish and explain the full and precise meaning of

particular words and texts, beyond what appears in the

common translation. The work is one of prodigious labour

and profound erudition, and is highly commended by several

eminent scholars and divines. It seems a most valuable help

to earnest students of Scripture who are unacquainted with

the original languages. The smallness of the type and signs

Ihas prevented me from profiting by it so much as could

wish.

    In addition to the Bible and New Testament, little books

Iwith a selection of texts for daily study are most useful and

convenient. Of the great numbers of such, may specially

name as excellent, ' Daily Light on the Daily Path,' (Bagster),

I' Night and Morning Watches,' ' Faithful Promiser,' ' Words

of Jesus,' and others by Dr. Macduff, which have often
found acceptable among patients. The ' Altar Incense ' of the

same author long proved useful as an aid to family or private

devotions. These in the last year have been richly supple-

mented by the manual of my dear old friend the Eev. W.

Niven, formerly vicar of St. Saviour's, Upper Chelsea, whose

state of health has debarred him of late from public ministra-

tion. But he has been blessed with fruitful work in old age,

not only in a sweet pamphlet of exhortation on that special'),
subject (' Fruit in Old Age addressed to aged pilgrims, but
also in excellent commentaries on several of St. Paul's epistles

for family reading. They seem to me models of Christian

teaching simple and plain, yet full of the very essence and

efficacy of Gospel truth and comfort.

Iwhat of a high church dress in phrase and form, especially in

the editions adorned with red letters, found on closer study to

be, for the most part, an excellent manual of devotion, rich in

the most precious scriptural truths, and deeply spiritual and

practical in their interpretation and application. The language

although simple, is remarkably terse and epigrammatic, and

speaks so plainly and to the point, that every sentence in each
page is full of meaning. And most of the pages ring with the
true sound of the Gospel in the Name which is above every

name. 1 Yet, strange to say, in some pages, neither the name

Inor the office of Christ is mentioned, and the language might
be that of a deist.  doubt not that the omission is uninten-

tional ; and perhaps it may be pleaded, that the name, if not
expressed, is understood. But THAT NAME is the NAME

to be not only understood, but ever expressed and confessed 2

before all, as the only ' NAME given among men wherein we

must be saved.' 3

     And here is the point on which (as it seems to me) centres
the whole truth of Christianity, GOD revealed to man, in
and through CHEIST, only. This conclusion, in my humble

opinion, is fully warranted by the teaching of the following and

other portions of Holy Scripture.

     John, chap. 1. vv. 1-4 and 9-14 ; Mat. 1. 23 ; Isaiah 9.

6, 7 ; Heb. 1. 1-3 (Literal translation), ' God, having of old in
many parts, and in many modes spoken unto the fathers in the
prophets, at the last of these days spake in (his) Son (sv VIM),
whom He appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made
the worlds ; who being effulgence of His glory, and very im-
press of His substance, 4 and upholding all things by the word

of His power, having made purification of sins, sat on right

hand of the majesty on high, that is, in full possession of the
power and authority of God. f All power is given unto me in

And to the end of the chapter is declared in prophecy the

pre-eminence of God the Son, as King, Creator, and Everlast-
ing God. Further on He is announced as ' High Priest for

ever after the order of Melchizedek,' and a compassionate

High Priest, having partaken of our nature ; yet Jesus Christ,
the same, yesterday, to-day, and for ever.' 13. 8. ' Through

Jesus Christ, to whom glory for ever and ever.' 18. 21. To

these absolute declarations of the Deity of Our Lord and

Saviour Jesus Christ may be added that of Col. 2. 9. 'In

Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,' and many

others, in letter and in spirit, both in the Old and in the New

Testament.

And concerning this second Person in the Blessed Trinity,

* Very God of very God,' what does the Holy Spirit speak of
Him and of His office ? In the mouth of John Baptist : ' No

one hath seen God at any time : the only begotten Son, being

in the bosom of the Father, that One (Eiceivos) hath declared
Him.' And of His sacrificial character, ' Behold the Lamb of

God  which  taketh  away the  sin  of the      world           '  John the
                                                             !

Evangelist, the beloved disciple, names Him as 'O Aoyos, The

Word, the Speech, the Voice of God ; and as the personifica-

tion also of all the Divine attributes : Life, Light, Truth,

Wisdom, Love, Holiness : through Him alone can man become

partaker of these attributes of Divine Nature. 1 And if we
follow the same evangelist, whom His Divine Master loved and

instructed most deeply in His truths and in the mysteries of
His love, we find Him in the third chapter opening the mind

of the Jew to the necessity of a new birth for the spiritual
reception of the new life from above. In the fourth chapter,

after reproving the sinning woman of Samaria, He proclaims

the spirituality and freedom of God's true worship through Him,
the fountain of ' living waters springing up into eternal life.'

And without dwelling on the rich revelations of Himself in

the intermediate chapters, as the Spiritual Bread of Life from
heaven the Light of the world the Door of the sheep the

Sanctified of the Father the Eesurrection and the Life

the Glorified of the Father, we come to the 14th and two

following chapters in which the identity and co-equality of

God the Father with God the Son are emphatically affirmed ;

and not less absolutely and exclusively the Son of God as

Son of man is declared to be the Mediator, Intercessor, and

Advocate between God and man. But the revelations were

gradual and progressive, and not completed until after the

Resurrection and the sending the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of
'ITruth who should guide into all truth (v. 17).
                                                  have yet

many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.

Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of Truth is come, he shall guide
you into all truth ' . . . ' He shall glorify me ; for he shall take
of mine, and declare unto you. All things whatsoever the
Father hath, are mine ' (26. 13, 14). But some revelations

are announced at once, absolutely, and for ever, as funda-

Imental doctrines, especially these two : AM THE WAY, AND

THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE : NO ONE COMETH UNTO THE FATHER,
IBUT BY ME (14. 6) ; and BELIEVE ME THAT
                                          AM IN THE

FATHER AND THE FATHER IN ME ' (14. 11.) In these two
declarations, fortified and enforced by numerous others, it is

affirmed that Jesus Christ is the only Mediator between God
and man, and as His Beloved Son in whom He is well pleased,

He shares with God the Father all the glorious attributes of

Divine Being, in which, in chap. 17, he intercedes with God
the Father for the participation of His Church.

This being so, we can understand the convergence of all

Scripture to this one point CHRIST revealed in the Old

Testament dimly, yet intelligibly in the Gospels clearly and

personally in the Acts, Epistles, and Revelation with em-

phatic distinctness and fulness. He is the ' One thing
needful,' declared by Himself to be ' The good part,' ' The

treasure found in a field,' ' The pearl of great price,' the end

and object of the parables of the 'kingdom of heaven,' the

theme of all the Epistles. Christ is ' God's power unto salva-
tion ' of Romans 1. 16 ; ' The end of the law for righteousness
to everyone that believeth ' (10. 3) ; ' God's power and God's
wisdom,' of 1 Cor. 1. 24; Paul's 'glory' in Gal. 6. 14; the

object of his prayer in Eph. 4. 14-21 ; the object of his
struggle in Phil. 3. 13, 14 ; ! of his thanksgiving and un-

     To the true Christian then Christ is ' all and in all.' And

this not in doctrine or idea only; but in reality. In the
parable of the Vine He tells His disciples, ' Apart from me ye
can do nothing.' It is only by the indwelling of His spirit
that we can partake of His life and love, and in His strength
bring forth fruit to His Glory. And should not the Christian,

Christ's man, be very zealous in his Master's service, and

jealous of His honour ? Not only will he remember the warn-
ing in Matt. 6 : ' Not everyone that saith unto me Lord, Lord,

&c.,' but also the closing words of St. John's first Epistle, which,

after emphatically declaring Jesus Christ the Son of God to
be the True God and Life Eternal, concludes, addressing

his children with a term of endearment, 'Tsxvia, (f>v\d^ars
sav-Tovs aTro rwv el&o!>\(av.' 'Little children, guard yourselves

from the likenesses, or imitations.' There are many idols, or

resemblances, and all the more dangerous, because they have

an outward likeness or resemblance : and our only safeguard

is that ' the Son of God is come, and hath given us understand-

ing that we may know Him that is true, and we are in Him
that is true in His SON JESUS CHRIST ' (1 Jno. 5. 20).

     The Established Church of England proves its Christian

character, not only in the Scriptural doctrines set forth in its

Articles, but also by the evangelical character of its Liturgy,

and by the express mention of the mediation and intercession of
'Iwords
         do,' which are not in the original, and the error has not been

corrected in the Revised Version. Aietaw is a verb active, and immediately
governs tv : thus the literal translation is ' but forgetting things behind, and

reaching forwards to things before, I pursue one thing toward the goal unto

the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus.'

Another example of the confusing effect of interpolating words, not in the

original, may be found in Eph. 2. 1. And you lw.Ui lie quickened (did lie
quicken, Revised Version), destroys the literal kense which couples ' And you '
(heathen) of the first verse with ' us ' (Jews) ' together with Christ,' of the fifth
verse. Both heathen and Jews dead in trespasses both ' made alive together

with Christ, and made to sit together in the heavenlies in Him.' It has been to

me a confirmation of the truth of Holy Scripture, that it comes out purer and

clearer when rid of human additions.

5co TARES IN THE CHURCH.

Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in every one of the

prayers and thanksgivings. It is to be feared, however, that the

monotony of the phraseology, and the usually irreverent mode

Iof reading the service have much obscured the depth and

vital importance of the meaning. Although prefer a liturgical
service to extemporaneous prayer, in common with many

Iothers, should be glad to see some changes introduced with

the view to render it more spiritual and evangelical ; but this

is too wide a subject to be entered on here. But I cannot

help expressing the wish that the attention of the English

clergy were more directed to improve the matter and manner

in their ministrations as servants l of Christ, and not wasted

in the trivial matters of ritual and ornament, emblems of an

obsolete priesthood, belonging to an age of shadows and

carnal ordinances, long superseded by the possession of a

Ispiritual reality, Col. 3. 17.      have endeavoured, how-
      The Confession of faith which

ever weakly and imperfectly, to express above, is designed to

avoid equally the blinding and debasing errors of human

superstition on the one hand, and the vain and dreary

doctrines of unchristian infidelity on the other. These are all

opposed to the Truth of Christ's Gospel ; and in so far as

they have penetrated the visible church they must be looked

on as tares sown by the enemy, of which we are exhorted to

beware, and to avoid until the end when the Lord Jesus

shall come to destroy them all in judgment. (Matt. 13. 30 ;

I2 Thes. 2. 8).

        accept and rejoice in the title of Protestant ; but less in
its common negative sense of protesting against error, than in

its positive and Scriptural meaning, (the first knowledge of

    1 It is remarkable how Paul in several epistles, and James, Peter and Jude,
all glory in calling themselves slaves (SoCAoi) of Christ. There are five or six

Iother words for servant in Greek, but they choose one implying, ' whose am,'
Ias well as, ' whom serve.' They ' are not their own, but are bought with a

price,' and rejoice in His service which is perfect freedom, because they find
His yoke pleasant (xpi)<rrbs) and His burden light, Matth. 11. 30, and desire
every thought to be brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ. 2 Cor
10, 5. This explanation is rendered only partially in the Eevised Version by

the insertion, in the margin, of the term bond-servant.
A PROTESTANT IS WITNESS FOR GOD.  501

Iwhich owe to a tract by my friend the Rev. Hugh McSorley),

protesting or witnessing FOR THE TRUTH. The Greek verb

Ifiaprvpsw or papTvpovfiai, and the Latin protestor, distinctly

mean witness for ; and it is only Luther's prominent use of
the word in a negative sense that has given it the conventional

'Imeaning of bearing witness against something. Take St. Paul's
use of the word in 1 Tim. 6. 13.  charge thee in the

sight of God, who maketh alive all things, and of Christ Jesus

who before Pontius Pilate witnessed (protested, fiaprvpri-
vavros) a good confession,' &c. Then see what was this ' good
confession' as described in John 18. 37. 'Pilate therefore

said unto him, Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered, Thou

I Isayest that am King. To this end have been born, and
I Ito this end am come into the world that should bear wit-

ness for (fj,aprvpr}o-(0, protest for) the truth. Everyone that
is of the truth heareth my voice.' Thus Jesus Christ protests

for or bears witness to the truth, and Protestants who hear

His voice bear witness to the same. They are witnesses for
the truth of God ' the truth as it is in Jesus ' (Eph. 4. 21),
' the Faithful and True Witness ' (Rev. 3. 14).

     Protesting for the truth of course includes protesting

against error, but this is a secondary function of the witness,

whose first ground or stand-point is the Truth of God, the

Rock of Ages Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and

for ever as He is revealed in the Holy Scriptures, carefully

and prayerfully studied, with the promised help of God's Holy

Spirit. It is only by the clear and full understanding and

receiving of the truths of Holy Scripture that error can be

detected and effectually counteracted, and there can be no

doubt that a chief cause of the spread of error, superstition

and infidelity in the present age, especially among the upper

classes is their general ignorance of the truths of the

IGospel.        met with among what may be considered

     Many have

highly educated people, who knew less of these vital truths

than the poor children of a Sunday school. And among

those who have been better taught, and have learnt the rudi-

ments of Christianity, how many are there who halt in these,
502 GROWTH IN GRACE AND KNOWLEDGE.

and heed not the exhortation of Peter to ' grow in the grace
and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ' ?

(2 Pet. 2. 18.)
     ' The path of the just,' we are told, ' is as the shining light,

which shineth more and more unto the perfect day.' The

work of justification is immediate and perfect, as is the right-
eousness of Christ which we appropriate by faith; we are
complete in Him (Col. 2. 10). But sanctification and know-
ledge are essentially gradual and progressive ; this is affirmed in

many parts of Scripture, and I would mention two instances

in which the meaning of the words has not been exactly ex-

pressed in our translations. In 1 Pet. 1. 15, there are two

Greek readings, "Ayioi yevsvOs, and ayioi sa-sa-ffs, which the

authorised version renders, 'Be ye holy.' But if the first

word be taken, the most literal translation is ' become ye holy ; '

or if the latter word easa-Os be preferred, it may be rendered

' ye shall be holy,' and this is adopted in the revised version :
both the last expressions indicating a state not at once start-

ing into Godly perfection, but becoming holy as a gradual and

I Iprogressive following of Divine holiness. Tivopai in this

sense may be generally rendered become or come to be, and

so distinguished from Et/u, which in conjunction with '70),

expresses self-existence and perfection, the prerogative of Deity.

     A similar idea of progression is conveyed with regard
to knowledge, yvcao-is, by the prefix, sirl, so that sirfyvaxns
denotes fuller or more perfect knowledge. This distinction
is never noticed in the authorised version, and but rarely in
the revision. Yet it is full of significance, especially in the

epistles, where the words siri^vwffLs and eTriyivooa-tcco are used
to express increase or greater fulness of knowledge and pro-

gress in the divine life. In his prayers and aspirations for

his converts the writer desires for them this fuller knowledge.
See Col. 1. 6-9, 10, Col. 2. 10, Ro. 1. 28, 10, 2, Eph. 1. 17,

4. 18, Phil. 1. 9, 1 Tim. 2. 4, 2 Tim. 2. 25. 3. 7, Tit. 1. 1,
Phile. 6, 2 Pet. 1. 2, 3, 8. 2. 20, 1 Cor. 13. 12. In these

passages searchers may find encouragements to ' follow on
to know the Lord,' ' that their hearts may be comforted, they
being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full

assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery

of God, even Christ in whom are stored all the treasures of

Iwisdom and knowledge.'      (Col. 2. 2,  8.)      for presuming  to
                            offer some    apology
      feel that I ought to

write thus freely on subjects, that may perhaps be beyond my

capacity and scholarship ; and it is this, that whilst humbly

conscious of liability to error, and willing to submit to more

Icompetent authorities, am actuated by a sincere desire to offer

my feeble testimony to what appears to me to be GOD'S

TKUTH.
