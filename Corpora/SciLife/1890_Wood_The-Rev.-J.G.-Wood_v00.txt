                                PREFACE.
       As it may fairly          be claimed    for my father that he was
       the first to popularise            natural history, and to render
       it   interesting,       and    even intelligible,     to non-scientific
       minds,      it    has    been     thought      advisable     that      some
       account      of his life and labours            should be prepared
       and published while his memory is yet fresh in the
       minds of those who have read his books or listened
       to his lectures.          In    the following     pages, therefore,         I
3      have      endeavoured         to describe his three-fold work as
$>     clergyman, author, and lecturer, and at the same time
tf-i   to give     a    short account of his public and private life
       from his early           boyhood to the closing days of his
»      life.
4.             Unfortunately for the labours of             a   biographer,      the
       diaries    which he left behind him — and which                     are   by
       no means continuous — are extremely scanty, and often
S      for many weeks together                there    is   nothing      but the
       barest     entry of work done and letters . written, with
al     out amplification or details of any kind.                    By   the aid

viii                     PREFACE.
of family information, however,    I  have,  I  think, been
enabled to fill in the gaps   ; and  I  have only to ask
that indulgence which all      may   crave    who   attempt
the most difficult task    of giving   to   the  world the
account of a father's life.

The        Reverend          John       George        Wood,        clergyman,
author,       and     lecturer      upon Natural History, father
of the        writer       of    this memoir, was born on the
21st      of    July, 1827, in Howland                     Street,    London.
His father, John Freeman Wood, a                          surgeon,      and for
some        years      Chemical        Lecturer       at     the    Middlesex
Hospital,        had     three      years      previously      married     Miss
Juliana        Lisetta      Arntz,      a     young      lady     of German
parentage upon the father's side, who, having passed
the first fourteen years of                her life at Dusseldorf, had
then      completed        her     education,     and     finally settled in
            B

2                     THE REV. J.   G.  WOOD.
England.       The first child of the marriage was still
born   ;  and my father, who came next, was thus
practically the eldest of a family of fourteen. Of these,
however, several died in infancy, and two more only
lived to early womanhood.
     My father himself was a weak and               sickly child
from his birth, and for          several years, indeed, it was
never thought        that he    could possibly   live to    reach
maturity.      He suffered principally from violent attacks
of croup, which recurred at frequent intervals, and,
until he    was eleven years    of age, obliged him to be kept
under     constant    supervision at home.       Yet the child
managed to pick up a wonderful stock of knowledge in
spite    of his delicate    state of health, and was always
occupied in learning something, in some of the thousand
and one ways which presented themselves             to his ever-
 active   mind.      Partly by instruction of the ordinary
 character, and partly by a species of self-tuition peculiar
 to himself,    he  learnt to read with wonderful rapidity
 and facility, and at four years of age was thoroughly
 familiar with the historical portions of the New
 Testament,     and was manifesting the first signs of the
 extreme     fondness for books       which afterwards    charac
 terised   the whole     of his life.   He could not     be  kept
 from them.       A   book, merely as a book, had an intense
 fascination for him, and he read with avidity almost
 everything that came in his way, and not only read,
 but remembered it.          Indeed, he always had a most
  wonderful memory, except for dates and names, which
  he could seldom recollect at all.          To the end of his

                       EARLY EDUCATION.                             3
 life he could cite verbatim long passages from books or
 poems which he had not read for many years, and apt
 quotations'   from all sorts of sources seemed             to come
 to his lips without any effort of recollection            whatever.
 And much of his       success  in literature was no doubt due
 to his marvellous      power of extracting, as        it were, at a
 single reading, the pith from the numberless books
 which he perused, and storing it up in some pigeon
 hole of his mind until required for use.
      Spelling, too, like' reading, came naturally to him,
 for he possessed that curious side-shoot of artistic
 talent which enables one to          see   any required word in
 the   mind's     eye,  without     depending       for the letters
 which compose it upon any mere                effort of memory.
 Strangely    enough,     however,      there   were     two words
 which always puzzled him, and to the end of his da\ s
                          "           "
 he could never spell        cheque      without the addition of
                           "       "
an unnecessary c, or         niece     without transposing the
second    and third letters.       And, with regard to these
two words, no amount of correction                 ever   made the
smallest difference.
     Arithmetic,     even in its simpler forms, was always
beyond     him.     He did, no doubt, know that two and
two make four, but        I   very much question whether he
ever mastered the multiplication           table.    And certainly
a piece of mere ordinary calculation was utterly outside
his powers.      Possibly this was in great measure due to
the character of his early training.              Mathematics, in
the days of his youth, were little regarded, and sound
classical knowledge was generally considered as the one

end and aim of education        ;  and the arithmetical talent,
if not cultivated in childhood,           seldom attains to any
degree of perfection       afterwards.       So  that when my
father had any sums to do, he always did them by
deputy.     Euclid, however, he liked, and often worked
at it merely for the interest that he managed to extract
from it.     But that was the only branch             of mathe
matical science of which he ever picked            up more than
the    merest    rudiments   ;    and   I   have always had a
shrewd    suspicion    that he kept no account of receipts
and expenditure       for the simple reason that he dis
 trusted his own power of adding up his columns.
     At four  years of age the boy was taken to church
for the first time;        and    there an     amusing incident
happened.     He    does   not seem       to  have received  any
preliminary instruction in the Liturgy, and did not at
all know what to expect when he entered the building.
He behaved very well, however, and joined in the
Lord's Prayer, which, of course, he knew by heart,
with much reverence and devotion.               By-and-by, how
ever, the Lord's Prayer was repeated again, and this
time he seemed a little bored, and took his part in
it only under    protest.   But    when the Litany drew near
to its close,     and the same       Prayer    was said  for the
third time,    his patience came altogether to an end,
and, rising     from his knees, he sat down with an
air of great determination, and a very audible remark

to the effect that he " couldn't stand this no more !
     In  1830 it was deemed         advisable, for more reasons
than one, that the Chemical Lectureship at the Middlesex

Hospital should be given up, in order that the family
might remove to Oxford. And there a house was taken
in the High Street, which was subsequently vacated
for another in Holywell Street, and that again in its
turn for a third in Broad Street.
    As the boy still continued very delicate, his father
saw that the only chance for him was to keep him at
home for the      present,   and   to   allow him to live as
healthy and natural a life    as. possible.   Outdoor exercise
and amusements, therefore,        were strongly encouraged,
and the child learned to run and swim and climb with
a facility which few boys      of his own age could equal.
In   the water,    more    especially,    he was  always  per
fectly at home, and would tumble in backwards, or
head foremost, and dive for eggs and three-penny
pieces,  and   even play a sort of aquatic leap-frog, as
readily as though the river were his natural home.
Indeed, he spent much of his time on its banks or in
its waters.    There were trout to be tickled, crayfish to
be caught,    and creatures innumerable        to be watched,
and   perhaps    brought home for the aquarium. The
spirit of emulation was rife, and every boy tried to do
better than his fellows.      And so each and all came to
be  as  familiar with the water        as  with the dry land,
never from the first having learned to consider       it as an
element to be dreaded.
    The crayfish were caught in rather a primitive
fashion. Paddling along in the water by the banks,
the boys would carefully investigate every hole, until
the long antenna?    of the crayfish were felt projecting.

 Then a sudden " grab           was made, the creature seized
behind the great claws, so as to deprive it of the power
 of employing those formidable weapons upon the un
protected     hand, and forthwith       transferred to the cap,
 which in those        days   was  a roomy article of attire,
capable of holding        several crayfishes    without   danger
of overcrowding.          The presence of half a dozen of
these    creatures   moving about       upon    the    head,  and
occasionally    giving a sharp pull to the hair, does not
seem    to have been regarded        in the least, the great
beauty of the arrangement being, of course, that it
left the hands free, while there was little or no danger
of the captives escaping.
     My father had many amusing stories to tell of
his early boyhood.          One of an organised attempt to
excavate a subterranean passage from the garden to the
river-bank (half a mile away), which resulted in the
removal of huge quantities of earth, and the dis
covery of the scheme by the higher powers just in
time    to   prevent    the   probable    burial   alive  of  the
whole     enthusiastic    party.   Another of      a great   plan
for the purchase of       a  donkey by means of the gradual
accumulation of        halfpence ; which plan seemed so
feasible,   and so certain     of fruition, that a big pair of
scissors were surreptitiously removed from the maternal
workbox, and the lawn diligently cropped, in order
that a store of hay might be laid up for the prospec
tive animal's requirements.        And a third of the queer
code of honour which forbade the plucking of apples
from the trees in the orchard (where windfalls were

recognised      as common      property), but did not militate
against the employment of boys from outside to pelt
the fruit With stones, by the bribe of a commission on
                   "                                         "
the profits.          Quod facit per  alium,    facit per se   was
a motto      clearly unregarded by the youthful moralists.
      Very earl}¦ in the boy's life the bent of his mind
manifested itself ; and he himself could never recollect
the     time   when     he  was not    constantly     poking, and
probing, and prying, here, there, and everywhere, in
the endeavour to discover some of the manifold secrets
of Nature, and to learn the ways and doings of the
 multitudinous living creatures that garden and river
 and woodland afforded.
       In  this he was much encouraged by his father,
 who, on Sunday afternoons, would lend a microscope
 and     a  pocket    magnifying-glass to the children, and
 join eagerly       with them in examining the numerous
 wonders      which a few       minutes'   search in the garden
 would always turn up. Pets, of course, were numerous
 and varied.        Bats, toads, lizards, snakes, blindworms,
 hedgehogs,       newts,     dormice,   insects   even of various
 kinds, all were kept in turn.             And so the boy laid
  the foundation of that store             of knowledge which
  afterwards     served the    man so     well.    He learned to
 love     animals     of all   kinds,  and     to study with    the
  deepest interest      and minutest care every detail of their
  life-history.     And    at the   same     time he   was uncon
  sciously teaching himself how to observe, and learning
  the lessons, myriad and diverse, which Nature is always
  ready to impart to those who            strive to search out her
   secrets.

  8                  THE REV. J.   G. WOOD.
       Soon followed another    step, and a most important
  one, in the pursuit after knowledge,    for at a very early
  age   the young naturalist found his way to the Ash-
  molean Museum, and almost immediately succeeded in
  getting upon unusually friendly terms with the kind-
  hearted old curator, who sympathised most heartily with
  the boy's keenness and wonderful thirst for information.
  Any   help that he could give was freely given, and soon
  "                 "
    Johnny Wood       was a constant visitor to the Museum,
  and as constant   an enquirer of the curator, who, so far
 from being annoyed by his persistence, said that his
 questions were so apt and sensible that it was a real
 pleasure to answer them.      For several years these visits
 were kept up, and even after school-days had begun the
 boy's first visit at the beginning of every holiday season
 was always to the Museum,         in order that he might
 discover all the new specimens, carefully examine them,
 and find out whatever there was to be learnt concerning
 them.
      So passed the time until 1838, by which time eight
years of active, outdoor life, with unlimited exercise in
the way of running, swimming, climbing, and exploring
woodland, hill, and dell, had so strengthened       the boy's
constitution that it was deemed that home study might
profitably be exchanged for the severer discipline of a
school.     He was therefore sent to Ashbourne Grammar
School, in Derbyshire, over which his uncle, the Rev.
G. E. Gepp, presided as head-master          ; and there he
remained for the next half-dozen years.
     The school was conducted on old-fashioned principles,

                       SCHOOL-LIFE.                      9
all  offences, great and small, being impartially visited
with the rod, while the daily routine would now be
considered as stern and rigorous to a degree.         And
the head-master, dreading to be accused of favouring
his own nephew, was far more strict, and even merci
less with him than with any of his fellow- pupils.     Yet
the six years which were spent there appear to have
been by no means unhappy on the whole.         There was
plenty of time for outdoor exercise   ; the neighbouring
country afforded every opportunity for the manifold
forms of recreation in which the souls of boys delight ;
and, pleasantest of all, the natural history studies
could be carried on almost as freely as at Oxford.    Soon
the boy collected about himself a band of kindred
spirits, who used to scour the neighbourhood in search
of specimens and trophies, and come home laden with
spoil, both living and dead.    Grass snakes more especi
ally were in great request by way of pets.         Almost
every boy had quite a number of them, and would carry
them about in his pockets, tie them round his wrists
and neck, or cause them to run, or rather glide, races
with those of his companions.    A  very favourite amuse
ment, too, was to visit certain deserted stone quarries in
the neighbourhood where standing water was always to
be  found, and there to make the snakes swim by the
simple expedient of throwing them into the middle
of a pool, and leaving them to find their way to laud.
Sometimes a snake would become obstinate, and lie
sullenly at the bottom without attempting to swim ;
and then stones had to be thrown in such a manner as

10                       -THE REV.   J.   O.   WOOD.
to fall close to       it without injuring it.         Sometimes even
this plan would fail, and then there was nothing for it
but to leave the snake master of the situation, and to
go home without it.            But generally there was little or
no trouble of this kind, and snake-races                   could be con
                                                           ¦
ducted in the water almost           as easily as upon               dry land.
The snakes very soon learned to recognise their masters,
and to refrain from making use of the highly disagree
able       odour    with which Nature has gifted them as a
means        of    protection against their foes. And, even
when illicitly taken into school, they would lie quite
quietly in the pocket without attempting to escape, or
in any way giving notification of their presence.
       I
      do not know that my father ever joined with any
degree of enthusiasm in the ordinary out-door games of
a schoolboy's        life.   He was something of           a    cricketer at
one time, but, after his usual unlucky manner, contrived
one day to catch his foot in a hole only a few inches
deep, and, in the fall which resulted, to break his right
leg rather badly and to dislocate his ankle. This in
volved confinement to bed for several weeks under
peculiarly disagreeable circumstances, of which he gives
                             "
a graphic account in his       Insects at Home," when
speaking           of that   unpleasant        creature,       the    common
flea:   —
      When    I
            was at school (he says),      I
                                     had the misfortune to suffer a
simultaneous dislocation and fracture of the ankle, and was con
veyed to  the infirmary, a large room at the top of the house.
Now, this room had been without tenants ever since I remembered
it,and     believe that for at least seven years no human being
           I
had entered the room, except to open the windows in the morning

                 AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.                               11
and shut   them at night.       The room was kept most scrupulously
clean, and no one ever imagined that a flea was in it.
    That the room was tenanted by these insects           I  found to my
own proper cost.        No sooner was the candle put out than a
simultaneous     attack was made on me in all directions.            From
every part of the room fleas came in battalions.             There was a
nurse in the room, who was one of those persons that are either
impervious   or objectionable   to fleas, and she escaped   them entirely,
while they concentrated all their energies on me.
     Now a damage such as I had suffered is not conducive to rest,
even with all appliances.        The limb swells, until the skin feels
almost unable     to  resist the tension,    and the burning    heat  is as
if melted lead were being continually poured over the joint.         Fever
rages through     the frame, and the      first endeavour of the surgeon
is to subdue   it  as much as possible.      Under such circumstances, it
may well    be  imagined that the ceaseless attacks of the flea armies
were   not   calculated    to produce   quietude  ; and, indeed, had    the
occupier of the bed been in perfect health and strength, one such
night would have sufficed to drive him into a fever. The only
portion of the skin that escaped was that which was covered
with the bandages, and even there the dreadful little insects had
found out the junctions of the bandages, forced themselves under
 the edges, and driven their beaks into the skin, so that, when the
bandage was removed in the morning, its course could be traced by
 the rows of flea-bites.
     The insects had never enjoyed such a chance of a banquet in
their lives, and naturally made the most of it.
      After this highly unpleasant experience my father
never seems to have taken any but a very occasional
part in the game of cricket, although he retained
his interest in it to the end of his life, and always
studied the cricketing news in the daily newspapers
 with some degree of care.              This accident, by the 'way,
was the first of a long series.               Seldom,   I  suppose, was
there a man who injured himself more often, or with

12                    THE REV. J.       G. WOOD.
less permanent        effect.    He broke,      at   different times
during his life, his right arm, his right leg, his collar
bone (twice), six ribs, almost all the bones of his
right hand, and his nose.              He cracked several other
bones without actually fracturing them.               He dislocated
his ankle and several of his fingers.                 And yet the
only lasting damage resulted from the injury to his
right hand, which was of so serious and complicated
a character that        the only      marvel    is that he should
ever have recovered           the use of the member at all.
    Remaining at school until he was seventeen years
of age, he then returned to Oxford, and shortly after
wards matriculated at Merton College.                 In  the follow
ing year      he    tried     for   and    obtained     the   Jackson
Scholarship    ;  and partly by the aid of this, partly by
taking    pupils     in his spare hours            and    during   the
vacations,    he   entirely      supported    himself     throughout
 his university career.
    In spite of his two-fold labours,             however,     he still
contrived to keep up his natural history studies, both
indoors and out. His rooms were full of cages, and
nets,  and boxes        of all kinds.       At   one time      he was
studying    the    development         of   the   tiger moth from
the egg    to    the perfect       insect, and had between         five
                                                       "
and six hundred of the " wholly bear                      caterpillars
simultaneously feeding in an enormous                  breeding-cage
 specially constructed for the purpose.                 This was     so
arranged     that the       stems     of the food-plants passed
through holes in the floor into a tank of water be
 neath ; so that while the caterpillars could not by

                   CATERPILLAR-BREEDING.                     13
any possibility suffer an untimely death by drowning,
their food was kept fresh and wholesome.           Yet, twice
a day,    so enormous     was the appetite     of the insects,
an   accommodating      scout    had   to be despatched into
the neighbouring lanes         to bring in as big a bundle
of dumb-nettles      as  he   could   carry.  And this con
tinued day after      day, until all the caterpillars which
remained were "full-fed,"        and ready to pass into the
pupal or chrysalis state.
     By this time, however,         their  numbers  had   been
considerably diminished, for at regular intervals of a
couple of days a certain number had been carefully
bottled in spirits of wine ; and so, when their growth
was    at an end,     my father had a complete series in
preservation, in all the stages from birth to maturity.
These he subsequently dissected, and thus began his
acquaintance      with the very important      and   extensive
 subject   of insect anatomy.
     Other pets he had, too, at the same time          : grass-
 snakes    again,   which    had   a  way of escaping from
 their cage and lying up in all sorts of nooks and
 corners, to the great dismay of the "bed-maker" and
 the scout   ; bats, and various other creatures.        About
 this time, also, he made a somewhat extensive collection
 of insects, principally    consisting of butterflies, moths,
 and beetles, and worked        the surrounding district very
 thoroughly, paying particular attention to Bagley
 Wood, which was always one of his favourite haunts.
 But yet he found time to join in many of the recrea
 tions of his fellow-students. He was very fond of

  14                  THE REV. J.    G.   WOOD.
  boating, and spent a good deal of his time on the
  river. He was a most enthusiastic gymnast, and
  became   the most proficient member of the university,
  as far   as   the    bars,  and   ropes,     and   trapezes,   and
  vaulting-horses     were   concerned.      He    was   fond,   too,
 of fencing       and   single-stick, and became no mean
  proficient in the art of self-defence.            Swimming, of
  course,  was    kept up, as of old; and in the winter,
  when the fields were flooded and the frost came, he
  was on the ice at every available          moment,     practising
 diligently    at   all the    manifold     varieties   of figure-
 skating, until he became an acknowledged                 expert in
 every branch of the art.
      He had many stories to tell of his college life ;
 a very strange one in particular, involving the dis
 appearance of a poker, which,          I  believe,   rests to this
 very day deep down in the ground in the centre
 of Merton " Quad." The adventure in question was
 as follows : —
      He was engaged in putting together the mechanism
of a small model steam-engine, and, finding himself
 in difficulties, went off to ask counsel of a friend.
The friend gave the requested advice, and came out
of his door to wish his visitor farewell. No sooner
had    the  two     crossed   the  threshold,      however,    than
              "
the " oak       closed    with  a bang,     and shut the occu
pant out of his         rooms.    Having left his latch-key
inside,   there    was   nothing    for it     but to     pick the
lock; and this, after twenty minutes' hard labour, the
two contrived       to  do.    Upon   entering the room,          to

                 AN UNEXPLAINED MYSTERY.                        15
their utter surprise, they found it so full of tobacco-
smoke (which the occupant of the apartments cordially
detested)    that it was impossible even to breathe or
to see until the window had been unfastened and
opened,   and the fumes gradually         expelled.    Then, of
course,   a   search   was   instituted,     and   the   puzzled
investigators    found on the hearth a           huge   heap    of
tha coarsest and strongest tobacco, upon which was
laid a poker, which had evidently been lately heated
to    redness.    No    sign was to be found of the
mysterious person who had placed it there.               No one
was in the room ; no one had passed                   out.    The
windows were closed and fastened,            of course on the
inside.     The    chimney was far too small to admit
of the ascent or descent of a human being, to say
nothing    of the fact that     a  fire   was burning       in the
grate.     And    there  was   not     even   a  water-pipe     by
means of which an accomplished           gymnast    might have
climbed     up   the   wall.   The     matter    was a    perfect
puzzle.    Tor some time the two stood talking                 the
mystery over, discussing every possible expedient by
 which the practical joker might have obtained ad
 mission to the rooms, and left them again before the
rightful occupant could return       ;  and each in turn       was
rejected   as  wholly impracticable.        Thus half an hour
 passed away, and again my father was accompanied
by his friend to the head of the staircase for a last
 parting word.
     No    sooner   had   the   two men passed         the    door
 than the same programme was exactly repeated              !  The

16                   THE REV. J.     G.  WOOD.
oak slammed-to        as before, fifteen    or  twenty minutes
were occupied in picking the lock, and when admis
sion was gained the windows were closed and fastened,
and the room        was   once more full      of smoke.      When
the smoke had cleared away, the smouldering pile of
tobacco and the heated          poker were found exactly as
before.      Not the smallest sign was to be found of
the  perpetrator     of the mysterious joke ; not a trace
could    be  discovered of the manner in which he had
made his entry and exit.           The two men were com
pletely at fault.
    Then an idea struck the           aggrieved    owner    of the
rooms.      Whose was the   poker ?     It  was a very ordinary
poker,    with nothing      whatever      distinctive   about    it;
but it was not the poker which belonged to the room.
That was lying in the fender as usual, and had not
been meddled        with.   Clearly the proper       thing to do
under the circumstances         was   to   send a scout      round
the  college on some pretext or other, in order to find
out whose fireplace was without its poker.             No sooner
said than done.         A scout was entrusted with the
commission,      and visited    every    room;    but every   room
had its poker.
    A    council of war was then held, and it was agreed
that the owner of the mysterious implement should
never see his poker again.          So at midnight       there set
out   a    solemn    procession   of two,      one   bearing    the
poker,    and the other the necessary tools for its inter
ment   :  to   wit,  a  crowbar,   a    wooden    mallet, and      a
heavy coal-hammer.         With    the    crowbar a deep hole

was made in the       very centre   of  the   college  quad,
and the poker placed upright therein.            Then, with
the mallet laid upon the top, in order to deaden the
sound, it was driven deeply down by repeated blows of
the hammer, until even the head was fully eighteen
inches below the surface.     Then the hole was carefully
filled in, and the operators went off to bed. But no
one ever applied for the poker, and nothing was ever
heard of the clever joker who had laid his plans so
carefully and so well.
     On another occasion a siege was laid against my
father's own rooms, which were quite at the top of the
college, and approached     only by a narrow and tortuous
staircase.   From an anonymous quarter, however, he
received pi*evious notice of the intended attack, and
made all his preparations accordingly.       First he laid in
a large stock of grey peas, and a few long glass tubes,
with a bore sufficiently large to carry them. Then he
opened both the windows, so as to expose only half the
surface of glass, protected that as well as possible, and
                          "
finally procured a large    demi-john," filled it with water,
and placed it at the head of the stairs ; and then he sat
down to read.
     About    twelve  o'clock sundry whisperings in the
quad warned him that the attack was about to begin ;
so he put out his lamp and waited.     Next moment came
a volley of stones, which were repelled by his fortifica
tions  ; and then he set to work with his pea-shooters.
A little   preliminary practice   had made him a fairly
expert marksman,     and as soon as an assailant showed

hand or face, that hand or face was smartly struck with
a pea.    The adversaries, too, laboured under the dis
advantage    that, although they could not see their
intended victim, whose room was in darkness, their
intended victim was perfectly well able to see them by
reason of the lights round the quad.        So after a while
the enemy's forces were drawn off, a hurried consulta
tion was held in a protected corner, and then a sudden
rush was made for the stairs.         But on reaching the
last flight the expected victim was seen calmly wait
ing, with the demi-john of water at hand, ready to
deluge the first besieger who should be bold enough
to approach.     The leader of the attacking party paused
and took in the situation ; and then, with a laugh,
he remarked,
                 " You fellows, I   think we had better go
back."     "I  think you had," said my father     ;  and the
enemy departed in confusion.
     The three years of the ordinary college course came
-to an end, examinations were safely passed, and in 1847
the future naturalist, still barely twenty years of age,
took his degree of Bachelor of Arts. Although not a
brilliant scholar, he had passed through his university
¦career with credit, and had imbibed     a love for classical
learning which never left him to the end of his life.
Scarcely a day ever passed in which he did not read at
least a few pages of a Latin or Greek author.         Horace
was always    his favourite poet, and he was always pick
ing up copies of his Odes at second-hand bookstalls,
 at prices ranging from a penny upwards.            Most of
 these Odes he knew by heart, and would repeat them

to himself over and over again when lying awake at
night.   And he never lost an opportunity of advising
others to read them, or of descanting with enthusiasm
upon their manifold beauties.
   Here is an old letter of his upon the subject written
to one of my sisters.     It was written from Boston,
U.S.A., and is dated Christmas Day, 1883: —
    As to the Horace,      I have picked out some of the gems.    They
are tolerably    easy,   and it will be better for you to work at them
instead of taking up the entire book.
    Book I. Odes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 20,   21, 22, 30, 37, 38.
    Book II. Odes 13, 14, 16.
    Book  IIL Odes 3, 9, 13, 26, 30.
   They are songs with words — the delight of scholars, and the
despair of imitators, the sublimest audacity concealed under a mask
which is " childlike and bland." Now,     I
                                         particularly want you to love
Horace, as you have begun to love Shakespeare, and        I
                                                        hope you will
love Chaucer and Spenser.    As a rule, women get along well enough
with Virgil, who was the Latin Tennyson ; but Horace is too much for
them.    He took his measures chiefly from Alcseus and Sappho, and his
Latin survives their Greek. Boil together Chaucer's " Romaunt of
the Rose," Spenser's " Faery Queen," Shakespeare's Sonnets (with a
few fiery flashes from " King John," " Henry V.," and the " Midsum
mer Night's Dream        "),     " Eve of St. Agnes," bits of
                               Keats'                         Shelley's
" Mab," Swinburne's classic   odes, and Morris'
                                                 " Earthly Paradise,"
and you may get a faint idea of the infinite variety, the unerring
selections of unexpected epithets (not a "nice derangement            of
epitaphs"), the dainty choice of words, the burning patriotism, the
gracious dignity of the scholarly gentleman, too proud to conceal his
lowly origin the self-respect of the poor man who could rebuke as
             ;
well as praise Cajsar and Msecenas, knowing that his life depended
                                    — who, like " Hamlet,"
on the one and his living on the other                          has no
                       "
fault but that of being made up of quotations."
    My    father's respect for the classical proprieties          also
showed itself occasionally in the strong protests               which
         c   2

are scattered  throughout his writings against the ex-
 reme looseness with which the terms used in scientific
phraseology are often framed.   Take, for example, the
                   "                 "
following, from his Insects at Home : —
     I really do not like to translate such a word as subapterus, which
is a repulsive hybrid between Latin and Greek, and —with all
respect to the eminent entomologist who first manufactured          it —
ought not to be accepted in its present form.      What, for example,
should we think of such words as eightagon, twelvehedron, dreiangle,
petitscope, telesseer, insectology, etoilonomy, erdology, and the like ?
Yet there is not one of these words which is one whit more ridiculous
than subapterus.     Should we be allowed to talk, much less write, of
a hemiglobe, an egg-positor, a chaudmeter, a baromeasurer, a virful
deed, or a megananimous sentiment 1 But, if we are to retain the
one word, there can be no reason why we should not employ the
others.       .   .   .
    Had the offending entomologist used the word subalatus, or
" partly winged," no one could have objected to                    it,
                                                         as both words
are Latin.    Apart from other reasons,         a prettier-looking word
                                                   it   is
than subapterus, and much easier to say.      But when he employs the
word sub, which      Latin, as a prefix to the Greek pteron,
                           is                                     do not I
see that we should be called upon to excoriate        our own ears and
those  of future generations  with such an atrocious compound.
 I     believe that brown sugar and oysters are considered incom
patible, as    salt with strawberry cream.
                      is                      There              is,
                                                        perhaps, not one
in ten thousand who would not feel direfully aggrieved by having
any such mixtures forced on him as part of his daily diet.          And
there    is   really no more reason for offending our eyes, ears, and mental
taste by subapterus, than our mere palates by the above-mentioned
mixtures.
   During the whole of his university career my father
had studied with the special intention of taking Holy
                                                             ¦
Orders   but as he had matriculated so unusually early,
              ;
he was still barely twenty years old when he proceeded to

                  TUTORSHIP AT HINTON.                21
his degree as Bachelor of Arts, and was consequently
obliged to wait at least three years longer before he
could apply for Ordination.      He therefore accepted
a situation as tutor in a school     of which the then
rector   of Little   Hinton,  in Wiltshire, was head
master.    Here he continued for two years, and was
very successful in the work of tuition, while he imbued
many of the lads with a taste for natural history.
The half-holiday afternoons were commonly spent in
long rambles over the downs, and in these two years
he added considerably to his own zoological knowledge,
and made many a note and observation which after
wards proved of the highest interest and importance.
     In  1850 he left Hinton and returned     to Oxford,
in order to read for Ordination.      Much of his time,
 however, was    devoted  to a private pupil, and as he
 was also working sedulously in the Anatomical Museum
at Christ Church, under Sir Henry — then Dr. — Acland,
the   Regius   Professor of Anatomy,    two more years
 passed away before he was actually ordained.    During
 these  two years, to his great subsequent benefit, he
 went through a complete course of research in com
 parative anatomy, himself dissecting representatives
 of all the important families of the animal kingdom,
and making numberless careful and valuable prepara
 tions, of which many remain in the museum to this
day. Insect anatomy, in particular, received special
 attention at his hands, and he thus acquired an
 intimate knowledge of every part of an insect's struc
 ture, which afterwards stood him in more than good

22                  THE EEV. J. 0.      WOOD.      ¦
 stead.   During these two years, in fact, was laid the
foundation of his future eminence as a naturalist.             He
had previously, both as child and man, learned                what
to observe in the       way    of outdoor zoology, and how
to observe it     ;  he   had   gained a stock        of personal
acquaintance with the ways and doings of birds and
beasts and reptiles and insects, in which at that time
he had few if any equals ; and he had imbibed a true
love for    the study of living nature,         which drew him
to   it purely for its own      sake, and not by reason of
the future emolument        which it might possibly bring
in.    And now was gained the equally important know
ledge   of anatomy      and   classification.     He   learned  to
understand     on what principles       animals are separated
into classes,    and tribes, and orders, and families, and
for what reason those         principles were chosen.          He
learned   to trace    common characteristics in creatures
which    to   all outward    seeming      are   separated   far as
the poles asunder.      And, above all, he       came    to under
stand the great and all-important            law, that Structure
depends upon Habit, which afterwards             formed the key
note to so much of his writings.              Without these two
years of careful study, he would never have been the
writer    and    naturalist   that    he    afterwards     became.
Probably     he would never       have     taken   to authorship
at all, unless, perhaps, as a writer for boys in boys'
periodicals ; and certainly he could never have ventured
upon the large and important works which principally
brought his name into prominence.              And the museum
itself also benefited considerably by his labours, of her

enriched its shelves with many a delicate and exquisite
preparation,    which perhaps     brought out some detail
of structure never before understood,         while he also
helped very largely in the systematic        arrangement    of
its contents.
    About this time, also, he was working very steadily
with the microscope, in the use of which he became
quite proficient, as evidenced    by his " Common      Objects
of the Microscope,"       written  some   years   later.   For
his insect dissections, of course, this     instrument     was
absolutely necessary   ;   and  during these and the few
following years he prepared many hundreds of slides,
and introduced several improvements of his own into
the art of microscopic mounting.
     In spite of all his zoological labours, however, and
also of his literary work (for his first book — the smaller
Natural History — was published in 1851), he kept up
his reading, and in 1852, having obtained a title for
the parish of St. Thomas the Martyr, in the outskirts
of Oxford, he was ordained      deacon by    Bishop Samuel
Wilberforce, who was at that time presiding over the
diocese of Oxford.

Immediately         after receiving         ordination       in 1852, my
father threw himself heart and soul into his new work.
His          which was situated in the poorest part of
       parish,
the city, was far from being an attractive one, but in a
few months', time he had come to know every man,
woman,       and child residing within               it,   and was busily
engaged in all the diverse labours              parish of
                                                      which     a
such   acharacter entails.  Besides serving as curate in
this parish, too, he accepted the chaplaincy of the Boat
men's Floating Chapel, an institution                   in which he took
the deepest interest, but which, of course, necessitated
a good deal of additional labour.    In consequence of
all this heavy work (the services at the church were
almost incessant, and all the curates were expected to
attend them all), his application for priest's Orders had
to be postponed until the end of the second year of

                  RESIGNATION'  OF CURACY.               25
liis ministry   ; and then he received full Orders  at the
hands of the same bishop.
      Shortly afterwards, however, owing to a variety of
causes, he felt himself obliged to relinquish his curacy.
 The stipend attached to his office, in the first place,
 amounted     to no more than sixty pounds a year, and
 out of this he was supposed to pay the interest upon
 the clothing club, and to make up the deficit in the
 salary of the schoolmistress,    if the children's pence
 failed to amount to the stipulated sum.     The laborious
 character of the work, and the necessity for constant
 visiting, prevented him altogether from adding to his
 income by the use of his pen; and so, in 1854, he
 retired temporarily from active clerical work, and went
 back to his literary labours.
      For  the next    two years he took occasional duty
 only, often relieving a brother clergyman at one of the
 numerous Oxford churches.       Early in 1856, however,
 he was advised to apply for the appointment of chaplain
to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, which was then vacant,
 and with which was held also a readership at Christ
 Church, Newgate     ; and having done so, and interviewed
 several   of the governors, he was shortly afterwards
 appointed to the post.     On April 28th of that year he
 brought his long residence at Oxford to a close, and
 travelled up to London; and on Ascension Day, May
  1st, he began his active work at the hospital.
      There he remained for the next six years, during
 which he also carried on literary work with but little
 interruption.     The duties at the hospital were not

28                  TTIE REV. J.  G.  WOOD.
arduous, save that they necessitated his residence within
five miuutes' walk of the building, and that he was of
course always liable to be called upon to minister to the
spiritual needs of the dying at any hour of the day or
night.     And so he contrived to find sufficient spare time
for his writing, without encroaching upon that which
Avas  required for the duties of his sacred office.
     Early in 1859, the monotony of his life was broken
by his marriage.      In  February, 1854* having come up
to town to attend a meeting of the Linnean Society, of
which he had just been elected a Fellow, he had met
Miss Jane Eleanor Ellis, fourth daughter of John Ellis,
Esq., of the Home Office, and a member of the York
shire branch of the family.      An engagement soon after
wards followed, but was protracted for more than four
years.    On February 15th, 1859, however, .the wedding
took place; and my father always plumed himself
greatly on the fact that no single member of the
hospital staff knew anything at all about the matter
until it was all over.      He simply left his rooms early
one morning, and returned a married man.
     In  1861 he began to think seriously of giving up
his hospital appointment, and taking up his residence
permanently in the country ; this for more reasons
than one.      A   child — a daughter — had    been  born a
year    previously,  and   had   died  at  the  age  of ten
months.      A second child, born in 18G1, was still-born.
My    mother's health was in a very unsatisfactory state,
and he himself was far from well.         Twice, indeed, he
had been visited with a species of blood-poisoning.       On

                REMOVAL     TO BELVEDERE.                   27
the first occasion, serious mischief had been averted by
the timely use of the Turkish bath     ; but on the second,
an obstinate   and painful gathering had formed on the
left hand, which did not show signs of healing until a
visit had been paid to Margate, supplemented by a
further, but shorter, trip to the New Forest.         It  was
evident enough that city life suited neither ; and so, in
1862, just six years after coming to the hospital, he
sent in his resignation, and at midsummer migrated to
 Belvedere,  near   Woolwich,    where   he   remained     for
rather more than fifteen years.
     Soon after his arrival, he became     acquainted    with
the clergyman who was acting as locum tenens to the
vicar of the neighbouring parish of Erith, the Venerable
C. J. Smith ; the vicar himself, who had formerly been
Archdeacon of Jamaica, being awa)T from home for an
indefinite  period.   A kind of     tacit   agreement     was
quickly   entered into, in virtue   of which     my father
began to act as a kind of honorary curate, the parish
being a large one, and the duty somewhat too onerous
to be successfully undertaken by one individual.         Not,
of course, that the ordinary week-day duties of     a curate
fell to his lot  : for those he had no time.         But he
assisted in the Sunday and week-day sendees until the
return of the vicar in 1863, and then continued to do so
at the special request of the vicar himself.
     The character of the services at this time was very
deplorable.   The clerk's wife played the harmonium,
and the clerk did the singing.       If a member of the
congregation   ventured   to join in the responses, or to

28                 THE REV. J.   G. WOOD.
utter an Amen above a whisper, the remainder of that
body instantly turned and gazed with astonishment at
the offender.   The chancel was squalid and dirty to the
last degree, the communicants at the monthly celebra
tion of the Holy Communion averaged only five in
number, out of a population of some six thousand, and
the Church, to all appearance,      was doomed to speedy
extinction as far  as the parish of Erith was concerned.
     So matters    continued until    1864, in which year
occurred the memorable explosion at the Belvedere gun
powder    magazines,   which   stood upon the river-bank
about half-way between Belvedere and Erith.           In ad
dition to widespread and almost incalculable damage
spread over a wide area of country, this explosion so
 wrecked the old parish church of    Erith that, during the
 necessary repairs, Divine Service had to be carried on in
 the schoolroom.    There music of a rather higher quality
 was instituted, and, before the return to the church, my
 father asked permission of the vicar to organise and
train a regular choir, and to provide properly practised
 music at the Sunday services.      The vicar gladly gave
 his consent, and my father set to work to get the choir
 together ; no light task in such a parish, and with the
 small amount of time at his command.          Shortly  after
the church was re-opened, however, a fully choral ser
vice was sung by a surpliced choir of fairly imposing
proportions.    The    harmonium     was   replaced   by an
 organ ; the old slovenliness,   formerly so painfully ap
 parent both in building    and service, was done away       ;
and bright hearty services began to attract regularly to

                 "RITUALISM AND POPERY."                  29
the church those who had previously deemed      it unneces
sary to attend Divine worship at all.
     My father's share in the work of the church was
now as follows.       On Sunday morning and Sunday
evening    he said the prayers or sang the service; on
Wednesday evenings he did the same ; and occasionally
— but very occasionally — he preached. After service on
Wednesday evenings came the choir practice ; and as a
 general rule, after service on Sunday evenings the choir
adjourned to the Lady Chapel, and there sang a selection
of anthems, less for the sake of the practice than as
a sort of additional service of praise.   After a time this
custom came to be known and appreciated         among the
members      of the congregation, many of whom would
always stay for the singing after service.         And the
arrangement was most popular with the members of the
choir themselves,     who were thus enabled to indulge
 their taste for choral singing of a somewhat more ad
 vanced character, without the usual effect of destroying
the thoroughly congregational     character of the   church
 services.
     Yet    the " innovations,"  as  they were commonly
 styled,  were not introduced without a great deal of
 opposition.    Letters without number appeared in the
 solitary local newspaper of those days ; the clergy were
 freely accused of ritualism and Popery ; my father, as
the originator of the surpliced choir, was even publicly
 burned in effigy.    But the excitement gradually calmed
 down until the year 1867, when the malcontents        were
 again   aroused  to indignation   upon the occasion of a
 dedication festival.

      This time the offending          clergy were solemnly pre
 sented    to   the   Archbishop,      and      were   summoned    to
 Addington Palace, where the proceedings               — which  igno-
 miniously collapsed in the end; — were enlivened by the
 laughter which followed the reading of one clause in
 the indictment        "             collectors in coloured bags."
                    :    offertory
 After this little more    was heard     of the Erith " ritualism,"
 and the constantly increasing           congregation testified to
 the   favour with which          the    services    were  generally
 regarded.
     During the whole of the eleven years which elapsed
 between his arrival at Belvedere and the death of Arch
 deacon Smith, my father rendered his services gratui
 tously, with two exceptions         :  the first for a period     of
 some    six months, during the prolonged absence             of the
 vicar,   who left him in sole charge             ;  the second — in
 1869-70    — for    the space    of   a year,     while the   vicar,
owing to heavy family affliction, was travelling abroad.
     On December 23th, 1873. Archdeacon Smith died,
after only two days' serious illness         ;  and my father was
again left in sole charge until the appointment of his
successor.       With    this gentleman, unfortunately, he
found it quite impossible to work, and their views
indeed     differed   so  radically and        completely that he
 ceased even to attend the parish church, and migrated
to a temporary district church which had lately been
erected in another part of the town.             Here he occasion
ally officiated ;   but his regular clerical work had come
to an end for ever.
     To the end of his life, however, he constantly exer-

cised his ministerial functions.                                While living       at Nor
wood — from 1878 to 1885 —he frequently assisted the
clergy of S. Philip's Church, Sydenham, and afterwards
was      always            ready to take Sunday duty                         to relieve     a
brother cleric, and to give up his well-earned rest in
order that he might, in some degree, lighten the labours
of others.             It was a common thing with him, while
absent upon his lecturing tours, to preach for a friend
upon the Sunday, wherever                              he might          happen      to be.
And as his sermons always cost him a vast amount
of care and anxiety, and, moreover, exhausted him very
considerably, the sacrifice upon his part, when consenting
to do so, was of no inconsiderable                              character.
      His      style of preaching                   was peculiarly his own, and
his sermons themselves were never like those of anybody
else.      During the earlier part of his clerical life, he
always read from a manuscript                             ;   but afterwards, gaining
confidence by experience,                       , he relinquished the practice
altogether, and trusted merely to the scantiest of notes.
      I give        here the outline of one of his later sermons,
exactly quoted from his notes                         ;    first, however, premising
that those notes are utterly incomprehensible                                   to myself:

 32                THE REV. J.   G.  WOOD.
     This is quite a fair specimen of the average style of
his notes, which were generally written out in small
handwriting upon half a half-sheet of note-paper, and
upon which alone he depended as an aid to his memory
while in the pulpit.       How he even contrived to read
them is a mystery, for he was very short-sighted, and
could scarcely see at all without the aid of spectacles ;
how he managed to make anything of them when
he did read them is a greater mystery still.      But every
single  word in those brief jottings suggested some
chain of ideas to his mind, which he had, of course,
carefully thought out before, and which a "key
word," so to speak, would instantly bring before him
again.
     He was always very nervous in beginning      a sermon ;
and generally the first few sentences, carefully prepared
beforehand, were a little laboured and heavy.      But then
by degrees he would quite forget himself, and become
wholly carried away by his subject ; and the remainder
of the sermon was always most instructive and striking.
He well understood the use of those sudden, startling
sayings which keep the attention of a congregation
fixed, and cause them to hang on the lips of the preacher
with   a sort  of breathless  interest.    I remember   one
occasion, for instance,   in which he had been treating
of the various phases of modern infidelity, especially as
shown in the atheistical writings of a certain well-known
platform orator; and his subject had led him to the
question of the existence of the soul.       "If," he said,
" that man were to confront    me, and to ask me   whether

                    STYLE OF PREACHING.                               33
or not   I thought     that I possessed a     soul,  I  think that I
should astonish him not a little by my answer.                   For if
that question were put to me,            I  should say, No." Of
course there was absolute            silence in  all parts of the
church. Every eye was fixed upon the preacher who
 could give vent to such an appalling doctrine ; every ear
was eagerly       waiting    for the next words        ;  the clergy
 in the chancel stalls were obviously most uncomfortable,
and wondering whether or not such a statement ought
to be permitted to pass unchallenged.                Then he went
on with his sentence.          " Man has no soul.        Man      has a
body   ;  man is a soul."
     It  was always a source of great regret to my father
that the bonds of custom prevented him from using
a black-board while preaching.             He said that he could
make himself understood so very much better                if only   he
could illustrate his remarks           with coloured chalks now
and then as he proceeded, just as he did in his sketch
lectures.      He also longed at times to         be able to      hang
up a map, and to have the pulpit formed rather after the
fashion     of a platform, so that he might walk up and
down while delivering his sermon.              Yet   he was    always
one   of the quietest of preachers, generally             abstaining
from even the       slightest of gestures         from    beginning
to   end     of his sermon,       standing perfectly       still, and
seldom even raising his voice.              He never ranted        ; he
never    declaimed   ;  he  never gave       way    to impassioned
bursts of oratory.       Just    as in his lectures, he    was   plain
and simple throughout        ;  the charm lay in the freshness
of thought, the aptness of illustration, and the novelty
          i)

which somehow he contrived                 to impart to       the most
familiar passages of Scripture.
                                                                       "
      He was, perhaps, especially happy in the " Flower
sermons which have so much come into fashion                     of late
years   ;  every member of the congregation being expected
to bring an offering of flowers, which, after being pre
sented at the altar, is sent off for the adornment of some
hospital. His favourite text upon these occasions was
Isaiah xl. 6, 7, 8.            I  quote the following from an
account of one of these sermons preached at St. George's
Church, Ramsgate, on August 2nd, 1885                  : —
     The presentations having been completed, the Rev. J. G. Wood,
eminent as a naturalist, delivered a brief discourse appropriate to
the occasion.     Selecting his text from Isaiah xl. 6, and the two
following verses, the preacher first of all reminded his hearers of
the beauty and perfume of flowers : God had filled the world with
beauty, showing them that beauty was a part of the Divine Nature,
so that they were bound in their little way to imitate God as well
as they could.     And they had no excuse for not making the services
which they rendered to Him as beautiful as possible ; for not giving
Him their very      best, whatever that best might be.      It was right
that they should fill their churches with beauty as far as they could,
and so give back to God something of those mercies which He had
showered     upon   them.    Commenting    on  the   words,  " The grass
 withereth, the flower fadeth, because the   Spirit of the Lord bloweth
 upon it," he said that they must remember that the Spirit which
 blew death into the flower was the same Spirit as that which
 breathed   into it the breath of life.   Then they must not forget that
 there was diversity of flowers    ; they saw all kinds of flowers, and
 yet the same Spirit had breathed the life into them all.     Again they
 must remember       that although the Spirit was the same, the means
 which were employed in clothing that Spirit in bodily form were not
 the same.     This fact struck him very forcibly some weeks ago, when
 travelling from the Isle of Thanet to Manchester ; he could not but

                         A "FLOWER SERlfON."                                     35
notice   the extreme diversity of the flowers          and plants in varying
atmospheres     and soils.      Successful   gardeners    took the    trouble to
find out the soil which suited a plant best, and were careful            to keep
it  supplied with that soil.      They must      also remember     that flowers
are not isolated.     Why, it took all the laws of Nature put together
to make one flower.        It  took all the laws of chemistry to begin with
— such     chemistry  as    the  mind of man had scarcely dreamed of.
 Flowers even that grew in the same ground had great diversity
among them.        And what was the cause of that 1           It was the result
of the extraordinary chemical powers of Nature, brought into
beautiful form by a science which man had never been able to
discover, and never would discover.           The science was the breath of
life which God had breathed into them. It took all the laws of
light to clothe the flowers in their beautiful colours ; and not only so,
 but every ray of light from, the sun to the flower rutin a band that tied
that flower to the sun, and thus to (lie whole of the universe.               The
¦smallest daisy of the field was not isolated, but was a necessary unit
of the universe. Again, flowers had their work to do in the time
 given them, and they were useless unless they developed into the
 fruit of the future.
      Having thus spoken of the flowers, the preacher endeavoured
 to apply the truths thus drawn out.           Children were the flowers of
            —
 humanity they       were  in  the  early stage of growth — and people were
apt to look on them     as they often looked on flowers, simply        as  pretty,
 engaging toys ; and hence the number of what were called
                                                                         " spoiled
children."- Let them look on children as the men and women of the
 future, and remember that the responsibility rested with them as to
 what kind of men and women they would ultimately become.                     The
 flower faded because the Spirit of the Lord had blown upon it.
 How often did they say to themselves : " 0 that the flowers would
                                                            "
 not fade ! O that children would remain children !            And how foolish
 they were ! Only a few weeks ago' the Kentish orchards were full of
 beautiful flowers, and they could but regret that the Spirit of the
 Lord blew upon those flowers, and caused them to fall and die.               But
 they  left  their fruit behind    them,  and   so   performed    the   work    for
 which they were sent into the world. So with children. The Spirit
of the Lord blew upon them : the time was coming when they would
 put away childish things, and they, as parents, could not but feel
            D  2

36                     THE REV. J.        G.  WOOD.
regret, for they missed the merry        patter  of childish feet, and the
hearty childish laugh. But although the child ceased to be a child —
ceased to be a blossom — and even though the petals fell away, the
plant did not die, and the individuality of the child did not cease.
And why ? Because " the word of our God shall stand for ever "—
that word which equally breathed the spirit of life into the plant
and into the child.       See here the   responsibility of parents. They
were not to Took on children as pretty playthings for the time
being, but should try to instil into their hearts the word of God, so
that, although the flower should fade, the word of the Lord should
stand for ever.   The responsibility was great, and they all had it to
some extent.     Even children had it to each other, and those who
were older much more than children ; and they would fail if they
forgot it.  The little child, of course, could feel none ; but when
                                                            I
children grew older they began to think — What shall do in the life
before me ? Later on, when they got into active life, the idea in their
minds, supposing them to be conscientious,       was — What am       I doing
now  1   Am  I doing  the work which God has given me to do        ?   When
they passed   into old  age, then they asked    themselves,  What have     I
done 1— and in all these      cases there was   a spirit of responsibility.
They could not but feel, when young,         that  they should fail ; when
older, that they were failing ; and in old age, that they had failed.
And what of that t They were all human beings ; who was there
who had not failed t        But suppose they learned this lesson — that
God had breathed into them the breath of life — and acted up to the
responsibility which that entailed ; then they would know that their
work would never fail and could never fail, because " the word of
the Lord shall stand for ever."
      This abstract is fairly complete and accurate ; and
 yet it gives little true idea of the sermon.                 Its telling*
 force depended so much upon the personal magnetism
 of the preacher        ;  and no pen can transfer to paper the
 deep earnestness        which made it what it was.
      My father       always      used    to complain       that lie was
terribly nervous when preaching,                but no one who did

                      VOICE AND DELIVERY.                    37
not   know      him very intimately indeed would have
imagined for a moment that such was the case. So,
too, in his lecturing, with regard to which he made
a   similar    complaint.     But  I  do  not think that his
nervousness      ever lasted very long.     His first  few sen
tences were generally a little stiff and formal, and had
obviously been carefully thought out and formed before
the sermon began.           But then, as he warmed to his
subject,    these    traces   of formality would altogether
disappear    ;  and    I  do not think that he was ever
nervous    after that.
     His delivery      was never very good.     His   voice was
naturally rather throaty and husky, and at no time was
it  ever really strong.      And yet he had the great faculty
of making himself plainly heard, even in the most dis
 tant recesses of the largest building. Even when stand
ing on the steps leading from the nave into the choir of
Canterbury Cathedral, as he had to do when conducting
 the rehearsals of the great choral festivals, and issuing
his orders to the choristers, who were but just entering
from the cloisters, those orders were distinctly heard.
 Probably this was owing to the fact that he took such
 remarkable pains with the due enunciation of his words.
     He had at one time stammered terribly, and although
 he had undergone        a course of treatment, and had been
 almost completely cured, there were certain words which
 he could never utter without         great  and obvious diffi
 culty ; and he was even at times compelled        to exchange
 these for others, from pure inability to pronounce them.
 Therefore,    I think,  he was the more careful with all his

words   ;  and certainly even   his most   distant auditors
could always hear him quite easily and distinctly.
     My father's last sermon was preached at Edenbridge,
Kent, on February 17th, 1889, when he selected 1 Cor.
ix. 9 as his text.    Usually he placed the notes of his
sermon in his pocket     Greek Testament after delivering
it ;  but as this sermon was preached after he had left
home for the last time,     I  am unable to find the brief
outline which he almost certainly wrote. And probably
it was accidentally destroyed with other private papers.
     Connected with my father's clerical labours, although
not of them, was the work which he did in furtherance
of the objects of the " Funeral Keform Association."
He was himself a strong advocate of cremation, which,
as he used to say,  only brings about in a couple of hours
the identical result which burial causes in a number of
years.    Sooner or later the body must be dissolved into
gases, and he  himself preferred that this should be done
by a process which involves no injury to the living, and
does away with some of the most repulsive circumstances
associated in the popular mind with death.       Cremation,
however, not being advocated by the Association, which
aims principally    at the simplification  of funeral cere
monies, and the speedy and true restoration of "earth
to earth, dust to dust," he set himself diligently to work
to   further their aims   ; repeatedly  speaking   at their
public meetings, organising such a meeting at our own
house at St. Peter's, and losing no opportunity of en
forcing their arguments both in sermon and in private

          THE "FUNERAL REFORM ASSOCIATION."                  39
                  "
conversation.        Mourning," whether taking the form of
black clothing, black-edged letter-paper, or the outward
indications of woe which are usually so prominent at
the modern funeral,       was absolutely abhorrent to him.
He    could feel the loss of a friend deeply     ; but on re
ligious, as well as upon other grounds, would never
show his sorrow in the orthodox manner.            And, long
before he joined the Association at all, he wrote          out
careful   directions for his own funeral,       whenever     it
should come    ;  expressing  the very strongest desire that
everything connected with it should be of the plainest
possible description, that no lead coffin should on any
account be used, and that no mourning should be worn
for him by the members of his family.
     This was a subject upon which he undoubtedly felt
very strongly.      It seemed so plainly evident to him
that the    more    extravagant    forms  of mourning were
utterly opposed to the spirit of the Christian religion —
deeds giving the lie to words ; and that the ordinary
system of burial is merely a vain and reasonless attempt
to delay that which is inevitable in the end.          He re
cognised   the   sanitary side of the question, too, and
urged the mischief often caused to the living by the
unsatisfactory and illogical disposal of the dead.        And
so, as a question     of religion,   as well as one of plain
common-sense,      he did all that lay in his power to
further the objects      of the Association, and    to   enlist
others in the cause.
     Had his time permitted him, he would,           I  think,
have taken    up the question     even more  enthusiastically

 40                THE REV. J.   G. WOOD.
than he did.     There was nothing that he enjoyed more
than working up some subject upon which the public iu
general needed enlightenment, obtaining all possible
information upon the matter, and then imparting the
results of his inquiry to others.   And he was so deeply
interested in funeral reform that he would have thrown
his whole   heart into the work, and have done his very
best to bring that reform about.

In  the year 1867 the             choir of Erith Parish              Church,
which had then been for three years under my father's
management and tuition, was at its best.                          There was
one point in which             it  was     almost      unique.       All  the
adult voices were those of gentlemen, and the result
was a refinement in the style of singing quite beyond
the attainment of the ordinary village choir.                      Then the
constant practices ; the minute attention paid to every
detail of the service ; and, above all, the regular anthem-
singing on Sunday evenings : all these had contributed
to raise the choir to an unusually high pitch of excel
lence, and to render the church an attraction to visitors
for miles around.
     In   the    early summer of this year a dedication
festival was held at the parish church of Northfleet,

42                   THE REV. J.    G,  WOOD.
and both my father and his vicar were           invited to take
part.     The preacher      at the     service  was the   Right
Reverend      Bishop H.    L.   Jenner, who had lately been
consecrated      to the See of Dunedin, but had not yet
left England for his diocese.        With him my father at
once struck up a friendship, which afterwards ripened
into intimacy ; and Archdeacon Smith was so delighted
with both the service and the sermon that he then and
there resolved that a Dedication Festival should without
delay be held in his own church at Erith, and that the
 Bishop,   if  possible, should again be the preacher.      The
Bishop, on being asked, at once consented, and in the
following August the festival was duly held.
     The music upon this occasion seems to have been
unusually good, and the Bishop himself was very much
surprised to learn that the very existence of the choir,
as  well as its excellence, was due to my father's labours.
 He was himself at that time the Precentor of the
Canterbury Diocesan Choral Union, which held annual
festivals — always     on  the   Tuesday following Trinity
 Sunday — in the       magnificent cathedral of the arch
diocese ; and to this he made a passing reference when
speaking at the luncheon which followed the Dedication
 Festival.     There was one subject, he said, upon which
 he —the      Bishop — would like to say a few words.
 He had ever regarded         as a pet    child the Canterbury
 Diocesan     Choral Union,     and in order to promote its
 success he had,    with his colleague, always       endeavoured
 to   extend    its workings throughout the county. He
 had even proposed to himself visiting every district,

               THE CANTERBURY CHORAL UNION.                           43
if    possible,     with   a   view     to   establishing     branches.
Other       duties,    however,      had     intervened     which   had
prevented         him from   carrying out this idea in its
completeness.           He hoped that his remarks on this
occasion    would have the effect of inducing many of
the    parishioners of Erith to join this Choral Union,
which could not fail to produce good results in per
fecting the service of song in the house of the Lord.
Then, after touching upon one or two incidental topics,
he concluded his remarks by saying that there were very
few country churches           indeed      in which would be found
musical services conducted as they were at Erith.
      Now, of course, the Bishop's rapidly approaching               de
parture for his distant diocese involved the resignation
of his post as Precentor of the Choral Union ; and he
was at this time searching for some duly qualified man
who might succeed him. The vacant post, it is true,
was temporarily filled, but the holder was very anxious
to resign     it,   and had, indeed, signified his intention of
doing so after the following festival. And so the idea
occurred to the Bishop that,   my father could produce
                                      if
such   a   service in such     a   parish, he would surely be the
right man to occupy the vacant position.                      Quite un
expectedly, therefore, he one day paid us           a   visit, and, with
the full concurrence of the cathedral              authorities, asked
him to take up the work which he himself had been
obliged to relinquish. My father, after due considera
tion, consented.   And so, in 1868, he found himself
responsible at the cathedral  for the greatest service of
all the year, with the musical department resting upon

U                   THE REV. J.   G.  WOOD.
him, and him alone.       In  other words, he had to select
the music, arrange the order of service, communicate
with all the choirs in the diocese, and then travel from
one to the other      for the space of eight or nine con
secutive weeks, in order that each might receive the
benefit of his own personal instruction.        Then all the
necessary arrangements had to be made at the cathedral,
the order of service appointed,      and the final rehearsals
held in the Chapter House ; so that, before the festival
could be held, nearly three months had of necessity to
be  given up to the settlement of preliminaries, while an
amount of labour was involved which very few already
busy men would not gladly have avoided.
     This, however, was by no means all, for, long before
the first practice   could be held, the festival book had
to be compiled, and seen through the press.               And
this alone was an undertaking involving no little
time and trouble. The music for two full services had
first of all to be selected, with the requirements of the
cathedral authorities, the choirs taking part, and the
service itself kept well in view.       Perhaps some special
chants or hymns had to be procured, and arrangements
made    with composers.        Then     the  organist   of the
cathedral    had  to be consulted,     and  perhaps   also the
precentors    of some    of the   principal choirs of the
diocese.      Then,   when   all this preliminary business
was    over, the   book   had   to undergo    the  process of
examination and revision        by the Dean and Chapter.
     Generally, that body took exception to some part
or parts of the book. Then came a wordy warfare

             FIGHTING A DEAN AND CHAPTER.                    45
through the medium of the post, usually carried on
with a good deal of spirit, but resulting generally in
concessions on both sides.         After his first experience,
I may here mention,       my father used purposely to make
an insertion or two which he himself had no desire
whatever to uphold, and which he knew perfectly well
would never be allowed to remain by the Chapter.
That august body, however, usually remained content
with the assertion of their power shown in striking out
the objectionable passages, and allowed all that my
father really wished for to remain unchallenged.          And
so  all parties were satisfied.
     Then, after the book was printed and published,
arrangements had to be made with every choir which
was to take part in the festival for a private practice by
the precentor    himself   ; necessitating   a vast amount   ot
correspondence, and the expenditure         of much time and
 ingenuity in making the different fixtures work in with
 one another.     A good deal of expense would also have
been   involved, but this was in great part obviated by
 the liberality of the South Eastern and London, Chat
 ham, and Dover Railway Companies, who furnished the
 precentor    with  a   free  pass  over the    whole of  their
 respective systems during the two months over which
 the preliminary    practices    extended.
     But the mere necessary work attending the pro
 duction    of  the   festivals  was   sufficient to appal  an
 already busy man, far more so one whose time was so
 greatly   occupied as was that of my father.         But he,
  nevertheless, went to work with his accustomed        energy

46                  THE EEV. J.   G.  WOOD.
and enthusiasm, and at once set himself to raise the
standard    both of the music and of the actual service
itself.
    There was plenty of room for improvement in both.
In  1868 my father attended the festival, and was much
shocked    to   see the slovenly,   and even irreverent,    be
haviour of those who, of all men, should have known
better.    Walking up the centre of the choir of the
cathedral itself might be seen clergy, arrayed in full
canonicals, carrying an ordinary tall hat in one hand,
and with a gaily dressed lady on either arm.        The alms
at the festival service itself, instead of being presented
at the altar, were     deliberately   and openty    placed   in
a hat, and so carried off to the   Chapter House.      And all
else was conducted on similar principles.
    The combined choirs, again, numbered but some four
hundred voices — a meagre show from a diocese compre
hending more than as many parishes.          And, finally, the
festival service itself was of the most ordinary type ;
scarcely, in fact, superior   to that which one may now
hear    upon   every day   in the week in almost every
cathedral in England.
    All   this my father set himself to reform       ; but, of
course, he had to go to work carefully, and to do what
he wished to do by slow degrees.       Cathedral corporations
are proverbially conservative and difficult to move ; and
argument, entreaty, sarcasm, invective, and bitter scorn
were all freely employed      without bringing about very
much in the way of results.       Perseverance and patience
did their work, however,        and    after a time    one or

          ARRANGING     FOR A PROCESSIONAL HYMN.                47
two     members    of the Chapter suffered themselves to
be persuaded, and even took up the cudgels upon my
father's side ; and, although the warfare regularly broke
out year after year when the approaching festival came
up for consideration,        most of the points for which
he contended were ultimately conceded.
      In   the first festival which he conducted       — that  of
 18G9   — he    managed     to  secure    a  great  accession  of
reverence from all concerned       ;   and in that year, for the
 first time, the alms were duly and properly offered upon
the altar by the present Bishop of Dover, who officiated.
      His next   step was to arrange for a processional hymn
 — an undertaking in which             he  met  with   great  op
 position. Hitherto the surpliced portion of the choir,
 after robing in the Chapter House, had straggled hur
 riedly into the choir, mutely and untidily, and a great
 and impressive     effect had been allowed to slip.         Now
 my father wished for a systematic           procession, singing
 some good and solid processional hymn.
       His chief difficulty in arranging for this lay in      the
  attitude of the Dean (Dr. Alford), who, for a long time,
 could not be brought to see that ordinary decorum
 required an orderly procession, while such a procession
  was   hardly possible    unless  it   were permitted to    sing
  upon the march.       Neither would he agree for a while
  that the impressiveness of the effect was at all a thing
  to be desired.     By dint of much perseverance, however,
  my father carried      his point   ;   and then  incontinently
  followed up his victory by suggesting that the Dean
  himself should write a processional hymn for the occa

48                 THE REV. J.   G. WOOD.
sion, and compose the music also     !    The Dean, at first,
was a little overcome     by the audacity of the proposal,
but finally consented  ; and shortly afterwards my father
received a very admirable     hymn, with the Dean's com
pliments.   This, however, good as it was, was by no
means the kind of hymn which he wanted ; and so he
wrote off again to the Dean, pointing out that the
hymn, while excellent in its way, was not at all adapted
to be sung upon the march.        Would    he kindly go into
his cathedral, walk slowly along the course which the
procession would take, and compose another hymn as he
did so ?
     The good old Dean was not in the least offended by
the unhesitating rejection of his work, and did as he was
bid; and the result was that grand hymn beginning
"Forward be our watchword," which, consisting of eight
                                               "
twelve-line verses, has since been added to Hymns An
cient and Modern,-' though set to different music.      The
manuscript   reached my father with a humorous little
note to the effect that the Dean had written the hymn
and put it into its hat and boots      ; and that my father
might add the coat and trousers for himself. On look
ing at the music, he found, accordingly, that only the
treble and bass had been supplied         by the composer ;
and, fearing to employ his own imperfect knowledge         of
harmony in the attempt to supply the omission, he put
the matter into the hands of Mrs. J. Worthington Bliss
 (Miss Lindsay), who kindly added what was necessary.
     The effect of the hymn, when sung by the vast
body   of choristers,  was almost   overwhelming.      From

           ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PROCESSION.                49
the time when the leaders of the procession emerged
from the cloisters into the north aisle to that in which the
last of the long stream ascended the steps of the choir,
nearly half-an-hour elapsed. And throughout the whole
of this time the glorious strains of Dean Alford's hymn
were taken up again and again by fresh bodies of voices,
each pair of choristers    joining in the chorus     as they
reached a specified spot, and ceasing as they set foot on
the last step of the ascent to the choir, and passed under
the screen to their seats within.       The effect of such a
 hymn, sung by such a body of voices in such a building
 as the grand old Cathedral of Canterbury, was utterly
 beyond the power of words to describe.           Scarcely a
 member of the congregation     but was visibly moved, and
                                   "
 long before the last of the five     brigades," into which
 the choristers were divided, had entered the choir, it was
 felt that no such festival had      ever before been held
within the walls of the stately Norman building.'
      Of course this magnificent result was not obtained
 without an infinity of preliminary labour.        And even
 the arrangements    for the procession itself were exceed
 ingly complicated.     The original four hundred voices
 had now risen to more than a thousand, a very large
 proportion of which belonged to surpliced choristers.
 All these had to be so arranged that throughout the
  procession the due balance of the parts     might be pre
  served ;  and at the same time some plan had to be
  devised, by means of which no member of the procession
  might at any moment be out of sight of the precentor's
  baton.

50                  THE REV. J.    G. WOOD.
     The first of these difficulties was overcome by the
division of the choir into the five "brigades" before re
ferred to, each being constituted as a single     choir, with
the various parts in their proper balance.       The second
requirement was more difficult to fulfil, for there was no
one spot in the entire nave where a conductor        could be
simultaneously seen by the whole of the           procession.
After much thought and experiment, therefore, it was
determined that, during the processional hymn, my father
should be assisted by three lieutenants, each armed with
a baton, whose duty it should be exactly to imitate his
beat.    He himself stood at the top of the choir-steps,
while they were so posted that each could see him, and
also that one of the four, at least, was visible from every
part of the course which the procession was to traverse.
And so the difficult question of time was settled.
     As the last part of the last brigade set foot upon
the steps leading to the choir the hymn was hushed,
and they passed to their seats in silence.     And then,   as
the precentor     ascended his conductor's    dais near the
lectern,   the  whole   choir,   surpliced and unsurpliced,
broke out with one grand burst into the jubilant last
verse, which was sung with full organ accompaniment.
     In  this year, for the first time, in view of the great
strain upon the voices by the long service in the
cathedral, and the preliminary practice      in the Chapter
 House, the morning service was given up, and an after
noon service only held, beginning at four o'clock. Early
in the day, however, there had been a choral celebration
of the Holy Communion in St. Margarets Church, the

           REHEARSAL IN THE CHAPTER HOUSE.                   51
preparations necessary for the afternoon service prevent
ing it from being held in the cathedral itself.
     The preliminary practice in the Chapter House — the
processional hymn itself being of course rehearsed in
situ   and on the march — occupied nearly two hours, and
obtained the honour of a special notice in one of the
                                   " There can be no doubt,"
leading musical newspapers.
 writes the critic, " that, merely as a singing lesson, the
practice in the Chapter House at Canterbury, under the
auspices of Mr. Wood and Mr.          Longhurst, was of un
told advantage to the choirs.       It was amusing to notice
the astonishment of some of the rustics at finding out
 the real meaning of a   '
                           rest,' and their evident  satisfac
tion at the effect of the responses when sung with the
proper pauses. It was clearly a new experience, a real
revelation, to some of them.       In like manner it is im
possible to doubt that many        young women were cured
for good of their odious trick of ' slurring ' one note
into another by Mr. "Wood's clever caricature of them,
which made the Chapter House ring with laughter."
     At one o'clock the assembled choristers were dis
missed, to fortify the inner man against the fatigue of
the afternoon   ;  and at three o'clock the surpliced con
tingent again repaired to the Chapter House, in order
to vest, while the remainder were ushered at once to
their seats in the choir.
     Towards the end of the festival service in this year a
most striking incident occurred.        The day had been a
very dull and cloudy one, and, although no rain had
fallen, the sun had     never for a moment     been   visible.
         e 2

52                  THE RET. J.   G. WOOD.
The second of the two offertory hymns was that beginning
" Saviour,
            blessed Saviour," and at the commencement
of the sixth verse,                      "           still and
                     just  as the words,   Brighter
brighter glows the western sun," were being sung, the
sun broke out for a moment from behind the clouds,
pouring through the great stained windows upon the
mass of white-robed choristers, and flooding the choir
with light.    It  was only for a moment    ;  but the effect,
coming just at that particular moment, and while those
particular words were being sung, was striking and im
pressive in the extreme     ; and no one. who was present is
 ever likely to forget it.
     For the first time in the history of these festivals,
no sermon was preached upon this occasion, an omission
which provoked some amount of adverse criticism in the
press.   But circumstances had so altered from those
of previous years that the change was rendered abso
lutely essential.    When the choristers engaged only
numbered three or four hundred in all, and the congre
gation together with the singers could easily be accom
modated in the choir, a short address was right and
proper   enough   ; and Dean Alford, who was generally
the preacher,    had   a peculiar knack of saying the right
thing in just the right manner, while his clear pene
trating voice was easily heard by all.        But when the
number of choristers        was  nearly trebled,   and  every
corner   of the choir was occupied by those who were
actually taking part in the service, some two thousand
people had to be accommodated with seats in the nave ;
and how was it possible that they should hear a sermon

         INTRODUCTION OF BRASS INSTRUMENTS.               S3
preached in the choir ?     The omission     of the sermon,
in fact,   was an obvious     necessity,  not a mere whim
upon the part of either the precentor       or the cathedral
authorities, as some of the critics seemed to suppose.
    Two years later my father managed to introduce
another improvement      into the festival, in the shape of
brass instruments.    These, however, were only employed
during the processional     hymn, and consisted of four
cornets, the performers upon which led the procession,
and,   on   reaching the choir-steps, stood aside, still
playing as before, and allowed the long stream of singers
to pass between them.          Then they too entered the
choir, laid aside their instruments, and joined in the
choral music as ordinary singers.        The chief object of
the innovation was to support the voices, and to help in
maintaining them at the proper pitch. In former years
they had shown a tendency to become distressingly flat,
as was perhaps only natural in a hymn of such length ;
and once, after   beginning in the key of Gr, the proces
sional was finished in that of F. This tendency the use
of the cornets entirely obviated; and the hymn went
better than ever before.     In  this year the choir num
bered no less than     twelve hundred voices, and the
proportion of surplices had considerably increased.
     In 1875 my father conducted the festival for the
last time.    He  was beginning to find that he could no
longer manage to give up the two months necessary for
the preliminary practice, or afford the expense which, in
spite  of the liberality   of the two railway companies,
naturally attended the incessant travelling from place to

54                    THE REV. J.    G.  WOOD.
 place  ;  and he therefore reluctantly sent in his resigna
 tion, which. was    as  reluctantly accepted.
     He had done much in his seven years of office.             He
had secured at least outward reverence before, during,
and    after the    service.     He had raised the general
standard of the music.         He had greatly improved the
performance       of that music.       He had introduced the
processional hymn, and the brass instruments.             He had
brought up the numbers of the choir from four hundred
to three times that number.           And, incidentally, he had
raised the tone of choral music throughout the diocese,
and indirectly      facilitated   its introduction    in parishes
where     it had never been known before.        In relinquishing
his baton, therefore, he could feel that he had done his
work   ;   but  I  am   sure   that   he   deeply  regretted   the
necessity of doing so, and that he would have been only

The first idea of taking up literary work                     as  at least a
supplementary         profession appears to have occurred to my
father some time during the year 1S50. At that time,
having given up his tutorship at Hinton, he was re
siding in Oxford, and occupying himself partly in the
tuition of a private pupil — with whom he afterwards
paid two short visits of a few weeks each to France —
partly in studying comparative anatomy under Doctor —
now Sir Henry — Acland, the Regius Professor, and
partly in reading for Holy Orders.                      Probably he felt
 that it would be well,                if   possible,     to   obtain some
 pecuniary profit          from the work in which he was so
 much absorbed ;           and his rapidly increasing familiarity
 with the wonders of the animal kingdom gave him good
 ground to suppose that he could produce a book which
 would at least be accurate             as   far as the subject-matter

56                    THE REV. J.      G.   WOOD.
was concerned, and which might very possibly help to
instruct the public upon a branch of science of which
mankind in general then knew very little.
    For in those days the book of Nature was practically
a sealed volume       to all but the few who were able and
willing to undergo     long apprenticeship before they
                         a
could   become acquainted with its marvels and its
mysteries.      It   had been made           a    hard,    dry science,
teeming      with     technicalities        and     incomprehensible
phraseology,    and    sesquipedalian       and often unmeaning
nomenclature.   Classification was regarded far more
highly than the study of habits and life-histories, and
animals were looked upon, in fact, rather as cleverly
constructed machines         than as living beings made from
the same     clay as man        himself.          And consequently
Natural History had come to                 be    associated in the
popular mind with all that was uninteresting and
repellent, and the wonder-world of Nature, only need
ing the easily applied key of Interest to open was as         it,
yet almost wholly unknown.
    So my father set himself to write               a     small Natural
History for the general reader, in which technicalities
and  scientific phraseology should be either set aside
altogether, or at least, when necessity compelled their
adoption, be carefully and simply explained.       From
this principle, in fact, he never swerved throughout the
whole of his literary career. Thoroughly familiar him
self with the rules of classification, and perfectly at
home in the tongue not
                               " understanded of the
                                                     people,"
which was then almost invariably adopted                     by   writers

              THE FIRST "NATURAL HISTORY."                  57
upon Natural History, lie could yet thoroughly appreciate
the manifold difficulties which they presented to others,
and especially to such as were but just entering upon
the first rudiments of the science.     And   so he resolved,
as  far as his own writings were concerned, to use only
simple and plainly intelligible language, which, with no
parade of learning, should yet convey accurate know
ledge upon the subject        of which it treated.     And   I
do not think that in        any of  his books    or magazine
articles there is one single sentence which could not
easily be understood.
     The book appeared in 1851, under the auspices of
Messrs. Routledge & Co., and met with a sale which,
if  not phenomenal in its character, amply justified both
author and publisher in undertaking further ventures.
The first step towards popularising Natural History had
been taken, and the public had responded,         if not with
ardour, at any rate with warmth.            And my father
began to feel that a literary career was before him, and
a definite  line of work laid down.
     For   some time    after the   production of his first
volume,    however,   he   was prevented   by the force     of
circumstances    from following up his success.     His pupil
naturally took up much of his time; his anatomical
studies, which of course he could not regulate to suit
his own individual    desires, occupied still more   ; and to
the preparation     for his Ordination,    which was now
drawing near, he was obliged to devote several hours
of daily labour.    And all that he could do for a while
was  to collect   material, and to write a few lines when

58                 THE HEV. J.    G. WOOD.
ever he could contrive to find a little leisure-time.    Yet
he managed     to  translate   from the French Alphonse
Karr's charming "Tour         Round my Garden," and to
bring it out with divers editorial notes.       This was in
1852, in June of which year came his Ordination ;
and then for two years he was busier than ever.         The
work of the parish took up almost the whole of his
time;    every  hour of    every day had its own special
duties assigned to it.    And literature had, of course, to
go to the wall.
     In the following    year, however,   appeared the first
volume    of " Anecdotes     of Animal Life," which had
been written    mainly    before his Ordination,   and com
pleted in odds and ends of spare time afterwards.       The
title of the work explains itself,    as  far as its general
idea is concerned   ; but, so far from being in any way
comprehensive    in its scope, it was limited to some eight
or nine animals only, which were treated at consider
able length, in anecdotal manner,        and discussed  most
thoroughly from different points of view.           In 1S56
appeared the second volume of the same work, in which
the same    system was adopted       with another   group of
animals, both volumes meeting with a very fair measure
of success.   The two have since been published together
under the less happy title of " Animal Traits and
Characteristics."
     His next literary work     was the editing of " Every
Boy's Book," for Messrs. Boutledge & Co., a task for
which his own skill in almost all outdoor and indoor
sports eminently fitted him.       And then —in 1854 — he

                   ¦¦'MY  FEATHERED FRIENDS.                       5t*
 began    to    find, as    shown     in the preceding chapter,
 that the arduous and poorly paid parish work must be
 given up for a time, and literature be regarded awhile
 as the  crutch instead of as the staff.
                                             "
     The perennial " Bird Question             was   now occupying
 his thoughts a good deal, and though he seldom, during
 his career as an author, approached Natural History
 from its economic side, he began industriously to collect
 information respecting the influence of birds on agri
 culture and horticulture, by way of supplement to his
 own   experiences      of very nearly twenty years. As a
result of this study, he found himself able to champion
the cause of the birds, and, towards the end of 1850,
"                                "
   My Feathered Friends             embodied the result of his
investigations, and pointed out the extreme value of
the smaller birds alike to gardener and farmer.              Black
birds and thrushes, it was shown, although they eat a
certain amount of garden fruit, amply atone for their
occasional    mischief by the vast amount of snails and
noxious insects which they destroy.                  Some of the
finches are fond of corn ; but then, on the other hand,
they feed themselves partially, and their young entirely,
with some of the most troublesome and mischievous of
all the farmer's        foes.   And     so,  though undoubtedly
injurious    at    one    season    of   the   year,   they are as
undoubtedly beneficial at another.               The rook steals
walnuts and potatoes, and also visits the corn-stacks
at times  ;  but then the benefit           which the same      bird
confers upon the farmer by the wholesale                slaughter of
wire-worms        and   other    root-feeding grubs is       simply

  60                   THE REV. J.   G. WOOD.
  incalculable.     The kestrels and the owls, in spite of the
'
  accusations    so  freely brought against them      by game
  keepers and owners of poultry, are altogether invaluable
  benefactors, and alone prevent the produce of our
  fields from being entirely destroyed by mice.             And
  even the much-vilified       sparrow   is not altogether so
  black as he is painted, but undoubtedly possesses         more
  than the one redeeming virtue to qualify his thousand
  crimes.     Such was the teaching of " My Feathered
  Friends."
       In  the following year — 1857 — Messrs. Routledge &
  Co., who had conceived the idea of publishing a series
  of shilling Handbooks on Natural History and kindred
  topics, requested my father to undertake one at least of
  the volumes     ; and he, therefore, set busily to work upon
  " Common
                Objects of the Sea-shore."       The book was
  not a large one, and the actual writing was a matter of
  only a few weeks ; but, as he did not care to describe
  any animal with which he was not thoroughly familiar,
  the preliminary investigations occupied some little time,
  and the small sum which he received for the          copyright
  was certainly thoroughly earned.
       The book appeared towards the end of 1857, and
  met with an immediate            and marked      success,  the
  publishers being scarcely able to keep pace with the
  demand.      It was quite a new thing for those who make
  holiday at the seaside to be able to learn something
  about the various creatures which they were daily
  finding in the rock-pools, or lying dead upon the
  shore  ;  and the little handbook opened out quite a new

                 TUB NATURALIST AT WORK.                      61
world, while the popular style in which it was written
rendered it easily intelligible to all.
     In  connection   with this book my father met with a
rather amusing incident. Soon after its publication, he
was hard at work among the rock-pools at Margate, a
mallet and a chisel in his hand, his oldest coat on, and
his trousers tucked up to his knees.          Just as he was
moving from one pool to another, a small company of
fashionably dressed young ladies approached, deeply
intent upon a copy of his own "Common Objects."
Just    as  they passed they looked up, saw the en
thusiastic naturalist in his working attire, shrugged
their shoulders, elevated their noses, and murmured,
 " How                          "
          very disgusting     !    And then they returned to
 their book.
     The   success  of " Common Objects of the Sea-shore
                                                               "
 was followed by still more striking results in the case of
 " Common                of the Country," which               in
              Objects                              appeared
 1858.     The book took the public completely by storm.
 A first edition of one hundred thousand copies was
 prepared, and at the end of a single week not a copy
 was to be procured     !    Edition followed edition, and still
 the   printers    and    binders  could scarcely work with
 sufficient rapidity to meet the orders which still came
 pouring in. After a time, of course, the demand
 slackened ; but from that day to this it has never
               "                                       "
 ceased, and     Common       Objects of the Country     is still
 a book which commands a yearly sale.
      Most    unfortunately, however, my father, when
 making arrangements for the production of these two

62                   THE REV. J.   G.  WOOD.
books, accepted the same terms which, were offered to
the   writers    of other books of the same series,            and
disposed of the copyrights for merely a small sum.              He
could not, of course, foresee the astonishing success         with
which the books would sell, and, looking rather to the
length of time occupied by the actual preparation of the
MS. — of course, only a very few weeks — than to the
return     which   those    books    would     bring in to the
publishers, took what was offered him, and parted with
all further interest in the publication. Had he retained
the copyrights, there can be no doubt that he would
have cleared a large sum of money        ; as  it was, the actual
remuneration which he received for each of the two
handbooks amounted to only thirty pounds              !
     After the first of the two little books was published,
a great     number    of letters reached him from readers,
most    of   them   asking for further        information     upon
certain    points, and some of a very amusing character.
Perhaps the funniest was one dated from Cincinnati,
U.S.A.      The writer had read the Rev.           J.   G. Wood's
interesting book with much pleasure         ;   but, living so far
from the sea as he did, many animals            described therein
were absolutely unknown         to him.    And, in particular,
he had a great desire to examine a jelly-fish.            Might he
ask the Rev.    J. G. Wood to forward him one by return
of post  ?
    About this time, appeared " The Playground,"                 in
                       I
which my father — believe for the first and only time
as far as book-work was concerned — adopted the nom
                "           Forest."    The little volume in
de plume of       George

             THE SECOND "NATURAL HISTORY."                      63
question, too, represents his only venture in the
direction of fiction, the book being a small tale of school
life, so constructed as to give, in narrative form, much
useful advice       upon    outdoor and indoor games, and
athletic sports of various descriptions.         In one of the
characters — Edward Benson, eldest son of the head
master — he depicts himself as he was when a young
man;      small    and   slight,   and   apparently weak      and
unhealthy, but with great power of endurance, and no
little development of muscle.           The book is so arranged
as to   include exactly a year of school-life      ;  so that the
sports and recreations adapted to the different seasons
are all described      in due succession.       It   has now,     I
 believe, for many years been out of print.
      The phenomenal       success   of the " Common      Objects
                     "
 of the Country led to arrangements for the production
 of a very much larger and more important work — the
 second Natural History.         The preparations for this were
 made upon an unusually lavish scale.          All   the illustra
 tions were to be drawn specially for the work, and only
 the best artists were to be employed.         Type, paper, and
 all the other accessories were to be of the best descrip
 tion, and no expense was to be spared either in produc
 tion or in advertising. Finally, the work was first to
 make its appearance in monthly parts (of which there
 were to be forty-eight in all), and, after the whole was
 completed,     it was to be re-issued in the form of three
  bulky volumes, of large octavo size.
      Of course the labour connected with the publication
  of this large and important work was very severe.          Each

64                    THE REV. J.       G.   WOOD.
mouth my father was responsible for forty-eight                    pages
of letter-press — due deduction being made for illustra
tions ; and each month many hours had to be given up
to personal interviews with the artists, correction of
blocks and printer's proofs, and all the manifold details
connected      with    the    production of any work upon a
tolerably large scale.         Then every available source of
information had to be sought out ; all the leading
authorities examined        ;  new material obtained from those
who had any personal knowledge of the rarer animals
described ; and almost daily visits paid to the Zoologi
cal Gardens in the Regent's Park, and the leading
London museums.             And all this in addition to the
labour involved by the actual writing.
     Into this book my father put perhaps his very best
work. All who know the three stout volumes will be
able to appreciate       the   careful    labour bestowed on the
description of every individual animal ; but over and
above this there is much of a higher quality, much in
which a deeper note is struck, and in which some of the
many problems as yet unsolved by man are brought
forward, treated with reverent care, and finally put by
with an evident         sense    of regret.       Perhaps    I may     be-
permitted to quote the following by way of example : —
    The attribute which we call Destruction ought to be termed
Conservation   and Progression, for without its beneficent influence all
things would be limited in their number and manifestation as soon
as they came into existence, and there would be no improvement          in
physical, moral, or spiritual natures.     In such sad case, it would be
possible to find a centre  and  circumference   to creation, whereas it is
truly as  unlimited as the very being   of its Creator.

              DESTRUCTION AND PRESERVATION.                                65
     Suppose, for example, that the huge saurians          of the geological
eras had been permitted      to retain their place upon       the earth, and
that the land and water were overrun with megatheria, iguano-
dons, and other creatures of like nature.        Suppose, to take our own
island as a limited example, that the land were peopled with the
naked and painted savages of its ancient times, unchanged in
numbers, in habits, and in customs.          It is evident that in either
case the country would be unable to retain the higher animals and
 the loftier humanity of the present day, and that in order to escape
absolute stagnation it is a necessity that old things should pass away,
and that the new should take their place.         How limited would the
human race be were it not subject to physical death ! But a very
few years and the earth would be over-peopled, setting aside the
question of bodily nourishment, which requires the destruction of
other beings, either animal or vegetable.       The same rule holds good
with regard to moral as well as physical improvement, for it is
necessary that all mental progress should be caused by a continual
destruction, a death of erroneous ideas, before the corresponding
truths can obtain entrance into the mind.
     Apply the same principle to the entire creation, and it will
become evident that the destructive attribute is essentially the pre
server and the improver.       Death, so-called, is the best guardian of the
human race, and its preserver from the most terrible selfishness and
the direst immorality.      If  men were unable to form any conception
of  a future state, and were forced to continue in the present phase of
existence to all eternity, they would naturally turn their endeavours
to collecting as much as possible of the things which afford sensual
pleasure, and each would lead an individual and selfish life, with no
future for which to hope, and no aim at which to aspire.
     The popular error respecting the destructive principle is that it
is supposed to be identical with annihilation, than which notion
nothing can be more false in itself, or more libellous to the Supreme
Creator of all things.    Death is to every man a terror, an abasement,
or an exaltation,   as the case may be ; but,   in truth, to those who are
capable of grasping this most beautiful subject, destruction is shown
as transmutation, and death becomes birth.           Nothing that is once
brought into existence can ever be annihilated, for the simple reason
that it is an emanation of the Deity, who is life itself, essential,

eternal, and universal.     The form is constantly liable to mutation,
but the substance always remains.
     In every pebble that lies unheeded on the ground are pent sundry
gaseous substances, which only await the delivering hand of the
analyser to be liberated and expanded ; possessing in their free and
etherealised existence many powers and properties which they were
debarred from exercising while imprisoned in their condensed and
materialised form.      To the ordinary observer, the stone thus trans
muted in its form appears to be destroyed, but its apparent death is in
reality the beginning of a new life, with extended powers and more
ethereal substance.      Thus it is that physical death acts upon man
kind, and in that light it is regarded by the true and brave spirit,
 with whom to live is toil, and death is a new birth into life, of which
he is conscious even here.        Death   is to such   minds the greatest
boon that could be conferred upon them, for just as the destruction
of the pebble etherealises and expands the element of its being,
so by the death     or destruction of the body the spirit is liberated
from   its material prison, and humanity is divinised through death.
      And also the following, which              I   select because      it
embodies my father's            great    principle,     that   scientific
phraseology       is in place only in strictly scientific works
written      expressly     for strictly scientific readers, and
that in books written for the general public it may
and must be dispensed with.
     The observer can, in   a minute   fragment of bone, though hardly
larger than a midge's wing, read the class of animal of whose frame
work it once formed a part as decisively as if its former owner were
present to claim his property ; for each particle of every animal is
imbued with the nature of the whole being.           The life-character is
enshrined   in and  written  upon every sanguine   disc that rolls through
the veins ; is manifested in every fibre and nervelet that gives energy
and force to the breathing and active body     ; and is stereotyped upon
each bony atom that forms part of its skeleton framework.
     Whoever reads these hieroglyphs rightly is truly a poet and a

 death passed away, and a prevision of a resurrection and a life to
 come.     As he gazes upon the vast multitude of dead, sapless me

 to them ; the vital fluid courses through their bodies ; the spirit of

 feet."   Ages upon ages roll back their tides, and once more the vast
 reptile epoch reigns on earth.      The huge saurians shake the ground
 with their heavy tread, wallow in the slimy ooze, or glide sinuous
 through the waters ; while winged reptiles flap their course through
 the miasmatic vapours that hang dank and heavy over the marshy
world.       As with them, so with us — an inevitable progression
 towards higher stages of existence, the effete and undeveloped
beings passing away to make room for new and loftier and more
 perfect creations.    What is the volume that has thus recorded the
 chronicles of an age so long past, and prophecies of so far-distant
 a future 1 Simply a little fragment of mouldering bone, tossed aside
contemptuously by the careless labourer as miner's
                                                           " rubbish."
     Not only is the past history of each being written in every
 particle of which its material frame is constructed, but the past
records of the universe      to which it belongs, and     a prediction  of its
future.      God can make no one thing that           is not universal in its
teachings,    if we would only be so taught   ; if  not the fault is with the
pupils, not with the Teacher.         He writes His ever-living words in
all the works of His hand ; He spreads this ample book before us,
always ready to teach, if we will only learn.          We walk in the midst
of miracles with closed eyes and stopped ears, dazzled and be
wildered with the light, fearful and distrustful of the Word.
     It is not enough to accumulate facts as misers gather coins, and
then to put them away on our bookshelves, guarded by the bars and
bolts   of technical   phraseology.    As coins,   the facts must   be circu
lated, and given to the public for their use.            It is no matter of
wonder that the generality of readers recoil from works on the
natural sciences, and look upon them as mere collections of tedious
names, irksome to read, unmanageable of utterance, and impossible
to remember.        Our scientific libraries are filled with facts, dead,
hard, dry,     and  material as the fossil bones that fill the sealed and
           F 2

 68                   THE BEY. J.      G. WOOD.
 caverned libraries of tho past.   But true science will breathe life
 into that dead  mass, and fill the study of zoology with poetry and
 spirit.
       Such digressions     from the main principle         of the
 work occur not uncommonly throughout the three
 volumes, generally at the close of a chapter — if such
the divisions of the book may rightly be termed — where
the leading characteristics         of  a group of animals are
 being summed up, and a few general conclusions drawn.
 And in most cases they illustrate one of the leading
 principles of his writings — of which he often spoke to
intimate friends, although never formulating it in print
— namely, that in writing books of such a character as
his own, religious instruction, while it should never be
brought obtrusively forward, could and should always
be    afforded by implication.          More thau once, when
writing for magazines of an avowedly religious cha
racter, editorial additions were inserted after the proofs
had passed      through his hands, generally consisting of
Scriptural quotations which seemed specially applicable
to the subject under treatment.             These    always   made
him furious, and usually resulted in a strong letter of
expostulation ; for he was accustomed to say that, while
he always endeavoured          to teach religion in all that he
wrote, he never attempted to force          it upon his readers,
but always left them to           gather it half-unconsciously
from the general tenor of his writings.           0 si sic omnes !

The first        part of the great Natural History was
published in the month of March, 1859, and for forty-
eight consecutive months the parts regularly appeared,
until the whole animal creation, from the anthropoid
apes    down to the infusoria and the sponges, had been
carefully and systematically described.                   The book was
by no means a strictly scientific               work, in the ordinary
sense    of the term.          It     was intended for the general
public rather than for a special and limited class of
readers, and aimed, as all its predecessors from the same
pen had done, at making the study of zoology bright
and interesting to those who knew little about it, while
yet the need for accuracy was carefully kept in mind
throughout.          In   fact, to quote the words of the preface

 70                 THE REV. J.  G. WOOD.
to the first volume, the work is, and was meant        to be,
" rather  anecdotal and vital than merely anatomical and
scientific."    For my father always held that the object
of the true zoologist is " to search into the essential
nature of every being, to investigate, according to his
individual capacity, the reason why it should have been
placed on earth, and to give his personal service to
his Divine     Master   in developing that nature in the
best   manner and to the fullest extent." And there
fore   he   relegated  the   whole  of   the  classificatory
portion, consisting of an elaborate compendium             of
generic distinctions, to the end of each volume,           in
order that it might      in no way interfere with the more
popular portion of the work.
     This Natural History, however, was not the only
work undertaken during the years 1859 — 62, for besides
various magazine articles, some of them of no incon
                                       " Common             "
siderable length, the third of the                Objects
Series —
          " Common Objects of the Microscope " — made
its appearance in 1861 . In this little book, however
— almost for the only time in the whole of his career
— my    father availed himself to some extent of the ser
vices   of a collaborateur.   Not in the actual    composi
tion of the book, for he wrote        every  word himself;
neither was it a mere hasty compilement         to suit the
needs of the moment.         But the great and incessant
pressure upon his time led him to relegate the selection
of the objects to be described to other hands       ; and so
this part of the work was entrusted to Mr. Tuffen
West, who employed the greater part of a year in col

                      THREE NEW BOOKS.                         71
lecting specimens for that special purpose.            Messrs.
Baker, also, the well-known opticians of High Holborn,
most    liberally placed their entire stock of instruments
and slides at my father's disposal ; and so, the mechanical
part of the labour being so greatly lightened, he was
able to write the book in such odd moments as were not
monopolised      by the Natural History.
     In   1862, as already mentioned, came the resignation
of the chaplaincy at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and
the removal from London to Belvedere, better known at
that time as Lessness Heath.          And the following year
witnessed    the appearance of no less than three books.
Two of these, however, were quite of small size, and,
under the title of the
                                " Old and New Testament
Histories,"     consisted of a short and concise account of
the Scriptural      narrative, written in plain and simple
language     for the use of children.        These two little
books were perhaps the pioneers of Bible manuals              for
the young, and met with a tolerably large sale, although,
 as was   usually the case, my father profited but little by
their success.
     The last of the three books was of quite a different
 character, and, under the descriptive title of " Glimpses
 into Petland," comprised short biographies of a number
 of pet animals,      nearly all of which had been in the
                                         " Pret," the cat, and
 possession of my father himself.
 "            "        "
   Roughie       and     Apollo," the dogs, together with
 chameleons, chicken-tortoises,     lizards, and butterflies, all
 were described in turn, in manner entirely anecdotal, and
 from the point of view of one who regarded            them as

 72                   THE REV. J.    G.  WOOD.
 intelligent    and   even   rational   beings.   The book en
 countered     rather merciless treatment from some of the
 reviewers,    who apparently could not bring themselves
 to believe that the stories recounted             therein were
 true.    But it   met, nevertheless,     with much favour at
 the hands of the public, and, just twenty years later,
 was reissued in a revised and extended form.
      In   1864 my father began perhaps the most popular
 work which he ever wrote, and which has always been
 specially associated with his name — the well-known
 " Homes without Hands."            In  this he set himself to
 describe the various habitations constructed        by different
 animals    for the use of themselves or their young, a
task which he completed          in  a  stout octavo volume of
some     six hundred and thirty pages. The work, how
ever, which appeared under the auspices of Messrs.
 Longmans, Green, & Co., was in the first place pub
lished in monthly parts, just as the larger Natural
History had been       ; and its publication in volume      form
did not take place until 1865.
      The popularity of the book was soon assured, even
if  the previous    issues of the      monthly parts had not
paved the way for its production as a whole.                Only
a   few days after its appearance The Times devoted no
less than four columns to a review of the work, and
spoke of    it throughout in    the very highest terms.      The
other newspapers, daily and weekly, followed suit, and
the consequence was that, perhaps putting " Common
                             "
Objects of the Country         out of the question, " Homes
                     "
without      Hands       proved   by    far the   most  popular

                    CURIOUS       CHARACTERISTIC.                   73
 and successful of all the numerous              books    which pro
 ceeded from my father's           pen    during his thirty years
 of literary life.
      In this work     I   notice  particularly that which was
 perhaps    a   characteristic     of all his writings, namely,
 the utter absence of anything whatever              in the way of
 a peroration,     or even of a thought-out and carefully
 turned conclusion.         He usually began both his books
 and magazine       articles with a thoughtful         introduction,
 comprising a statement of the subject which he in
 tended to treat, and of the point of view from which
 he was about to consider it.               Of this, in faot, he
 made a systematic          practice,   often saying that, after
 settling   upon a title for a book or an article, the
 hardest    part of the work was to find a suitable
 beginning.      And     I   have   frequently known him to
 expend    at least as much time and thought over his
prefatory paragraph as            over    the   whole     of the re
mainder of the article.            But with regard to          a con
clusion he rarely seemed             to  trouble himself at all,
and    merely adopted         the   simple    plan  of leaving off
when     he had    said all that he had          to say upon      the
                                                        "
subject.      Thus " Homes without Hands                   concludes
 with the sentence — " As is the case with many of the
illustrations to this work, the sketch             was taken    from
nature."     That is all; nothing more at all.                "Com
mon     Objects   of the Country,"         in like manner, ends
                                                "
with a sentence        equally simple — Figure 6 shows
the curious Earth-star, chiefly remarkable for its re
semblance to the marine           star-fish."    And  so on.     And

74                     THE REY. J.   G. WOOD.
even     in " Trespassers," a book in which, perhaps,
almost more than in any other, he had a definite
idea to work out, and a definite ground to cover,
he abstains     in the same marked manner from anything
approaching        to a recapitulation of what he has         said,
or to a summary         of the principal points which he has
brought forward. The final paragraph is merely as fol
lows : — "Now as to the travelling ants, which are shown
in the illustration; these creatures          act,  when on the
march, just as        soldiers  when pushing       their way to
wards a battery       ;  they always keep themselves under
cover, and in a most extraordinary manner,               and with
wonderful speed, build covered galleries, under the
shelter of which they can proceed unmolested by the
unwelcome        light."
     Yet, in his sketch-lectures,        he  was    most   careful
with his conclusion, and always had a few sentences
which took one back over the ground that he had
covered, and summed up the teaching of the whole.
So,    too,  in any      speech   that  he   made     in  public ;
the end was as carefully considered           as the   beginning.
Probably,      therefore,   the absence    of peroration in his
writings was intentional;          certainly  it was character
istic.
     In    the     same          in which    " Homes without
                          year
          "
Hands       appeared — 1865 — my father varied his literary
labours     by    undertaking the editorship of The Boys
 Own Magazine.          To this, for some years past, he had
                                                            "  The
been    contributing a series of papers entitled
Zoological Gardens," in which most of the inmates

               A CONFIDING       CORRESPONDENT,                   lb
of that     wonderful menagerie were in turn described;
as  well as various       occasional  articles   upon a variety
of    subjects   dear    to   the   boyish heart.       I  do   not
know     that he much        enjoyed the work of           editing,
which     had too    much of the      mechanical      element in
it  to satisfy him    ;  and certainly he never referred to
it  afterwards    with any expressions of pleasure.             But
after   the end of twelve months or so the arrange
ment was suddenly brought to an end by the bank
ruptcy     of the publisher;       and the     editorship     of an
" Annual," which he had also taken                over,   came   to
an untimely      end owing to the same cause.
     Some    of the correspondence         connected     with the
magazine     was very amusing.        There was the orthodox
column upon the last page, devoted to " Answers to
Correspondents," and questions of the most ridiculous
character naturally came in by almost every post.
Of one in particular my father was very fond of tell
ing.     A boy wrote in great tribulation to say that
he was exceedingly short for his age, that he had
ceased    growing, and that his deficiency in stature
preyed very much upon his mind and spirits.                   Could
the editor offer any suggestions as to ways and means
by which      this deficiency might be made good            ?   The
editor politely replied, through the ordinary medium
of the correspondence column, to the effect that the
 case  was   a   very sad one, that he deeply regretted
his inability to advise upon a subject of so much
 importance, and that all he could suggest was the
daily    use   of the   rack  !   The  answer      duly appeared

76                    THE REV. J.   O.  WOOD.
in print, and elicited        a further letter from the same
correspondent,     evidently written in all sober earnest
and good faith. He was much obliged to the editor
for his kindly advice ; he was anxious to follow that
advice without      loss of time.      But as  he did not know
at what shops racks toere        to be bought,  would the editor
be so   kind as   to   tell him where he might procure one I
     It  is scarcely necessary to state that this second
epistle remained unanswered.
     Next in order came the fourth of the            " Common
Objects" Series, "Common Shells of the Sea-shore" being
the title of the little work in question.        This appeared
in 1867, in which year was also issued, as a companion
volume, " The Fresh and Salt Water Aquarium," con
sisting of a reprint of a number of articles which had
originally been contributed to the pages of The Boys
 Own Magazine.          Save and except that a chapter was
specially devoted to aquarium construction and manage
ment, this last might for all practical purposes have
been termed " Common Objects of the Fresh and Salt
         "
Water      ;  for there is scarcely      one   of the common
inmates of pond, stream, or ocean which is not therein
described, or at the least mentioned.
     In  the same year " Our Garden        Friends and Foes
                                                               "
saw the light    :   a book   whose title is sufficiently self-
 explanatory.      But the principal business of the year
was the commencement of the great " Natural History
of Man," comprising an exhaustive account of all
the savage races of mankind, with details of their
habits, dress, hunting, warfare, and all else that ap-

             " THti NATURAL HISTORY OF MAN."              77
pertains to man in his uncivilised state. My father
had long seen that his Natural History was incom
plete, and must remain so until the human      species  had
received     due   attention with  the  rest  of animated
creation.      He had for many years taken       a   special
interest in ethnology, and had succeeded in making
himself more or less intimately acquainted with most
of those who could speak with authority upon the
subject.     He had even Drought together the nucleus of
that which some few years afterwards was one of the
finest collections of savage weapons, dress, ornaments,
and implements in the world. And so he was perfectly
qualified to take the matter up.       He made arrange
ments with his publisher, therefore, of very much the
same nature as those which had governed the production
of the larger Natural History. The best artists only
were to be engaged ; thirty -four parts, or numbers, were
to succeed one       another regularly at intervals of a
month    ;   and the whole, when completed, was to be
issued     in similar form to that of the great Natural
History, to which, in fact, it was intended to serve as
a sequel.
     This work involved perhaps even more labour than
its predecessor, although it consisted of two volumes
only.     The number of books of travel, &c, which had
to be consulted was simply enormous.       Whole days had
frequently to be passed in the Eeading-room of the
British Museum.         Books to the value   of more than
forty pounds had to be purchased outright.      Travellers,
and those with a special knowledge of any savage race,

 78                 THE REV. J.    G.  WOOD.
 had to be sought out and applied           to for information
on subjects      merely   touched   upon or    even altogether
neglected    in the books.      And then, of course, there
came    the constant    supervision   of the    artists — nearly
 every   one of whose blocks had in some            way to be
altered before passing into the hands of the engraver —
the revision of the proof-sheets, the ceaseless search for
 sources of further information, and the necessary          cor
respondence which the work involved.
     In  the three years during which this book          was in
progress,    my father added very considerably to the
collection of savage weapons, utensils, tools, ornaments,
and articles    of costume     which   he   had  already been
accumulating for several years.         I  do not think that
this hobby ever cost him very much money, for, with
the exception of a few odds and ends picked up chiefly
at old curiosity shops in London, he purchased very
few of his trophies, but obtained them partly as gifts,
and partly by exchange, from those with whom the
preparation     of the book     brought    him   into   contact.
And soon the collection      began to attain to really im
posing proportions.        The  walls of the entrance hall,
staircase,   and   my father's    own study were hung so
closely    with   spears,   swords, blow-guns, bows and
arrows,    and other weapons      of war that scarcely any
where was there a spare inch of space available.           Here
hung a Kaffir cradle, roughly constructed from a strip

There was a Kaffir girl's dancing-belt, made of large
seeds, and so constructed      as to  rattle loudly at ever

of Dyak clubs     ;  one a most     formidable weapon made
from the lower part of the stem of a small tree, with
the roots trimmed off in such a manner that the stumps
formed a radiating mass of sharp spikes, calculated to
lacerate the flesh of a foe in the most terrible manner.
Close by was a most elaborately carved
                                              " toko-toko," or
walking-stick, from New Zealand.             Then there were
two formidable Macquarri whips, used in that singular
dance in which each performer presents his leg in turn
to be gashed by a blow from the other.               There was
                "
a Patagonian bolas," or three-ball lasso, just as it had
last been used by the native hunter        ; quite a quantity
of tomahawks       ;  and   several  of the strange wooden
swords,   set on either edge        with almost    innumerable
sharks' teeth, for the manufacture of which the inhabi
tants of the Kingsmill Islands were formerly famous.
 A small cabinet contained a variety of poisons and
poisoned    arrows,    including a vessel of the famous
 Wourali, and a roll of arrows presented by Charles
Waterton himself, the first traveller who succeeded in
 bringing the poison home to England.             In the same
cabinet was the stuffed skin of a hedgehog which had
fallen victim to a prick from one of the arrows ; strong
testimony to the potency of the venom, as hedgehogs
have little objection to arsenic, strychnine, and prussic
acid, receive the bite of the viper with perfect equanimity,
and are practically poison-proof.        In  every odd corner
were hung ornamented gourds, daggers, bead necklaces,
bracelets, anklets, aprons, and small ornaments         far too

reptitiously         carried    away    beneaththe clothing of an
unsuspected visitor.             Before the book was finished the
collection had perhaps but two equals in Great Britain —
that at the British Museum, and the famous " Christy

collection.      A
              very large proportion of the illustrations
in the Natural History were drawn from the objects
which it contained, and at last it became evident enough
that, if many more additions were made to       the walls   it,
of the entire house would hardly afford sufficient surface
for its display. After the book was finished, however,
and its work was done, my father practically ceased to
enlarge it, and,       a   very few years afterwards, the collec
tion was broken up and sold.
    Heavy as was the labour thrown upon him, however,
                            " Natural
by the preparation of the             History of Man,"
and the necessity for sending in monthly a prescribed
quantity of manuscript upon prescribed day, my father
                                         a
did not at all appear to consider that his energies were
wholly occupied, and actually entered into arrangements
for the simultaneous publication of "Bible Animals
                                                       "
upon   asimilar principle.   The first of the monthly
numbers of the new work appeared in 1869, and thus
for many consecutive months               a    double quota of manu
script had regularly to be sent in,               a   double quantity of
proofs revised, and        a   double number of artists' illustra
tions to be superintended           and corrected.
     Only   a   man of the strongest           constitution could have
performed the work which the preparation of these two

                  THE DAILY PROGRAMME.                   81
works involved.     The three-mile run immediately before
breakfast was now almost the only regular exercise that
my father allowed himself; and during almost the
whole of the rest of the day, from half-past four or
five o'clock in the morning until nearly eleven o'clock
at night, he was hard at work at his desk. The two
hours' sleep after dinner — regularly from two o'clock
till four — probably prevented him from breaking down
altogether. But perhaps the greatest marvel was that
the character of his work did not seem to suffer at all
from its quantity, and that he could write as brightly
and freshly after a long day at his desk as he could
when that day was just beginning.        That he injured
his health by this close application to work can hardly
be doubted.      He suffered greatly from sleeplessness at
night, and, had he deferred his rising to  a more orthodox
hour, would have gained no real additional repose by
doing so. And probably the ill-health of 1877 and
1878 was caused almost as much by the reaction        after
all this incessant labour  as by the worry and anxiety of
the time.
     The character of
                        " Bible Animals " is evident  from
its title ; but the book is by no means a mere description
of   the living creatures mentioned by name in the
Scriptures. It aims rather at elucidating some of the
obscurities of the Bible by showing the true meaning
of the many references to various animals ; and it is
intended, in fact, as an aid to Biblical study rather
than as in any way a popular Manual of Natural
History.

      Contemporary   history (says the preface), philology, geography,
and ethnology must all be pressed into the service of the true Biblical
scholar ; and there is yet another science which is to the full as
important as either of the others. This is natural history, in its
widest sense.    The Oriental character of the Scriptural Books causes
them to abound with metaphors and symbols, taken from the common
life of the time. They embrace the barren, precipitous rocks alter
nating with the green and fertile valleys, the trees, flowers, and
herbage, the creeping things of the earth, the fishes of the sea, the
birds of the air, and the beasts which abode with man, or dwelt in
the     deserts              Unless, therefore, we understand these

writings    as those understood themfor whom they were written, it is
evident that we shall misinterpret, instead of rightly comprehending
them.    Even with secular books of equally ancient date, the right
understanding   of them would be important ; but in the case of
the Holy Scriptures it is more than important, and becomes a
duty.
    The importance of zoology in elucidating the Scriptures cannot be
overrated, and without its aid we shall not only miss the point of
innumerable passages of the Old and New Testament, but the words
of our Lord Himself will either be totally misinterpreted, or, at
least, lose the greater part of their significance.   The object of the
present   work     is,
                    therefore, to take in its  proper succession every
creature whose name                is   given   in the Scriptures,      and to supply so
much of its history as will enable the reader to understand all the
passages in which      mentioned.

 Beetles      were also written   and published during   the
year 1870; both appearing under the auspices of Messrs.
 George Routledge & Co.         I  think that my father was
afterwards sorry that he had ever written these two
 books.     He did so under pressure from the publishers,
at  a  period when he had not the time to devote to his
subject ; and under any circumstances, moreover, he was
scarcely the right man for the task, as he had for nearly
twenty years discontinued the active collection of in
sects, and had never given that minute attention to
species and specific differences which is essential to those
who write even a popular handbook upon the subject.
In consequence, the insects selected for description were
not well chosen, and the books — as my father himself
afterwards freely admitted— are of but little practical
value.
     The year 1871 was occupied by the preparation of      a
much larger and more important work, which, under the
title of " Insects at Home," comprises descriptions, life-
histories, &c, of a great number of representative British
insects.     The book was far more carefully prepared than
its two smaller predecessors. More time could be de
voted    to its preparation in the first place, and the
author had not constantly to write under the haunting
dread of an imperative demand for "copy." The illustra
tions, too, were provided for in a much more satisfactory
          g 2

84                 THE BEV. J.   G.   WOOD.
manner, and comprised more than seven hundred sepa
rate figures.    jThe result was     a bulky volume of six
hundred and seventy pages, in which all the different
orders were treated in turn, of course in a strictly
"          "
   popular    manner.   And an illustrated description of
insect   anatomy, by way of an introduction, and a few
remarks    upon setting and preserving insects, as a con
clusion, rendered the book as comprehensive as could be
desired.
     During the same year, my father edited a new book
for boys, " The Modern Playmate," for Messrs. Frederick
Warne & Co., himself writing the articles         upon skat
ing and swimming, and superintending and revising the
remainder.     In  1872 and 1873 no book appeared bear
ing his name ; but he was nevertheless very busy upon
" Insects Abroad," a                             " Insects at
                       companion volume to
Home," treating of exotic instead of British insects, the
preparation of which occupied very nearly two years. For,
of course, the task was a far harder one than had been
involved by the compilation of its predecessor. The insects
selected were, in many cases, almost utterly unknown ;
some    had even   for the first time to be described   ; and
information concerning     them     could   only be obtained
with great difficulty.    But the officials in the insect
 room at the British Museum offered every assistance in
 their power; the artists threw themselves heart and
 soul into their work, examining, as stated in the pre
 face, some three thousand     drawers of insects, each con
 taining an average of fifty specimens, and sparing no
 pains to obtain the utmost possible accuracy in the

                  "INSECTS ABROAD."                   85
illustrations.  And in 1874 the book appeared, forming
a larger volume than its predecessor by more than one
hundred pages.    No  less than eight hundred and sixty
species were described in all, of which six hundred were
figured   ; and both descriptions  and drawings were in
every case made from the actual specimens themselves.

As already stated, there had been two years — 1872 and
1873 — during which no work of any importance had
proceeded from my father's pen                  ;  but, after the publica
tion of "Insects             Abroad"        in 1874, several volumes
made their appearance in rapid succession.
       First came " Trespassers," the leading idea of which
was to show the tendency manifested in every large
group of animals towards usurping the domain which is
usually occupied by other families. Mammals, broadly
speaking, are terrestrial. Yet the bats fly in the air
like the birds, the whales and the seals live in the water
like the fishes, while the mole lives under the earth
instead        of upon it.           Among        the   birds,   again,    the
penguin, the auks, and the divers are water-trespassers,
while the ostrich and the emu do not fly at all, but live
upon the ground like most of the mammals.                              Then,

               THE MASTER-KEY TO ZOOLOGY.                      87
among the reptiles, the crocodiles, alligators, and turtles
are aquatic, while the flying dragon skims through the
air after the manner of the petaurists and the flying
squirrels ; while there are even fishes, and fishes not a
few, which      at times    leave their natural element and
trespass for awhile upon the land.         All these, and many
more, are described      in " Trespassers," which not only
gives an account of the animals themselves, but explains
the wonderful modifications of structure which enable
them to " trespass."        In this book, in fact, my father
first dilated upon that great and most important fact
the one and the only master-key to all zoology, that
 Structure is subservient to and dependent upon Habit ;
in other words, that every detail of the bodily form of
every animal is more or less modified in accordance with
the life which that animal is intended           to lead.    And
upon this rule — one to which there is no exception — he
was never afterwards tired of insisting, alike in book,
in   magazine    article, in sketch-lecture,      and   even   in
sermon.
     Almost contemporary with " Trespassers " was " Out
           "
of Doors     ; but this was merely a collection of magazine
articles which had from time to time appeared in various
periodicals,    and  which     were now deemed worthy          of
 re-publication in book form. The first twelve of these
 were now arranged according to the seasons of the year,

spring.    These    were    the subjects   of the    first three
papers, and then came others          on a certain small pond,
historically known as
                           " Mrs.  Coates' Bath," which was
full of aquatic creatures of all kinds ; an English lane
in the height of summer ; the wood ant ; the green
crab ; the stinging jelly-fish ; the toad ; the " Children
of the New Forest " ; a blackberry bush in autumn ; and
the repose of Nature.        And then followed a few mis
cellaneous papers, two of them bearing the rather
                        "                                   " De
singular titles of        Turkey and Oysters," and
Monstris."
     In July of this year my father met with a most
serious accident.     He was always somewhat notorious
for the brittleness of his bones, and already, in my own
recollection  of him, had broken no less than five ribs         :
three   by collision    with   a  low post when unwisely
running at some little speed in the darkness, in which
his shortness of sight rendered him practically blind ;
and two by walking against a tombstone when taking a
funeral, a gust of wind suddenly lifting up his surplice
and blowing     it over his head, so that he was unable to
see  the obstacle in his way.      And previously to this, as
already mentioned, he had broken his leg, and his arm,
and his collar-bone (twice),     and his nose, and had also
suffered various    dislocations   and lesser   injuries.    But
the accident   which now befell him was more serious
by far than any of these, and he never really recovered
from its effects to the end of his life.
     He had promised — we were living at Belvedere at
the time — to take the morning duty on a certain Sunday

                  A SERIOUS     ACCIDENT.                 89
in July to oblige a clerical friend in charge of one of the
Woolwich churches ; and, anxious to employ his time
to the last possible moment, he arranged to leave only
by the last train on the Saturday night. When the
night came, there was no moon ; the sky was covered
with dense clouds ; and, as it was summer-time, the
wisdom of the Local Board had decreed that the street
lamps should not be lighted.      Also, as was usually the
case  when he had a train to catch, my father remembered
some important omission at the last moment, and was
consequently very late in starting.       Now, while the
greater part of the village of Belvedere stands on high
ground, the railway station, which is some three-
quarters of a mile distant, naturally lies down below,
in the valley of the Thames ; and the descent is by a
long and steep hill, closely overhung with trees upon
either side. Anxious if possible to catch his train, and
so  to save himself from a four-mile walk at midnight,
my father ran down the hill, carrying a carpet-bag
and a walking-stick in his right hand.        Just in the
darkest and steepest part of the road a cartload of
manure had been emptied for the supply of a neighbour
ing garden, and carelessly left upon the pathway.      And
over this, which he was quite unable to see in the dark
ness, my father fell heavily, alighting with all his
weight upon his unfortunate right hand, the fingers of
which were still holding the walking-stick and the
carpet-bag.   The consequence was that the second,
third, and fourth fingers were fractured, one of them in
two places ; two were dislocated as well ; and nearly all

90                  THE REV. J.   G.  WOOD.
the bones of the      palm   were also    badly broken, the
thumb and first finger alone escaping injury.
      At the time, and in the hurry of the moment, my
father was scarcely alive to the extent of the damage
which he had sustained.          He knew that bones were
broken, but not that the mischief was so severe.      And so,
instead of giving up his journey — instead even of seeing
a medical man, and driving into Woolwich afterwards —
he caught his train and went on ; passed the night in
great pain, the wounded       hand, of course,    swelling to
three times its original size, and somehow managed to
conduct the services next morning, although more than
once in imminent danger         of fainting.   He even cele
brated the Holy Communion; how, it is not easy to
imagine.      At  eleven  o'clock he     conducted   the  full
morning service, and preached.         And then, at last, he
 made up his mind to come home and have his injuries
attended to.      Of course, by this time, the condition of
the wounded hand was such that it was almost               im
possible even to examine      it.   Only with the greatest
 difficulty . were the fractured bones set, and the dis
locations reduced.     And for many weeks it remained in
 splints and bandages, while not for nearly a year could
 it be used again for writing.        Indeed, it never quite
 recovered its former steadiness and strength.       Nervous
 tremors and twitches would suddenly seize it      ; at times
 it would tremble so severely as to be practically useless.
And to the end of his life my father could never write
 without steadying the right hand with the left, and
 seldom even lift a cup of tea to his lips without employ
 ing both hands in the operation.

                    ANIMAL IMMORTALITY.                    91
     Of course, an accident     so severe  told very greatly
upon    his literary work.    He could not write for many
months — save slowly and laboriously with his left hand
— and he suffered under the additional misfortune of
being utterly unable to dictate to an amanuensis.        So
that until the damaged hand recovered something of
its former usefulness, the supply of manuscript practi
cally ceased.     Most fortunately he had taken out ar
policy in an accident insurance company, and was able
to claim the allowance for total disablement ; for it was
not until the following year that he was able to earn
anything by his pen.
     As soon    as he could  again set to work, however, he
                   " Man and Beast, Here and Hereafter,"
began to write
an examination into the question        of the mortality or
immortality of the lower animals.       The matter was one
which for a very long period had occupied his thoughts      ;.
probably since the time when, in reading for his examina
tion for Holy Orders, he had studied         Bishop Butler's
well-known      "Analogy    of Revealed    Religion."   For
no less than fifteen years he had actually been accu
mulating materials for the book. And now he set
himself to arrange his masses of notes and corre
spondence into something like order, and to write the
book itself.
     This he did upon    a somewhat   singular plan.   Him
self a firm believer    in the immortality of animals, as
many others had been before him, he first entered into
a  careful examination   of the Scriptural evidence for and
against    the proposition, and showed that most of the

¦92                THE REV. J. G. WOOD.    .
passages which are generally supposed to bear upon the
subject   are mistranslated, while others are misunder
stood.   And also he pointed out that in other      passages
not a    few,  animal immortality is either distinctly
taught by implication, or else that human immortality
is denied.    Then, passing from the theological to the
practical side of the question, he proceeded to show
that animals possess — although, of course, in low de
gree—most of the faculties generally considered, not
only as peculiar to the human species, but also as
purely spiritual in character; that they are often dis
tinguished by reasoning power of a really high order         ;
 and that even the attributes which we usually deem as
strictly appertaining to the immortal soul are by no
 means lacking in the animal world.    This he did princi
 pally by means of anecdotes, collected only from the
 most thoroughly trustworthy quarters,    and showing all
these different attributes as manifested in practice.   And
 then he argued that, although the difference between
 man and beast in the spirit world might possibly, and
 not improbably, continue as vast as now, no proof what
 ever could be found to show that animals ceased to exist
 at the moment of dissolution, but that, on the contrary,
 an overwhelming weight of evidence, both scriptural
 and other, seemed to testify to their absolute immor
 tality.   And he also showed that the doctrine is by no
 means a hard one to those who    will put   prejudice upon
 one side, and examine the whole    question carefully and
 upon its merits.
      Long before writing " Man and Beast," however,

                   INDIGNANT CORRESPONDENTS.                              9S
my father had publicly expressed his views upon this
subject of animal immortality.                    To quote his own
words     :
            —
     Some    years ago,   when    writing my " Common Objects of the
Country,"    I  ventured to doubt the truth of the popular belief on
this subject, and was rather surprised at the result.        Almost every
periodical which gave a notice of the book quoted the passage, and,
with only one or two exceptions, more or less approved of it. The
exceptional cases were those of distinctly religious publications ; and
they, of course, brought against me "the beasts that perish"
     I was   also inundated     with letters upon the subject.    Many of
them were written by persons who had possessed favourite animals,
and who cordially welcomed an idea which they had long held in
their hearts, but had been afraid to express. Many were from
persons who were seriously shocked at the idea that any animal
lower than themselves could live after the death of the body.
      Some were     full of grave rebuke, while others were couched in
 sarcastic terms.
      Two are especially worthy of notice.        The one contains twelve
 pages of closely-written, full-sized letter paper, in which the writer
 tells me that any one who cherished the hope that animals could
 live after death was unworthy of his position as a clergyman, ought
 to be deprived of his university degrees, and expelled from the
 learned societies to which lie belonged.        This argument was so un
 answerable that I did not venture to reply to it.
      The writer of the second letter remarked that, whatever       I  might
 say, he would never condescend to share immortality with a cheese-
  mite.    I replied that, in the first place, it was not likely that he
  would be consulted upon the subject j and that, in the second place,
  as he did condescend to share mortality with a good many cheese-
  mites, there could be no great harm in extending his condescension a
  step further.
      But, no matter whether the writers agreed with me or not ; no
  matter    whether   they were    sympathetic,  severe, or sarcastic,  they
  invariably mentioned      " the beasts that perish."     Some wished to
  know how     it was possible to get over    a passage  which had always
  prevented them from indulging in the hope that the animals which

94                       THE REV. J.       G.  WOOD.
they Lad loved on earth would have a future life; while others
brought forward
                     " the beasts that perish " as a crushing and con
clusive argument, of which they evidently supposed me to be entirely
ignorant.
    The reader will therefore see how important it is that the true
meaning of the Hebrew text should be known, and that the Psalmist
•should not be accredited with putting forward a doctrine to which,
whether true or false, he makes no reference whatever.
      As regards the main idea of the book, and the con
clusions to be drawn from the arguments which he
brings forward,           I  cannot do better than quote my
father's own closing remarks : —
    In   announcing    my belief that the lower animals share immortality
with man in the next world, as they share mortality in this, I do not
claim for them the slightest equality. . Man will be man, and beast
will be beast, and insect will be insect in the next world as in this.
They are living exponents of Divine ideas, as is evident from the
Holy Scriptures,     and   will be  wanted to continue    in the woiJd of
spirits the work which they have begun in the world of matter.
    But, though    I  do not claim   for them the slightest equality with
man,   I  do claim for them a higher status in creation than is generally
attributed to them :     I do claim for them a future life in which they
can be compensated for the sufferings which so many of them have to
undergo in this world ; and      I do so chiefly because I am quite sure
that most of the cruelties which are perpetrated on the animals are
due to the habit of considering them as mere machines, without
susceptibilities, without reason, and without the capacity of a future.
      Of course, " Man and Beast," when                    it appeared,
gave rise to much discussion,               and a   host of criticisms
appeared        in the      newspapers        and  other    periodicals  ;
some      very friendly, some very much the reverse. But
the prevailing tone was that of ardent sympatic with
the principle of the work; and until the end of his

life my father was constantly receiving letters warmly
thanking him for the book, and embodying further
facts and anecdotes for his use in the event of a
revised        edition.
        This    I   have reason    my father had in
                                            to    believe
contemplation during the closing years of his life.
His working copy of " Man and Beast " is filled with
letters from friends and manuscript notes of his own,
and he had clearly been collecting material for addi
tions and improvements. And gummed upon the title-
page is a printed extract from some religious magazine
which struck him very deeply, and to which he often
referred in the course of conversation.    It refers to
the original Hebrew of the term translated                                     in our ver
sion as "living soul."
    Certain of King James's translators        says)    .   (it have       .         .
rendered   the Hebrew word "nephesh," soul, when referring to
man, quite literally.  The fact that the same word      applied to          is
animals    iscovered up, or concealed, to all who are not Hebrew
scholars, other words being substituted for      such as " life," or
                                                                  it,
"creature."
    In    Genesis    i.      30,   "To   every beast of the earth, and to every
fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth
wherein there    life " the Hebrew words are " nephesh chaiyah,"
                    is             ;
a living soul.  Also in Genesis  20,
                                     " Let the waters bring forth
                                            i.
                                                                  "

soul.

                                                             it                           is   it
literally translated.  In nine other instances, when     refers to the   it
lower orders of creation,     the fact carefnlly concealed from the
                                       is
readers of the English version.              In   seven   of tin nine instances          it    is
Je/tovah who uses this unorthodox language.

     The italics are my father's own, inserted, in the
copy from which        I  quote, in the red ink which he
used so freely.      Apparently this extract was intended
to serve as the foundation of an additional chapter,
for  I find enclosed in the book a large sheet of care
fully worked-out notes, in which a reference to the
"            "
   nephesh      of the    Hebrew      has  a   very prominent
place.
     " Man and Beast " was succeeded in the following
year — 1876 — by "Nature's Teachings," the leading
idea of which is the remarkable frequency with which
most    striking anticipations of human inventions may
be found in the world of Nature.              Man hits upon
what he considers        a   perfectly original notion, only
to find that Nature        has been before him, and that
the prototype      of his discovery has been existing for
countless ages in the world, ever ready to tell its
unmistakable story to those willing and able to
learn.    And from this was drawn the corollary that,
in the words of the Preface, " as existing human
inventions     have   been    anticipated   by Nature, so it
will surely be found that in Nature lie the proto
types of inventions not yet revealed to man.               The
great    discoverers   of the      future will, therefore,  be
those   who will look to Nature           for art, science, or
mechanics,     instead   of    taking pride in some new
invention, and then finding that it has existed in Nature
for countless    centuries."
     The first part of the book is Nautical, and shows
how the sail, the rudder, the oar, the screw, the

                      "NATURE'S      TEACHINGS:'                  97
cable,   the anchor,        and   the   boat-hook are all to be
found typified in Nature, together with almost every
other appliance which man employs for navigation in
its widest sense.          Part II. treats of War and Hunt
ing,   and      shows     the   analogy between the offensive
and    defensive       weapons of man, civilised and un
civilised, with those in the possession of animals
which existed in the world long before him. The
pitfall, the sword, the spear, the net, the "gin,'' the
hook, and even the blow-gun,               all are shown typically
to be     in the possession         of divers animals,     although
for the        most part invented         independently by man.
Then follow          in turn sections appropriated to archi
tecture,      tools,  optics,   and   useful   arts, and the   book
closes with a chapter on Acoustics, in which is shown
the analogy existing between the vibration of a violin-
 string and that of the notched ridge upon the wing-
case   of a cricket       ;  between     the   trombone    and   the
throat     of the swan        ; and between our " whispering
              "
 galleries       and the natural echo.
      The subject had always been a very favourite one
 with my father, and he was never tired of working
 it out, and showing its manifold applications. He
refers to it in several of his books ; he devoted to it
 many a magazine article ; and few of those who
ever attended his sketch-lectures will fail to recollect
how frequently he brought the same subject forward,
and how he delighted in showing, for instance, the
similarity between our life-boats and the egg-boat
 of the gnat; always with the remark                  that  in this,
           ii

as   in numberless        other      instances,     Nature     had   been
beforehand       with man.        And, alike in book, in article,
and    in    lecture,   he   always        brought the matter for
ward     with the       one intention of showing that the
same     Creator who embodied an idea in visible shape
in Nature put the germ of the same idea into the
mind of man,          and     thus that its independent, dual
existence forms one of the many proofs of the unity
                                                 I
of the Divine scheme. For — as have already stated
— he     always    preferred,     if   possible,   to point his moral
indirectly,      and   to   leave     it rather to        be   drawn by
inference than gathered            from direct statement.           Thus
he never       seasoned his writings            with texts, and sel
dom even        quoted    Scripture at all, although he might
be enlarging        upon the beauties of Nature and the
marvels of Creation.              Nature to him was God, and
Creation was God's work.                   Yet   he always abstained
 on   principle     from saying so in so many words, and
had     the     most utter detestation               of that form of
                                              "
 writing generally described              as    goody," which causes
many       a   reader    to    throw       aside   many      a   book   in
 disgust.       And yet the whole spirit of his writings
breathes the one great truth; which is never expressed
                                 The "              "
 but   always     implied.                  goody      element is care
 fully excluded, but yet the work which that element
 is intended to do is done.                Throughout all his work
 the clergyman and the             naturalist went hand in hand,
 and    the    one was always           the exponent       and   assistant
 of the other.

After      the issue of       "Nature's         Teachings" in 1870,
three whole years elapsed before any further book
appeared from my father's pen. For in that year began
the great depression in the book trade consequent upon
the    Russo-Turkish war ; a depression which, although
fluctuating in its severity, lasted for long after that
war had come to an end, and brought about the ruin
of thousands.           Money was scarce, for no man could
venture to say that England would not be drawn into
the struggle, and be forced to throw both her arms and
her    resources into the           scale.       Everywhere retrench
ment was the order of the day, for few could afford
luxuries while the national danger seemed so imminent                           ;
           h 2

and the    first luxury which a man denies himself at
times of financial difficulty is the purchase of books.
Firm after firm of publishers failed, and were forced to
make composition        with their creditors.     Others escaped,
but only by reducing their staff, cutting down expenses
to the lowest possible level, and discontinuing                the
production of new books.            And so, like many another
writer, my father was forced into practical idleness
between    the years 1876 and 1878, his literary labours
consisting merely in the production of occasional articles
for the monthly magazines.
    Partly from this        cause,   and partly, no doubt, from
the reaction     consequent upon the severe and incessant
labours of preceding years, his health gave way, and for
many    months,     while suffering from no definite com
plaint, he was seriously unwell.           If work had come to
him he would not have been able to perform it ; and at
one time, indeed,      it seemed    doubtful whether he would
ever write again.         Early in 1878, however, his strong
constitution    reasserted     itself, and he began to recover.
And from that time to the end of his life he was
scarcely really   ill  for a day.
    In the latter part of 1878 matters began to improve
in the literary world ; and in the course of the autumn
of that year he received        a commission    from the Society
for Promoting Christian Knowledge to write
                                                            " The
Lane and Field," as one of the series of small volumes
 which the Committee were              making arrangements      to
                                              " Natural
publish, under the general title of                      History
 Pambles."      Meanwhile the Belvedere house had been

              REMOVAL      TO  UPPER NORWOOD.                 101
given up (in December, 187Gj, and after some eighteen
months of semi-nomad life, we had settled down at
Upper Norwood, quite close to the High Level railway
station at the Crystal Palace.
     To the palace itself my father soon became a most
regular visitor. The library and reading-room attracted
him greatly, and thither, during the whole time that
we    lived at Norwood,      he repaired    nearly every    day,
generally for the purpose           of making notes, or of
working up some subject upon which he was about to
write. The music, too, was of course a great attraction.
Orchestral concerts were, as they still are, given daily,
either in the concert-room or upon the large Handel
orchestra in the central       transept.    A  part, at least, of
these he nearly always         managed    to attend, becoming
one of a small     party of musical enthusiasts, who were
looked upon as having a sort of prescriptive right upon
ordinary week-days to the seats which the professional
critics   occupied   upon   the    Saturdays, and     who,   full
orchestral score     in hand,     were   regularly to be seen
attentively following     the music from the first note of
the concert to the last.       He was one of the select few,
also, who by special favour obtained a card of admis
sion to the      rehearsals   for the well-known       Saturday
concerts, of which card he was by no means remiss in
 making use. And, after his manner, he soon con
trived to be on the most friendly terms with every
 official  connected    with    the building,    and to obtain
admission    at will  into those sacra privata from which
the general public were rigidly excluded.

 102               THE REV. J.    G. WOOD.
                                                          "
     Before the end of the year " The Lane and Field
had gone to press. It was not a hard book to write,
for all the necessary information had been acquired
years before, and little now remained to be done save
the actual preparation   of the manuscript, and the choice
of fit and proper illustrations.     And so my father was
enabled, at the same time, to work at a second book,
which for many years he had had in contemplation, but
which, for various reasons, he had never until now
been able to commence.
     This  was   a  new   edition of   Charles "Waterton's
famous "   Wanderings in South America," which, deeply
interesting as it is, is deprived of half its value to the
general reader by its author's singular fondness for the
use  of incomprehensible native titles in place of those
familiar to English ears ; so that the identification
of the various animals, plants, and trees is rendered
utterly impossible to those who do not possess a key
to this strange phraseology.          This key Waterton
always   steadily declined to provide ; and when, after
his death, the book was gradually passing out of
circulation, it occurred to my father that a new edition,
in which an explanatory index should be supplied,
                             "
while the "    Wanderings        themselves remained un
touched, might save a really valuable book from falling
into oblivion.
     And for the preparation of this new edition he was
peculiarly qualified.     He had regularly corresponded
with Waterton ; he had visited him at Walton Hall,
his marvellous bird- paradise in Yorkshire; and he had

                  WATERTON'S       "  WANDERINGS."                      103
received personal        and special instruction from him in
his wonderful system of taxidermy. And, moreover,
                                                          "
ever since first reading the " Wanderings                     as a boy,
he    had neglected no opportunity of identifying the
various animals, &c, which are therein mentioned.
Such an identification          was   by no means unnecessary,
as    my father points out           in the preface to the new
edition.
    The book fascinated me (he says, speaking of the " Wanderings "
when first they fell into his hands).   Week after week      I  took it out
of the (school) library, and really think that I  could have repeated it
verbatim from beginning to end. . . .     But there was one drawback
to the full enjoyment and comprehension of the book.         It mentioned
all kinds of animals, birds, and trees, and I  did not know what they
were, nor was there anyone who could tell me.          I   did not know
what a Salempenta was, except that it was good to eat.         It might be
a monkey, a fish, or a fruit.   Neither could    I  identify the Couan-
acouchi, Labarri, Camoudi, Duraquara, Houtou, or Karabimiti,
except that the three first were snakes, and the three hist were birds.
    It was certainly pleasant to learn that the traveller in Guiana
would be awakened by the crowing of the Hannaquoi, but there was
no one who could tell me what kind of a bird the Hannaquoi might
ba Then, as to trees,    I did not know the Siloabali, or the Wallaba,
or even the Purple-heart, nor how the last mentioned tree could be
made into a woodskin.      I  wanted a guide to the " Wanderings,"
and such a guide   I  have attempted to supply in the " Explanatory
            '
Index."
      This " Index," although it consists of less than one
hundred and fifty pages, was the fruit of an enormous
quantity of labour, the real amount of which did not
appear, owing to the fact that it had been distributed
over a considerable number of years.               The identification

itself was the principal difficulty.     Few travellers have
wandered through the wilds and forests of British Guiana,
and those who have done so seem for the most part to
have been somewhat        neglectful of its natural history.
All  the existing books upon the subject, however, were
consulted in the course of a few days' hard work in the
library of the British Museum        ;  and then came     inter
views    and   communications     with the officials of the
various natural history departments in the same institu
tion, the leading members of the Zoological Society,
and a number of others who happened to possess special
information upon the subject.       And so at length, by dint
of careful and persevering work, all the strange creatures,
                                         "              '*
plants, and trees mentioned in the         Wanderings       were
successfully   identified, and a short account of their life-
                               "
history procured for the         Explanatory Index." The
"Wanderings" themselves were left perfectly untouched,
in accordance with the often-expressed wish of their
author.       But a short biography of the celebrated
traveller was prefixed to the book, and an account of
his original system of taxidermy written by way of
conclusion ; and the book went to press on the last day
of October.
     Its  passage  through the printers' hands, however,
was somewhat delayed       ; and although    towards  the end
of November the proofs were coming in daily, it was
not until the 11th of December that the last sheet
appeared, and the index could be drawn up           ; and the
book had to be on the counters of the booksellers before
Christmas    !   On that day we had but little time for

             NATURAL HISTORY READING-BOOKS.               105
rest or refreshment.      At  half-past seven a messenger
from the printer arrived, with instructions not to take
his departure until the index was placed in his hands.
All   the afternoon and all the evening: we toiled, and at
last, an hour after midnight, the last slip was cut out
and gummed in its place, the last reference added, and
the boy departed with the manuscript, to get back to
town as best he might. And ten days later the first
edition of the work was in the hands of the booksellers.
     Early in 1879 "The Lane and Field" appeared;
and shortly afterwards my father entered into arrange
ments with Messrs. Isbister and Co. for the production
                                                  "
of   a series of six " Natural History Readers       for the
use of schools, graduated in accordance with the capa
bilities of the seven " standards," and        prepared    in
accordance     with the requirements    of the Educational
Commissioners.      These books, of course,     were   to be
divided off into "lessons" in the orthodox manner, were
to have all words not in common use carefully explained,
and were to embrace a review of the entire animal
kingdom, from the monkeys down to the sponges.          They
were, of course, published singly, at intervals, and were
quickly introduced into many schools in Great Britain.
Recently, too, they have been brought out in America,
and have there also met with a considerable amount of
success.
     A  few months later came " The      Field Naturalist's
Handbook,"      the joint . production of my father and
 myself, the monthly lists, &c, falling to my share,
while he wrote the preface and the introductions to the

106                    THE REV. J.       G.    WOOD.
various          This was followed by " Anecdotal
             months.
Natural History," also a joint production, and con
sisting of      a   series   of articles        originally      contributed
to the    Practical      Teacher.       Then came " Petland Re-
visited," a revised, enlarged, and illustrated edition of
the " Glimpses into Petland," which had appeared just
twenty years previously, and which was now brought
up to almost double its original size. And then my
father set to work upon a book which he had had in
contemplation for many years, and for which, mean
while, he had gradually been accumulating material.
    This was intended to point out the utter absurdity
of the              almost invariably received by the
             treatment
horse.  Man, my father held, with regard to this
animal, sets Nature altogether at defiance. He creates
for himself an artificial standard of beauty. He maims
the creature and impairs its usefulness by the very
means which he takes to improve its power                    of work..
And in all that he       does     for   it,   in respect to either its
accommodation,         its food, or its personal treatment, ther.e
seems    a   deliberate wrongheadedness,              a   careful rejection
of the better way in favour of the worse, which can
onty be explained            by
                       supposing a sort of inherent
perversity in those who have to do with horse manage
ment, and an obstinate determination to travel on in
the same beaten track in opposition to all the dictates
of commoa           sense,   of     experience,        and      of     science.
Nature       permits    unshod      horses       to    travel        over   the
hardest and roughest of ground without                       the slightest
injury to the hoofs; man, who thinks that he knows very

                       ¦'HORSE AND MAN."                    107
 much better than Nature, considers that a macadamised
 road will wear the hoofs away, and so first cuts and
                                          "
 mutilates them, and then " protects        them with a more
 or less heavy plate of iron. All the elaborately arranged
             "          " in
 system of     springs       the hoof is utterly destroyed by
 our system of shoeing.        The foot is rendered liable to
 numberless injuries and diseases, and both the strength
 and the endurance of the horse are greatly diminished,
 while experience shows that, even upon the roughest
 of roads, unshod horses will do more work, and do it
 much better, than those which have been treated          — or
 rather maltreated — in the orthodox manner.
      That is one leading idea of the book.         My father
 collected information upon the subject from all sources.
 He    consulted     comparative    anatomists,   professional
farriers,   and     veterinary   surgeons    almost   without
number.        He    read   every  book    bearing upon    the
subject which he could find.            He procured hoofs
and shoes of all sorts and sizes.         He induced several
of his friends to take the shoes from off their horses,
and, after a space of three       months   or so, to allow   of
the recovery of the hoofs from the bad treatment
which they had received, to work them as usual, but
without shoes, and to acquaint him with the results.
And when this was done, he made a point, whenever
possible, of seeing the horse for himself, and inspecting
its feet, in order that he might be able ¦to speak and
write about it from personal knowledge.             The con
sequence was that he acquired a vast amount of informa
tion upon the subject, and was able to give his judgment

108                      THE REV. J.          G.   WOOD.
as    that of one who thoroughly understood                    it in all its
branches.
   But " Horse and Man " by no means treats of the
hoof and the shoe alone.  That instrument of cruel
torture the bearing-rein comes in for strong censure
also, and it is pointed out how, in the desire to attain
a false and  utterly unnatural standard of beauty, the
health of the horse is injured, and its capability for work
greatly diminished, while it is                    subjected    to positive
agony by the abominable appliance in question.  Many
of the diseases to which horses are subject are traced
entirely to its use, while it is shown that it can serve nu
useful purpose whatever, and cannot be defended on
the ground either of utility or of elegance.
    Then the ridiculous appliances known as " blinkers
                                                                          "
are attacked in their turn ; and it is shown that they
injure the eye — partly by heating                 it,
                                    and partly by strain
ing the vision —that they     frequent cause of "shying"
                                    are   a
upon the part of their wearer, who can obtain merely a
transitory and imperfect view of some unfamiliar object,
and so naturally takes alarm, while their only possible
function    is    to protect the eyes from the whip of             a   care
less driver   !     For, as riding horses are never seen with
blinkers,   it    is    to pretend that their office
                       impossible                                         is
to prevent the animal from catching sight of objects
which might alarm it; saddle horses being obviously
as    liable to alarm as those in harness.
      Then follow        a   few words upon the now, happily,
                                               "

while the last two chapters are devoted to defects in

the preface states, " a parallel is drawn between the
horse   and   the steam-engine,   and an attempt is made
to show that those who have the management             of the
former or the latter will be adapted to their task in

     Of course, the book provoked   a perfect storm    of dis
approval from professional men, who found their leading
ideas ridiculed, and the many defects of their system
ruthlessly    exposed.  That my father        had   expected.
Many of the reviews, too, were adverse, and some spoke
of the folly shown by any one who should take upon
himself   to   write upon such    a  subject,   not being a
qualified veterinary surgeon.      That he had expected
also.    So much interested opposition had in the first
instance to be overcome that he      did not at all despair
of ultimate success, and he was content to wait quietly
until the new teaching should have had a fair trial,
and its results be made apparent.          And by-and-by
letters began to reach him — at first very occasionally,
but afterwards with greater frequency — from those who
had been induced by. the book to follow out his in
structions, and who, having done so, felt bound to write
and thank him for the results which they had obtained.
Here is one of the most interesting of the letters in
 question  :
             —

110                     THE REV. J.       0.  WOOD.
                                        "Preston,     28<A Ap-il,  1887.
    " Dear Sir,
          " Through reading about ' Unshod Horses ' in your book
' Horse and Man,' my father and       I  decided to try the experiment ;
and on the 3rd or 4th of January of this year we had the shoes
taken off one of our ponies (aged seven), and commenced to prepare
it for running without them, as advised in your book.             Since the
beginning of March it has done its ordinary work without shoes,
and  I have driven as many as forty miles in the day without any
damage to the hoof.
    " To-day our man has been down to Lytham, thirteen miles
¦distant,   and on the road   he was     stopped by Inspector    T       , of
the Royal Society     for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and
told that we must have the shoes put on again, as in the Inspector's
opinion running without shoes was cruelty to animals.
    " We feel much inclined to persevere in our course, and should
be much obliged if you could give us any assistance or information
in the event of the Inspector taking action.
    " Awaiting the favour of your reply,
                                  " I  am,
                                           " Yours sincerely,
                                                 " J       H. T       ."
     This letter — with the exception of the concluding
paragraphs      — is   a  type   of     several    which      my father
received, and of which he was very proud, never letting
an opportunity pass of referring to them in his sketch-
lectures or his magazine            articles.     For he      was    by no
means satisfied with attacking the many abuses of horse
management merely in a book, which would, and could,
be read      only by a very small proportion of the com
munity.        The new teaching, if it were to prosper and
to bear fruit, could not be too widely spread ; and so
a   special      sketch-lecture     was      prepared,     and     special
magazine articles        from time to time written upon the

             "ILLUSTRATED      STABLE MAXIMS."             Ill
subject.    The lecture was delivered     in all parts of the
kingdom,    as well  as in America;    in  some cases — as at
Bristol — before an audience composed almost entirely
of those whom it was specially necessary to influence.
Shoes actually taken from the feet of horses were
exhibited, together with specimens of hoofs, both shod
and unshod.       The anatomy of the animal was carefully
explained, and illustrated by many drawings in coloured
chalks upon the great black canvas. And, with regard
to the literary part of the task which he had set him
self, almost   the very last magazine      articles which my
father wrote were a series, upon the popular errors of
horse management and treatment, for the Leisure Hour,
which are appearing      in that periodical at the time of
writing these lines.
     In  another way, also, he strove to disseminate the
leading principles of the new teaching ; namely, by the
                                                   "
 production of a large coloured chart entitled Illustrated
Stable Maxims," showing by means of coloured diagrams
some of the anatomical peculiarities of the horse's body,
and intended to be hung         in stables for the benefit of
 grooms   and coachmen.       The sheet also contains short
 " Instructions "
                    upon the Structure of the Hoof, Feed
 ing, Watering, Air, the Bearing-rein, Blinkers, and
 Stable Medicines, and forms,       in fact, in the briefest
 possible form, a kind of epitome of the book.
     Almost    as  soon as
                            " Horse and Man        ''
                                                      had been
placed   in the printer's hands, my father set to work
upon another book for the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge : a more important one than its

predecessor, the          "Lane    and Field," and treating, not
of natural history at all, in the ordinary acceptation
of the term, but — under the title of " Man and his
Handiwork" — of the gradual advance of the human
race from savagery to civilisation, as shown by the
works of their hands. The book is not a very large
one — consisting of. some six hundred and fifty octavo
pages,    set       in large type, and profusely illustrated — but
includes        a    good deal.    It   opens somewhat          strangely,
with the sentence "            A   horse     cannot  play the piano,"
and then proceeds to show                   the vast difference of the
human hand from the corresponding member in any
other animal, and the part which it plays in the arts
and inventions, as well as in the daily life of mankind.
And it is also pointed out that the hand of man makes
the tools and weapons which, in the members of the
animal world, are provided by the hand of Nature.
Man makes out of iron and wood a spade wherewith to
dig, but the mole, which, in proportion to its dimen
sions, is a far better excavator  than any living man,
has its spade naturally provided for                  it,
                                         in the form of
its own specially-modified fore limbs. Man makes oars
wherewith to row his boat               ;   but the water-beetles and
water-boatmen            have their hinder limbs            modified   into
oars, wherewith they row their own boat-like bodies.
And so on. And then       traced out the gradual de
                                   is
velopment of human tools, weapons, utensils, clothing,
and ornament,            from the primitive           relics which     have
been     brought to light by geology,               down to their com
paratively perfected representatives of the present day

                "MAN AND HIS HANDIWORK"                     113
The    work,    of  course,  is    largely  ethnological.   It
takes in much of the ground already covered in the
"Natural History of Man," although approaching it
from a totally different point of view, man being con
sidered with regard to what he does, rather than to
what he is.      And the contrast between civilisation and
uncivilisation   is constantly brought      forward, while at
the same time the great gulf fixed, which separates the
savage from the brute, is never forgotten.
    And it is these two latter points which inspire the
closing lines of the book.          I
                                  " mention this
                                                      phase of
human existence," runs the last                  "
                                      paragraph,   as  showing
the common humanity of ourselves at the present day,
and of the races who lived and left their handiwork
behind them as the only memorial of a long-vanished
epoch.     It is impossible, moreover, for anyone to con
template even the simplest example of man's handi
work, be it but a flint flake or a notched bone, and not
to feel that it indicates       the   impassable  gulf which
separates the lowest of the human race from the highest
of all other inhabitants of earth."
    From this it will be seen that my father was no
believer in the theory of evolution, at any rate so far
as it concerns the development of man.         Other passages
in his books speak even more strongly and decidedly
upon the subject.
                        " Anyone," he says, in the larger
" Natural                                                " who
             History," with reference to the gorilla,
could fancy himself to be descended, however remotely,
from such a being, is welcome to his ancestry." And
for many years after the doctrine was set before the

world,  I  believe, he rejected   it in  toto.    But latterly, I
fancy — although he could never be induced to talk upon
the subject, beyond admitting that, in his opinion, the
theory was in no way opposed to religion — he some
what modified     his convictions,    holding that evolution
 was no doubt responsible for much in the way of animal
 development, without granting to it the almost limitless
 power which    many naturalists claim.          But it was far
from easy to gather his views regarding a subject upon
which he was so reticent, and upon which he evidently
considered   that it was as yet premature to pronounce a
decided opinion.
     The last of my father's works published during his
lifetime was the " Handy Natural History," a book
written   specially for boys, and produced           under the
auspices of the Religious Tract Society.            It  treats of
the vertebrate    animals only, and has no higher aim
than to give such a pleasant readable account of the
animals which it describes as to lead the youthful
reader to seek other sources of information also, and to
persevere in the study which he has taken              up.   The
book appeared in 1886.
     Of posthumous works there are three, only two of
which are as yet actually published. One is " The
Brook and its Banks," originally written in the form of
a series of connected        articles for the Girl's Own
Paper, which has now, at the time of writing (October,
1889), just appeared in volume form.           It gives a short,
brightly   written   account    of the different creatures,
aquatic and terrestrial, which are to be found in or

                     POSTHUMOUS    WORKS.                 115
 about our smaller streams, and contains many references
 to the zoological experiences of my father's own boy
 hood.
      Then there is " The Dominion       of Man,"  a  larger
 and    more   important work, recently published by
 Messrs. Richard Bentley and Co., under the motto of
 " The  fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon
 every   beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the
 air, and upon all the fishes of the sea ; into your hand
 are they delivered."    The book treats of the sovereignty
 of man over the lower animals, and traces back that
 sovereignty to pre-historic times, through the medium
 of the cave and rock inscriptions which have of late so
 much attracted     the attention of scholars.   This book
 was begun and finished in 1887, and is very characteristic
 both in style and treatment.

      Lastly, there is a small book on Ant Life," which
 was written in the first place for The Sun magazine,
and of which the two last chapters were still incomplete
at the time of my father's death.           The preceding
fourteen chapters have already appeared in the magazine
in question, and probably will sooner or later     be  pub
lished in volume form.

Besides those which.            I  have already         mentioned        in the
course of preceding            chapters,     several books have from
time to time appeared bearing my father's name. Of
these, perhaps, the only one that can claim to take rank
as a separate      work is a small handbook on " Bees and
their Management," edited by him in quite the early part
of his career, and published by Messrs. George Boutledge
and Co., as one of their series of popular shilling hand
 books for the country.             He was not very well satisfied
with this himself,          I  fancy, and afterwards wished that
 it had not borne his name.              I   do not remember ever to
 have seen a copy, and have no doubt that                         it has long
since fallen out of circulation.
      The remainder of these books consist partly of smaller
volumes cut down from his larger works, partly of
collections of articles which had been previously pub
lished in the periodical press. The first of the former
class to appear,          I   believe, was " Strange Dwellings,"

              ABRIDGMENTS AND REPRINTS.                     117
extracted, with a few     alterations and additions, from
" Homes without Hands " a book of about half the size,
                              ;
but with sufficient of the original matter to render the
scheme   precisely  similar. The "      Boy's   Own Natural
History," in like manner, was cut down from the large
three-volume work which was completed in 1863.
"Insects at Home" yielded — in 1882 — "Common
British Insects," which included a selection only of
the beetles, butterflies, and moths described in the
                                                        " Wild
larger work. And the list is completed by
Animals of the Bible," " Domestic Animals of the
Bible," and " Birds of the Bible," all of which were
extracted from " Bible Animals."
    Of the second class of these supplementary books,
comprising    those   which     consist  merely   of reprinted
                     " Out of Doors " has
magazine articles,                               already been
mentioned as appearing in 1874.           This was followed
                                      "
about ten years later, first by         My Back-yard Zoo,"
and afterwards by      " The Romance of Animal Life,"
and   " Half Hours in Field and Forest," all three of
which consist of articles originally contributed to Good
 Words   and    The  Sunday     Magazine.      Latterly, also,
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge has
published part of a long series of articles written
for  The   Child's Pictorial     in two handsome quarto
volumes, under the title of " The Zoo."               A third
volume will probably follow. Their principal feature is
that the illustrations — from the pencil of Mr. Harrison
Weir — are for the most part in colours.           The books,
of course, are intended for children's reading.

  118                THE REV. J.  G.  WOOD.
      The   magazines   to  which my father     at different
 times    contributed are somewhat      numerous  ;   and  no
 doubt to the list which     I  have been able to draw up
 many more might be added, of which no record has
  been preserved.
      London   Society was one of the first for which he
 wrote.     In   this appeared four of the papers since
                 " Out of Doors,"                   "
 reprinted in                        among them       Turkey
 and Oysters," and an essay entitled
                                          " Our River Har
 vests,"   giving   a description of the science of fish-
 hatching as it existed in its earliest infancy. In the
  Cornhill Magazine appeared, among others, two long
 articles upon the inner life of a hospital, written during
 the time of the chaplaincy at St. Bartholomew's, and
 one giving a description of Walton Hall, the celebrated
 abode    of Charles Waterton, the traveller, under the
 title of " The Home of a Naturalist." In the Boy's
  Own Magazine, which flourished — more or less — for
 about   eight years, was published the long series of
 articles entitled " The Zoological Gardens," which
 practically amounted to a complete Natural History in
 themselves    before they  were brought to a premature
 conclusion by the bankruptcy of the publisher.          And
 besides these, several other    shorter papers appeared in
 the same periodical upon a variety of subjects not con
 nected with natural history, but dear to the hearts of
                         "                  '
juvenile readers. In The Dark Blue were published
 " De Monstris " — an account of that
                                            very remarkable
              "                          "—"
 book the        Nuremberg Chronicle           Mrs. Coates'
 Bath," and several other papers, for the most part

                    MAGAZINE     ARTICLES.                    119
 treating of some phase of insect life. The St. James's
 Magazine brought out "A Summer Walk through an
 English Lane," and "The Bepose of Nature."                 Once
                       "
 a Week produced         My Toads," " Medusa and her
 Locks," and several other short essays ; and a variety
 of articles   also  appeared    in   All  the   Year   Round,
 Tlie Churchman's Magazine, The Home Visitor (a some
 what lengthy series), and the Daily Telegraph.
      But during all the earlier part of my father's career
 he seems to have looked upon writing for magazines
 or newspapers rather as an occasional relaxation than
 as  an item of serious   business.     By far     the  greater
part of his time was occupied in the production of
books, and his contributions to periodical literature were
few    and  far between.   It  was not, indeed, until the
great    depression  which    existed   in   the   book   trade
between the years 1876 and 1S80 that he set himself
systematically to magazine work, with the exception of
that period during which he was connected with the
                                                  " The    Zoo
Boy's    Own Magazine,    and    was   writing
                  "
logical Gardens and other papers for its columns.           But
when no publisher would venture to undertake the risk
of producing a book ; when those copyrights which he
had retained were bringing      in little or nothing    :  then
he took to magazine writing upon a somewhat extensive
scale.   And thenceforward, up to the very end of his
life, he was a constant contributor to many magazines,
and was generally busy with his type-writer in the
                "      "
production of copy for some publication or other.
     He was one of the first writers engaged for the

 120               THE REV. J.    G. WOOD.
 Boys Own Paper when that popular periodical was in
 contemplation,   and contributed an article entitled " Out
 with a Jack-knife," to the very first number.       This was
followed by a long series of papers on swimming,
skating, and other athletic exercises, as well as on all
kinds of subjects connected with the collection and
preservation of insects.     After the two first years or
so   these  papers   appeared   only   occasionally,  the last
which he wrote for the magazine, on Charles Waterton's
                                                   I
system of bird-stuffing, being published in — believe —
1885.
     For  the companion magazine, the Girts Own Paper,
my father wrote only the long series of papers entitled
 " The Brook and its Banks,"
                                     already referred to as
having been published since his death in volume form.
In the Leisure Hour, issued by the same society, he
wrote frequently, and, as already mentioned,        a series of
articles upon the treatment     and management       of horses
appeared in its columns after his death.
     To the Sunday Magazine,         however,     he   perhaps
contributed more regularly than to any other periodical,
and for many successive years not a volume ap
peared    which   did not contain     several  articles   from
his pen.     Three volumes of these articles — as already
stated — have hitherto been issued, and doubtless others
will in    due  course  succeed them.      To Good      Words,
also, he was a frequent,      although not a regular con
tributor, and was engaged upon a paper to be pub
lished in its pages at the very time of his death.
     Longmans Magazine was another of the periodicals

                      MAGAZINE ARTICLES.                       121
for which he occasionally wrote, and among the articles
 which have appeared therein are one upon the whale,
another upon the mole, and a third upon " My Garden
 "Wall." The Church Monthly has had a series of short
                  " Our Fellow Creatures "        the   Sun   has
 papers upon                                   ;
                                                         " Ant "
published fourteen chapters of the unfinished
book ; and the Practical Teacher brought out twenty-
                      " Anecdotal Natural
five articles on                             History," which
have    since appeared in volume form, and have also
been modified       into a series of Natural History Read
ing-books.       For A 1 he wrote frequently during the
first year of its publication, and also contributed at
"the same time to Our Own Gazette, which was then
under the same          management.      Social Notes, which
appeared for nearly three years under the editorship of
the late Mr.        Samuel    Carter Hall,  had many        short
papers from his pen       ;  in the Hereford Times occasional
special    articles    appeared  ; and  he   also   wrote one
article each for the Nineteenth Century (on           " Modern
Museums "), the Argosy, and Temple Bar, the latter
of which, I believe, has still to appear.
     As a contributor to magazines intended especially
for juvenile readers, too, my father was in frequent
request,   and at different times he wrote for Little Folks,
 Our Little Darlings (a long series of papers), and the
                                                      "
Child's Pictorial, in which appeared the " Zoo           articles
now being issued in volume form by the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge.             And, finally, with
regard to transatlantic literature, he once contributed
an essay     (" The     Trail of the Sea Serpent ") to the

122               THE REV. J.    G.    WOOD.
Atlantic Monthly, and was a tolerably frequent contribu
tor during the latter years of his life to the Youth's
Companion, a well-known American publication.
      I
     may also mention that, about the year 1870,
               "
when " Mistram   became for a time a fashionable
round game, he published a small pamphlet - hand
book upon the game, similar in form to the well-known
" Hints
        upon Whist-playing," by Cavendish.    The
game was a favourite one with him for a time, and
he even managed to work a certain amount of science
and calculation into his play.                     *
      It
      now only remains for me briefly to summarise
my father's literary work as a whole.      It is not for
me, of course, to criticise it in any way, or to discuss
the question   of his position        in the    dual worlds of
science and letters.    I may,   perhaps, however, be per
mitted to make one or two remarks upon the labours
of his life ; and in the first place to point out that
he never in any way      attempted   to pose as a man of
science.   Quite at the      beginning of his career he
saw that his forte and his opportunity lay in the
popularisation of natural history ; in making it a
study of living and ever-increasing interest to the
many, and not a mere monopoly for the few ; and in
clearing away the hedge of technicalities and repellent
phraseology which surrounded      it,
                                 and which practically
debarred   all who had not received       a    special scientific
education from taking   it  up at all. For pure classifi-
cators, abstractedly   scientific though they might be,

                    TWO       TYPES OF NATURALISTS.                            123
he entertained            a       rooted       and    measureless       contempt.
" Certain
            dreadfully scientific persons," he says in one
of his articles, " who call themselves        the name of       by
'
    naturalists,' seem             to consider         zoology and compara

which      no one can read without an expensive Greek
lexicon,      and    to           put up           its remains       in cells and

bottles.  They delight in an abnormal hoemopophysis                             ;
they pin their faith on       pterygoid processa  they                    ;
stake their reputation on the number of tubercles in                            a

      His own        ideanaturalist may be seen by
                                   of   a
what follows — " Then there are the field naturalists,'
                 :

              village
eyes and telling his friends what he has seen. Another
wanders far abroad in quest of new wonders, and                                if

                            "
the distinctively " field     naturalist would often find
himself at fault.      But he did from his        very heart
despise, detest, and abhor the men who pretend          to be
naturalists and yet have no love at all for Nature,
whose only desire upon seeing an animal is the desire
to  kill it, and who are never      thoroughly happy un
less they have a scalpel in their hands, and a half-
                     "
dissected " subject     before them.
    He was     a compiler himself, no doubt     ;  the  accu
sation has sometimes been brought against him, and
the accusation is undoubtedly true.        But he was also
an original and painstaking observer, and never lost an
opportunity of watching an animal for himself, and of
recording its ways and doings from personal observa
tion in preference to trusting to the report of another.
Such opportunities for observation     as  he could   obtain,
he used to the best advantage.                           I
                                    He never, so far as am
         "         "
aware,     read up   a subject simply and solely for the
purpose of writing an article upon it ; he loved — and
showed that he loved — natural history for its own
sake ; and he would take any trouble in order to clear
up a vexed question purely for his own satisfaction,
without a thought of its possible usefulness from
a pecuniary point of view.       And a very considerable
proportion of his writings is based entirely upon per
sonal observation.
    But what man could possibly do the work which
he did without being a compiler ? What man, however
laborious and painstaking in the field, however diligent

                POPULARISING NATURAL HISTORY.                                     125
and unremitting  in his studies, could hope to produce
such a work as the " Natural History," or even as
" Homes without Hands," from
                                   personal observation
and experience ? The thing is not to be done.    Either
a man  must compile, or else such books are not to be
written. But compilation does not necessarily exclude
original work         ;    and when the two go together in com
petent     hands, a            good   and    useful book       is   tolerably
sure to be the result.
    Undoubtedly my father's great distinction was that
of being the pioneer in the work of popularising natural
history, and presenting it to the general public in the
form of an alluring and deeply interesting study. He
had many subsequent imitators, but he himself imitated
no one.        He found zoology              a    dull and dry study, open
to none but the favoured few who enjoyed special apti
tude, special opportunities, and special circumstances for
its pursuit.    He left it an open book of world-wide
interest, needing no scholar to read or interpret  no                       it,
unusual        zeal       or   persistence       in order to decipher             its
secrets.       His    was the pen that led other pens to write
upon the subject.  His was the enthusiasm which fired
the enthusiasm of others  which made observers out of
                                      ;
mechanics,        and naturalists out of artisans.                  And to
gether with ability and enthusiasm he united dogged                 a
perseverance which enabled him to accomplish   work                     a
which, even so far as its mere extent                  is   concerned, very
few men have excelled.
     Is   unbecoming in me, as his son, to say all this

whatever as to the quality of his work, and                   I   say little
of its results   ;   and    I endeavour      merely to put forward

out mention. All that              I
                          claim for my father is that he
did what no man had attempted to do before him ; that,
alike by pen and by word of mouth, he gave the greater
part of his life to the popularisation of natural history ;
and that in that task he succeeded.                  "Whether he was a
man of science, or not,            I do
                            not pretend to say ; as to
whether he was even a remarkable writer,  do not offer    I
an opinion.      And       if,   in what  I     have said, there be any
thing which good taste would have left unwritten,                  I    can
only deeply regret         it,   and ask for the indulgence of my
readers.

Throughout almost the whole of his career                      as an    author
my father delivered occasional lectures on natural history
subjects ; sometimes gratuitously, for the benefit of
parochial funds ; sometimes at the special request of
scientific societies, and upon the ordinary terms of
remuneration.          These lectures, as may well be imagined,
were very different in character from those which in
later years formed an important part of his regular pro
fessional work.        The power of extempore free-hand draw
ing had not yet been developed, and he was contented
to illustrate his remarks by means of diagrams and
specimens.         He had not yet struck out the original line
which he afterwards made so peculiarly his own.                             And

 128                    TEE REV. J.      G.   WOOD.
these, his first lectures,          were more orthodox in style
 than the humorous,            unconventional        addresses    of his
later years, for which they paved the way, while wholly
unlike them in character.
      The first lecture of which         I  can find any record was
delivered     in Oxford Town Hall, on March 11, 1856,
and was apparently very successful.                  My father's own
entry in his diary for that day is            :
                                                —
     Engaged all afternoon    in hanging diagrams in Town Hall.       De
livered first part of lecture  in evening with much applause.
The preparation for this lecture appears to have occupied
some little time, and the lecture itself to have been read
from a manuscript.             As to its subject,      I    can find no
 information.
      The first note concerning it occurs on February 1st,
when the final arrangements seem to have been made.
On the Gth of the same month is the brief entry, Read
                                                                 "
               "                                                       "
for lecture ; on the 8th, " Began to write lecture ;
                  " Made                                "
 on the 13th,                 drawings for lecture ; and on the
 lGth, "Wrote three pages of lecture." After this the
 entries become more frequent, and there seems to have
 been trouble with regard to the diagrams.                   There is an
                                                          "

and another, on the day preceding                 that of the lecture,
                                            "                         Of
briefly noting that they were                   very expensive."
the second part of the lecture                I  can find no mention
whatever.       Possibly it was never delivered at all, as
just at this time the chaplaincy at St. Bartholomew's
Hospital fell vacant, and on March the 25th my father

              THE FIRST SEETGH-LECTURES.                      129
left Oxford for a short sojourn in town, during which
he called upon the members of the Board of Governors.
After this, his time    seems to have been much         taken up
with the necessary preparations for removal; and no
 doubt the second part of the lecture was, in conse
 quence, abandoned.
     Other lectures were given at Nottingham and at
Botherhithe (on British Guiana) in 1864, at the Stein-
way Hall, London, and at Bath, in 1869, and afterwards
 at Eritb, and at Belvedere       upon several occasions, of
the dates of which       I  can find no record.     But it was
not until 1879 that any idea crossed my father's mind
of taking up lecturing as a kind of secondary profession.
In that year, however, he received a letter from Dr.
Chaning-Pearce, who was then residing at Brixton, and
who was anxious for a series of afternoon lectures, for
the benefit of his friends, in the large geological museum
attached to his house.        Six lectures were accordingly
arranged, admission     to be by invitation only      ;  and the
first was delivered on the afternoon        of April 12th, the
                " Hibernation."      A
subject being                           large audience assem
bled, and the lecture was enthusiastically received        ; and
on the five following       Saturdays   the course was con
tinued, with steadily increasing success, the subjects of
" Migration," " Aerial Life," " Sub-aquatic Life," and
"                       "
   Subterranean   Life     being successively   treated,   while
the last lecture was devoted to such
                                              "
                                                Unappreciated
Insects," as the cockroach, the earwig, the blue-bottle
fly, and the gnat.      And before it was completed my
father had made up his mind to undertake lecturing as
        J

130                    THE REV. J.        G. WOOD.
a sub-profession,        and to devote to         it  at least the best
months of the winter of every year.
      A   rather amusing incident occurred in connection
with one of these Brixton lectures.                   My father, in the
course of his remarks,            had happened to speak of the
excellence of rats' flesh as an article of diet, pointing
out that the almost universal repugnance to it was
simply a matter of prejudice, and that it was in reality
far more delicate and well-flavoured than that of rabbit
or hare, and stating that he himself had often partaken
of the dainty in question, and hoped often to do so
again.      Although the lectures were private, accounts
of them were regularly sent to the local newspapers                          ;
and by the succeeding Saturday the following                        notice
had been copied into pretty well half the newspapers in
the kingdom       :
                    —
      Having in the course of his lecture to allude to the hedgehog
and the squirrel, Mr. Wood observed that it was well known that
these animals, when      dead and    properly cooked, formed       excellent
articles  for human    food.   Few people were, however, aware that,
when similarly treated, the flesh of a rat had a finer flavour, and was
altogether   a greater   delicacy   than either    of  them.    There was
literally nothing of which he (the lecturer) was so fond as a rat-pie.
This was a dish which frequently made its appearance on his table,
and was enjoyed by all the members of his family.           He had several
friends, too, who, like himself, had overcome their prejudice, and
thoroughly enjoyed a good helping of rat-pie.         He remembered one
most interesting    case  of a whole    family who, except the parents,
were extremely fond of this dish.       They were in very good circum
stances, owning large grain stores on the Medway.           Their residence
was close by, and rats abounded in the neighbourhood.                 It was
always   their custom  when   their  parents  were  out to have  their  great
treat.   This being the   case  on one occasion, dinner-time came, and
every one was ready for the repast, which consisted of a pie             con

                                   BAT-PIE.                              131
taining sixteen large rats, when a knock at the door was heard, and
in a few minutes grandmamma, accompanied by two young ladies,
 was announced.        Except their savoury pie, the young people had
 nothing in the house to offer their unexpected guests for dinner,
and, what was still more inconvenient, being some distance from
a market, nothing could be procured.            Undaunted, however, the
eldest son, who presided at the table, invited the visitors to sit down
to dinner, and, addressing his grandmother, asked whether he should
help her to some gull--pie.      The old lady expressed her astonishment
at the idea of their having such a dish for dinner, but at last con
 sented, as did also the young ladies, to take a small piece.      This was
followed     by larger helpings, and, like the rest of the diners, the old
lady   made    a hearty meal.   Having come some distance grandmamma
stopped the night, and next morning at the breakfast-table, to the
great amusement of the children,         expressed a wish to have some of
      "      "
the     gull pie which she had enjoyed so much on the previous day.
Inquiries being made below-stairs, it was found that the servants
had devoured the fragments.           The young lady visitors, too, it was
said, were afterwards constantly asking their gentlemen friends, in
the season, to shoot them some gulls, so that they might try their
hands at making the delicious pie.
      Naturally this account aroused               a good     deal of at
tention, and          my father was shortly the              recipient of
numberless         letters,   some      simply making inquiries as
to the proper          way of preparing the novel             dainty for
table, some asking whether the newspaper reports could
possibly be accurate, and some abusing him in the
roundest terms for even mentioning the flesh of so
repulsive a creature as a possible article of diet.
      I  quote — verbatim et literatim          — the    most    amusing

      The comic papers, too, made much of the oppor
tunity, and for three or four weeks were full of jokes,
poems, and illustrations, all bearing on the novel dainty.
One of the wittiest            of these       I   give    herewith, as for
some years        my father had it printed, together with the
companion         illustration, in the syllabus to his sketch

 134                THE BEV. J.       G.   WOOD.
              And Wood, M.A., his best may say
                Rodential in laudation,
              But the rat-pie will still defy
                All ratiocination.
     No doubt these various skits gave amusement                 to
thousands,    but they had besides this most beneficial
effect, that they made the sketch-lectures known. Those
few remarks concerning the flesh of the rat — uttered in
parenthesis,   and quite without         forethought —did what
no amount of advertising could have done, for they, or
the references made to them, found their way into every
newspaper, and     everywhere excited         public interest and
attention.     So that     when,     a few months later, the
sketch-lectures    proper     began,      the  way was     already
paved for them, and thousands came to see in the flesh
the man who had actually eaten rat-pie           !
     Before these lectures could be undertaken,          however,
many preliminaries had of necessity to be arranged.             In
the first place, an agent had to be found, who should
undertake all the correspondence, advertising, and organ
isation, and leave the lecturer nothing to do but to
travel to the appointed spot and deliver his lecture.
By a lucky chance my father almost immediately found
the very man he wanted, in the person              of Mr. George
H. Robinson, manager of the New Book Court in the
Crystal Palace.      Terms were speedily arranged.            Lec
turer and agent were to share preliminary expenses,
and all arrangements were to be made by the latter,
who in return was to receive a commission on the fees.
     Here, perhaps,   I should mention that          my father on

                 AN AGENT AND HIS        WORK.             135
no   occasion   lectured at his own risk.       Terms were
always   made    with   some local organiser, who paid       a
definite fee without reference to the receipts, and prac
tically took the entire responsibility into his own hands.
By this plan the services of a travelling agent were
rendered    unnecessary,   and travelling   expenses corres
pondingly minimised.
     During the ten      seasons   over  which   the  sketch-
lectures   extended   (1879-1888 inclusive), lecturer and
agent worked together upon the most friendly terms, and
the arrangement     proved a success    in every way.    Cir
culars were sent, early in the summer, to all the schools,
colleges, natural history societies, and lecture     commit
tees   in the kingdom, and the dates of lectures            so
arranged that prolonged tours could be made, with only
the minimum of travelling between the different towns
en route.    All  correspondence     was conducted    by Mr.
Robinson, arrangements made, fees settled, and even the
train service worked out, and the particular trains to and
from each town decided upon.          Thus weeks before a
lecture my father would know when, where, and whence
he had   to go, the dimensions of the platform, the size
of the hall, and the character and situation of the light,
and could make his own private arrangements           accord
ingly.    All these details both agent and lecturer entered
in  a huge ledger,   with — in my father's case — a kind of
abstract — lstly, in his diary, 2ndly, in a pocket note
book, and, 3rdly, in a " memoriser," or folding engage
ment card.
     The next thing was to       see  about accommodation,

136                THE REV. J.   G. WOOD.
which was generally freely offered.     Indeed, throughout
his career as a lecturer, my father was hardly ever
obliged to sleep at an hotel, owing to the kindness       and
hospitality of the numberless friends whom he made on
his travels ; and very commonly he was obliged to
refuse three or four invitations, which would perhaps
reach him almost simultaneously.       And, finally, notices
had to be sent round to the different secretaries          or
managers, with particulars as to time of arrival, lug
gage, &c, in order    that arrangements might be made
for conveying both lecturer and apparatus from the
railway station to the lecture hall.
     Still, however — and before even the preliminary
circulars could be sent out — very much had to be done.
In  the first place a syllabus had to be drawn up       ;  no
easy matter, as  it practically involved  the writing out of
tolerably full notes for some fourteen or fifteen lectures,
in order that a brief abstract of these might be supplied
as a guide to secretaries, &c.      Then, when these were
printed, a small photograph had to be affixed to each ;
a practice which was continued until the great increase
in the number of circulars sent out rendered it imprac
ticable.
     Next a portable drawing-frame had to be designed
and constructed; and this proved to be a long and
tedious undertaking.     My father had soon discovered,
not only that he possessed an almost unique talent for
what may be best denominated " descriptive freehand
drawing," but that audiences were far more interested
and    pleased  by  even a rough-and-ready        extempore

sketch than by the most carefully prepared and elaborate
diagrams.     He had used the ordinary black drawing-
 boards for the Brixton lectures, and had found them to
answer his purpose fairly well in a comparatively       small
room.    But now, with the prospect before him of lec
 turing in large buildings, before audiences of perhaps
twelve or fourteen hundred,       he clearly saw that some
thing on   a larger scale must be provided, if the effect of
his drawings was not to be entirely lost. Now what was
                    "
this " something to be ?          Clearly it would be of no
use to construct      an ordinary blackboard of gigantic
dimensions, for the difficulty of carriage would form an
insuperable   obstacle, while   it would   be  at best but a
very clumsy piece of apparatus upon the platform.           A
blackboard,   again, upon the ordinary tripod stand has
no sort of stability   ; a leg slips, or the  whole thing is
unsteady, or perhaps even collapses with a run.       Plainly
this would not do at all    ; but the puzzle was to provide
a more efficient substitute.
     At length, however, after much thought, and a long
discussion with one of the engineers employed by the
Crystal Palace Company, the difficulty was overcome.
An iron framework of great strength, some seven feet in
height by eight in width, was constructed in such a
manner as to stand firmly erect when braced up by two
strong stays. In the central part of this framework, which
was grooved     to accommodate       them, were placed   four
blackboards, fitting closely side by side, and so accurately
adjusted that a perfectly uniform surface was presented
when they were tightly screwed together.         Ornamental

tops to the two upright poles, and three strong boxes to
contain the whole,      completed     the equipment     ;  and so
was supplied a blackboard       which was large enough to
accommodate a drawing eight feet long by four and
a half feet wide, which was fairly portable, and which
could be easily erected even upon           a  narrow platform.
And now the lecturing began in earnest.
     First of all it was deemed advisable, in order to
obtain an advertisement      for the syllabus, that a course
of lectures should be delivered at the Polytechnic Insti
tution, an engagement at which might be looked upon
                           "
as a  sort of " hall-mark     to a lecturer.     The prosperity
of the building, it is true, was then on the wane, and it
did not survive in its original form for much more than
a year afterwards.     But still it retained much of its old
prestige, and certainly an engagement there, for the sake
of the advertisement, was not to be despised. Overtures
were therefore made, and an engagement for a course of
twelve lectures quickly followed       ;  these twelve    to con
sist of the six shortly before delivered at Brixton Rise,
and now to be twice       repeated, and        on no account to
occupy more than three-quarters          of an hour apiece.
     This last restriction chafed my father terribly, for of
all things he detested being tied for time, and liked to
say what he had to say 'at what length he pleased,
 without the necessity for constant reference to his
 watch.    However, there was nothing for it.          The pro
gramme was made out, and as fast as one entertainment
 was over another had to be provided ; and of course
punctuality was an absolute necessity to all concerned.

                   WELCOMING A GORILLA.                    139
So the frame was put together     behind the scenes, ready
to be carried on and fastened       at a moment's     notice,
and at the appointed      time the    curtain rose,   and   at
the appointed     time it fell.   The lectures were duly
delivered,   the audiences were most      appreciative,   and
the officials ready and willing to render all the assist
ance possible.    So that when, after the last lecture, we
packed    up the frame    and   drove   away, we left     the
building with quite a feeling of regret.
     Meanwhile, however, other lectures had been going
on at the Crystal Palace ; but these need a few words
of introduction.
     On the 18th of August my father had received a
sudden visit from two of the leading Crystal Palace
officials (we were then living at Norwood).          A baby
gorilla, it appeared, had been safely brought to Eng
land, had been secured for exhibition at the Palace, and,
together    with a young chimpanzee to which it was
passionately attached, was to arrive at the Palace that
evening.     Would my father,      as a  lover of animals,
like to be present upon the occasion, and supervise the
removal of the animal from the railway station to its
temporary quarters within the building      ?
     Of course he was only too delighted at having the
opportunity of welcoming a stranger of such rarity
(two living gorillas only having previously been brought
to England), and at about a quarter before ten he and
I  set out, escorted by a number of officials and workmen,
through the dark, silent Palace, looking very grim and
ghostly by the light of the lanterns, down to the Low

140                   THE REV. J.      G. WOOD.
 Level Station, to meet the animal.              In   due course    it
 arrived, securely     fastened     up in a    crate of portentous
size, and was quickly placed upon a truck, and wheeled
away out of the draught to a warm room for the night.
 As soon   as   it  was safely installed, the wrappings were
carefully removed from the crate, and we all peered
 in, to see a frightened little black object hiding away
in   a corner, and    jealously guarded by the chimpanzee.
 This was the gorilla; not at all the terrible-looking
creature that one had been led to expect.                  But then
 it  was very young — quite a baby, in fact, scarcely two
years old   ;  and it had been travelling          in  a  noisy train
all day long,       and   it  was very tired, and       it was very
 much    dazzled by the light suddenly flashing in upon
 it  from the lanterns.         So a little food and drink were
put into the cage, and the crate was carefully covered
up again, in order to keep out the least suspicion of a
draught.      And then       we  all went home again until the
morning.
      Next day we were early at the Palace to ascertain
whether the little gorilla had suffered from its long
journey.      There we met the owner of the animal, who
at once suggested that         if my father would give        a short
descriptive lecture        upon    the anthropoid apes two or
three times a day it would add greatly to the attrac
tive power of the animal towards the general public.
 To this proposition my father, after some deliberation,
agreed.     A    few specimens, consisting chiefly of casts of
the feet, hands, and heads of adult gorillas, were pro
cured,    and     between     the    21st  and   3 1st   of August,

                     DEATH OF THE GORILLA.                         141
both days inclusive, twenty of these quasi-lectures were
delivered, making, with those at the Polytechnic, twenty-
nine in the nine working days.
     Of course this involved          a   good    deal   of hurried
travelling      backwards      and forwards,    from the Crystal
Palace to the Polytechnic, and from the Polytechnic to
the Crystal Palace ; but the difficulties were overcome,
and all the lectures         were duly delivered.        The health
of the poor little gorilla, however, fell off very rapidly.
With      the seeds of pulmonary disease          already   working
within it when it reached England, it received its final
death-blow before it had been in the Palace a week,
owing principally to the negligence of its keeper, who was
an ignorant Dutchman, with no experience of the larger
apes   ;  for a sudden shower of cold rain, falling upon
the heated glass of the Palace, and then rapidly evapor
ating, quickly lowered the temperature of the building
by no less than ten degrees. No precautions whatever
 were taken       to protect     the gorilla, or to increase the
 warmth of its cage, and the animal sustained a severe
 chill, which, settling upon its lungs, carried it off upon
 the     3rd   of September.        On the     following     day my
 father assisted at a post-mortem examination of its body,
 and   I  find in his diary the entry : —
      Examined interior of gorilla.   Such  a chest and back.    Right
 lung all tubercles, left very bad.
      A    second note bears date a few days later.
      Chimpanzee died a few hours after leaving    Crystal Palace, and
 an Orang-Outan (not exhibited) died shortly after arrival.    But all

three anthropoid types were alive at the same time under    the same
roof, for the first time in the history of the world.
     The next lectures were at Forest School, Waltham-
stow, of which Dr. Gr.         F. Barlow Guy,      a very old friend
of my father's, was then head-master.               The same series
were delivered here as at Brixton five months earlier,
one lecture being given each day from September 10th
to 16th.      This was rather an experiment, it being the
first time that my father had lectured to an audience
consisting almost entirely of boys; but they seemed
wonderfully interested, were vociferous in their applause,
and were full of questions at the close of each lecture.
My father,       indeed, always had         a  wonderful knack of
winning and keeping the attention of boys. He seemed
to know by a sort of instinct the points which would
interest them, and always contrived to put those points
in simple and yet attractive language ; so that he never
went beyond the capacity of his hearers, and always left
them with a clear understanding of that which he had
endeavoured to teach.            School engagements were con
sequently      numerous,      and in course of time a special
syllabus was drawn up for schools only, embracing a
comprehensive series of lectures on every branch of
zoology.
     The first lecture of the regular season took place at
Lancaster, on September 25th, and was enthusiastically
                                       "
received, the subject being Unappreciated Insects."
The same lecture was given at Swansea, on October 2nd,
before an audience of fully eleven hundred, on October
7th at the Angell Town Institute, Brixton, and on the

21st    at Newbury,      in  each    case meeting    with   great
success.
     Judging by a    note in the ledger, dated October 21st,
my father does not seem          to have carried away a very
                                            "
high opinion of the latter town.              Utterly dull and
stupid place," he writes ; "no one seemed to know or
care   about    anything.     Partly private room in Com
mercial     Hotel  :  bad fire ; draughts.        Had to hail
omnibus for myself."
      Three days later followed the same lecture at Maid
stone, of the large Natural History and Philosophical
Society at which town my father was for many years
president.      On the 29th he was at Newport-Pagnell,
still with the same subject ; and on November 3rd he
        " Life                  " at the Bow and
gave             Underground                            Bromley
 Institute.     Then followed a short tour, beginning with
Angell Town (2nd lecture), on November 19th, and
including     lectures  at Chelmsford,       Huntingdon,    Cam
bridge, Huddersfield, Saltaire, Sheffield, and Gloucester
 (two).    At Chelmsford he was greatly struck by the
 extreme enterprise of a local reporter, who interviewed
 him in the private room as soon as the doors were
 opened, wrote an account of the lecture before it was
 delivered, and actually had      it printed  before the lecturer
 had left the platform     !  The second of the two lectures
 at Gloucester was delivered        in Dr. Needham's private
 lunatic    asylum,   and was listened      to by the    patients
  with great interest and atention.
      Before the end of the year further           lectures  were
 given at Gosport, Bexley, and the Boyal Naval School,

New Cross (two)      ;  and then came       the usual " recess
                                                                 "
during    the   Christmas      holidays,   when    lectures   give
place a while to pantomimes,            and the general     public
prefers amusement         to instruction.     A  single   lecture,
however, was delivered at Warminster, on January 13th,
but unfortunately a severe snowstorm was raging, and
naturally the audience was a very scanty one.              On the
 20th began a short tour, including lectures at Rotherham,
Hull, and Great Grimsby, the latter of which towns is

described in the diary as         Queer place, rather of mush
room    character; broken up into small cliques, mostly
polemic." A lecture at Upper Norwood followed, and
then came a week's visit to Bristol, during which five
lectures were given.
     These    were   delivered    under the    auspices    of the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
and one, to carters only, was of special interest, the
                 "
subject being The Horse," and the various mistakes
commonly made in the treatment of that animal being
carefully explained.        Then followed lectures at Ply
mouth (two), Banbury, Birmingham (two), Gloucester
(two), Cheltenham, Greenwich, the Birkbeck Institute
in London, and Streatham (five), and the season closed
with " Bee Life at Tonbridge, on June 23rd.

     Eighty-three      lectures   had    been  delivered   in all,
including    those    at the     Polytechnic   and the Crystal
 Palace ;  the result had always been highly satisfactory ;
and in nearly every case an engagement for the follow
ing season was arranged for before my father left the
lecture hall.    There could be no doubt whatever that

           SUCCESS   OF THE SKETCH-LECTURES.              145
the sketch-lectures  were a success.     People were pleased
with the novelty of the thing, with the absence of the
usual   manuscript and     glass  of water, and with the
rapid    impromptu    sketches   with    which  the  various
"         " in
   points      the lectures were illustrated.     And both
lecturer and agent looked     forward to a busy season in
the following autumn and winter.
     Before this could be begun, however, certain altera
tions  had to be made, more especially in the drawing-
frame, which had not answered         its purpose nearly so
well as had been expected.      But a notice of these must
be deferred to the  following chapter.

Although           the    large    portable      blackboard which              my
father had           had specially made for these lectures had
proved       satisfactory in many ways, he soon discovered
that, like all experiments, it was open to a great deal of
improvement.             It  was far too heavy,               for one thing,
weighing         no    less than        17S lb. when packed in its
three boxes        ;  so   that excess railway fares and extra cab
hires formed a very important item in the travelling
expenses.         And it was often difficult, when arriving at
a   hall, to find helpers sufficiently strong to carry the
boxes from the cab to the platform.
      Then, again, in spite of its quite unusual dimen
sions, the board was far too small ! My father had
taken to drawing whales and other sea-monsters upon a
large scale, and found that a board only eight feet long

                EXPEEIMENTAL             DRAWING-FBAMES.              147
did not afford him space enough for a sketch of suffi
cient magnitude ; while, even with drawings of lesser
size,    the available      space    became so rapidly filled that
the constant use of the sponge and towel was necessary.
And, thirdly, he wanted a more yielding, more elastic
surface.  He had now taken to drawing with pastils of
many colours — some manufactured specially for himself
— instead of with the plain white chalks as at first. The
                        "
board did not " take       these colours well ; and the
pastils, moreover, were for the most part so soft that
the pressure against the unyielding wood crumbled
them into fragments, so that they could not be used
with any degree of certainty. So the big blackboard
was doomed.
    But what         was to         be    substituted   for it   ?   Mr.
Waterhouse         Hawkins, who about this time had been
lecturing at the Crystal Palace, had employed a large
sheet of black canvas, loosely stretched by means of
guy-ropes ; but this did not at all fall in with my
father's       fastidious    requirements,       and    certainly    was
                                                     "
rather too much             of the " rough-and-ready   descrip
tion for use upon a public platform. So he devoted
himself heart and soul to the designing of a more
worthy substitute.
   One or two failures, of course, were inevitable.                  He
soon saw       that the canvas must be stretched on a wooden
frame, but fell into the error of making this frame                  too
light;    so   that when the strain of the canvas was thrown
upon     it,
           it   collapsed, and proved utterly unsuitable to its
purpose.        After quite   a     long succession of experiments,

 therefore,   a  second   frame    was    constructed    of a far
 stouter character,     and   this, after    a   few   alterations
 and   improvements      had   been   made,    proved    perfectly
 satisfactory, and afforded a clear surface        of eleven feet
 by five feet six inches    ; so that a drawing made there
 upon was clearly visible in every part of the largest
 hall.
     Few of those who          have    seen   this   great  black
 screen erected   upon a lecture platform would be likely
 to form any idea of the intricacy of the mechanism ;
 and so perhaps a short description of the apparatus
 may not be out of place.
     In  the first place, each of the two upright posts to
 which the oblong frame         actually bearing the canvas
 was affixed was composed of two pieces, jointing in
 with one another, and firmly fastened together by long
hand-screws.      The oblong frame itself consisted         of six
parts,   two uprights being fastened by screws to the
outer    poles, and four cross-pieces, capable of being
firmly braced together so as to form but two, running
from corner to corner of these so as to form the oblong.
A   stout iron brace in the centre of this completed the
actual framework, which was supported by four long
guy-ropes running from pegs at the top of the outside
poles.
     The canvas was quite a work of art in itself. In
the first place, it had to be of a special quality, finely
and yet very     strongly woven, and, of course, without
seam.     Then the edges had to be strengthened with
broad bands of the very         strongest    webbing, sewn on

                    STRETG11ISG        THE CAXVAS.                     149
by machine,        and      running completely round the can
vas.     Next   a  number of iron rings had to be fastened
to   the    edges,      at   intervals of about      five    inches,   by
means of twine           ;  and, finally, these    rings had to be
fitted    with running           cords   carefully  waxed,       spliced,
and bound, to prevent               any possible    chance of fray
ing.
     Then,     of course, this         canvas had to       be painted     ;
but before that operation              could be performed         it was
necessary to stretch          it upon the frame.       This was done
as  follows : —
     First, the two upper corners              of the     canvas were
firmly lashed, by means of short cords depending from
the corner      rings, to the hand-screws upon the upper
part of the back of the frame.                   Next the running
cords already mentioned were looped over a number of
projecting screws with which the whole inner edge of
the framework was set ; and, when these cords were
drawn      tight,      the    result   was   that the      canvas     was
stretched     so  perfectly that not a wrinkle was anywhere
to be seen.       Then all the cords were securely fastened,
and tucked away out of sight, a final turn                 given to all
the screws, and the guy-ropes tightened up                if  necessary   ;
and then the frame was all ready for the lecture.
     The painting of the canvas was a somewhat lengthy
process.      First of all it had to be " sized," and then
left for a day. After this three coats of black paint
were successively           applied at intervals of        a couple     of
days   ;  and then         was superimposed      a coat,      sometimes
                  "
repeated, of         flatting,"    to employ     the technical term,

mixed.      The object of this, of course, was to give a
certain    amount of roughness to the face of the canvas,
and     so to   enable it to hold the chalk.         After this
"            " had dried the canvas was
   flatting                                    ready for use,
and would generally last for a whole           season   without
needing     repair ;  and when    it   began to show signs of
wear and tear, a fresh coat of flatting         was generally
all that was required.
     When not in use this frame reposed in a strong
canvas case, protected by stout cushions at the ends,
and fastened     by means of a rather complicated        system
of lacing. It was a very good case, and did its work
well ; but the worst of it was that it looked so dread
fully suggestive of      a corpse.     Even the railway autho
rities noticed this, and so striking was the resemblance
that, shortly after the mysterious disappearance of the
body of the late Lord Crawford, my father was actually
stopped upon one occasion by the officials,          and   com
pelled to open his great black package before they could
be    induced   to believe    that the body of the missing
nobleman was not reposing therein.           Ever after this, of
                                            "
course, the frame went by the title of Lord Crawford,"
and so it was known upon almost every railway in the
kingdom.       And there were few of the larger stations,
at any rate, at which all the porters were not thoroughly
acquainted with the familiar black parcel.
     This frame was entirely my father's own invention,
and very proud of it he was ; so much so, indeed, that
he always objected        to more help than was absolutely

             DIFFICULTIES WITH HALL-KEEPERS.                              151
necessary in putting        it up, and would trust no one but
himself to stretch the canvas, fasten the guy-ropes, and
give the finishing touches.            But the strain must often
have     been a severe      one,      especially      when,       as   often
happened, he had been travelling all day long, and only
arrived just in time to make the necessary preparations
before delivering       his lecture.          Even under          the most
favourable        circumstances       the    screen    could      never   be
erected  in less than an hour, and the physical exertion
involved, particularly in stretching the canvas, was very
severe, as    I    can testify from much personal experience.
And very often it would happen that the hall-keeper
was     unable, or unwilling, to give the necessary assist
ance.     Hall-keepers, in fact, were a source of constant
trouble to my father, and he often inveighed bitterly
against them — as a class, that.            is,
                                 for he met with many
shining exceptions.         One great difficulty which he often
had with them was caused    by their reluctance to allow
him to put the necessary screws into the floor. In the
case of the old cumbersome blackboard, there certainly
was some        for their unwillingness, for the screws
              excuse
used were the well-known
                          "
                            stage-screws," which make
a   ragged hole in the boarding fully half an inch across
But when the new frame took its place these were                          re
placed by ordinary screw-eyes, making holes so small as
to be barely noticeable       ;     and, indeed, in putting up the
frame for    a    second lecture,     it   often required     a   very close
search to    find the old holes.
       But   some    of these hall-keepers            were as jealously
careful of their floor as         a   yacht-owner of his deck, and

152               THE REV. J.   G. WOOD.
a great   deal of opposition had to be overcome before
even these   small screws could be inserted.     In  one or
two extreme cases, indeed, my father was compelled to
inform the obdurate janitor that unless the screws were
at once inserted he should decline to deliver his lecture,
on the ground that his drawing-frame         could not be
erected, and should lay the matter before the committee    —
an expedient which never failed to produce the desired
result.
     Taking down and packing the frame after the lecture
was over was also a rather long process, and was seldom
completed much under three-quarters      of an hour.    First
the canvas had to be thoroughly washed and dried,
and this always took some time, as coloured chalks
have a way of obstinately clinging      to the canvas, and
cannot be removed without      some little trouble.     Then
the frame-work had to be taken to pieces and carefully
packed together   ;  the  screws put into one bag     ;   the
cords rolled up and placed in another    ; the canvas care
fully and neatly folded, and placed on the top of all ;
and then, after several straps had been tightly drawn
round them, the whole had to be transferred to the long
leather case, and securely laced up therein. So that,
with a lecture     occupying fully an hour and a half,
visitors to be interviewed, and their questions answered,
perhaps a reporter to be posted up in some part of the
lecture which he had missed, and then the screen to be
taken down    and packed, it was often close upon eleven
o'clock before my father could leave the hall. And as,
very often, he would be obliged to take his departure

              REPAIRING THE DRAWING-FRAMES.                 153
 not later than seven o'clock on      the following morning
in order to fulfil another engagement, and would con
stantly write articles, &c, while in the train, it may
well be imagined that these prolonged tours were a great
strain upon him, and must have told not inconsiderably
 upon his general health.
     While at home he was constantly going over his
frames   (for he had three in       all) in order to provide
against accidents.        Perhaps a new canvas had to be
made, or a few rings fastened on more securely      ;  or part
of the woodwork needed repair, owing to rough treat
ment received upon the railway ; or some of the screws
             "
would be stripped," and so would have to be replaced
by others.      Perhaps, too, some new improvement had
to be made, involving a visit to the blacksmith, or the
purchase of a new set of screws.         This was commonly
the case  ;   and when, a few weeks after my father's death,
I had to    put up the frame for a lecture of my own,         I
found that it had changed in several respects during
the year that had passed since     I had seen it.
    And     even  if  nothing in the way of repairs    or im
provements      happened to be necessary, still almost     my
father's first proceeding upon reaching home was to put
up one of his frames in a large lumber-room, either for
the purpose      of fitting a new   canvas, in readiness    for
future necessities, or else that he might practise some of
his drawings.        For all those wonderful sketches, pro
duced   so    rapidly before the eyes of the audience, and
seemingly without a moment's consideration, were the
outcome of long and careful prior preparation.        First he

154                    THE REV. J.     G.   WOOD.
used to     make a tracing,       if  possible, of the object lie
wished to draw from some thoroughly trustworthy wood
cut.    Then he would copy this two or three times upon
a slate,   which      hung by a cord from his table, always
attempting to do so with the fewest possible lines, and,
                                        " making
as he frequently used to say,                       every line tell
its own story."        Then, having contrived this to his own
satisfaction, he would make a very careful sketch in
colour upon the back of one of the small paper strips
which contained         his brief lecture-notes.       And finally,
chalks in hand,         he   would go off to his frame and
practise that drawing diligently, until he could exe
cute it accurately without hesitation and without a
mistake.
      No doubt these coloured sketches contributed more
than all else       to the invariable success     of the lectures.
Every drawing elicited          a   round of applause, and the
newspapers        always   commented admiringly upon the
great artistic power which could produce              such a result
with such simple          means,     and    apparently with such
perfect ease.        In  the   words      of Dr. Oliver Wendell
 Holmes, who was present at one of his lectures upon
 " Pond and Stream "
                             during his first American tour
and    who     afterwards    wrote    to him a letter of warm
admiration      :
                  —
     I looked as well as listened, and saw tbe stickleback and his
little aquatic neighbours grow up on the black canvas from a mere
outline to perfect creatures, resplendent in their many-coloured
uniforms.    The lecture had much that was agreeable, but the coloured
chalk improvisation was fascinating to the old and young alike, and
was — as it deserved to be — heartily applauded.

  THE "XARLBURIAX"                       OJV       THE SKETCH-LEOTURES.                155
       I    also quote       a few          lines upon the same                  subject
from the Marlburian — the           journal of Marl  private
borough College — which appeared shortly after the first
lecture had been delivered there                            :
                                                                —
    His appliances for illustration were excellent, and the result of
no little experience.        A   capacious canvas, which could be withdrawn
into   a   wondrously small compass            ;    chalks of all colours, selected     to
rescue the      entangling       lines    of       insect-organs    from   the   confusion
inevitable if portrayed in academic white alone ; and these, too,
bought at great price, and suited for use. in the glare of gas-light —
such light turns white to yellow ; yellow must be used for white ;
blue looks green, and green blue.      That red which glowed on the
wings of a new-born gnat was hunted up and finally captured only in
Paris. Those who have tried to draw under such conditions at close
quarters will appreciate, too, the facility displayed in the use of
these, the truth to Nature, as far as is possible in section drawing,
and the accurate knowledge of detail, which only comes of careful
out-door study the motive of which is love.
     The first drawing was a longitudinal section of a type-insect. An
impossible monster, therefore, but designed to show the structure
and position of the internal organs, and necessary to explain the
deeply esoteric title of the lecture.  If it be not profanity to divulge
in print what we were told would not bear publication, that
title was " Entomarchetype."        The prodigy grew on that magic
canvas for all to behold, and though one felt it hard to like a beast
with such a name, it was not without a pang that we saw it make
way for more familiar creatures under the visitation of that remorse
less sponge.
       I    may   perhaps            also      be     permitted        to quote       the
following from the Altrincham and Bowdon                                   Guardian     of
October 8th, 1881            :   —
     Mr. Wood's method of lecturing                   is,
                                        we believe, unique.   It con
sists in producing upon a black canvas screen drawings of the objects
to be described.  These are drawn in the presence of the audience

156                    THE REV. J.        G.  WOOD.
They are not mere diagrams,         but finished   pictures in colours of
great beauty.    These, as they literally       started into life under
the lecturer's artistic touch, elicited very marked      approbation from
the audience.    One picture especially showed the very highest skill.
A   particular species of the hydrozoa had to be described, which,
from the transparency of its substance and the near approach of its
refractive power to that of water, can scarcely be distinguished from
the element in which it swims.       It requires a practised eye and close
attention to see it at all.    Mr. Wood drew it on the screen as one
would gradually come     to  distinguish its parts ; here a flash of light
and there a filament; here a red, and there a blue tint, till the
creature ultimately took shape and stood forth in all its beauty of
iridescent colours and gracefulness of form.
      Of course, all this artistic skill was the outcome,
not merely of much careful practice at home, but also of
many experiments and failures with chalks of various
descriptions.        At    first   the   ordinary drawing pastils
 were procured, but these were soon found to be utterly
unsuited for the purpose, having neither sufficient
brilliancy of colour to show out upon the black surface,
nor the peculiar quality necessary for ready adherence
to the smooth canvas.             In the course of a conversation,
 however, with the late Mr. Waterhouse                   Hawkins, who
 had already adopted the coloured              pastils in his lecture-
 sketches, although upon quite a small scale, my father
 was recommended by him to pay a visit to Messrs.
 Lechertier     & Barbe, of Regent Street              ; and from    that
 firm he thenceforth procured the whole of his pastils.
 Some of these, as stated in the Marlburian, were
 imported from Paris, more particularly the brilliant
scarlet which glowed out with such striking effect upon
 the black of the canvas.              Some were specially manu

                      COLOURED CHALKS.                       157
factured for him, upon condition of his purchasing a
sufficient quantity to ensure a profit upon the whole.
And    a few,   but very few — were selected from those
already in stock.     By degrees, he added considerably to
the number of different shades which he employed, and
in his boxes   I  find three shades of red, three of blue,
two of green, three of yellow, an ochre, a brown, and a
neutral tint, all of which have clearly been used upon
several occasions.
     These   he used with     wonderful discrimination and
judgment, seeming to know by a kind of instinct just
 how and where to apply the colours so that they might
 produce   the   desired   result at a distance.     He had,
 indeed,   something of the      peculiar art of the scene-
 painter,   whose    productions, when viewed at close
 quarters, appear but the coarsest and clumsiest daubs,
 but when seen from some thirty or forty feet away are
 really elegant   pictures.   As one stood upon the plat
 form, quite close to the screen,   it was sometimes almost
 impossible to realise that these were the famous draw
 ings, which had made the success of the sketch-lectures.
 But, upon going down to the middle of the hall, and
 then viewing the self-same sketches, one's wonder ceased,
 for now one saw them as they were intended to be seen,
 and as they were seen in the mind's eye of the lecturer.
      This aptitude for drawing was quite     a  natural gift,
 for my father never had a drawing-lesson      in his life, and
 was entirely his own pupil.         During his university
 career he showed a good deal of artistic talent in the
 production of a number of small pen-and-ink sketches

 158                THE REV. J.    G. WOOD.
 which now adorn      a small scrap-book in my possession.
These are chiefly of a humorous character, and for the
most part relate to scenes of collegiate life, the key to
which, of course, is now missing. But that he added
to these in after life is evidenced by the appearance of
 " Ye
       Margate Mag-Pyes,"     a  fancy sketch of two elderly
 gossips conversing upon the Margate        sands, and by a
whole series of illustrations of pelicans and flamingoes
in eccentric attitudes, drawn from life at the Zoological
 Gardens, and reproduced almost exactly in the small
sketches of those birds which appear in the
                                                  "
                                                    Explana
               "                      "
tory Index        to his edition of     Waterton's Wander
ings."      He would occasionally illustrate letters to
intimate friends, also, by small drawings, sometimes of
a wonderfully      graphic character.   But he never pre
tended    to be an artist, and, indeed, always disclaimed
the title, saying that he could show what he wanted
to show by a rough drawing, but that anything in the
shape of a finished sketch was altogether beyond his
powers.
     In the later years of his sketch-lectures  he was very
particular about light, and would have neither gas nor
lamp anywhere near the screen itself, save in the form
of footlights some six or seven feet in front.      He even
had a set of footlights made, and for some time carried
them about with him. But, finding that they were
seldom     suited  to the requirements    of any particular
room, he contented       himself with sending notice that
footlights must be provided in some form or other, and
that, if nothing better were forthcoming, half-a-dozen

                FOOTLIGHTS AND THEIR USE.                        159
ordinary     paraffin   lamps,   such as those    made to hang
upon a kitchen wall, would answer            his purpose.      For,
in order that the drawings should show out to the best
advantage, it was necessary that the light should come
from below.       If   it  proceeded    from above it merely
dazzled the eyes of the audience            when   reflected   back
from the screen, and prevented them from seeing the
sketches at all, while side-lights were almost equally un
satisfactory, and so were tabooed also. But light from
below brought out the full effect of the colours, and
 showed     them out in bold relief with the dull black
 of the canvas     ;  and   if  there  were   no other light in
 the hall at all, the result was even more satisfactory
 still.
       Of course  some    of his sketches were more striking
 and remarkable than others.           One of his best was that
 of two ants fighting, in which jaws, limbs, and antennae
 were hopelessly interlocked, and yet the individuality
 of each insect       was    clearly preserved.     There    was   a
 drawing of the spermaceti whale, too, in which the spine
 came first, and then was followed by some of the other
 bones and internal organs,           while, finally, a line was
 quickly run round these and the whale seen to be com
 plete, with every part in due proportion.                And the
 drawing of the male stickleback in all the glories of his
 courting array always elicited a special round of ap
  plause.    The odd thing was, that no line was ever
 rubbed out, no alteration ever made.                The sketches
  were hastily executed, but were always           perfectly exact
 in every particular.         No measurements       seemed    to be

160                THE REV. J.    G. WOOD.
taken, and yet the proportions were      invariably correct.
Of course there was a great deal of art in this, although
it did not appear — ars est celare artem — and any one who
thinks otherwise has only to try to reproduce the draw
ings, even with the small coloured sketches to guide him,
in order to find out his mistake.

With      all the advantages           of the new canvas drawing-

second season of the sketch-lectures                 began on September
 15th, 1880, again with a short series at Forest                       School,
Walthamstow.           A   completely new course of subjects was
chosen, and "Insect Transformations," on the 15th, was
followed by

                  on the 21st, while

twice on the 22nd, the first time at 4 p.m., and again at
 7.30.     Visitors from the neighbourhood were admitted
as  before, and all were delighted, each lecture proving
more interesting than the last, while the liberal use of
the coloured chalks          added greatly to the             effect of the
 sketches.

162                  THE REV. J.       G.  WOOD.
     Next   came a   tour of some length, the towns visited
including     Sheffield,    Maldon, Chelmsford, Lancaster,
Birmingham, Doncaster, Leeds, Sheffield again, TJlvers-
ton, Birmingham again, and Leamington.
      At the first of these        places   occurred   the  first of
many     more     or   less    severe   injuries   to   the  frame.
Throughout my father's career these accidents occurred
at tolerably regular intervals.            Perhaps the railway
porters, in their eagerness to get the luggage out of the
van with" as little delay as possible, would tumble               the
great black parcel out unceremoniously upon the plat
form, from the height of a couple of feet or more ; and
then an hour at least would have to be spent in repairing
damages.       Or a cabman would lift it to the ground
with insufficient care ; or, more frequently still, willing
but unnecessary and undesired helpers, with the best
 intentions possible, would carefully put together pieces
 which did not belong together, force the screws, wrench
 the ironwork, and so create havoc which              it was often
 times   difficult to repair.       Many were the makeshifts
 which my father was compelled to adopt at different
 times,  and fortunate      it  was both for himself and his
 audiences that he was no mean amateur               carpenter, and
 could often,    by the aid of some ingenious temporary
 device, erect and use his screen, even after it had received
  some serious and unrepaired        damage.
      And by degrees, growing wise from experience, he
  greatly strengthened the frame.              The ends of every
  piece of woodwork were carefully plated with iron             ;  the
  system of packing       was improved       ;  the case itself was

 altered for the better.       But even all these precautions
 failed to prevent an occasional accident, and always, at
 the end of a tour, the best part of a day had to be spent
 in careful examination of every part of the frame, and
in various little repairs rendered necessary by the
 knocking about which it had undergone during its
 travels.
      During the autumn followed lectures at the Sunday
 School Union, and also at Brighton, the Royal Naval
 School,    New Cross, Norwood, Bedford, Streatham,
 Peterborough, Newcastle, Morpeth, Banbury, Windsor,
 Maidstone, Staleybridge, Saltaire, Huddersfield, and
                           "
 Liverpool     (at the       Young Men's Christian Associa
tion").      This last institute comes in for almost the
highest praise that my father ever bestowed upon any
of the halls in which he lectured.            I find the following
notes in his diary      : —
      Capital hall at Y.M.C.A.;  a good-natured hall-keeper, who wails
for orders.   Carpeted floor, and pitch pine ; not object to screws.
      Then came the Christmas recess            ; but on January
                                             "                        "
3rd the lectures began again with Life under "Water
at Upper Norwood.             At Sydenham, on the 8th and
 15th, were given       "Ant Life" and " Spider Life," for
the benefit of various parochial institutions.             Then came
lectures    at Caterham,        Streatham (three         delivered   in
the drawing-room of a private house), Romsey, Win
chester, and the London Institution ; this last on a day
of deep snow, when a cab could hardly be procured for
love or money, and we were obliged to drive                   from the

Elephant     and   Castle   station with two horses placed
" tandem " wise.      After this came the first of the Scotch
tours, a lecture at Chester being delivered         on the way,
and   succeeded by others       at Stirling, Edinburgh        (2),
Falkirk, Dumbarton, Dumfries, Dunse, Kirkcudbright,
Dollar, and Helensburgh.          On the way home a stay of
a  few days was made at Conisborough, near Rotherham,
and a short address delivered on
                                        " Ants," three or four
spare leaves from a dining-room table serving as make
shift   blackboards.       Then    followed     engagements     at
Manchester, Stafford, Weymouth (2), Worcester, Har-
borne, Cardiff, Malvern, Norwood (5), and Tarlet Hall,
near Stafford (3)   ;  and the season      closed with
                                                         " Insect
Transformations"        at  Marlborough        College  on June
4th.
     Seventy-four     lectures    only    had    been  given, as
 against eighty-three in the preceding season, but as no
less than twenty of the latter consisted merely of the
                 "
 short " gorilla addresses at the Crystal Palace, which
 certainly were not "sketch-lectures," and perhaps ought
 hardly to be dignified with the title of lectures at all,
 the year's engagements were in reality rather more nu
 merous than those of the preceding season.
     In   the  course    of his career my father naturally
 received many curious and amusing letters.              He was
 accustomed to the correspondent who writes asking for
 an amount of information which,          if given in full, would
 require about as much space as that occupied by an
 ordinary three-volume novel.         He was familiar with the
 twelve or fourteen closely written, and perhaps crossed,

              AN INDIGNANT CORRESPONDENT.                               165
pages    in which is embodied            a  minute description of
some perfectly well-known fact, which the writer never
theless looks upon as a perfectly original discovery, of
a  nature which will shake received science to its very
foundations. He was inured to the flat and sometimes
even    angry contradictions of his statements which
periodically arrived, and which were not always couched
in the mildest and most inoffensive of language.                        As
for instance : —
     Sir,
           You say in your " Common Objects of the Country " (page
70) that insects never grow.     You do not understand what you are
writing   about.   Sir, did you never    see black-beetles    in your life  ?
As you   seem  not to have  seen them,  I send you  a lot which    I caught
myself in my kitchen, and they are all of different    sizes.    Insects do
grow, and you are quite wrong.      I  hope that you will publish this
 when you write again about insects.
                                        Yours indignantly,
                                                                   A. B.
     But for cool audacity        I   do not think that he ever
 received any communication            to be compared with one
 that reached       him just       about this time, and which
 appeared to have been written in perfectly good faith.
 The writer began by stating that my father had
 deservedly risen to very high eminence               as   a    naturalist
 and an author, that his name had now been before the
 public for many years, and that his reputation                        was
 thoroughly      established.        He then proceeded to say
 that, as one who had written and lectured so much must
 have necessarily        amassed an immense            fortune, it was

166                  THE REY. J.     G.  WOOD.
clearly my father's duty to retire in favour of a younger
man.     And then he remarked that he himself was a
younger man, and that, as he was very anxious to take
up public lecturing as a profession, he would venture to
ask my father to rest contented with what he had done,
and   to    transfer    to   himself  " the            of the
                                             goodwill
             "
business  !
    I do not    know whether my father ever replied to
this modest and unassuming epistle, but certainly he
always   treasured     it  as one   of the greatest curiosities
which he had ever received.
    The 1881-82 season began rather later than usual
with  a lecture before the     Gipsy Hill Band of Hope on
                                                              "
September 19th.         This was followed by " The Horse
at Tonbridge Grammar School ten days later, and a
somewhat prolonged tour followed immediately after, be

                 " Jelly-fish " at Altrincham near Bowdon,
on October 3rd, and ending with
                                        " Life under Water "
at Brighton on the 27th of the same month.            Between
these dates fifteen lectures       were given, with the  same
                          Then came " Life under Water at
                                                          "

Newbury, which behaved rather better than on the
occasion of his former visit ; then three lectures were
given at Dover on successive evenings, while a second
lecture at Brighton followed on November 5th, and a
third  a week     later, the series being organised by the
local Ladies' Committee of the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
    Travelling all day on the 13th (Sunday), Southport
was reached late at night        ;  and on each afternoon    of

                 A LONG LECTURING TOUR.                      167
the ensuing week a lecture       was given in the Winter
Gardens.      On the 21st the lecturer was at Leek, on the
22nd at Hanley, on the 23rd at Leighton Buzzard, on
the 24th at Coventry, and on the        25th at Worcester.
Then came two days of relaxation, and then on the
                    "
2Sth " Jelly-fish     was delivered at Weymouth.          Next
                                                   "
day  a second lecture, this time on " Bee Life       was given
to the Gipsy     Hill  Band of Hope ; and on the 3rd of
the following month the first of many lectures was
given at Uppingham School, a place which my father
always greatly enjoyed visiting, and at which he was
                                                               "
especially popular.      Three days later " The Whale
was  given at Stone, this time with a large drawing of
the animal, showing its internal anatomy in a peculiarly
striking manner ; and three days later still the ever-
          " Unappreciated Insects "¦—now, however, con
popular
siderably altered and improved — was delivered in the
Mechanics' Institute at Bolton.
     Nothing of any special importance appears to have
occurred during this somewhat       extended tour, and my
father's notes and ledger-entries are very scanty.           At
Coventry,     however,   he  seems  to   have    met   with    a
novelty in the form        of a feminine     hall-keeper,   ex
pressively    described in his note-book     as   "a  starched
widow,    who shakes her head and          contemplates     the
zenith."
     On December 12th he was at the London Institution
for the  third time, on this occasion with " The Hoof of
             "
the Horse      for his subject.   And he now succeeded in
obtaining an extra twenty minutes for his lecture, the

 168                  THE REV. J.     G.  WOOD.
 two previously given having been strictly limited to an
 hour apiece.       Thence he went to Peterborough, to find,
 on arrival, that the hall-keeper, unauthorised, had let
 the hall for the purpose of an examination, and that           it
 would not be free until the time came to open the doors
for the admission of the public ; in other words, that
the drawing-screen       could not be put up.       Consequence,
a   storm of indignation       on my father's part, a threat
there and then to leave the town without delivering his
lecture at all, and the final submission of the keeper,
who contrived to clear the hall by half -past six. Next
             "                            "
day came       Unappreciated Insects        at Nottingham, in
the Mechanics' Institute, and on the day after he was
at Stamford, with the same subject.           Thence he went
to Driffield   to deliver the same lecture        again  ; and so
closed the first part of the season.
     He was soon at work again, however, for December
30th saw him at Falmouth, for the first and only time.
Then came a short recess, until Bowdon was visited on
                                                "
January 9th     ;  this for an " experimental      lecture, which
was very well attended.           The month was not a busy
one, however, only six more lectures being given,
namely, at Holloway, Salisbury, Slough, Bedditch, and
Hull   (2).
     February was better        filled, with no less than six
teen lectures, including      two at Clifton upon the same
day (one at the College and the other at the Vic
toria Booms), one at Cardiff, one at Weymouth, and
three at Rugby.           At Cardiff another feminine hall-
keeper    was     met   with,  and    was  described    in terms

            LECTURES AT THE CRYSTAL FALACE.                          169
even     less flattering    than those applied to her pre
                                "
decessor at Coventry.             Sulky and peppery female,"
 I read in the ledger; "regular Xantippe, so gave her
no tip."
      The three Rugby lectures were the first of               a school
course of six, the remaining three being given upon the
first three Thursdays in March.               In  that month also
came      engagements at Yarlet         Hall,   near Stafford (2),
Uppingham         School (2),      and   Ascot.       In April      one
regular      lecture   only was delivered, on the 27th, at
Tonbridge       Grammar School.         Three engagements fol
lowed in May, at Yarlet Hall (2), and at Ascot again ;
while June was more busy.             For in this month, besides
single engagements at Chislehurst, and one or two small
schools, begau a long course of lectures at the Crystal
Palace, which were continued at intervals until the
middle of September.          Unfortunately, the hour selected
(11.30 a.m.) was so early as to preclude visitors from a
distance from attending these lectures, but the season-
ticket holders and other inhabitants of the neigh
bourhood came in considerable numbers, and the series
was very successful.          While this course was still in
progress     my father received the following letter from
the then manager       :
                         —
                           Crystal Palace     Company,
                                             Crystal Palaoe, S.E.
   Dear Mr. Wood,
        I  have much   pleasure  in stating that the Sketch-Lectures
¦which you are now delivering at the Crystal Palace have attracted
great attention, and seem to be as instructive as interesting.

170                   THE REV. J.     G.   WOOD.
     I sincerely  trust that we may be able to make arrangements by
which you shall continue to give lectures here, as they are popular
with all classes.
                                  Yours faithfully,
                                        (Signed)    S. Flood Page,
                                                       Manager.
     Besides this course at the Crystal Palace, a series of
lectures    were also in progress at two schools at Upper
Norwood, an arrangement being made by which my
father delivered a lecture at each on every Saturday in
term-time when he happened to be at home.                   And so,
when,     after a second       course  of    six lectures    at    the
 Winter Gardens of Southport, exclusively upon marine
subjects, the season came to an end, no less than one
hundred and twenty-one lectures had been given in all,
as against      seventy-four in 1880-81,         and eighty-three
in 1879-80.         This was the busiest year that my father
ever had, as far as the          number of lectures was con
cerned,     although in several subsequent seasons the
amount of travelling involved was considerably greater.
     Yet it would be a great mistake to suppose that the
profits, even of so successful       a season, were ve,ry       large.
I   do not think that, at any rate in this country, my
father ever received more than ten guineas for a single
lecture; and his average gross fee certainly did not
exceed   half that amount.         Now when from five guineas
has to be deducted the cost of perhaps one hundred and
fifty miles' railway travelling, with        a hundred-weight at
least of excess luggage, the expense of cabs, tips to hall-
keepers and porters, and the agent's fee, to say nothing

                      PECUNIARY RESULTS.                       171
of the outlay upon chalks, printing, and postage, and
the wear and tear of the drawing-frame, it will easily
be seen   that the net receipts are not so very high after
all.    Many    a time,    especially  in the   case of  a  single
isolated lecture, has my father barely cleared his ex
penses ; and     I  do not suppose that in any one year he
succeeded in clearing          three  hundred     pounds   by his
lectures.    And so bad a man of business was he that            I
am quite sure that, had           it not  been that all arrange
ments    were in the hands of his agent, he would never
have contrived to realise even half that amount.
     With    one season      prolonged until September 12th,.
the interval between that and the next must naturally
be   so brief as scarcely to be noticeable at all ; and, in
point of fact, only eight days elapsed before the season
of 1882-83 began with the " Entomarchetype," or
"                    "
   typical insect       lecture, at a large ladies' school in
Upper Norwood.           Then, in the same month, followed
lectures at Chislehurst, Tonbridge, and at a boys' school
in Norwood     ;   and with October      work began in earnest.
During this month Maidstone, Upper Norwood, Chisle
hurst, Felstead Grammar School, the Eoyal Naval
School at New Cross, Leek, Bossall, Kilburn, and Yarlet
Hall, were all in turn visited, some of them two or even
three times.       In  November visits were paid to Cardiff,
Clevedon (where a comparatively scanty audience on the
first evening was replaced by one crowded even to over
flowing on the second), Axminster, Upper Norwood (3),
South Norwood, Bedford, Hurstpierpoint, Warminster,
Chislehurst, and Coventry.           And the year's work was

172                  THE REV. J.       G.  WOOD.
completed     by the fulfilment      of engagements at Hurst-
pierpoint again, Reading, Upper Norwood, Hull, Not
tingham, Stamford, Perry Bar, Driffield, Bradford (3),
Redditch, and Ambleside ; forty-two lectures in all
¦during the    first part of the season.
     The second part was busier still, and the total num
ber of lectures      given very nearly equalled         the  record
¦of the preceding season.
     The first lecture given in the new year was also the
first of a private series — six in all — delivered by special
request at the house of a well-known London banker.
 They formed, in fact, the pieces         de resistance of a course
of social conversaziones, to which a large circle of friends
were invited, and which were one and all thoroughly
 successful.     All   were given     between the 3rd and the
 15th of the month, at four o'clock in the afternoon;
 and universal regret was expressed when the course was
 concluded.
     Still   more    interesting was the lecture given on
January     5th, which initiated a series of twelve at the
 Boyal Normal College for the Blind, at Upper Nor
 wood.     It seemed rather a contradictory arrangement           —
sketc/i-lectures    to those who could not see.            But the
 sketches were nevertheless executed just as usual, and
 were explained to the patients by the attendants               ; so
 that, although       unable  to   see   the  drawings for them
 selves, they were yet enabled to form a tolerably clear
idea of what those drawings were meant to represent.
And they      were all thoroughly delighted, both with this
.and  with the subsequent        lectures of the course.      They

            SKETCH-LECTURES         TO   THE BLIND.            17*
applauded    the lecturer to the echo      ;  they were most
eager with their questions as he was leaving the plat
form.    And no doubt they gained almost, if not quite
as  much, amusement         and   instruction   as if they had
possessed the    full use of their eyes.
     The other lectures given during the month were at
Bristol,   "Weston-super-Mare       (2),  Highgate      (2),  and
the Birkbeck      Institution  ; and these were followed in
February     by others at Tonbridge Grammar School,
Brighton (3, a marine course), Leamington, Harborne,
and two of the Upper Norwood Schools.
     March was a busy month, as usual, with seventeen
lectures, including two at Uppingham School, one at
 Marlborough College, and others at Worcester, Totten
 ham, Tonbridge Wells, Tonbridge, and Lytham.                April
 brought one engagement          only, at Malvern,     besides   a-
 couple of the occasional        Saturday    school-lectures    at
 Norwood.      May brought seven — two at Chislehurst,
 three at Yarlet Hall, and two at a private school at
 Earl's Court ; June, six, including three more at Chisle
 hurst, two at Earl's Court, and one at Forest School ;
 and  July,   three, which brought the season to an end.
 The total number of lectures given amounted to one
 hundred and thirteen.
     A   great change was to take place in the following
 season.    My father     had, several months previously, re
 ceived   a pressing    invitation to cross the Atlantic, and
               "          "
 deliver the     Lowell Lectures for the autumn of 1S83,
 at Boston, Mass., U.S.A.         For some time he had hesi
 tated ;  partly by reason of family ties, partly from the

distance to be travelled, and partly from a doubt as to
whether the English connection might not suffer by his
temporary withdrawal from the scene of action.               At
length, however, he arrived at the conclusion (a false
one, as events afterwards proved), that his absence for
a winter would lead to an increase of the number of
lectures in the following season     ;  that an American tour
was likely to prove profitable     ;   and that in other ways,
besides that of mere lecturing, he might make the trip
a successful   one.   And   so  his decision was made, and
the American offer accepted.
    As, however, he was bound by the terms of his
agreement not to lecture in America before giving his
course at the Lowell Institute, he thought         it advisable
to begin the season in England, and not to cross until
he could delay no longer ; there being, of course, no
object in his staying idle in America while he might
have been earning money in England.             Therefore, lec
tures were arranged    for and given on September 28th,
at the Royal Naval School, New Cross; on October 1st
at Coventry (a special lecture on the Horse) ; at New
Swindon two days later    ;  at Yarlet    Hall on the 8th and
9th; at Wolverhampton on the 11th; at Westbourne
Park on the 12th ; and, finally, at Sheffield on the 1 5th.
    Meanwhile, preparations      for the transatlantic tour
had been going on apace.         Two drawing-frames were
thoroughly overhauled, put in perfect repair, and fitted
with new canvas. Notes had to be drawn up for the
special series at the Lowell Institute, on which, proba
bly, the success of the trip would depend, while all the

necessary preparations   for a six months' absence from
England had to      be made;   all this in the occasional
flying visits home, which were all that could be managed
in the three or four preceding weeks. But all was at
last completed, and on October 15th my father left
home, not to return until well on in the following
spring. The same evening he gave his Sheffield lecture,
on Ants, and on the next day reached Liverpool,         to
embark at once upon the Cunard steamship       Cephalonia.
On the following day the vessel left the Mersey, touch
ing at Queenstown a few hours later, to pick up passen
gers and mails; and by the morning of the        19th she
was  well out at sea.

Before setting out upon his first Transatlantic tour, my
father made an arrangement with us at home, in virtue
of which he was to write letters whenever possible, but
was in addition to keep a daily " log," portions of which
were to be sent off whenever                   an    opportunity should
occur.      This undertaking he faithfully carried out, and
almost     regularly once a week, and                   sometimes        more

frequently still, a bulky letter used to arrive bearing an
American postmark, and containing eight, ten, or twelve
closely-written pages of diary. This, when it arrived,
was copied into a large manuscript book, and thus we
have, in his own words, an accurate record of almost the
whole of his doings during this his first visit to Trans
atlantic shores.
         The     passage           from Liverpool was a very rough one.
     I  knew that the storm-cone meant a lot (he says), and was
not mistaken.     We are just catching                  it,
                                           and no mistake      Crash! A            !

just as he was diving into his hole.            thought     a beautiful

little   use in           it   when       fellow-creatures     are afflicted.          In    room    62
there are two ladies and their maid, and which                          is    the worst      I     don't
know.     I      think, however, that             it   is   the maid.     As there           is   only a
plank between the rooms, every sound                           is   audible    from one room
to the other.
    October 19th, 8.45 p.m.                    Such    a    night, and no wonder that we
saw a Mother Carey's                  chicken this morning.             My portmanteau              got
loose, and danced and jumped                     all over the floor      as   if   it   were a live
thing and how

This morning the few passengers who appeared at the breakfast-
table were           comparing notes as to knees and elbows.                    Unwittingly         I
deprived                                   Being in
               one of them of his breakfast.          state of out              a
rageous hunger,    had ordered liver and bacon for breakfast.
                          I                                    My
opposite neighbour, who has crossed several times, was just making
             M

his way very slowly through           a cup  of coffee when       my liver and
bacon were set before me.        He looked at them for       a moment,   turned
pale, and fled.    Just   as  I went on deck, a message was sent to me
that the chief steward had ordered a plate of grapes into my cabin.
So I distributed most of them among the sick ladies, took a few
myself for form's sake, and gaye the rest to my victim.
                            I
     Early this morning went on deck, and was enchanted.                 First I
went to the extreme stern. Up it went, and then down, down,
thirty feet down.      Then it paused for a moment, and from the screw-
there rushed a torrent of liquid sapphire edged with emendd, and
extending as far as the eye could reach.             Then to the bow, which
looked like a gigantic plough, flinging on either side vast swathes
of sapphire, flecked with foam as white as snow. As the ship passed
on, one could see the sapphire masses sinking deeply into the black
depths below.      Then the wind tore the edges of the swathes into
clouds of spray, in which a succession of rainbows played.                     I
calculated that on an average each wave raised my l>ed at least as
high as our house, and, of course, dropped as much, while the roll
was about fifteen feet. The officers and stewards are quite astonished
at me, for    I  feel as lively as a dozen crickets,         and resemble Dr.
Gordon    Stables'   cockroaches in point of appetite.             One of the
passengers   had   put  his   portmanteau    on   the   sofa  when   he went to
bed.    In the night the ship gave a tremendous roll, and the portman
teau was pitched completely across the cabin, falling on his stomach.
The captain     never   went to bed after we started             until one this
morning, when he turned in for a short time.              By   the way, we saw
two great schools of porpoises, many of which came quite close to us,
showing the wonderful grace of their leaps.           Despite our speed they
caught us with the greatest ease, kept pace with us for some time,
and then crossed our bows as       if  we were standing still.      The deck is
such a curious sight when the weather          is fine.   It  is covered with
rows of passengers in deok chairs, some sitting, but most reclining.
Passengers have to supply their own chairs.            Mine is a very modest
business, but most of them are couches, and            would    make very   fair
beds.    As to the ladies, they might     be  Egyptian mummies, for they
are tucked up in rugs and furs up to their throats, and have shawls
wrapped round their heads, so that the occasional tip of a nose is the
sole indication of a human countenance.

   October 20th. —Wind still fiercer.                   At   five o'clock this morning
there was a slight lull, and              I
                              was nicely asleep, when the men must
needs holystone the deck just over my head.      The noise beats the
shunting all to fits.
     We were living near                      a   railway terminus just at this
time, and the goods traffic                         was carried     on principally
during the           small      hours             of the morning      :    hence        the
allusion.
   Holystones look like gigantic                   Bath bricks fixed at the ends of
broom-handles.           First, the deck is sluiced, and while it is wet brick
powder is scattered over            it,   and two men run the holystone           up and
down, making         a   noise much like the escape           steam of    a   locomotive.
This went on until seven, when    had had enough of
                                              I                     it,   and got up.   I
mean to turn in early to-night, for the noises on board a steamer are
much the same at all hours, and nothing    to be gained by waiting.

    This morning the waves were so huge that, when       stood at the
                                                                    I
stem, they rose above my   head  like  mountains  of blue  glass. The
wind veered northward about mid-day, so that some sails were got
up, and we are much steadier.     Since noon yesterday we have run
234 miles, and hope to do better by the same time to-niorrow, as the
wind   is   not directly ahead.           Please remember that the vessel        is   pitch
ing some thirty feet, rolling about ten feet, and throbbing all over
with the engines, so that my writing can't be expected to be veiy
good.   Nothing eventful occurred to-day, except that we shipped                          a
sea which swept over the upper deck, evoking great screams from
the emigrants on the lower deck, and the ladies on the upper deck.                      I
was at dinner at the time, and saw the great wave climb over all the
ports in the most leisurely manner.
    The captain asked        would preach to-morrow morning.

said that
        I  would give an unconventional discourse, and pleased him
much by offering to do the same in the evening.
    October 21st. — Everyone delighted with morning and evenin?,
and requests all round for repetition.   This morning the wind lullod
partially. One of the stewardesses told me that she had not been to
bed since we started, i.e., for four consecutive days.  One lady has

not yet left her berth at all. To-day, however, several new faces
appeared at luncheon, and it is actually possible to take a meal with
out clutching frantically at the plate to prevent it from jumping into
one's lap.    I  think it immense fun, but stand alone in that opinion.
By   the  way, everyone will call me
                                            " Doctor." It is of no use ex
plaining.     They all say that they have been accustomed to call me
" Doctor " as
                 long as they can remember, and think they cannot call
me by any other title.
      Throughout            my whole memory of him my father
was     always        very contemptuous with regard to the
"              "
   Mizpah            rings     which     have been      and still are so
fashionable        ;   and he never lost an opportunity, in ser
mon or in ordinary conversation,                  of inveighing against
them,      and showing the fallacy of the misinterpretation
to which they owe their existence.                   For, as he was con

other.       So far from being a prayer or a blessing, in
fact, it was practically an implied curse.                  And he    seems
to have taken the opportunity of working this into one
of the "unconventional                  discourses,"    for  on    October

    It  is so absurd.        Lots of the passengers came up to thank me for
my semi-sermons, and Judge             F       was very emphatic.   He said
that they never got such sermons in America, doctrine and florid
eloquence being paramount.            He was delighted with " Mizpah," and
e"er so many of the passengers came to me lamenting that they had
sent Mizpah rings, <fec, to their friends before starting.        This even

     October    23rd. — Wind very fierce again,           and is now    shrieking
through the rigging.            Just as    I   came on deck this morning a
man fell off the main-yard and was killed on the spot.                     We left
him in mid- Atlantic at four p.m.             Of course the event threw a great
gloom    over      the   ship.    I   have   been   asked   on all sides to give
another    lecture,     and    if  the   sea   behaves   itself shall  do   so  to
morrow.       Everyone is talking about the cockroach, and some of
the passengers have been cockroach-hunting                 in the surgery with
the aid of an electric lamp about as big as a marble.                    .  .  .
     Bless these fragile American ladies ! How they do eat ! They
have had three huge "square" meals, have been nibbling gingerbread
and eating fruit all day, and now (10 p.m.) are going in for supper.
      Next follow         some minute          directions for getting into
one's berth during                bad weather, which           I quote for the
 benefit of inexperienced travellers.
     Getting into      bed is a Science.      First you roll up the clothes      as
small as possible against the wall.            Then you hold on tight to the
edge of the bunk, wait for the roll of the ship, and get the right leg
over. On the next roll you only have to jump, and are chucked into
 the berth.     Then you " scrouge " yourself against the board, and by
dint of wriggling and coaxing you get the clothes over you. Once in
you must lie on your back, and quite straight.               If you try to bend
either legs or arms your knees and elbows are covered with bruises.
 I always " play at " being an Egyptian mummy, and somehow can
sleep better than at home.              Only it is necessary to pad yourself
 tightly against both sides, as otherwise you will roll against each side
alternately    as the vessel rolls.
      There seems to have been but little fair weather
 during the passage, which must have severely tried even
 the most experienced sailors.                    On the 24th of October
 is the following entry             :
                                      —

estimable in its place, but that            it was out of place in my room.          I
hope never to have such another night.                   The wind was terrific, and
more than a storm.            Pressure on the wind-gauge of twelve degrees
means a hurricane, and we had eleven degrees, and right in our
teeth    !   China and glass were crashing all over the ship, and at 1.30
there came a terrific bang, followed by shrieks, and accompanied by
a torrent of water rushing through my room.                    Then the vessel went
up    somewhere,    and     back     came   the   water.   Then   there was a great
turmoil on deck, shouting and stamping of sailors, screaming of
women and frightened children, &c.                  Just to show what a storm it
was,    I  found an empty drawer from a room at some distance lying at
my door.                       I
               It was all could do to keep in my berth, and one lady
was pitched completely out of hers into several inches of water.                    It
was so bad that two boats were slung ready for immediate launching,
and a life-belt was laid out for each passenger.                  You may imagine
what a noise the Irish emigrants made. Knowing that                          I should
only be in the way if            I  got up,  I  just held on tightly. There was
not much sleep for anyone that night.                                    I
                                                         At daylight got up and
found that the portmanteau had kept out the water, so that, except
soaking boots and slippers, no harm was done.                           Some of the
passengers, however, had nearly all their clothing spoiled, and one of
the officers was washed out of his berth.                     We had shipped a sea
astern, and it had broken into the main deck, sweeping it fore acid
aft as the vessel pitched.                  I
                                       Yet had not the least indication of sick
ness, though scarcely another passenger escaped.                      There was one
 exception, a young lady, but old sailor.                    She foresaw what was
 coming,     and did   not   undress.       About    noon,  the  wind went round to
 the north and the waves abated, but the long Atlantic swell con
 tinued until evening.             Then, at the request of the passengers, I gave
 another lecture.      .  .  .
       Here   we are, a week           out, and barely half-way to Boston.        We
 only ran 213 miles in the last twenty -four hours               —  an easy six hours'
 journey by     rail.    It  will     be  a  very  close  shave   for me to arrive in
 time.      The captain        says that he has hardly ever been as late as
 Sunday, but      that   this    time ho doubts whether we shall arrive until
 Tuesday morning.               Just fancy what it must be to those poor
 passengers who are prostrate in their berths, arid have had a week of
  sickness.     The ladies in the next cabin were too                  ill even to be
  frightened.

      TEE "UNCONVENTIONAL DISCOURSES" AGAIN.                                            183
    October 25th. — Just off Newfoundland Bank.                    A   whole flock of
various     gulls are coming   quite close to the ship. Yesterday, or
rather the       day before, we saw many Mother Carey's chickens.
Their flight is very curious.     They keep close to the surface,
wheeling up and down the huge waves in a manner resembling a
mixture of the bat and the swallow.   This morning was wonderfully
quiet, so that the guards were removed from the tables.     Now,
however, the vessel         is rolling             About 5 p.m. we
                                           as badly as    ever.
got a taste of the Newfoundland fog, and the horrid fog-horn began
to howl.   During the last twenty-four hours we ran 283 miles, so
that there      is,
               at all events, an improvement.  Yesterday the vessel
gave a tremendous lurch, and four ladies shot out of their chairs and
slid down the deck until brought up by the bulwarks. One of them,
who    was eating        an apple,    stuck     by her plate      manfully.    I        con
gratulated her on her courage, but she said that it was so sudden
that she thought herself still seated in her chair, and that she
clutched her plate because there was nothing else to hold by.                   .   .   .
      They have such       a queer custom.            laid out on the
                                                    The dessert   is
tables, and as soon as they sit down the Americans lay violent hands
on    it,
        so that before you can look round scarcely        pear, apple, a
orange, or bunch of grapes           is   to be seen.
      After this date, the weather                      seems to have changed
for the better, so that the dismal prognostications as to
delay in arriving were not realised.  On the evening of
the 26th advantage               was taken of the comparative still
ness, and another lecture was delivered                      — the     second part
of
   " Pond and Stream," which had been                                                   two
                                      begun
days        earlier.      The    unconventional discourses                     of       the
preceding             Sunday still seem to have afforded                   a   leading
topic of conversation            : —
      Mr.   P   (nominated as Governor of one of the States) paid
me    avery pretty compliment.   There was a conversation about
various preachers, and Mr.           turned suddenly on me, and
                                          P
" guessed " that no one went out when     preached. IThe sermons

seem        to have       extraordinary sensation, and judges and
                       made an
senators are continually asking me to explain passages which they
could not understand.                              I
                        At last, was obliged to say that     really                  I
could not be expected to answer theological questions generally.
    October 27th. — Curious variations of temperature.   We got out
of the Gulf Stream and were very cold. Then we got into an elbow
of the stream and were warm.         Now we are in the north-east
current and are again cold.    The last two days have pulled us up
wonderfully, and if there be no fog we ought to sight land by
noon to-morrow.             ... I
                           have found out the mystery of the dessert.
It is all pocketed to be eaten before breakfast next morning. They
are always at      andit,   no wonder that half the passengers have
                               it   is
artificial teeth. Toast and jam, " candy," apples, oranges, celery,
and buttered toast go on all day, accompanied by uncounted quarts
of iced water.    The consumption of ice      almost incredible, and
                                                                 is                       I
almost wonder that they do not pocket the ice, as well as the fruit,
biscuits, and

      On the 28th, land was duly sighted, after — in these
days of ocean racing —                    prolonged passage of nearly
                                          a
eleven        days.         My      father had contrived during the
voyage to make great friends                                with      a  fellow passenger
of influence, who undertook to                               see      him safely through
the     Custom-house.                    But           when        the      time   came   he
found         that mediation was A'ain,                               and    that he must
patiently await his turn with the other passengers.   He
                       "              "
employed his time in     taking stock   of the building,
and does not seem to have been greatly struck by what
he saw there          :   —
      Oh,    that Custom-House          (he says).
                                         !            Imagine a vast wooden
shed, very dark,          and smelling like a stable.   Truck after truck full
of luggage dumped down anywhere, and the passengers left to pick
out their scattered property as best they can. If you appeal to an
official there  only one answer
                 is               " Git all your own things
                                               :            together
and then wait till your number         called." One lady had nine

                     trunks, each big enough to receive               a dress    without
folding, besides boxes, bags, parcels, deck-chairs, <fec                I   had trouble
enough myself, although an old traveller, and when                    I saw   one of my
belongings in a truck    stuck to  I  and would insist on the men

putting    in my corner.
           it               should think that at least two acres of
                                       I
ground was covered with luggage.    Then, large females would sit on
boxes which did not belong to them.    Fortunately, Mr.         who         P        ,
is   a very great       man here, introduced         me    to the chief     officer.      So
neither the frames nor the bundle   were opened, and the trunk,
portmanteau, and bag were only opened and shut again. . . . As to
Boston, except the very modern part,         as dull, dismal, and

squalid as any part of Deptford or Wapping, and       a square half   if
mile of each were transposed,  do not think that any one would see
                                           I
much difference.             The chief distinction   is   that the inhabitants live in
flats, and that the houses are red brick, with outside                     green louvre
blinds to each window.
     Next day, the 30th, the preparations began for the
               " lecture, which was
first " Lowell                       to be delivered on
                                                  "   "
the day following.    Judging by the entry in the log
for that day, American hall-keepers are very much what
they are in England.
       Mr. Lowell called this morning, accompanied by Dr.                   C        ,    the
manager.   We went over together and sent for the frame, which
was unpacked, and    told the keeper how to lay out the pieces, so
that after breakfast         I I
                      could put them together.   About 11.0 Dr.
C      came again, and said that the janitor had put up the frame,
but did not quite know how to put up the canvas        found that   !   I
he had  put up the frame     All the screws were outside, and every
                                       !
bit was wrong.   He thought that     would save time.

come to pieces again, and the janitor said that he felt

that  I   couldnot write.   There was an unexpected run on the
tickets, so that the applicants had to be formed in queue, two and
two, and get their tickets in their order.   Dr.        said that C                        it

 186                   THE REV. J.         G.    WOOD.
 was the largest house that he had known for thirty years. After the
 lecture, he said that it was the very thing which was wanted.              The
 papers are so  full of the elections that there is no mention of the
 lectures, though there may be this evening.             Even Irving only
 has a few lines, and so has Matthew Arnold.
     November 1st. — Just had a long interview with C. H. H                     ,
 of the American agency     —  satisfactory as far as preliminaries go.        I
 gave him nearly all the copies of the syllabus.         His brother-in-law,
a scientific  party, was at the Lowell Institute yesterday, and spoke
in the highest terms of the lecture.                             I
                                               It appears that am legally
entitled to the prefix of   "  Professor." However playfully conversa
tional titles are given, ranging from General, Colonel, Judge, Doctor,
and the like, they are never used in print or writing unless they be
genuine.     Mr. Williams was very strong on the subject, and insisted
on substituting "Professor
                                "
                                  for " Rev." He says that the clergy
are, as a rule, so conventional, that people are shy of going to hear
a " Rev." lecturer. . . .
     How would you like this kind of luncheon ? Clam chowder,
Mayonnaise chicken, corn-cake, ice (Ponche Romaine), grapes ad
libitum, and coffee. If you like you can begin to breakfast at 7 a.m.,
and go on until luncheon.          Then you can eat luncheon until tea-
time, and then dine until supper time, when you can go on with
supper until 11.0. As to fruit, whole piles of apples, peal's, and
grapes are on every table at every meal.            I always pitch into the
grapes.    There is a black grape here quite new to me. It is not
very large, and has something of the Muscatel flavour, but is sweeter.
It is called the " Martha." The peculiarity is that as soon as it is
bitten the whole interior tumbles out of the skin
     Clam chowder is something like green-pea soup, with dried
oysters grated into it.   Alone, the clam is rather too strong.          Fried
oysters are stunning,   each being separate and bread-crumbed.         .  .  .
     The Archaeological Institute of America has sent me an invita
                                                              I
tion to a conversazione this evening, and to-morrow am going to
the meeting of " Scientists," as men of science are called here.
     This morning    I went   to explore.     Tremont Street is wonderful.
On one side are the best shops, on the other the gardens, and in the
immensely wide road is a four-fold stream of tram-cars ;
                                                                " horse-cars "
as they are called here.    Imagine Regent        Street twice as wide, and

having Hyde Park on one side.            In almost every tree there are
" martin-houses," i.e., Swiss cottages, made of wood, for the benefit
of small birds.      The police are dressed in blue -grey, with grey
                                                                  "      "
helmets.     They do not have a sheath for the baton, or club as
they call   it here, but carry it hanging by      a string from the hand.
It is small, but heavily loaded.
      On November 17th, however, there is                 a   second note
upon this subject        : —
     The beings whom       I  took for police are park-keepers.     The real
policeman is a big man      in dark blue, with   a helmet   like that of our
own " Bobby," and a staff which he carries in a ring (not a sheath)
attached to his belt.        Also, he has a silver shield on his manly
breast, and he has a revolver in his pocket.       On the whole, however,
he is fairly affable, and though     he is said to have his helmet full of
cigars given to him by provident bar-keepers, much the same is said
of our own specimens.
      A   further note, however, dated January 7th, 1884,
shows these officials in a somewhat less favourable light,
and also shows          something of the practical results of
compulsory Sunday closing : —
     You will   see  in " Puck," which I am sending you, a mention of
police who go over to Hoboken on Sunday to get a drink.                 Each
State    makes  its  own   laws.   If  Massachusetts  were    to make  a  law
that everyone must carry a loaded revolver and smoke six cigars
daily, the Government at Washington could not interfere.            In New
York, at present, there is a law which closes all bars on Sunday, and
prohibits the sale of wine, beer, and spirits.      Consequently, there is
more drinking on Sunday than on the week-days, only it is done on
the sly.    The known frequenters of hotels go boldly in at the front
entrance, and so pass into the bar, the blinds of which are virtuously
drawn down.       Others not connected with hotels have private signals
with their customers. The man walks past the door and gives the
 signal.   Then   he saunters    back again, leans against the door, which

188                         THE REV. J.            G.   WOOD.
opens for a moment, and in he goes.                   Oddly enough, the policeman
always happens to be looking in the opposite direction, so that
Sunday is a profitable day with the force.                     The police, however,
dare not go into a bar themselves.                    So, when relieved, they go in
the ferry-boat across the Hudson into New Jersey, where the pro
hibition law is not in force.
      One very neat dodge was discovered lately.                    A portion of a
brick wall was taken out, and replaced by a wooden door painted
like bricks.      It was not adjoining any bar-room, so that it was not
suspected.      But it opened into         a passage      which gave access to a bar
on the other side of the block.              Everyone knows that prohibition is
a farce, and yet the officials           are   forced to make the law lest they
should lose the vote of the teetotallers, who are as noisy here as in
 England.
       Keturning to               the     above-mentioned               meeting      of
 " Scientists,"        he goes on to say : —
      In  the evening       I went    to the meeting ; very interesting, but all
the describers were wretched speakers. The only good speaker was

 the American Prayer Book is almost entirely the same as ours.                      The
 Marriage Service        is  cut   down   quite three-fourths,     and   the Office for
 the Visitation      of the Sick is also mutilated.                The Consecration
 Prayer is essentially the same.               Considering the strong Puritanical
 influences of the place, the book is most praiseworthy                          Wash

 shops are upstairs.         Locomotion      here is almost entirely managed by
  "horse-cars."      Cabs like ours do not exist.               There are two-horse
 carriages called
                       " hacks," but their charges are exorbitant, i.e., two
 shillings  for  the   shortest    distance for eacft person, so that four people
  would have to pay eight shillings.             Hence the horse-cars. Luggage

    The " American drinks," of which so much has been said, are
really very harmless affairs. There is barely a tablespoonful of
spirit. Then there are several flavourings, then pounded ice, then
it is shaken violently, then iced water and pounded sugar, then more
shake, and then a shell-shaped      silver colander is put over the mouth
of the glass, and        the mixture strained through into a tumbler.
" Cocktails," I  am informed, are taken before breakfast, and never
afterwards.    If you take a "straight," it is another business. The
man hands you the bottle, a glass, and iced water.         You may fill the
glass  with  the  spirit, if  you  choose, or  only wet  the bottom.   This
last is the plan usually adopted, where a refusal, no matter how well
grounded, is taken as an insult.
     There is a new fashion for ladies' dress.        Instead of leaving a
little bit of white handkerchief sticking out of the bosom, they put a

   The Lowell lectures were delivered bi-weekly, on
Tuesdays and Fridays, and as, by the terms of the
agreement,        my father was precluded from lecturing
elsewhere until the series (of 12) was concluded, he had
during the earlier part of his visit a good deal of spare
time on his hands.     The second lecture was delivered
on November 2nd, and                         seems        to   have been a great
success.

tickets, and      if    the hall had been twice as large          it could have been
filled.     Mr. Lowell says that  I now may accept as many engage
ments     as I like
                 in  or out  of Boston, provided that                 I
                                                          give no lecture
until after it has been delivered at the Institute.       The Arew York
 Herald announces my coming, and quotes the Boston papers. People
here are curiously impressed with my pension.            They would not
think half so much of a C.B. By the way, instead of illustrating
the development of an insect by the gnat,                     I
                                                      took the Eristalia
(drone-fly), and produced a perfect storm of applause.      The iridescent
wings took them all by surprise, and                  I
                                                heard them saying that
nothing   had been  seen  to  compare  with it.  .  .  .
    It is a good thing that I brought supplies with me, as nearly
everything has been doubled in price since the war.          Why clothes
should be so dear I cannot imagine.   A coat, for example, which
would cost about £2 in London, costs from £6 to £7 in America.
Consequently           the knowing ones get themselves carefully measured at
home, send the measures to London, and have the clothes sent to
America.                                      on the value — say
                 They have to pay 50 or 60 per cent
£1 10s. at the Custom-house — but even with that and the freight
they save at least £3 on the suit. American tailors are grumbling
terribly, and are trying to put it down, just as our grocers, <tc, try
to put down the stores.           .   .     .
      Art   is   charged     higher       than   anything   else.         For example,       I
bought one of our penny paint-brushes,               and had to pay sixpence                for
it.   Had it not been for Mr. P       , 1 might not have got my pastils
out of the Custom-house     yet.    The  officers have a sweet way of
impounding things which they well enough know to be free, charging
anything that they like, and then saying that you can pay under
protest, and so have the right of appeal ! The Court of Appeal is
much like our Chancery, and if you win your case it half ruins you,
and does so entirely if you lose it.  One of our best artists — think               I
                  —
it was Herkomer took with him some of his own pictures in order
to illustrate his lecture.  Previous to sailing he insured them at
their full value. The Custom-house heard of                         it,
                                                        and assessed the
paintings at 90 per cent, of their value.     He was so angry that lie
refused to clear them,           and left them there          until       he   returned to
England.         So the Customs got nothing.
      As to variability of climate, England cannot hold                        a   candle    to

the special points that seem to have struck my father,
besides the use of the English Prayer-book, with the
modifications already noticed in the Occasional Offices,
was the distribution of functions when more than two
clergy were present.    The Roman Catholic Cathedral
does not seem to have impressed him particularly,
save as regards the excellence of the music. He gives
an amusing description               of       a   sermon          by an     Irish
American : —
    November is the " Month of the Dead," set aside for the pur
pose of freeing the souls of the faithful from purgatory,  they, as
H      says,
             " being incapable of prayer for themselves." And the
preacher gave us Purgatory, as he called          it,
                                           hot and strong.  After
saying that the pains of purgatory were the same as those of hell,
except that hope was not taken away, he proceeded to describe the
scourge, and the rack, and the wheel, and the stake, and said that
all these agonies put together would      not equal an hour of purgatory.
Then he showed us how the faithful        departed behaved in purgatory.
He shrieked, he sobbed, he groaned,           for mercy, and nearly
                                          he cried
drove the females into hysterics by telling them to think of their
loved ones departed as being thus in unspeakable tortures.     The
upshot, of course, being that the more money they paid for masses,
the sooner would their friends escape.    Otherwise, when they too
entered purgatory,   they would     be met by the reproaches              of their
friends for leaving them still in that place of torment.

  192                   THE REV. J.        G.    WOOD.
        On November 5th torchlight processions perambu
 lated the town, not in honour of Guy Fawkes' fiasco,
 as    my father at first supposed, but for electioneering
 purposes.       Later in the evening a fire occurred in the
 neighbourhood.          This resulted in      a good deal    of noise: —
       The engine continually rings a big bell, which gives right of
 passage.   The men yell and shout, and all the church bells of the
district bang at random.      The track of the engine is marked as far
as you can see by a train of burning coal ; which word reminds me
that this is a smokeless city, like Paris. No one would think of
burning any coal except anthracite.       I  have now learnt the meaning
              "       "
of the word      build a fire. The coal must be broken into knobs
not larger than the asbestos balls in a gas-stove, and they must be
built in the same manner.       It takes a little more trouble at first, but
there is none afterwards.     No smoky chimneys ; no soot ; no poking
or raking.    Only, when fresh coal is put on, it must not be shovelled
on anyhow, but laid on so as to allow air to pass freely.       The heat is
bright and clear, and there is no dust flying about         For a kitchen
stove it would be invaluable, as the flues would never get choked.

mountains) is pronounced
 " Borston."
        During the first week of the Boston visit the citv
was in the full flow of electioneering excitement ; and,
seeing how absorbed all Americans become in political
affairs at such times,         it is really astonishing that the
rate of attendance at the lectures was maintained.                      Yet
the hall was crowded to overflowing upon each occasion.
My father       saw something of the manner of voting, and
has thus described his experiences               : —
       November 11th. — On Tuesday, Dr. C               drove me to four
of the voting places, and   I went through all the proceedings except

                                AMERICAN GIRLS.                                 193
that of actually putting the ticket into the box.              I had a little mild
chaff with the officials, and suggested that if          I  voted impartially for
all the candidates there could be no harm in their acceptance of my
votes.       I   will send you    a collection   of tickets,    which were quite
affectionately pressed, upon me.            When you vote, you push your
 ticket endwise into a slit.        There it is seized between two rollers,
which stamp it and record the number on a set of figures under glass.
Thus the number of votes which have been given is recorded, but
 not the proportion given to any candidate.             The excitement lias been
 tremendous, and in several places pistols were used freely, with loss
 of life and many wounds.           Contrary to Mr. Lowell's expectations,
 there was no diminution in the attendance at the lecture.                   Yet in
 many parts of the town the streets were impassable, the horse-cars
 taken off, and all wheeled vehicles sent round by other routes.                 In
 several places the votes were shown on house fronts by means of the
 magic lantern, and as the vote of each              district was exhibited, the
 yells were terrific.        Here they do not cheer, but bark, with a series
 of short yaps.
        The description            of the American girls does                  not
 sound altogether attractive to English ears : —
       If  English girls used such astounding expressions as these girls
 do, they would be thought horribly vulgar.               But, somehow or other,
 they
         "  guess," and   "  conclude," and   " allow," <fec. <fcc. ; they ask the
 waiter for a "swallow" of water; they use the word "fix" for
 everything except its right meaning, and then they say "settle."
 They talk of " running" a house, i.e., keeping it. And yet, though
 they use their noses as organs of speech, they do not seem vulgar.
 .   .    .    .  I  heard an eloquent      preacher, by the way, ask in the
 pulpit for liberal contributions,       because   it cost so much to " run " so
 large a parish.       .   .   .
       What would you think of having spittoons — I beg pardon,
 cuspadors — in the drawing-room ? Here they are, but of elegant
 design — pink and gold china, about two feet high.                   Even in the
 elevator there is one, but only plain blue and white.                The height is
  to make them        more accessible    to ladies,   gentlemen being     supposed
 capable of hitting the ordinary article at five or six feet.

 194                  THE REV. J. 0.          WOOD.
       Then there is a description of the American weather.
 My father, not quite knowing what to expect, made no
 special preparation for the winter before leaving England,
 save   that he purchased a tolerably large stock of ordinary
 winter clothing. But he very soon discovered that for all
 practical purposes this would be well-nigh useless.                        It
 might do very well in what is generally considered as a
 "                                                  in which the ther
   sharp frost," but for a          climate
 mometer      is  apt   to   fall occasionally to some thirty
 degrees below zero, and in which the wind is given to
 blow with almost all the force of a hurricane, it soon
 proved altogether insufficient.          So      it  was necessary to do
in America      as the  Americans did, and purchase clothing
 better adapted to the vagaries of the thermometer.
     November 12th. — We Lave had a fine specimen of Boston
weather.                                     I
            Last night was so warm that had to take off all the bed
clothes.   This  morning, about 3.0,    I   awoke half-frozen.        A fierce
north-westerly gale was blowing, and literally howling round my
room, which exactly faces that quarter.        So I had to get up, fasten
the window, replace all the clothes, and add the fur rug, and even
then could hardly get warm. During the day there were several fierce
snow and hail storms.     In returning from the S           's I half thought
that both ears would have been frost-bitten, and regretted that I
had not put on the travelling cap.        .     .    But, for compensation,
such a sky.    I certainly never saw the moon before. She was so
brilliant that it was barely possible to look at her without being
dazzled, while Jupiter blazed with a splendour which he never attains
in England.     Few stars could be seen, the moon killing them all,
and even Sirius and Capella were barely traceable.
      On the 1st of December there is a somewhat similar
note, to which is          appended a further             eulogy of the
anthracite, or smokeless         coal.    I    may add, by the way,

that one of my father's first proceedings after his return
home was to order a quantity of this coal for his own
study fire             ;    that he failed to make it burn                                 ;    and that
his         enthusiasm               in its favour thereafter                           considerably
waned.               Here is the note : —
    Yesterday the thermometer, with its usual playfulness, dropped
from 70° to 8°, and the Bostonian clerk of the weather again turned
on the north-west    wind ; which, as William Black remarks, is
enough to blow the ears off a brass monkey.       So as I had much
writing to do, and it was scarcely possible to hold                                  a pen,    I   ordered a
fire.       It    was lighted           at   10     a.m., and at 1.30 was made up.                        Since
that time it has not been                    touched, and now, to-day, at 11.20 a.m.,                           it
is still alight              What coal is there which would remain alight for
twenty-two hours  and then be too hot to be approached 1 There is
no smoke, and only a solid mass of fire, with pale flames flickering
over it.          If I      can have my way                 I'll   save half our coal-bill.          I know
that nothing has been added for twenty-two hours, for, as                                            I went
out,    I   put      a damaged          tie on the fire, and there its                  ashes       are still.
There        is only one defect                                         defect), and that           that    the
                                              (if           be     a                           is

        A        few days later there                    is        another weather note               :  —

mometer at 65°.   Monday morning, thermometer at 8°, and skating
on the Frog Pond. Tuesday, rain again, then blue sky and brilliant
sun, and such a wind that the mud suddenly became dust.   Yester
day (Wednesday)    rain again and weather close, and too warm for
an overcoat.                At    2.0 p.m., snow again and cold wind.                          This morn
ing, an azure sky, blazing sun, and north-easterly wind. No mortal
can avoid taking cold.     Even Americans from New York,     much                                    a
colder       place, cannot                        it,

top  of the   steps is exposed to its full violence.
      And again : —
     December 16th, 6.30 a.m. — Yesterday was another " brass-
           "
monkey        day, the thermometer down to anything you like, a bright
blue sky, dazzling sun, and a north-westerly wind that seemed to
pierce any clothing except fur.              I  had read of this fact, but never
realised it before. The natives wear fur mittens, and                I  only wish that
 I had  possessed     a   pair yesterday.          Did you ever hear of ear-caps f
 I never did until my last visit to Concord. They are made of fur
 or double velvet, are slipped over the ears, and held in their places
 by an elastic     band under        the chin.        On windy days these are a
 necessity for those who ride or drive.                  The cloth travelling-cap is
 nowhere, and      I   have been obliged to substitute a fur cap, as in
 general   use   here,    the   wind    going through       the cloth as though       it
 were gauze.
     Another institution is dust.           It   is not black, because there is no
 smoke, but is pale grey, and so impalpably fine that it penetrates
 everything.      Yesterday the storm-sashes were put into my window.
 In spite of- the double window, and the great height of my room
 from the ground, yesterday's wind drove the dust into the room so
 fast that   I was obliged to keep a clean handkerchief by me, and wipe
 the paper continually.
      This morning the wind has gone down, but the cold is still
 intense.     When      I  came back from the early service               I  could not
 open my mouth,           the moustache        and beard being frozen together.
 And when they were thawed my lips were                    so  stiff that  I could  not
 speak to order

  thankful for fur. The collar, when turned up, covers the ears and
  both sides of the head, coming well above the eyes.                  Even with this
  protection my      ears    felt as   if  they had been frozen, and could be
  blown off in fragments.           And, though         I  kept my gloved hands in
  my pockets, they felt frozen.           This sort of weather is called a " cold
  snap," and is mostly followed by a thaw, or, as they call it, a " warm

                       A SEVERE SNOW-STORM.                                                  197

frozen    ornamental     water.          At     6.0,    on crossing the road, my boots
were covered with mud.                 After the " warm spell " snow is expected.
But this is an altogether abnormal year.
     The        expectations             of the weather                  prophets           were
speedily realised, for on the very next day there is the

following entry in the log : —
    Here is the snow, and the boys, who have been fretting over
their sleds, will be pleased. Sleds are stacked in bundles everywhere.
They are painted of the most brilliant hues. They are shaped like
swans,      dogs, beavers',       skunks,       ia         There    are double and tandem
sleds.      When there iscertain depth of snow the mayor issues an
                                  a
order prohibiting wheels, and all traffic has to be done on runners.
The carriages are so made that they can be taken off the wheels and
put on the runners.
    December       17th. —    I       should    just think that there was snow.               It
is deep enough to paralyse London, and is still falling. In spite of
the double sashes it found its way through the window, and when                                I
got up at 6.30 my table and books were covered with snow.  So                                  I
turned to at once, put on some clothes, and dusted the snow off
without difficulty.      In London              we do not prepare for snow, but here
the people do prepare for              it,   and traffic    is    not stopped.   Large gangs
of men are at work, the sleighs are dashing about, and        seems so            it
strange to see the traffic and hear nothing but the ceaseless jingle of
sleigh-bells.
     December       23rd. — The snow             is    unexampled,      even in Boston, and
all the appliances can scarcely keep         with it. First came the
                                                           pace
snow-plough, looking like a railway-truck with a great ploughshare
on each side, and diagonal cylindrical brushes beneath. It     drawn                   is
at full speed by six or eight horses, and    covered with men yelling
                                                              is
and shouting just like firemen.    It stops for nothing. Only yester
day two men were killed by one of these ploughs.        Behind  come                   it
the car ploughs.    These are much smaller, but exceedingly heavy,
and are furnished with scoops on each side so as to clear the rails of
the tramways.     Then a legion of men are busy with ice-shovels,
 clearing    the snow from the fronts of the houses, and throwing                              it

 198                     THE REV. J.        G.   WOOD.
 on the banks raised by the ploughs.          Then come a number of great
 snow-carts, into which a second legion of men pitch the snow which
 has been thrown up.        This year the snow was too much even for
          —
 Boston one hundred and ten hours of continuous snow having
taken place.
      There was    a very   pretty turn-out on Wednesday evening.           The
 sleigh was very ornamental, and was drawn by four splendid horses.
 Four strings of bells were hung round the body of each horse, a bell
 necklace on its neck, and bells of larger size hung like fringes upon
 the pole and harness.       They were beautifully tuned to each other,
 the tinkling of the horse-bells harmonising with the chime of the
 harness-bells.    Some sleighs are made like vast canoes or ships, and
 can take a whole school at a time.        They carry banners and music,
 and the heads of the eight horses are decorated with brilliant plumes.
      You should see young ladies going to school.            I saw the whole
 process  of the  preliminary attiring.     First   the girl puts on a pair of
jack-boots,    reaching   to the knees.      These boots are      indiarubber.
Then     she  slings  her books,    papers, and luncheon-basket       over her
 shoulders.    Then   she puts on a fur-cap,    with the side flaps and peak
let down.      Next  she   puts on a  waterproof sleeveless coat, pulls the
hood over the cap, slips her hands through the coat, and fastens               it
inside.    Lastly, she pulls her fur gloves through the openings, puts
them on inside the coat, and then starts off.         You meet numbers of
them in this costume about 9 a.m. and         5  p.m.   I  put down all these
details while they are new to me, knowing how soon they                 will be
 familiar and attract no notice.
      Drivers of covered carts are protected by a vast waterproof
screen, which is fastened to the front of the cart, and drawn nearly
to the top. The reins pass through slits in the screen, each slit
being covered with a flap, like those in the waterproof cloak.               As
the cart approaches you can see nothing of the driver but the top of
 his head and his eyes.       The horses are protected by a waterproof
 covering, almost exactly like the housings used in the tournaments
of the middle ages. You see nothing of the horse except the eyes
and the feet.       These screens and housings, however, are only used
 in carts and waggons, where the pace is slow and there are long
halts.
      Most thankful    I  am   for the furs and " arctics."      Without     the

latter it would be almost impossible to walk, partly                          because the snow,
where there is no householder              to remove           it,   is   several inches        deep.
Moreover,        when      the    snow-carts          cannot         immediately       follow the
ploughs, and you have to cross the street, you                        will have to charge the
snow-wall        which   is   thrown up by the plough.                     Many persons wear
boots like those already mentioned, and draw them over the trousers.
Nothing but " rubbers seem to hold the ice which gathers on the
                        "
pavements.         Even with them          it     is   necessary to watch             every      step.
As to horses, the poor beasts are tumbling down in all directions. As
to humanity,  even the arctics fail when ice forms on glass or iron
slabs, and the boys have made slides on it.  Yesterday, when return
ing from arranging the platform at the Cooper Institute,         found                     I
my feet slipping away from all control.   Long experience of ice had
taught me not to resist, and accordingly                I      sat down         gracefully as
                                                                                as
circumstances        would       permit.     It    was quite           dark, and the " total
                                             "
depravity        of inanimate      objects        had put a glass slab plus ice plus
slide in my way.
    Another horse killed this afternoon.  All yesterday the rain fell
in torrents and produced a most curious effect.       A dense white
cloud rose from the snow, just as    hot water had been poured on it.
                                                 if
Last night a short but fierce gale arose, followed by sharp frost.
Consequently, the snow which had not been removed was first partly
melted, and then froze, so as to make an uneven and slippery surface.

caution.   They go   at   them as fast as the horses can gallop.   The
sleigh    pivoted
            is     to   the  shafts in rather  curious manner,  awhich
allows      of considerable       up-and-down play, so that                  it     shoots up one
side of the bank and down the other without                               injury.     It   is   rather
startling to the novice, and makes him think that he                            is   going up one
side of a gable roof and down the other                  ;     at least,      it    had that effect
on me.
        One effect of the dry cold very remarkable.
                                           is          Here the barbers
cut hair just as    their customers were convicts.

hair looked much like        tight sealskin cap.

sticks up like hedgehog's quills. Every now and then          pass a wet             I

      In  spite of the        extreme     severity      of the weather,
however, so different from that to which all his life he
had been accustomed, my father suffered but little, and
really did not take cold more often than he would pro
bably have done during an ordinary winter in England.
Throughout        his transatlantic visit, in fact, his health
was excellent, the constant            travelling did not produce
its usual bad effect upon him, and almost all that he
complains       of was the enforced irregularity                 of meals,
especially during         the long railway journeys, with occa
sional remarks          upon     the    weak       points of American
cookery.
      While staying in Boston he made the acquaintance
of Mr. Henry Irving, who was then touring in the States
with the entire Lyceum company.                      And very much he
seems to have appreciated his            friendship, which took the
pleasant form of complimentary tickets for the theatre,
and invitations to supper afterwards.                     Here is one of
his notes upon the subject : —
     Yesterday, just   as  I  had sat down to luncheon,       H. Irving sent
his carriage for me, saying that a box was at my service for The
Merchant of Venice.        Of course the luncheon was let alone.       I tried
to find the S       s,  but they were not to      be  seen, and  I had to go
off alone  ; so  I  had the box to myself,         and felt horribly selfish.
Fancy the     S      s' feelings  when   I   told   them at dinner   !   They
propose to wait in the dining-room          all day, in    case another   offer
should be made.
     There was one most impressive      scene.      Shylock's  house is on a
canal, and just    beyond it is a bridge, under which gondolas pass
continually.    After Jessica has robbed her father under cover of the
masquerade, the revellers      rush  and dance across the stage.         Just
after the disappearance of the last masquerader, Shylock is              seen,

                        AN AMUSING MISTAKE.                                     201
bearing a lantern, on the opposite side of the bridge.           He   crosses    it,
goes to   his door, and the curtain falls       as he stands   knocking at the
empty house.
    Portia was admirable, and her swagger off the stage as Balthazar
was excruciatingly droll.     The care which was taken with the
smallest parts was evident to everyone who was familiar with the
stage.   Even the general public behind the barrier was as carefully
dressed and drilled as any of the actors.  After Shylock leaves the
hall the public rushes after him, and you can hear their hoots and
hisses following him and melting in the distance.
   In     the evening
                    I   got   a   note from   H. Irving,   asking me to supper
at 11.30.  Miss Terry was good enough to come from her own hotel,
and was accompanied by two well-known ladies, Mrs.               and
                                                                  L
         —
Miss S— . The manager of the company was there, together with
another gentleman, whose name did not catch. It was very funny.
                                     I
In the course of supper, mention was made of a rattlesnake as thick
as a man's thigh. Naturally  suggested that there must be a mistake,
                              I
whereupon Irving said that probably his thigh was intended as the
measure.   Then there arose a discussion, in the course of which                I
showed the distinction between venomous and constricting snakes.
They were all greatly taken with the description, and Irving said
that had learned a good deal about snakes from my father
   I                                                          This      !
led to an explanation, and utter astonishment fell upon all, mixed
at first with evident incredulity.
   Such misapprehensions, by the way, were by no
means infrequent, and for many years towards the end of
his life my father was constantly taken for his own son                           .
Perhaps the funniest blunder of this kind was that of                            a

Meanwhile the stipulated twelve sketch-lectures were
being delivered on Tuesday and Friday evenings at the
Lowell Institute, and always with great and increasing
success.        Just    as  in England, the drawings excited the
greatest enthusiasm.              People listened with deep interest
to the lectures themselves, and were always quick                              to
pick up a point, or to follow the thread of an argu
ment ; but the loudest applause was always evoked by
the rapid sketches which were made in so many colours
upon the great black canvas.                   I quote    my father's own
account of the lecture on the Whale, the first part of
which was given on the 13th of November: —

                     THE LOWELL LECTURES.                            203-
     Room more crowded than ever, and the rush for front seats
tremendous.     Three ladies, for whom     I   had contrived to obtain
tickets, said that they had been to these lectures for many years, and
that they had never witnessed anything like the rush.         One lady
had her bonnet knocked     off, and more than one    thought that there
was an alarm of fire.     When    I opened the lecture by drawing the
whale, eleven feet long, in two strokes, there was first dead silence,
and then such a thunder of applause that     I  had to wait.  When the
little sailor was drawn a number of lads gave a shriek of laughter,
setting the example to the audience, who laughed and cheered in
the heartiest  manner.    After the lecture was over the platform was
stormed by local science.
      Perhaps    I   may be allowed here to explain that the
drawing in question was that of the spermaceti whale,
and that the
                  " little sailor " referred to
                                                    was placed upon
the whale's back in order to show the comparative sizea
of the man and the cetacean which falls victim to his
harpoon.       The sketch        always   proved      a very popular
one,    and was invariably received with much laughter
and applause.
      The second part of the lecture, given three day&
later, was equally successful         : —
      Audience still  crammed    in the evening.     At the outset,  Dr.
C       ,  the secretary, told me that the audience had become so
critical, from many years' experience of the best lecturers who could
be obtained, that an incompetent lecturer, no matter how able he
might be in other respects, would find the room gradually deserted.
 However, exactly the opposite result has been obtained, the audi
 torium being one dense mass of human heads.         Yesterday's lecture
 was no exception, and it is really pleasant to have the platform
 stormed by the best men of the day, all lamenting that another half-
 hour at least might not be allowed.     One of the professors was good
 enough to suggest that I should go on for two hours more, and
 was met by a general cheer.

         On November 14th an event took place which had
 long been looked forward to with great pleasure — viz.,
 an interview with Oliver Wendell Holmes, the famous
  American author.             My    father had for many years been
  a great admirer of his works, and we had all shared in
  his admiration        ;  and so the meeting was regarded with
  special interest, not only by my father himself, but by
  us all.      He writes about it         as  follows    :
                                                           —
        Be envious, all of you.       I   have had a long talk with O. "W.
   Holmes.     He was more than cordial, not to say affectionate, and
  spoke in the highest terms of my books, especially of the
                                                                       " Natural
   History of Man," which he characterised as an " encyclopaedia of
 .anthropology."      He gave     me   another    signed   photo [one such had
  already been sent by him], and signed two more which                I  brought
   with me. Such a. lovely view from his study window.                   It over
   hangs the bay, which is called
                                       " Charles River," but which is really
  .sea,  and which comes within four or five yards of the window.
         My    father met the doctor again before very long,
   this time at a dinner party of professors given in his
  honour by one of the leading publishers of Boston.
        I was next O.     W. Holmes (he writes, on December            1st), who
   was in high feather.      Only fancy, he and       I were the only two who
   had read " Little Pedlington           and " "Uncle Remus."
                                       "
                                                                      He is de

   lighted with
   was a wonderful evening.          No one was in the least dignified, and
   the chaff was merciless, and spared no one.           There was a delightful
   German    professor    of natural   history,   whose description   of   a baby
. elephant    was   excruciatingly    funny,    especially   when  the   baby in
 -question
             "  did walk from os, wearing ze preeches ob his fader."
        There is nothing like cheek.         Next day Dr. Holmes called on
   Mr. H        , and  said  that  he  had   enjoyed the evening immensely.
   Because, as he said, all the talking was done by the old men

while the young           ones —i.e.,
                            himself and Mr. H        , sat quietly,
and improved their minds with wisdom.       Now, as Dr. Holmes
talked more than all of us put together, this was not a bad speci
men of cheek.
      Scattered        throughout the                      "log"            are       curiosities of
American nomenclature,                        some     of which              I    give herewith.
The   ordinary hackneyed                           expressions                   are           altogether
omitted.
     Did not you think that                  a drummer           was some one who beat a
drum     ?Here the word signifies a commercial traveller.
     Ialways thought that a crank was a part of machinery,                                                     but
here it signifies a lunatic.
     A big   advertisement           (pronounced
                                                           " advertisement                 "),   or   a   candi
dature for office,        is   called a " boom."            If   it   fails,   it     is   a     " fizzle "   ;   if
it   succeeds,   it   is   a   "bonanza."          A   "bonanza              girl"         may mean an
heiress, or the reigning beauty, or famous horsewoman, <fec., <tc.

quite, two  miles  long, with  brass  bands,  drums and  fifes, and Ame
rican flags by the dozen.     was asking what
                                   I             was all about. My      it

affair, and said that " Borston didn't enthuse worth  cent."                        a
    To "beat" your way to a place signifies to evade payment of
the fare. To beat hotels means to go into these establishments, eat
a big dinner, and run your chance of being kicked out.     A " tin
type" signifies a hardly perceptible touch of negro blood in an
 apparently pure white.               It      is   sure to       show itself,               either        by the

      Doorsteps       are called      " stoops," and the pavements are " side
 walks." A "bobtail" is an omnibus with no conductor.                             Collared

       Certain other American peculiarities also come in
 for notice        :

      I  wonder      by what perversion          of language the Americans called
                                              "
 side-spring boots by the name of Congress Gaiters." A watch-glass
 is called a "crystal."            Ice is left at your door just like milk or the
 newspaper.          At          I
                          first was rather startled to see big blocks of ice
 standing at doors, but am now used to it. The plan has the dis
 advantage of making the doorway slippery.                        The carrier dumps
 ¦down    the block any way, and chips               fly about, freeze to the pave
 ment, and are horribly treacherous, especially in coming down the
 outside flight of stone stairs which is universal here, the ground
 having been reclaimed from the sea.
      Shop-window           advertisement      is  noteworthy.        One huge estab
 lishment has got up the story of Red Riding Hood in wax figures of
 life-size, with cottage garden and interiors to match.                    It begins with
  the mother sending the child with her basket, and ends with the
 grandmother's         parlour (tall clock and all complete, with a view
  through a partly opened door into the bedroom).                            In it is the
  woodman,        with his axe, the dead wolf on the ground, and Red
  Riding Hood grasping the man's arm.
       Dangerous Passage. — This placard meets you everywhere.
  On my first arrival          I   saw the notice      in  a small    street.     I  looked
 down the street, and            as everything    seemed    all right,   I went through
  it to    see   where the danger          came    in.    Presently    I   found    another
  Dangerous       Passage which was quite            safe,   and then saw plenty          of
  them.       Traffic, on foot or by wheel, passed             through      these dangers
 just   as   if  no warning were given.              At   last  I  found      out what it
  meant.       The public streets are stringently regulated, and if anyone
  bo killed or injured the State of Massachusetts pays damages.                         But
  the State declines responsibility for private roads ; so, the owner of

the property would                   have to pay damages.          Therefore     he protects
himself by putting up this notice, so that anyone who passes                            along
the street does so at his own risk.
     I   was under the delusion  that Yankees loved gold.      Whereas,

    Chairs are a great trial to me. You can scarcely find a chair
without arms. Then, they are so low that you can't sit up to the
table with them, and they are so long in the seat that you must lean
back in a semi-reclining attitude.    Then there    the all-pervadingis

      A    curious New Year's custom — probably designed
as   a   sort of advertisement —                  :
     On New Year's Day the hotel-keepers have a free luncheon for
their customers, and vie with each other in " splendaciousness." Ours
is  said by the papers to have come off second.       The first was at
Hoffman House, Fifth Avenue, and nothing else has a chance against
it.   The proprietor struck out a most daring scheme, and made his
luncheon-room into an art gallery, having nothing but the very best
of everything.   The room alone cost between five and six thousand

      A    decided impediment                      to walking lies           in the habit of putting
great boxes of heavy goods on the side-walk.                                    A huge   waggon (drawn
by five horses, three abreast in the shafts and two in the traces) pulls
up    opposite          the store — say a sewing-machine                           business   — and          some
20    or       30 big square                 boxes        are     dumped        down   anyhow            on the
pavement,             and the foot-passenger                     has to dodge his way                amongst
them      if   he can.         If    he can't he must go out                    into the road (already

       The following is curious and interesting                                           :
                                                                                              —
      One       would have thought                         that      the    U.S.A.     would       be,    of all
civilised countries in the world, the least superstitious:   Yet
" Cranford," before the advent of the railway, does not yield to
Boston or New York in point of superstition.    The artisan, who
will deride the Bible, class the clergyman with Mumbo-Jumbo, and
deny a future state, believes with all his soul (only he says that he
has none) in the Horse-shoe.     Should he accidentally (he must not
look for        it,
            or the spell would be gone) find     cast horse-shoe, he is      a
a happy man.                  He polishes           it,   he    will go without his dinner for                      a
week to gild            it,   he nails        it   over his door, and makes                   it   his fetish.
He jeers at the very name of God. He yells blasphemies that are
enough to curdle one's blood.  But when you ask hiin about his
horse-shoe he speaks with bated breath,                                      and would,       if    he dared,
shoot or stab anyone who would apply to    the same                        it                 epithets        that
he applies to the Bible. This   not second-hand.          is                           I      have seen         it
myself in factories where even the heads of departments                                             could      not
feel secure without a horse-shoe over their doors.                                       Let them have
their fetish           if     they like.           But      it    does     seem    the acme of illogical
absurdity for            a man          to inveigh             against     the Bible as superstitious,
and then to feel himself guarded against all earthly ills because he
 happens to have found a horse-shoe                              !

                     SOME AMERICAN CUSTOMS.                              209
     I  cannot get over the calm manner in which express trains run
through town without the least protection.        The rails are sunk level
with the ground.       At  one place the cars stopped in the middle of
the market-place     without even the vestige of a platform, and the
passengers walked across several sets of rails in entering or leaving
the train.     I  nearly lost my train at- Worcester for this reason,
Naturally,   I  expected it to draw up to the platform. O dear no !
It had been standing for some time in the middle of several lines,
and   I had been looking at    it without the least suspicion of its object.
Finding casually that it was the Boston train I made         a rush   for it,
and clambered on the car while it was in motion.
     I saw a house being lifted, so as to get an additional storey below.
Strong beams were inserted under the foundations, and         a number     of
screw-jacks raised    it enough to have wooden blocks inserted.         Then
it was again raised, and more blocks added.
     The hotel office is a capital institution, and I wish we had it in
England. It pays your cab when you arrive.            When you go it pro
cures your ticket and checks your luggage to anywhere, so that you
need not trouble about it.       If the journey be a long one, the office
gets you a chair in a drawing-room       car, and charges one dollar.      It
finds you a cab, and all the charges are entered in your bill.        If you
make purchases, you want no money.           The articles are sent to the
hotel, and the office pays for them.        If you go out, and ' have for
gotten your purse, the office hands you any sum you like.
     The checking system is wonderfully good.       When I neared Boston
from New York, a man came into the car, bearing on his arm a huge
iron ring, on which were hung numbers of leather straps. The man
calls out " Any luggage to be checked 1"        I call out, " Hotel Bruns
wick ; four."     I give the man my New York checks, and in return he
gives me checks marked
                             " Brunswick." At the station a number of
hack men are penned behind a barrier, and bawl for custom.             These
men may not come out unless called, but they may bawl and gesticu
late as much as they like, and in the semi-darkness — glass roofs being
impossible on account of the snow — all you can make out is a row of
mouths opened beyond all anatomical proprieties, and double the
number of hands gesticulating wildly in the obscurity.            I call out
" Brunswick," and the Brunswick driver takes                         of me.
                                                         possession
Arrived at the hotel     I give the checks to the office, and shortly find

the luggage in my room.        So you may travel from one end of the
States to the other, carry nothing but a hand-bag, and never bother
yourself about luggage.  But there are no porters at the stations, so
that any small baggage you must carry yourself.
    It's an odd country in some things.    In Maryland, no clergyman
or minister can accept a legacy without permission of the Governor !
I prefer our
               " serfdom " to their " freedom."   None of the clergy
here, or in America generally, wear clerical attire, except when on
duty. Even Dr. Phillips Brooks, of Trinity (who preached at West
minster, St. Paul's, Osborne,          <fcc),   wears a black tie on week-days.             I
found myself as much an object of attention as                     if   I had   perambulated
Regent Street in a surplice and biretta.                   So   I was perforce
                                                                          obliged to
conform   to custom, and have modelled                     my costume on that of the
Episcopalian clergy.    And, though no one may believe me,       do not             I

of hybrid between a coat and a cutaway), waistcoat buttoning nearly
to the throat, and filled in above with a broad black silk tie, so that
the shirt is wholly covered        ;   collars       coming nearly round            the neck,
and nearly covered by the coat.
      The black waiter         comes            in for     a good deal           of notice,
and seems to be a somewhat comical                               individual.            Here
                                  "    " :—
is the account of him given in the log
     The black waiter is a queer being. He has not                        the least notion
that time is of any value, and cannot walk straight                       across the room
because he must diverge first to one side and then                         to another,   and
wait in the middle to swing his legs and flourish his                     arms.   The other
clay, while walking down Tremont Street, I noticed                        in front of me a
very fashionable young woman.   Presently she swung her right leg
round, and announced herself as a negress.  The waiter can't keep
himself   still    If   he hands       you      a   visitor's card on       a salver, he is
obliged to keep the card down with his thumb, knowing that he can't
help whirling the salver round as he presents  just as  girl whirls
                                                                 it,            a
a ball before throwing it. The other day, while bringing the salt
cellar for which someone had asked, the waiter chucked the salt high
in air, and as   descended in a shower on the table was so frightened
                  it
that he followed suit with the salt-cellar, which fell upside down on

the heap of salt.       If he carries a bunch    of forks or spoons across the
room he is sure to play bones with them unless the head-waiter's                eye
is severely upon him.         However,     I can get on very well with the
negro, but the coloured man is a nuisance.             If  you look at a negro
he grins, but     if you look at   a coloured man he sulks.       In  fact, all the
¦coloured men are      sulky in proportion to the amount of white blood in
 them.     As to the genuine article, I never saw dignity till I saw a
 black preacher (of the " coloured Gospel") on Friday.              He was one
 of the biggest men I ever met. He had the glossiest clothes I ever
 saw, and the shiniest hat, and the varnishedst           boots, and the largest
 expanse of white shirt-front.         Cetewayo, with a negro face, might
 have looked about half as majestic, especially if he were waiting for
a horse-car.        On Monday he will appear in striped jacket and
 apron,    or  in   blue cotton overalls.       As for me,     I  collapsed into
 nothingness.       .  .   .
       December 1st. — Black waiter again.           One of them had a very
 bad cold.                                          I
               As he had often waited on me compassionated him, and
  made him a glass of boiling punch           in Oxford fashion.       The head-
  waiter's  eye was on him,        but   his  excitement    during the mixing
  process, in spite of his struggles to keep quiet, was nearly irrepres
  sible.   However, he took the glass and got safely out of the door,
  with only a low chuckle.          Presently he came back, dodged into a
  corner out of range of the head-waiter, and there executed a dance,
  rubbing his gratified stomach the while.
       December 23rd. — Mrs. P              came out strong, not only telling,
 but acting stories of negro life.          Once, on returning home from a
  rather long visit, she was met by her maid Lucy.                " Heigh, Miss
  Phoebe ! Glad to see you agin at de ole place. Is you bachelor woman
 stUH"
       Then there was a preacher of the " coloured Gospel " who
             " de Lord to look clown wid
  besought                                      sang-froid on de sins ob dem
  poor white trash."
       When the negroes were suddenly emancipated they ejected all
  the scholars and gentlemen from the offices of State (this was in
  one of the Southern States), and put in a lot of absolutely ignorant
  plantation negroes. Lucy had married a fellow-servant named Pete,
   who was elected Governor of South Carolina.             Of course they made
  such havoc that they were glad enough to go out and vote the white
             o 2

men back again.         Sancho Panza was nothing to the negro in office.
Some time afterwards,         when Mrs.    P —¦— ,   who had been    married    for
several years, took heart to re-visit her old home, Lucy               found    her
out, and welcomed her heartily.            Then    she narrated  her experience
of official life.    " Yes, Miss    Phoebe,  we lived in de State House, me
and Pete, and we gib big parties — heigh ! An, Pete, he sit at de
foot ob de table, and       I sit at de liead ob de table, Miss Phoebe.        An'
Pete, he toas' de ladies, and        I toas' de genelums, Miss Phoebe.         An'
we had ducks       for supper, Miss    Phoebe, an' we drink champagne        ! But
laws, Miss Phoebe, we was nuffin but niggers all de time."
      The Chinaman, also, in his turn receives tolerably
frequent mention.               By reason of an old and somewhat
intimate acquaintance with Chang, the famous Chinese
giant, with whom at one time he used frequently to
exchange visits, my father took a special interest in the
nation, whose members consequently attracted more of
his attention than otherwise probably they would have
done.       The first note on the subject is quite                       a  short
one,    and     shows the          Chinaman         hard at work in the
laundry.         Most of the washing in the larger American
towns, by the way, seems to be done by Chinese : —
     November 24th. — Coming down Shawmut Avenue,                      I  became
aware of an extraordinary gabble.           On coming near the house whence
it proceeded,     I saw   over the door —WING          LEE, Laundry.       It  was
a Chinese house.        I  should think    that   some   twenty Celestials were
in the room, which was        a small    one ; and the temperature       was 70°
in the open air.
      Poor      Wing Lee              afterwards        came     in    for     sad
trouble     :
              —
     You recollect my mentioning Wing Lee when                I first came here.
The poor fellow was found in his laundry nearly dead from wounds

and bruises.      It   is believed that the assailants were his own country
men, professional rivalry running very high.   In the State of New
York a law hiis been passed  which forbids any more Chinese to land,
and if a Chinaman goes out of the State he cannot return unless he
has previously obtained a permit.   In New York City no Chinaman
may conduct a laundry within three blocks of another.   Even Chang
had great difficulty         in getting leave to land.
    There is a passage, again, with regard to the na
tional habit of opium smoking, which, in spite of restric
tions, appears as rife among the Chinese in America as
it is elsewhere.
    What wonderful rubbish the missionary         world tolerates and
 talks.  O ! the virtuous indignation at the iniquity of England in
forcing opium on guileless China ! But, the same childlike and
 bland Chinee is smuggling his beloved opium into America, he
 having grown it in China. When a ship arrives at the quay, Ah
 Sin, a sailor on board, heaves a rope to Lee Fung ashore. Lee Fung
 makes the rope fast.    After dusk he cuts the loop at the end of the
rope, tucks     it under his garments, makes             a fresh   loop,     and goes
home.       The loop was nothing but an india-rubber tube                      full of
opium.
     Wing Lee       does         business in milk, butter, and new laid

goes over the shoulder.       The stick is hollow and contains opium.

But we only hear of the one who abuses, and not of the nine hundred

 Hamitic races are not intended to find a solace in opium, which clears
 the brain of the Malay or Chinaman, but muddles that of the
 European.     Of course excess would be injurious in any race.

 upon China, or any other country         Even Sir R. Alcock has come

214                     THE REV. J.           G.   WOOD.
     American manners, whether of adults or children,
come in for scant praise.                  The boys are described a*
noisy and mischievous to the last degree, and absolutely
wanting in all respect to their parents, who, strangely
enough,      seem     perfectly blind to their manifold faults,
and give them, if not open, at least tacit encouragement.
Concerning the parents themselves my father has a good
deal more to say; and he says it upon several occasions.
As for example : —
    I ought   to have an angelic         temper by the time of my return.
There is scarcely anything which affects my nerves which is not in
full play.     The Americans are the noisiest people             I ever met
                                          /
They shriek at each other, and if don't shriek no one understands
me.    The space at table which an ordinary American occupies is
wonderful.     Both his elbows are level with his shoulders when he
uses his knife and fork, and        I get scrooged round the corner.    When
he is not eating he is whistling, or humming, or drumming on the
table, or playing a tattoo with his knife and fork, or clattering with
heel and toe on the floor.         He kicks your chair at regular intervals,
and you find yourself bracing up your nerves as the time for the
next kick approaches.            An American gentleman excused these ways
by saying that the Americans were an excitable race, and not stolid
like the English.      I    retorted that we were both of the same stock,
and that the English were just as excitable as the Americans.           Only,
I said,  that in England we are trained from childhood              to refrain
from such habits because they cause annoyance to others.            I had him
there.
    If  you are looking at a print in a window, someone will swagger
along with his hands in his pockets and bump you aside. The first
time this happened      I   instinctively started for the man's collar and
the slack of his t  .     .   s.   But a moment    of reflection showed that
it was only boorish ignorance, and that          he would have expected to
be shoved   aside in   the     same   way himself.   Or, the man thinks that
he would like to look at the same print.            So he leans on you, rests

his chili on your shoulder, and clears his throat in your ear.                    He has
not the least idea that it annoys you

enough, this pushing and bumping is far worse in Boston than in
New York.
    The great American anniversaries                                  appear to have
met with but very scant favour,                                 to judge by the brief
remarks passed upon them                     :
                                                 —
    November 29th. — This is Thanksgiving Day, and a horrid
nuisance it is.  Shops all shut, no late dinner at the hotel, and
everyone supposed to be gorging themselves with turkey.       Even the
prisoners  have turkey,  and it is a point of honour among the well-
to-do people to see that even the poorest family in their district shall
not be without their turkey.    That is a most admirable trait in the
American character.     Only in America there is none of the abject
poverty   of  East  London.    Last year, at Concord, Dr. C         hail
charge of a district (which means several parishes), and only found
one family which needed a turkey.                     .     .
    Bother Washington          !    If     he had never been born he would not
have had a birthday,              birthday would not have become a
                           and that
sort of bank holiday, to the upsettal of all arrangements.   The cars
were so crowded that       I
                         had to travel in the smoking-car, and even in
that there were at least twenty who had to stand ; of course stars
and stripes and eagles were everywhere.
     The constant              elections,             too,        come in for severe
condemnation       :
                       —
   These incessant elections are the curse of the country, and                          I
was told yesterday that " Presidential year
                                            "
                                              costs the country about
as much as the whole expenses     of the late war. Then, every year
the Governor, Mayor, Marshal, ifcc, of each state are elected, and of
course it is,as a rule, not the best, but the noisiest and most unscru
pulous candidate who wins.     The more thoughtful among Americans
are already suggesting that the Presidential term ought to be at
least seven years, and the Governorship of a State four years.       Of
course the Irish, being            noisy    and           unscrupulous,   [are getting the

government very much into their own hands.             You don't find them
in country towns or villages.        They congregate in big cities, like
Boston and New York ; and as three Irishmen make more noise
than a hundred Yankees, the result may be imagined.
       Then      there    is   something       about     the    American
cookery : —
     I  have had supper at the Club, and had Tarrapin            for supper.
" Brudder Tarrapin " is very good, but is           so rich that a little of
him goes     a long way.     "When you  eat a bit of him      your lips are
glued firmly together.       The meat is black and the bones are white,
and there are too many of them.
      Also I have had "pie."       Never again ! The crust is much like
the sole   of  an india-rubber shoe, and what the interior is like     I  can
not tell.     A huge plate full of great slices of pie is put on the table.
You look round and there it isn't ! Four days ago 1 took a very
little piece, with barely a mouthful of crust, and am paying for it
still.   I don't wonder at the number of doctors.          This morning 1
counted twenty-two doctors' plates on one side of one small block,
most of which was taken up by the great          Hotel Berkeley, and four
or five lodging-houses.
     I  have been living considerably    on bear lately.     Saddle   of bear
is very like saddle of mutton, and there is rather more fat.       It "  sets
                                                                              "
quickly on cooling, like venison fat, and so must be eaten very hot.
 Bear steaks are also very good, and so are bear chops.
      " Corn-cakes " are very good, except that they are too dry to be
 eaten without butter, and all American butter is very salt — the cake
being very sweet.       Fresh butter is absolutely unknown. Is there
not some way of squeezing butter, or putting it through the mincing
machine, or rubbing it with the bread grater under water, or some
 such process, by which the salt is extracted     ?

Meanwhile the business of the tour was going steadily
on.      The last of the twelve Lowell lectures was given
on December 7th, with the usual success, and previously
to this four lectures (two on the
                                                     "
                                                        Entomarchetype,"
which had now been enlarged and extended, and two on
" Ant Life,") had. been delivered at St. Paul's School,
Concord, North Hampshire.                    Concerning the opening
sentences of the           first part of the former lecture, the
newspapers had something to say j and                            I    find the
                                 "        " —
following entry in the log :
     " A   Boston lecturer is charge'd with using a dozen words in a
single  lecture  that are not in any dictionary ; he alone knows what

218                       THE REV. J.           G.  WOOD.
they mean."       This is me.       I  only began my lecture by explaining
                                    "
that the " Entomarchetype               signified   the typical arthropodous,
trachaaferous,      hexapodous,       annulate.     Consequent     consternation.
Then    I  told  the audience      that,    if they wished, the whole of the
lecture   should    be   given   in that style, but that       if they preferred
simple language they might have it.
                                                                  "

Saturday Club              at Boston.          On the following Monday
came the
               " Whale," at Salem, Mass., which elicited the
following pretty little piece of criticism from one of the
leading newspapers : —
      When   I went    to the lecture      my feeling was   :
                                                               " What    a pity he
has not a more interesting subject.             Whales ?     I don't   see how he
can say much that         I  shall care to hear about them."            But when
there, and when      I came away, I wondered          if anything    else could be
so interesting.
       My father's own            account of the lecture, and of the
                  "                  "
 subsequent          Reception          which was held in his honour,
is as follows      :
                     —
      December 11th. — Yesterday          I lectured  at Salem, and quite took
the place by storm.         The audience screwed an hour and fifty minutes
 out of me, and then grumbled because the lecture was so short.
Afterwards, Mr.      W         ,
                                                   "
                                 my host, gave a Reception."          Salem is the
scientific centre of America, just as Boston represents literature, and
 Harvard     education.      More than thirty of the leading men were
there, and they were all so taken with the lecture that they want to
get me to return and give a course.                 Such a supper ! Game of
various kinds, fruits various, shell-oysters, oysters in patties, stewed,
 fried, and done in all kinds of ways ; pyramids of ice ; champagne in
 big glass jugs ; and everything in similar style.
      This morning, on leaving the building, I found a carriage for me,
 with orders to be at my disposal all day.

      On December              20th      followed    another     lecture    at
Boston     ;   not at the Lowell Institute this time, but in
the Tremont Temple, for the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.                     The subject chosen
        "
was       The Hoof of the Horse," and the lecture seems to
have given rise to much subsequent discussion, and not
a  little ill-feeling among the local farriers.              The audience
themselves were remarkably enthusiastic in their expres
sions of approval           :
                              —
     On the 20th               the  " log,") my horse lecture   came  off with
                       (runs
enormous      success.    I   had hardly spoken the last words when an
excited crowd surged on the platform from both sides, and converged
on me.     They trod in the water basin, and upset it.         They knocked
the water-bottle     over, and deluged my table, spoiling the colours and
losing the   small   sponge.     But they were madly enthusiastic, and       I
could pardon them.          Requests were made on all sides for my return
to Boston, and repetition of the lecture.
     I  heard one man delivering a lecture of his own.            He got hold
of  a hoof and a shoe, and argued that as tho hoof was rounded and
the shoe was rounded, the hoof was made for the shoe.              Of course,
this was " spoke sarcastic."
       Those personally interested in the orthodox system
of shoeing were far otherwise affected by the lecture, as
may be gathered from a subsequent passage : —
     Here's a to-do ! The farriers and horse-shoe contractors have
risen in their wrath against me.           One of them, who ought to have
                                       "
known better, " went for me               in a lecture, and said that " such
shoes as   I exhibited were the work of ignorant, beery brutes, and
could only have been found in England."               That very man was at
 my lecture, and had not the courage to attack me, though            I invited
attack, and remained on the platform nearly half an hour after the
lecture.     But, although he talked in that way, and wrote similarly
vitriolic letters to the local papers, he did not contradict a single

          On December 22nd a visit was paid to New York,
    where    a   lecture was to be given at the Cooper Institute.
_   The drawing-frame had been " expressed," and sent on
    before   ;   and on arriving at the hall my father found, to
    his utter astonishment, that the janitor had succeeded
    in putting      up, and that all he had to do was to
                       it
    re-stretch        tbe canvas, which no one but himself ever
    succeeded in spreading quite to his requirements.                                         The
    hall was again crowded                        to overflowing, and the lecture
                                 And then there                  came

    the second lecture             at the               same     institute on the 29th,
    which was spent at one of the New York hotels.
       Here      rather amusing incident occurred.
                     a                                                                        My
    father was always                   very           fond of tea, and              extremely
    particular        as     to the manner in which                 it      was made    ;     and,
    whenever          possible,     if            he had         any doubts          as to        the
    capabilities of the maker, he would brew  for himself.                      it
    The hotel system he seems to have despised altogether.
    This    is   what he says —         :
        Hotel tea-pots are rubbish. They are very small and inconvenient
    everywhere, but here they are simply absurd.        They are scarcely
    larger than a cricket-ball,    and hold about half of an ordinary
    breakfast-cup.   The handle      so small that you can only hold
                                                  is                                               it
    between the finger and thumb.      This, added to my damaged right
    hand, almost prevented me from using it         So, on Wednesday,                              I
     went out and bought a pint Japanese tea pot.                   .   .   At breakfast    yester
    day morning       I      produced       it.        The effect was general consternation,

                          AN INTERRUPTED LECTURE.                                      221
and    if it     had been     the boiler of a locomotive            it could not have
created a greater          sensation.       The waiters gathered round          it,   and
gazed on   helplessly.
               it      At               last one of them took   away.

ten minutes he came back, put  on the table, and vanished.

    To add to their perplexity,     had also bought (for ten cents) a

basket tea-strainer, as slop-basins are here unknown.  The intricacy
of this complex piece of mechanism was too much even for the
head waiter.            However,   he   is   a Frenchman,    and cannot be expected
to understand tea.          No one here       does.I    have only met one American
as yet who can make tea, and she doesn't                   know how to pour    it   out.
      Again there           was    a    week's interval, and then another
lecture         at the Cooper             Institute     ;       and then   a   further
week's interval, and               a    fourth lecture, which brought the

" Pond Life "
               on the 2nd of February.   These lectures,
like all the rest, were most successful, but had to be

number of Kaffirs were performing                           ;   and in consequence
they were           a    good deal interrupted by shrieks and yells
from       below.          My father of               course embraced the op
portunity of paying the savages                        a   visit, and found them
very       interesting.            This       is   what he has to say about
them       —

He sent six assegais in succession  into a circle scarcely more than
three inches in diameter. The manager of the museum announced —
 'This gentleman will now illustrate the use of the assegai, the

weapon with which the Prince Imperial was killed."                    It looked
rather incongruous to see " this gentleman " reading                the  Boston
 Globe.
       A    few    native      Indians were ¦also seen             upon two
 separate occasions          :
                               —
     On Monday        I  saw some     noble red men of the       forest.   Fact.
They were the genuine article, gorgeous in scarlet blanket, deer-skin
 robes,  leather    leggings,    moccassins, and   any    amount    of ermine,
€agle-feathers, bear-claws, <fec. There were about twelve men and
 four women, and their presence in a railway-car was incongruity
 itself; of which they were serenely unconscious.                They stalked
 along the platform      after someone who was acting as guide.           Then,
.at a distance of some         six or seven paces, came the women.         Their
 object,  I   believe, was to pay their respects to the newly-elected
 Governor of the State at the State House.          .   .   .
     I saw   more red men at a station.       They were not gorgeous, and
they wore boots, which scarcely harmonised with feather plumes on
 the head.     I  think that they were some of the Gay Head Indians,
 who behaved so well at the wreck of the City of Columbus.
       On the 29th of January the first of a further course
of six lectures was given at Boston ; this time at the
                                " Ant Life," in two
 Chickering Hall.                                             parts, wTas fol
 lowed by " Pond Life," also in two parts ; then came
 the famous          "Horse"        lecture; and, last of all,           "The
 Great Sea Serpent."
       This last was quite a new lecture, and was the out
 come of careful investigations made during the first
 part of this same American visit.                    But for many years
 my father had been a qualified believer in the sea
 serpent.        He did not hold that a serpent of gigantic
 dimensions        was roaming the seas, to be caught sight of
 now and then in widely distant parts of the globe.

                      THE GREAT SEA-SERPENT.                                      223
He did not credit the various                 tales of its               speed,   its
ferocity, and its horrific aspect which occasionally ap
peared in the periodical press.   But he did believe that
all these different           emanating from so many
                            stories,
different sources, must have some basis in fact, and that
they could not be entirely due to the imaginative power
of a number of independent writers.     And soon after
arriving in America, he happened to meet with informa
tion which greatly confirmed him in this view.        First
of all he saw a skeleton, which was reported to be that
of the monster in question, and speaks of it as follows : —
    Yesterday   I saw   the sea serpent   !   At   least,   I     saw his skeleton,
65 feet long.    It   has been so knocked     about that only the vertebrae
remain, and they are in a dilapidated condition.           One of them
was better off than the rest, and just in sufficiently good preservation
to prove that the beast was an eel-shaped cetacean, the spine being
flexible up and down, and not sideways.          This accounts for the
appearance which has been noticed by everyone who lays claim to
having seen the creature.  Dr. W. P. L      , who   sailed alongside
one of these creatures, and made a sketch of                it,
                                                  lives near Boston,

    November 23rd. — Dr.      L   called on the 20th and showed
me the original sketch of the sea serpent.   He    going to copyis                 it

Mifflin, the chief Boston publishers.    Saw Mr. Houghton, who
asked me to write a paper for The Atlantic Monthly.      shall take  I
the sea serpent as the subject.
     Further     information        was       soon     forthcoming,               and
the promised article —entitled " The Trail of the Sea
Serpent" — in due course appeared, my father stating
his belief that the so-called fabulous monster     in                         is

 reality a long-necked cetacean of great rarity, nearly
 akin to the whales, and probably perfectly harmless.
 Then      he    thought of delivering a lecture upon the
 same      subject, and gave a short outline of his views
 to    some    leading members of the Thursday Club,
 Boston, in a kind of quasi-lecture.                      The result was a
 numerously-signed address, asking him to deliver the
 full text of the lecture at an early date, in some build
 ing to which the public as well as themselves might
 have access      ;  and the lecture was accordingly delivered
 as the     last     of the series at the Chickering                  Hall,   on
 March 13th.
      After the second of these lectures, on January 31st,
came a most amusing experience, in the shape of that
                                                                 "
curious American festivity known as a                               Leap Year
Ball."       I quote the description in the
                                                          "        "

     Last night I went to a " Leap Year Ball                              It was
                                                           "
                                                              at Salem.
held in the     "   Hamilton    House,"   just   like   a  provincial assembly
room.     There     were   about  150   guests.       It   was   great fun, the
privileges and duties of the 'sexes being reversed.              The gentlemen
carried   bouquets     and smelling-bottles,    and kept dropping bouquets,
handkerchiefs, and fans,       so as to   make     the ladies pick them up.
Gentlemen could not cross the room unless accompanied by ladies,
while the latter roamed about at ease, and selected their partners.
There was a venerable judge, with the biggest bouquet of pink
rosebuds that the mind of man can conceive.              A lively young lady-
asked him for the next polka.          The judge drew himself up, con
templated the audacious individual with an air of impertinent
wonder, and replied that his mamma never allowed him to dance
with persons who had not been regularly introduced.                   After each
dance the lady led her partner to a chair, bowed, and went off.
    Every now and then        a gentleman would feel faint, and then         his
partner   had to put      him into a chair, fetch iced water for him, and

                         A "LEAP YEAR BALL."                               225
fan him.      The   scene   at supper was   comical   in the extreme. The
gentlemen were seated on chairs round the room, while the ladies
spread table-napkins        over their knees, " so as to take care of their
dresses," and brought        them delicacies  from   the tables.    It  was a
curious   sight.     All  round the room a row of black-coated men, each
with    a table-napkin     on his knees, while    the supper table was sur
rounded with the brilliant dresses, flashing jewellery, and white arms
of the ladies. Several of the former imitated the tactics of old
dowagers, and contrived         to be taken   down to supper three or four
times.    The shrinking, timid modesty of the gentlemen was beautiful
to   sea   At 11.30 a cotillon began, and continued until 2.30 a.m.
It was a wonderfully pretty scene, the figures being a mixture of
waltzes, minuets, lancers, polkas, &c., while every now and then the
whole lot melted into a gigantic ladies' chain, extending all round the
room.
     Part of it consisted in the distribution of " favours," of which
there was ample store. After going a certain number of times round
 the  room, the lady took her partner to the favour table, and then
selected the most appropriate favour that could be found.               Then,
 after another turn, the gentleman was allowed to select a favour, and
 to ask his partner's    acceptance thereof.    Consequently,    colour began
 to predominate.      One gentleman     was gifted    with a rattle, several
artificial flowers, two or three huge rosettes with streaming ends, a-
 metal peacock with spread tail, and a basket.           A lady near me had
 a row of  five  big square pin-cushions suspended     in front of her bodice.
 Somewhere about 1.30 the balance of things was restored.              A num
 ber of gentlemen who were employed in business had slipped away,
 so the ladies constituted themselves Mormons for the nonce, and
 went shares, or thirds, in a partner.
       On February 8th a trip was made to Sonthborough,
 Mass., where the first of five lectures was delivered in
 St. Mark's School.              On the following         evening came a
 private lecture on the Cockroach, to the members of the
St. Botolph's Club at Boston.                   On the 12th followed
the
       " Horse " lecture at the Chickering Hall,
                                                                     already
referred to      ;  two days later came the second lecture at

Southborough      ;   and on the next night the lecturer was
at    Salem,   discoursing        on    "Ants of       the   Temperate
               " Ants of                        "
Regions."                         the Tropics         followed on the

18th, and this was succeeded              by "Pond Life
21st, and that in turn by the "Horse's                  Hoof"   on the
26th.  On one of these occasions the lecture was pre
ceded by a small luncheon party, concerning which                    I
find the entry " Kitten and                grouse." Whether this
was     some   novel experiment          in gastronomy or not,       I
cannot say.      Probably it was, as on a previous occasion

my father had feasted on "jugged                         thoroughly

weather  continued very bad indeed, and some of the
experiences of the earlier part of the winter were repeated
in an intensified form. Note after note upon the sub
ject occurs in the "log," from which             I
                                     quote the follow
ing short extracts      :
                            —
   January 5th. — Brilliant sun, and clear blue sky. BxU the wind,
and the cold. I said that the thermometer went down.       Rather !
I thought 15° below zero tolerably cold, but here is 30° below. Yet
the additional — or rather the subtractional — fifteen degrees seem
to make little, if any difference. In Minnesota      has been 43° be
                                                       ^it

                            A  SEVERE WINTER.                              227
   and the poor beasts     have not yet been reached.        Of course, they
   have all been frozen to death long ago.        I told you of the wind of
   the 4th.    At  Fonda,  N.Y.,  a woman   went out to fetch    some clothes
   off the line.    She did not return, and when search was made, she
   was found in the branches of a pine-tree, into which she had been
   blown ; one leg and one shoulder were broken.               Such weather
   has not been known for thirty years, and people naturally con
  nect it with the scarlet and green sunsets.          Yet   I  have suffered
   more from cold on the Crystal Palace parade than here, though
  the temperature is fully sixty degrees lower, and the wind twice as
  strong.
       January 6th. — Still cold.     There was a fire at Chicago, and
  several   firemen were severely injured — not by the fire, but by the
  water, which fell on them and instantly froze, the temperature being
  29° below zero                No one can understand this cold wave.
  Here we have the temperature of the Arctic regions, and are in the
  latitude of Central Spain ! Even Florida has learned for the first
  time what frost means.                I
                              Just now am in an upper room of a hotel,
  warmed     throughout   by hot-water  pipes.  There is a large anthracite
 fire.    The fur rug is over my knees and wrapped round my feet ;
 and yet my legs are shaking with cold. . . .
       The streets look so strange. Ears are invisible, and those who
 do not possess ear-muffs, or " pantiles," or fur caps, are obliged to tie
 many-folded handkerchiefs over their ears.        The sensation produced
 in the ears by a sixty-mile-per-hour       wind, with the thermometer
 below zero, is remarkable.       The ears feel just as if they were seized
 between red-hot tongs.       Ditto the hands. My thick double gloves
 are of no more use than if they were made of gauze ; and even when
 held in the pockets, the frost grasps my hands as in a vice.            The
 fur glove alone can withstand such cold. The first breath on going
 into the open air seems to fill the bronchial tubes and lungs with ice.

 Without the furs should be a prisoner.
      January 8th. — Here's weather again. This morning Mr. P
and     I went to the club.     Gangs of men were working with picks,
ice-spades, ice-axes, <fec, at the snow-ice wall which runs along the
middle of Fifth Avenue. They were cutting breaches in it so as to
allow people to cross. Before an hour had passed the weather sud
denly changed, and a heavy snow-storm had begun to rage.             It was
            p 2

still falling at 7 p.m. Now, at 10.30, it has changed to torrents of
rain and a fierce wind.
     March 9th. — Never was such weather known.                This morning I
went to the Advent Church through snow and ice. The return,
being up-hill, took forty minutes, fifteen        being a very easy average.
 I  was engaged to take luncheon with Mr. R                   ; you can have
no idea of what       I  underwent    in keeping my appointment.           After
luncheon    the weather      put in another      improvement    — i.e., torrents
of rain, hail mixed with the rain, and a north-westerly gale, cutting
your face with the hail as if fired at with a charge of No. 5 shot
All the R           family begged me not to venture the walk home,
 but to stay for the night.          Here was felt the want of the cab.
 However,    I declined the invitation, and started off.        How long      the
journey took    I cannot   say.    .  .   .   Several times  I was   brought to
a standstill.    It  was  impossible    to go into the road, because it was
 one mass of tram cars, each with four horses, and now and then pre
 ceded by a snow-plough.         The "side-walks" had their curved sur
 faces covered with a substratum of ice, on which was a superstratum
 of mixed hail and snow, the whole being the most hopelessly slippery
 surface that  I ever knew.       Even had it been level ground it would
 have been bad enough.           But just imagine what it        was.    Sliding
 down the slope would fling you among the tram-cars, and not even
 the " arctics
               "
                 could find a hold on a surface of semi-ice upon a sub
 surface of complete ice.        No mortal could hold an umbrella, and
 even the regulation sealskin cap would have been blown away had it
 not been fastened under the chin.          Add to this the fierce wind, hail-
 laden, spinning you round at its own sweet will, and slashing the
 hailstones into your face and eyes, just as       if you  were being whipped
 with small twigs.      Several   times   I was  really frightened, not being
 able to afford a broken limb, and sincerely regretted         that   I had not
 accepted the invitation to stay at Mr. R                's.  When at last I
 entered Quincy House       I could realise Blondin's feelings after cross
  ing Niagara.    If any one had offered me £20 to make the journey
 again  I should have laughed the offer to scorn.
       Comment         upon     these extracts         is needless.         The
  only wonder is that the attendance at the lectures
  should always have been so uniformly satisfactory.

                 END OF THE LECTURING TOUR,                         229
     On Monday, March 3rd, North Easton was visited
again, and the second part of the Ant lecture delivered.
Next day       came      the same lecture      at Andover, and two

     My father did           not   leave America, however,        until
nearly a month later, being busily engaged upon articles
for several of the magazines, which he wished to com
plete before setting out for England.              He  was, moreover,
holding      almost      daily consultations with one of the
leading publishers of Boston,. with regard to the pub
lication of an International Natural History upon a
very large       scale.     All  the arrangements       for this were
completed       before the month was out, but the scheme
subsequently        fell through, owing to the failure of nego
tiations with the English publishers.

wooden houses.       Even the mansions of wealthy men are by prefer
ence built of wood.      They look exactly as if they had come out of a
toy shop and been magnified.          The usual colour is white, with
bright green blinds (outside) and red roofs. Now and then an
aesthetic owner paints his house all yellow, like a sunflower.     They
look as if they would blaze up like shavings if a match were dropped
within ten yards of them.

 230                        THE REV. J.         G.  WOOD.
      Of course,      one   would think that such houses could not be in
 sured against fire, and       I   am sure that none of our English offices
 would take thern at any price. Yet, so contradictious are facts,,
 the offices are only too glad to get the insurances, and, when a big
 fire occurs, the stone and brick buildings are burned to the ground,
 and the wooden houses escape.               They look dismally cold, whereas
 they are rather loo warm.           I   am writing this in a wooden house,
 and though the country          around   is a sheet of snow, and a window is
 open,  I    can hardly bear my coat. This is the dodge. First there is
 a frame, across which are nailed row upon row of planks.                 This
 makes the shell.          Over the planks (which have been seasoned for
some three years after being sawn) is a layer of water-proofed felt, or
                                                                              "
brown paper. Over that comes the covering, made of " clap-boards
 — i.e., boards with overlapping edges. Inside the house is a lining
of plaster, and upon that is the paper. The chimneys are necessarily
 of brick or stone, and there is a basement of the same material .
     If you happen to want more rooms, nothing is simpler. You
screw up the whole house some ten or twelve feet from the base
ment, and put another set of rooms below.              Household life goes on
just the same during the process. If you dislike your neighbours,
or your neighbours' poultry or ducks, you buy a piece of ground
elsewhere, put down a new basement, and then go, house and all, to
the new locality.         If you are attached to your garden, you can take
it with you,      trees,   shrubs,  <kc,  all complete. Now why do not we
do this   !    Americans think nothing of it. A stone or brick house is
treated in the same free and easy style.
      Then there is a note upon oranges : —
     You don't know what oranges are. I did not.                    They are
picked ripe in Florida, packed very lightly, and sent northwards at
once.     The packing which is necessary for a sea voyage would smash
them.       In the first place, in size they are as a peach to a plum. In
 the next, you must hold them nearly at arm's length when you peel
them.       As you begin to strip the peel, the essential oil flies out in a
 small white cloud.         If it should strike your face, it has the effect of
 a nettle    ; and   if it  should  get into the eye, it is as bad as cayenne
 pepper.       The white portion is very bitter, and you must get rid of

                               " TBAIN-BOYS."                          231
every particle.    However, it comes off at a touch. Then you pull
the orange to pieces, cut off the edge of each piece, and pull out the
pips.    Tlten I ! It is all juice, very sweet, and always seems to
retain its coolness in the heated rooms of a hotel.
       The " train-boys "          come   in for very unfavourable
mention : —
      The train-boys are nuisances.       They pervade the train. They
carry baskets full of books, or candy, or pea-nuts, or
                                                              " pop-corn,"
and put a specimen by the side of each passenger. They wanted to
sell me for a quarter — i.e., twenty-five cents — a book which sells in
the streets for ten cents.        While going to Salem on Monday,         I
thought that eveiy traveller must have been taking absinthe.             It
was only aniseed candy, which the train-boy had forced upon them.
       There is also an amusing story describing some of
the dangers attending a theatrical enterprise in the oil
district : —
      There   is a play   called  " Struck Oil," which   was very success
ful in New England, and the manager thought that he would try
it in the oil districts.        It is a very sensational piece, with the
usual virtuous victim, the cold and calculating villain, the faithful
 lover, Ac., &c.   The success was tremendous, and the treasury was
 filled.  Hotel accommodation was not to be had, and all the gentle
 men of the company had to sleep in a loft.        The manager was very
 restless, and about 2.30 a.m. he saw the door pushed open, and a
 couple of huge ruffians come stealthily in.        They went round the
 sleepers, comparing notes, and from their conversation it appeared
 that they were dissatisfied with the punishment inflicted on the
 villain in the last   act,  and had decided on thrashing    him.   Fortu
 nately,    they  knew    nothing about     " making-up."   One   of them
  thought that the manager was the villain, but the other identified
  him as the lover— he, of course, not needing much of a make-up.
  Finally they decided that " the cuss had scooted," and went away.

    Then there is a short paragraph which reminds                                        one
of Burns' famous lines : —
                    " O wad         power the giftie gie us

      I   hear on all sides       that
                                 both              Matthew Arnold and I speak

shut      up the backs       of our throats        and speak through our noses.
Boyd Dawkins          isliable to the same defect, and so    Tyndall,          is
but in    less .degree.
          a                Miss R      told me that when she returned
from a long visit to England she was painfully struck with the
shrill, high-pitched voices of her country-women, and was horribly
afraid lest she should go back to the same pitch.       They all seem
to scream, and make wonderful use of their lips.
       There     is   also   a   note to the effect that at the leading
churches the             choir-boys         are    all of English             birth,         no
amount    of training being sufficient to eradicate                                      the
shrill, nasal intonation of the American lads.
       Finally there         are one or two more                     Americanisms —      :
      Goloshes are called by various              names.         The ordinary golosh          is
here called a     " kick-off," to distinguish from the " Arctic," which
                                                     it
is   buckled.     The " Arctic," by the way,     a waterproof
                                                          is  boot, with
India-rubber sole, sides, and          toes, which goes over the boots, and,                  if
wished,       over the trousers as well.            It    is   impossible to keep one's
footing in snow-time with a leather boot.                 I   thought that    would it
be    horribly expensive,        but   it   is   cheap,    the very best being only
eight shillings per pair.
    " Rubber "     a generic term.
                    is                South of New England, goloshes
are called "gums."       One southern  gentleman made quite   sensa                 a
tion here lately. He and his wife were calling at  friend's house,     a
and the wife did not make her appearance with her husband.    This
he explained by saying that she was                " only rubbing her gums on                the
door-mat."
      As to " kick-offs," when you tumble on the side-walk, the height
to which the article in question can be projected                     is   really amazing.

If  it  -would  only  rise perpendicularly,   one would     not mind    it  so
much.     But, in accordance with the total depravity          of inanimate
objects, it mostly falls among the horse-cars, or on the       opposite side
of the road, where recovery is hopeless.      On February     29th Tremont
Street was literally strewn with goloshes, the owners         of which    had
wisely left them to their fate.

           were given in his honour.               Concerning two of
the    most     important of these latter he briefly remarks
that modesty forbids him to enter into particulars ;
with regard to a third he is a little less reticent.                        A

following effect       : —
     The   monthly    meeting of the Papyrus Club was held at              the
Revere     House,   Saturday evening.       Professor   J.   G. Wood,      the
English Naturalist, and Mr. Paton of the New York Tile Club, were
the guests, and each responded to toasts in their honour.              After
¦dinner exercises were contributed      by Mr. Barrett Wendell, Mr. F.
J.  Stimpson,   Mr.  John A.   Lowell,  Mr. T. Adamowski, and Mr. Otto

of which interchange hospitality.      Note the curious use of the word

      On     the   9th    of  April my       father    left New        York
on board        the    Cunard      steamship      Servia,     amid    many

234                 THE REV. J.       G.   WOOD.
regrets    at his    departure,    and    hopes  that he would
shortly return. He had, indeed, almost pledged him
self to revisit America during the following winter, and
was even thinking, and thinking seriously, of taking
up his abode in that          country altogether.       But this
last idea, fortunately,     as  I think, for himself, was not
destined to be carried out, and although a second trans
atlantic visit was paid according to promise, it again
took the form of a mere lecturing tour of only a few
months' duration.
     The return passage was accomplished under far more
favourable circumstances than that in the Cephalonia,
although the sea was again very rough, and bad weather
almost incessant.        On Thursday, the 17th, Queenstown
was reached, and early on the following             morning the
Servia was in the docks at Liverpool.
     Had the tour      been successful ?
     It  had, and     it  had not.       Judged merely by the
enthusiasm which the lectures had excited,            its success
could not be doubted.         In  every town which my father
had     visited   he    had    been   greeted    by  overflowing
audiences, the papers had been           full of his praises, and
he had received     invitation    after invitation to return to
the country for a more prolonged tour.               But, from a
financial point of view, it was scarcely, if at all, more
profitable than would have been a winter in England.
Throughout his life my father suffered very severely in
pocket     through his utter lack of business qualities.
Anyone who would could cheat him. He never set a
 sufficiently high price on his work, and very often did

not obtain all, even, that he had bargained for. And in
this American tour he made the grand initial mistake of
not putting himself into the hands of one of the great
lecturing agencies, upon the usual understanding that a
certain fixed sum was to be paid to him under any cir
cumstances, with a certain specified addition thereto          if
the receipts should exceed a certain amount.           In  that
case he   would have cleared his travelling expenses, and
returned home with a fairly substantial balance. But,
instead   of doing this, he crossed the Atlantic solely
on the strength of the Lowell lectures, which, though
profitable enough as one engagement out of many,,
were certainly not sufficiently remunerative         to ensure
the success of the venture.      It  is true that after a time
he did secure the services of a professional      agent.   But
by some     ill-fortune  he contrived    to select one whose
whole attention was practically monopolised         by travel
ling dramatic companies, while no stipulation whatever
was made as to the payment of a fixed sum in any
contingency      ; so that the lectures fell into the back
           and were not " pushed
                                       "
ground,                                  as they would have
been  in better hands.      The consequence was that, on
more than one occasion, no lecture was given for a week
or ten days at a time.      The cost of living in America
is very much higher than in England, travelling
expenses had to be paid, and, when all was taken into
account, the financial results of the tour barely exceeded
those   which would have been forthcoming             from an
 average winter season in England.
    Of course the matter had also to       be considered  from

236               THE REV. J.     G.  WOOD.
another point of view.      The tour had yielded much
personal enjoyment (for my father had scarcely been
out of England before), and had added considerably to
his stock of bodily health ; and he had also accumulated
a good deal of matter which afterwards afforded the
basis of many magazine      articles.   But, regarded as a
business undertaking, which in the main it was, the
tour had proved but a very qualified success, and the
expectations with which he started had by no means
been fulfilled.
    Of course by the time that he arrived at Liverpool
the English season was over; and save for three
lectures at Yarlet Hall, near Stafford, towards the end
of May, and five at      a small     boys' school in Upper
Norwood, given at intervals during the summer term,
lecturing ceased until the beginning of the season of
1884-85.

It had been well for my father, in more ways than one,
if he had rested satisfied with his first visit to America,
without deciding to repeat it in the following winter.
He would then have escaped much disappointment and
much failure, to say nothing of the consequent absence
from the English platform during two successive seasons.                           .
But several        causes conspired         together to bring about his
return.
     In    the first place, he had in some degree pledged
himself      so     to     return, before         leaving for England.
Forgetting the proverbial love of the Americans for
novelty, and forgetting that he himself at a second visit
would be a novelty no more, he imagined that the

 238                THE REV. J.    G.  WOOD.
 success  of his lecturing in one season would necessarily
 ensure, not only an equal, but a far greater success in
 the next.    No doubt he was badly advised by many of
 the   Americans themselves,      who,  as personal   friends,
 wished for a speedy repetition of the visit on personal
 grounds.     No doubt, too, the interested representations
 of his incompetent American agent had great weight
 with him, and he was led to believe that the financial
 success  of a second visit would not only be absolutely
 assured, but would greatly exceed that of the first.     But
 the greatest mistake of all was that of overlooking the
 fact that the forthcoming season would be taken up with
 the Presidential and other elections, that the Americans,
 absorbed in their deep and burning ardour for politics,
 would have neither time nor thought for anything but
canvassing and party meetings, and that, consequently,
 even under the most favourable conditions, no measure
of pecuniary or other     success  could be expected.     And
so   evil counsels prevailed,   and a second transatlantic
journey was undertaken.
     This, however, did not commence until compara
tively late in the year, and the earlier part of the autumn
 was occupied as usual with lectures in England.        These
alone saved the season     from total and absolute failure.
                "
The first, on Pond Life," was delivered at Coventry on
September 23rd.       This was followed by " Spider Life,"
at the Eoyal Naval School, New Cross, on October 3rd.
On the 7th of the same month the same lecture was

ships that occasionally attend upon a lecturer.        Leaving
home at 11.0 a.m., my father found upon arriving at
Paddington that the train by which he had intended to
travel had been taken off; so that he had to wait at
the station    for rather more than an hour and a half.
Arriving at the College at five o'clock, instead of at half-
past three, he made the far from pleasant discovery that
the preliminary letter which he invariably sent a few
days before every lecture had never been delivered, and
that consequently no arrangements had been made for
the preparation of the lecture-hall. This difficulty, how
ever, was overcome, but with the inevitable consequence

240                THE REV. J.    G.  WOOD.
that the lecture was delayed ; and so, after delivering
his lecture, and taking down and packing the drawing-
frame, my father was unable        to reach his hotel until
very nearly    half-past eleven. Even yet, however, his
day's work was not completed, for he found a newspaper
reporter waiting for him when he arrived, and had to
give an abstract of the lecture for publication before he
could obtain    any refreshment.      Consequently,   it  was
fully one o'clock before he could retire to rest    ; and at
a quarter before     five he had to rise, in order to drive
over to Savernake      in time to catch the early train to
London.
    On the 1st of November, the now famous " Horse
                                                             "
lecture   was   delivered   at Brixton, in the    Geological
Museum belonging to Dr. Chaning Pearce, in which the
original sketch-lectures of all had been given rather
more than five years previously.
                                        "
                                          Dolly," an unshod
Korse belonging to the doctor,       was   exhibited in the
greenhouse adjoining as a living illustration of the main
point of the lecture ; and as she had been in regular
carriage work for several months, over ordinary London
roads, while    her   hoofs  were nevertheless   in perfectly
sound    condition, proof positive was        given of the
lecturer's contention that shoes are not necessary, and
that horses are better, and less liable to accident and
disease,  without them.
     Then followed in quick succession lectures at Rossall,
West Bromwich, and Leeds ; and then came a few days
spent at home, in the necessary preparations          for de
parture.    Then, on the 11th of November, my father

                      LECTURING AT SEA.                          241
left Norwood for Liverpool ; and on the following day-
 he embarked for Boston in the Cunard steamship
 Catalonia.
     No "   log"   was kept this time, as the novelty of the
 journey and subsequent experiences had worn off; and
 the only records of the tour lie in the diary —almost
 always of the most sketchy and scanty description — and
 in the few letters which have been preserved.               From
 the former of these    I gather that the weather this time
 was   of a much more satisfactory character than upon
 the occasion of the first journey ; so much so, in fact,
that a large board was roughly painted, in order to act as
a substitute for the canvas drawing-screen, and a lecture,
on the Stickleback and the Great Water Beetle, given for
the benefit of the passengers on the evening of the 17th.
This    was so   successful, and so well appreciated, that a
second lecture was arranged         for the 19th;   but, as the
waves     were then    sweeping      over  the  deck, and      the
lecturer would      have been quite unable        to    keep    his
footing, it was postponed until the following day. As
                                                            "
soon as the corner of the Newfoundland " Bank                  was
turned the wind lulled, and the lecture — Part       I.  of " Ant
      "
Life — was duly given        ; and this was followed by the
second part on the evening of the 22nd.          And early on
the morning of the 23rd the vessel anchored in Boston
Harbour,     after  an  unusually     slow passage    of eleven
days.
     On the following day       a visit was paid to the agent,
who promised great things, and undertook at once to
send out copies of the syllabus, &c, to all the leading

institutes — a task which ought, of course, to have been
performed weeks before.          This, apparently, he did
without    further  delay, but took no particular pains to
secure engagements.        And he also, without enquiry,
allowed    himself to be     entrapped     into  an   arrange
ment     which  subsequently fell     through,    and which,
in itself, was quite sufficient to ruin the success of the
tour.
     Yet  the season began fairly well, and the prospects
were apparently     bright and promising enough.           The
first lecture was given at Newton, Mass., on the 1st of
December, and was followed by the second part of Ant
                                                         "
      "
Life at Southborough two days later. The first part
of this lecture, curiously enough, had been given during
the former tour, on February Sth of the same year ; and
although four subsequent lectures had intervened at the
very same Institute, the subject had not until now been
concluded.
     Next day came the first part of the      same lecture   at
Peabody, Mass., in the Peabody Institute.            This was
delivered under circumstances      not the most agreeable,
as a  fancy fair upon a somewhat large scale was being
 held in the room immediately beneath, and the audience
 was largely recruited               "         " element, the
                         from the       rough
 members of which indulged in much             horse-play, and
 not a little noisy comment upon the lecture.          On the
 following evening came
                              " Pond Life," at Haverhill,
 followed by " Bee Life," at Southborough on the 9th.
 There is a characteristic entry in the diary concerning
 this latter lecture, and one which well illustrates my

father's peculiar knack of obtaining without particular
difficulty that which very few men would have succeeded
in obtaining at all.
    Went to Southborough,      and  mistook  train  ;  telegraphed  ; had
oysters; then took next train, and bribed officials      to slop train at

     Two days later he went to Peabody, for the second
part of the Ant lecture, and found the fancy fair
still going on in the room below the hall; and the
audience on this occasion is tei\sely described as "awful."
On Saturday, the 13th, the first part of the ever-
           "              "
 popular Ant Life            was delivered to members of the
St. Botolph Club at Boston, and on the following Tues
       " Whales " was
day                          given at Cambridge, Mass., with
the usual success.         Next day, by a curious coincidence,
¦came   "Ant Life," Part I.,       at Oxford, where the janitor,
 through     officious     over-zeal,   contrived to         break    the
                      rather badly.       On    the      ] 8th   " Pond

 Life was given at Peabody, where the fancy fair was
¦over  at last  ;   and this was followed, two days later, by
"  Whales
             "
                  at Nantucket, where the janitor is described
as " an old noodle, who would not do what was wanted."
 The    weather      had now become very           severe,     with the
thermometer at 10° below zero; but on the 26th, when
 a  visit was paid to St. Johnsburgh,                 it had further
sunk to — 27°, without,         however, diminishing either the
 numbers or the enthusiasm of the audience.                    Tuesday,
 December        30th, saw the lecturer again at Oxford,
 whither he had repaired for the purpose of concluding

" Ant Life," and next
                                   day "Pond Life" was given at
Concord, Mass.             And so came to an end the year
1884.
      Up to this time the tour had been fairly successful.
Fourteen lectures had been given in the course of
the month, and although these were less remunerative
than those which             had been delivered            at  the   Lowell
Institute in the preceding            season,    they had yet brought
in sufficient      to leave a      moderately substantial balance
after the payment of all expenses.                    But now engage
ments became few and far between.                     Those that were
secured were so badly arranged that very possibly a long
railway journey had to be undertaken in order that a
single lecture might be delivered ; and it soon became
apparent that upon the tour as a whole there would be
no profit at all.
      The principal reason for this failure my father gave
in a letter from which          I  quote the following passages : —
    At   last  1 can tell you   something    about   the Western     lectures.
They have     been a complete    swindle.    A  syndicate   of three persons
got up a scheme     for a vast lecture course through     the West.    About
ten lecturers were to be engaged,      and sent on a   circuitous tour, so as
to  avoid   backwards     and  forwards    travel.    Payment was to be
according to reputation.      They asked    H       to supply five lecturers,
each to give from thirty to fifty lectures     in January and February.
I was   considered the chief of them, and payment           was to be either
£20 for each lecture, and pay my own expenses, or £15 nett. The
whole idea was an excellent one, but unfortunately the three
quarrelled, and the whole thing was thrown over.            H       was quite
knocked over by the blow, and could hardly speak when he told me
of it. Besides all his work, postage, &c, he loses from £160 to £200
in his commissions, besides the injury to the prestige of his house.
I cannot   tell you what the anxiety of the last three weeks has been.

                     JOURNEY TO LA CROSSE.                             245
 Here was my sheet anchor suddenly torn away, just when it was
most needed.      However, H         acted with a promptitude for which
 I had not given him credit, and at once sent out a shower of letters
¦on his own account.     One place — La Crosse, near Chicago — he has
already secured, and he has received a number of applications from
Chicago.     To save time, he is conducting        his correspondence   by
 telegraph.
      All these    applications, however — if ever they existed
 — came to nothing, and the first eight days of the new
 year     my father was compelled to spend in inactivity at
 Boston. On the 9th of January he started for La Crosse,
 hoping against hope that other lectures might still be
 arranged either in Chicago or some of the neighbouring
 towns.      But in this he was again disappointed.
      From St. Paul's, Minn., on his way to La Crosse, he
 wrote as follows : —
     I'll just write what   I can.    I  arrived here at 8.0 a.m., after
 travelling all night Thermometer 4° below zero, and no one to
 meet me.                 I
              Fortunately had the name of the secretary in my pocket-
 book, but not his address.    So  I put my belongings into the baggage-
 room, went into the streets, and by enquiring at the best shops,
 found the address.     He is one of a well-known firm of lawyers.
         I
There found one of the firm.        As usual, each of them thought that
 the other was to meet me, and so     I was literally left out in the cold.
 However, he was very kind, and went with me to the hotel, where
 he engaged a room on the quiet side of the house.         The other side
 stands on the platform of the railway station.
                I         I
     As far as can see, shall have to pack my frame, have supper,
and get to bed by 11.0.     Then up at 2. .'50 to catch the 3.0 a.m. train
 to Chicago, where I arrive at 3.0 p.m.          Then a thirty-six hours'
journey from Chicago to Boston.         So I need to be somewhat tough
 to get through all the fatigue.            Just think what thirty-six
 hours' incessant jolting and trembling of the car must be.           Then
the monotony of American travelling is appalling after you are

246                           THE HEV. J.               G.      WOOD.
accustomed to the differences of customs.    In England and on the
Continent you pass through a series of pictures, every little village
having its individuality. But, here, every place is like every other
place.  There are the same white wooden houses and green blinds,
the same wooden churches with wooden spires that look as if they
could be unscrewed, and the same lack of durability, as                           if they    could
be swept away witli a birch broom.      Per contra, the scenery, when
ice on the car window does not shut     out the view, is often lovely,
and, owing to the difference of trees, quite unlike the scenery of
Europe.   Anyway,             I
                       am glad to have seen these big lakes and the
Mississippi ; though, as to the latter,                  I
                                          only saw the frozen surface,
w   ;ich was traversed by big horse vehicles.
      I   have put up the frame in the                  " Opera House."           The enclosed
Jotter from       H           shows that        it would        be absurd   to linger    in the
West on the mere chance of someone procuring lectures somewhere.
As it was, my literary reputation got me this lecture, and H           had
nothing  to do with         it,
                         beyond sending me  the  date.      at  once  sent  I
an urgent telegram to him, and by the time that        reach Boston he  I
may have something.       Anyway     am fighting my best, and
                                                I                        a               it   is

      When the time for the La Crosse lecture                                        arrived,
the thermometer                   had fallen to no less than forty degrees
below zero        ;    but the audience was nevertheless                            full and
very appreciative, and the lecture                              a     great success      ;    and
next day the return journey                                      to     Boston —     a       very
fatiguing one — was commenced. My father writes from
Boston on the 6th as follows —

get up at 5.30. It was fortunate that did so, as otherwise  should                    I
have had no breakfast    Being anxious about my luggage,   went to                I
the railway-station (thermometer still 40° below zero), and after
much difficulty found the baggage-master, lie could not understand
either my ticket or the map, and expended fully five-and- twenty
minutes before        I
                   got the checks. Then back to the hotel, packed
the travelling-bags, took them down myself, and put them by the
door so as to be ready.  The train was to start at seven, and break
fast was announced for half-past              six.        But the breakfast-room was
not opened until a quarter to seven, so that there were barely seven
minutes for breakfast.                  I
                        Then had to carry the two bags, &c, and
find     the train.
                  They do not trouble themselves about platforms
here, but the trains stand about anywhere in the road or market
place.     There are no porters or railway-servants               about, and the only
plan is to boardevery train until you find the right                   one.       This is not
pleasant, when you have to climb the steep steps and are impeded
by luggage.  As far as Chicago, all was plain sailing. There had                          I
to take a carriage across the city, and get upon the Lake Shore line.
Now began       a series   of difficulties.     I    had been puzzled to know why,
the fare to Boston was so expensive.                      To La Crosse from Boston,
including drawing-room             and sleeping-cars,        the fare was twenty-six
dollars,    i.e.,   about five guineas.        But the fare from La Crosse                     to
Boston was thirty-two dollars, or nearly £6 10s., vnlJwut drawing-
room and sleeping-cars.            The latter are         10s. 6d. each, and the former
4s.    Both are necessary,      ordinary cars have no accommodation1
                                   as the
for washing, and the wood fuel covers you with a fine black dust.'
Neither is there any drinking-water, and the hot and close atmosphere
creates incessant thirst.
    Then began the bother of the tickets, my route being a singularly
complicated one, involving all kinds of changes. Just before arriving
at Buffalo, where the sleeper tickets had to be procured, the con
ductor found that I should have to take a carriage and drive to
another station.   When we arrived, there were only twenty-five
minutes in which to cross Buffalo, take ticket, and catch train.   No
hope of supper.           There were    just seven minutes             to spare, so       I   ran
across the road           to an    apparent    restaurant.        It   was    a    "saloon,"
where eatables   are not sold.  However, the mistress very kindly
gave me a roll, broke    and it,
                              put a slice of ham inside, with which                           I
bolted back again.    As   happened, there were oysters and milk in
                               it

 248                        THE REV.        J.   G.    WOOD.
 the car, but the roll came           in handy afterwards.         I could   only get
 an upper berth.         Then    I found that about six o'clock next morning
 I should    have to make another          change.       So  I  turned out at 5.15
 (getting out of an upper berth is anything but a pleasant process),
 and got myself dressed and bags re-packed.                     This is a difficult
 business   in  a  sleeper, as boots, rubbers, overcoats, umbrellas, hats, &c,
 are tucked     away by the conductor in all kinds of holes and corners,
 the berths     and curtains occupying         the whole of the car except a
 narrow alley, through which you must sidle. Light, of course, is
 very dim.        Exactly at six the train stopped, so it was lucky that I
 was up so early.         Then   I had  to wander      again among miscellaneous
 trains, and found the right one.          At  Albany      I had again to turn out,
 carry my bags about a quarter of a mile, and then go up three nights
of stone stairs.        This was at 6-45.       Here     I learned that the train
was due at Boston at 3.0, and that there was no chance of getting
food.     Happily, the roll and ham (a very little piece) came to the
rescue, otherwise       I should    have had sixteen hours' fast.       As it was,  I
just arrived here as they were closing the dining-room doors, and
induced them to let me in privately.
      The conductor of the last train explained the mystery of the
route.     The clerks get a percentage on the tickets, and so the clerk
at   La Crosse        chose    the   most expensive, and complicated route.
Altogether the expenses of the double journey were seventy dollars.
H        , however, would only take half his fee.             He is still in commu
                                            I
nication with several places ; but cannot afford to stay here on the
chance of getting lectures, and, unless           I   know of something within
a week,    I shall telegraph to you and come home by the next boat.                 I
trust that it may not come to that, but it is necessary to look ahead.
      H       's programme        was a very sound one.          It was to procure
half-a-dozen lectures at least in December, then reserve January and
February for the thirty to fifty in the west, and then, while                  I was
away, to arrange for the whole of Murch.                  He procured twelve for
 December,     and    was   in  correspondence      for  March. Then came the
unexpected blow from Chicago ; and there has hardly been time to
complete arrangements, especially as proposals for January and
February had to        be declined.
       The fee paid for the La Crosse lecture,                       I   may here
remark, was one hundred and twenty-five dollars, or

£25.     From this had to    be deducted seventy      dollars, or
£14, for the travelling       expenses,   besides  the    agent's
commission,     and certain items of incidental outlay       ;  so
that the week of incessant travelling and hard work
resulted in a profit of perhaps some seven pounds.
     With the exception of the          second part of
                                                           " Ant

part of the same lecture        at Dartmouth      on the 30th,
this was the only lecture        delivered   during the entire
month of January !
     Still  the   agent   continued to make       his   delusive
promises, and still nothing came of them.          Even if no
other matter of interest were engaging men's minds,
the time had long passed by for making lecture arrange
ments.     But, moreover, political     questions  were every
where     wholly absorbing     the public attention     ;  every
where    lectures, concerts, and even dramatic         perform
ances   were being set aside in favour of the meetings
of the rival       parties,  while    no   one could    talk    or
think of any subject which was not in some way con
nected with electioneering.       And so, when the first day
of February dawned, and still no lectures were pending,
my father accepted the inevitable, secured a berth on
board the     Cunard     steamship    Cephalonia,   which     had
 brought him over to America on the occasion of his
first visit, and which was now advertised to sail for
England on the 7th of the month, telegraphed to us to
expect him at home on the day after the vessel reached
Liverpool, and made all his preparations for embarking
in less than   a week's time.

250                 THE REV. J.     G.  WOOD.
     Only   one   lecture    now remained     to be   given — a
private one, at the house of a friend in Charles Street,
Boston. This was duly delivered on the afternoon of
Thursday, the 5th, and met with great appreciation ;
and two days later my father transferred his belongings
to the Cephalonia, and left the American shores for
the second and last time.
     The tour, as a whole, had been a complete failure,
the arrangements        having been hopelessly mismanaged
from beginning to end. It ought not, in the first place,
to have been undertaken at all until several years at least
after the first visit.  It ought not, under any circumstances,
to have taken      place at a time when electioneering ex
citement, always so fierce in America, was in its fullest
force, and when, in consequence, men's minds were certain
to be in a state of more or less turbulent disquietude.
Neither should the business arrangements have been
postponed until almost the time of my father's arrival
in America; nor yet should they have been entrusted
to an agent so wanting in energy as the man upon
whom      his   choice     unfortunately   happened    to   fall.
 Mistake, in fact, followed mistake,       and as a necessary
 result,  when the tour was brought to its sudden and
 premature conclusion, expenses had barely been covered,
 valuable   time had been uselessly        wasted,   and   profit
 there was little or none.      Nor was my father alone in
 his disappointing experiences, for two others of our best
 known English lecturers were in precisely the same
 predicament.       And all three returned to England
 almost   together,    and long    before the time    originally
 fixed upon for their departure.

                        A SAD    INCIDENT.                     251
    The passage home was a moderately quiet and easy
one, broken only b}- one incident of any note : that of a
sudden    outburst of madness, soon after the vessel had
weighed     anchor,   upon     the   part of one of the female
steerage passengers, who had to be forcibly restrained
for   some hours, and         finally died in a paroxysm of
mania upon the day after sailing. On the 17th the
vessel touched at Queenstown,             reaching   Liverpool on
the   following day     ;    and   so   the   second of the two
American journeys was brought to a close.
    Of course,   as  the English season was very nearly at
an end, but little        could   be   managed     in the way of
engagements      after    my father's       return ; but, by the
energy of his English agent, a few lectures were never
theless arranged for within a few days after his arrival.
                            "
The first of these, on Ant Life," Part I., was delivered
on February      25th at a large ladies' school at New
Southgate, Middlesex, where many others were subse
quently given.      At this school, as at most of the many
others at which my father lectured,              guests from the
neighbourhood were invited to attend, and the audience
was consequently       by no means confined to the pupils
alone,   but was of very much the same character as
that which would have listened to him at a public
institution.
    Next day " The Whale

                                          was   given at Clifton
College to     a very      appreciative    audience of boys and
masters   ; and on tlie following evening the same lecture
was delivered at the Seamen's          Institute at Bristol.   On
March 11th     a visit was paid to Uxbridge; and then no

ground       at Yarlet Hall, near Stafford.         Finally, on the
                                    "                  "
 9th of July, the first   part  of     The Whale         was   given
 at Dulwich College ; and the second part of the same
 lecture, delivered two days later, brought the disastrous
 season   of 1884-85 to a close.
      Only forty-four lectures had been delivered in all,
or little more than a third of the average annual number;
 and the proceeds even of these had been almost entirely
 swallowed     up by the heavy expenses attending the
 American tour. No wonder my father made up his
 mind never again to undertake another transatlantic
journey, although he had been warmly and repeatedly
 pressed to do so before leaving Boston.                 One such
experience was sufficient for a life-time, and he sted-
fastly adhered to his resolution, although subsequent
 overtures     were more than           once made with the
 view    of inducing   him    to break      it.      Lecturing in
 England      was   more   certain,   more      satisfactory,    and
 attended    by far less of personal inconvenience.             The
 fee paid for each individual lecture might not be so
 high, no doubt ; but this difference was practically
equalised by the saving in travelling           expenses and the
cost of living, which latter is in America at least one-
 third more than in England.        And, besides, there was the
comfortable     knowledge    that, even    if   a general     parlia
mentary election were to take place, the British public
would not in consequence be rendered utterly and

totally incapable    of talking or thinkiDg of any other
subject for at least three months to follow.
    And so all idea of returning to America for a third
lecturing tour was given up at once and for ever. A
fresh syllabus was prepared, with details of additional
lectures,  and arrangements    were   quickly made with
the view of making the English season of 1885-86 as
successful as possible, and of regaining, so far as might
be practicable, the ground which had been lost during
the two preceding seasons.

 The season of 1885-86 began rather late with a lecture
 at New Southgate, on October 6th ; and it soon became
 plainly evident that the two . seasons of absence in
America had done their work. For the continuity of
the English lecturing had been broken ; engagements
without number had necessarily been refused ; other
lecturers in the same line had come to the front                    : and, of
course, the lost ground could not be at once regained.
 Indeed,       I   do not think that the               lecturing was ever
again quite what it had been before. The interest and
 success of the lectures themselves were as great as ever,
but engagements came in less frequently, and there was
never again a season like that of 1S81-S2, when more
than one hundred and twenty lectures were delivered in
all.      And it is difficult to attribute this falling off to
any other source than the prolonged absence from the

               "EVOLUTION"    IN LECTURING.               255
English platform, which occurred at an unfortunate
time, and was an undoubted error of judgment.
     During the first three months of this season scarcely
any lectures at all were given, and nothing in the way
of an extended tour was possible.        Early in the new
year, however, a visit was paid to Ireland, and there a
short series of lectures was delivered in several of the
principal   towns,   concluding with the      old favourite,
"
   Unappreciated Insects," at Armagh.
     This, by the way, was by no means identical with
the same lecture as originally given.     My father seldom
gave any lecture twice upon precisely the same lines,
but would add here, and prune there, as the whim ot
the moment prompted him, or as he saw that the atten
tion of the audience was specially taken by any parti
cular point. And also, whenever he was at home for
any time, he made a rule of carefully revising, or even
re-writing, his notes, adding fresh drawings, or im
 proving those which he had, and so importing a constant
element of novelty into each lecture, and preventing it
 from becoming monotonous      and wearisome to himself.
     And these changes had been, perhaps, more nume
              "                        "
 rous in the    Unappreciated Insects than in any other
 lecture.   He began with quite a long list of. insects,
 and reduced them at last,    I think, to three — the Cock
 roach, the Earwig,    and the Gnat — finding so much to
 say about each that very often the stipulated hour and
 a  quarter was increased by half as much again, and the
 subject even then only partially treated.    On more than
 one occasion, in fact, he confined     his remarks   to the

 256                 THE REV. J.        G.  WOOD.
 cockroach alone, and delivered an entire lecture upon it.
And    so, also,   in several other cases a lecture          subject
was gradually so enlarged that it had at last to be dis
cussed in two parts as two distinct lectures.
     During the latter half of this season lectures were
a little more numerous than in the earlier portion ; but,
nevertheless, only fifty lectures were delivered in all, as
against   more than double           that number in preceding
sessions.    Yet the     season,    though less profitable than
it might     have    been,    was not quite so barren as it
appeared.     For, in other years,         a  number of lectures
had been included, which, being delivered at neighbour
ing schools at such dates and hours as happened to suit
my father's own convenience, were not remunerated
very highly,     and were, in some         cases,  given for little
more than a merely nominal fee.            After we left Norwood
for St. Peter's these lectures were, of necessity, discon
tinued, and so, although the total number of engage
ments fell considerably,       the receipts did not decrease      in
exactly the same proportion.
     The   following     season    began     at   Exeter, on   Sep
tember 30th    ;  and, a few days later, began a short but
busy tour in the West of England.                  This included a
special lecture, given at the Seamen's Institute at
Bristol — an entertainment         which proved so gratifying
to the large and chiefly sea-faring audience that they
showed their appreciation        by singing
                  "For   he's a jolly good fellow"
as the lecturer    left the platform.       At  Windsor, where     a

            THE POLICE AND THE TYPE-WRITER.                      257
lecture    was soon      afterwards   given, so many auditors
were attracted that the room was filled to overflowing,
and a number of late comers had to be accommodated
on the platform      ;  an arrangement    which proved highly
satisfactory to themselves, but highly annoying to the
lecturer, who objected even to the presence of a chair
man upon the platform, and always               liked to have as
much      space  as    possible  to   himself.     And the first
part of the season concluded with a flying visit to
Ireland, followed by an equally brief expedition to
Scotland.
     While at Armagh, on December 12th, an amusing
incident took place, in the form of a little friction with
the police, who entertained         grave suspicions      as to the
true purpose of the type-writer, which now invariably
accompanied my father upon his travels.                One of the
periodical dynamite scares         had just been running         its
course  ;  detectives were everywhere          on   the watch for
suspicious characters and suspicious packages           ;  and one
of these enlightened individuals persisted in believing
that the instrument in question was a new kind of in
fernal machine     !   The little bell, especially, which gave
notice as the end of each line was approached, appeared
to rouse the direst        apprehension   in his breast.       And
nothing would do but that the type-writer must be
examined by the proper authorities before my father
could be allowed to proceed.         Of course, its real nature
was  quickly demonstrated, and he was allowed to drive
off with it in triumph ; but the zealous detective evi
dently considered        that he had greatly distinguished

 258                 THE REV. J.    G.  WOOD.
 himself, and had shown much acumen in arresting so
distinctly suspicious an individual !
     Lecturing began again very soon after Christmas,
and the greater part of January was taken up by a tour
in the northern counties. February was a fairly busy
month, and March would have been so likewise, but for
an unfortunate slip upon        a slide   at Upper   Norwood.
This resulted in an injury to the smaller bone of the
right leg, which was cracked, although not actually
fractured, and which for a time gave some little trouble.
In   spite of the damage, however, my father continued
his tour for a few days, but, erysipelas supervening,     was
compelled to relinquish his remaining engagements, and
return home for rest and nursing.            In  a few weeks,
however, he had recovered sufficiently to deliver a short
course of four lectures at Newbury, the population of
which, from being entirely apathetic, had now become
his warm admirers -x and these brought the sixty-two
lectures of the session to a close.
     The following      season — that of     1887-88 —was of
almost     precisely  similar  character,   although  October
and November         were  especially   busy months.    Work
began on October 3rd, with a third visit to Ireland,
Armagh, Coleraine, and Belfast, being the towns
visited  ;  and sixteen lectures in all were delivered during
the month.        Exactly the  same    number were given in
November;        but,  on  the  other hand, the December
engagements       were only four in number, and those of
January, 1888, but five. Seven lectures were given in
 February, six in March, and nine in the four following

months;      the   season    thus again   including     sixty-two
lectures.
     October     11th,   1888,    saw the   beginning      of  my
father's last lecturing season.        On that day he visited
Malvern, and gave two lectures, the first on " Insect
                     "
Transformations         at three o'clock, and the second, on
" The Horse and his Master " at                        Both this
                                            eight.
month and the next were fully occupied ; and by
Christmas he had delivered thirty-two lectures in all.
      His life's work    was now very nearly at an end.          I
returned home towards the end of November, for a visit
of a few weeks, and noticed little change in him,
except that he seemed          rather more absent than usual,
and rather more susceptible to fatigue.              But he was
away lecturing during a considerable portion of my
 stay, and, when at home, was generally hard at work
 in his study, after his manner; so that             I  saw com
 paratively little of him. On the 8th of January he
 started off to spend a week with some friends at South
 Norwood, and on the morning of that day               I  saw him
 for the last time.
      I  cannot help thinking that even now, although no
 traces of the disease      which carried him   off'  had as yet
 appeared, his constitution was breaking up.            Now and
 then — as   I  afterwards    learned — he would give way to
  drowsiness, and would fall asleep in his chair, or even
 at the table.     He took cold repeatedly, and complained
  more than usual of pains in the chest.        And the strain
  of the incessant work and the constant railway travel
  ling  seemed to    be telling upon him, although at times
           r  2

260                   THE REV. J.     G. WOOD.
he was as bright and cheerful            as ever.    But yet he
never stopped        his writing for a single day, and no
falling-off was noticed in the interest or the humour of
his lectures.
     On January ] 5th, 1889, lecturing began again with
" Ant Life of the
                       Tropics," at the Congregational School
room, Ramsgate, where he constantly lectured, and was
always warmly welcomed.           Other lectures followed, the
                                                 "
most noticeable being that on " Ant Life at the London
Institution, which met with such marked              success   that
the committee,         with a highly appreciative     letter, sent
him an increased fee.        This  was on   February   1 8th.    On
the   19th     he    gave   "Nature's    Teachings"       at   New
Southgate    ;    and on the following day he travelled north
for a short tour in Scotland.
     To this, strange to say, he had from the very first
looked forward with absolute dread.            Frevious Scottish
tours had proved very successful, both from an artistic and
a  financial point of view, and he had made many friends
who were glad again to receive him with their usual
hospitality.        But he had always complained       bitterly of
the terribly slow travelling       upon the branch railways,
the   long waits at the numerous             junctions, and     the
miserably       inadequate     accommodation       provided      for
passengers at all but the principal stations.            An   entire
 day would sometimes be occupied           in travelling fifty or
 sixty miles    ;  he would arrive at his destination with but
barely sufficient time to put up his frame, and without
 a moment for rest or refreshment.          And he had so vivid
 a recollection     of the discomforts which he had endured

                  BEGINNING OF THE END.                  261
on previous occasions, that, from the. very time that this
present tour was arranged, he repeatedly expressed a
wish that he could avoid it.       Only a few days before
leaving home for the last time, indeed, he said that if
there had been one lecture less arranged, he would even
then, at the eleventh hour, relinquish the tour altogether,
rather than go through what he knew lay before him.
The shadow of what was to come seemed upon him,
aud he never left home for a lecturing expedition in
such marked depression of spirits.
     However, engagements were engagements,          and he
had never yet disappointed     the public through any fault
of his own   ; and he accordingly left London for Glasgow
on February 20th, and lectured       at Tillicoultry on the
next day. On the 22nd he went to Dollar, where he
lectured in the evening.      The next three days he spent
at Fettes College, near Edinburgh, lecturing twice, and
remaining over the Sunday ; and on that day he made
the last entry in his diary — a mere brief reference to
some letters which he had written.
    On Tuesday, the 25th, he travelled southwards, and
on the following day was to have lectured at Sedbergh
Grammar School, in Yorkshire.         But drowsiness over
came him in the train, he passed the junction at which
it was necessary for him to change, and was unable        to
return in time to reach the school.
    On    this   day  the  illness which    carried him off
assumed its final form.     Even on Sunday, the 17th, he
had been very unwell, and by advice had stayed quietly
indoors until the evening, when he had promised to

262               THE EEV. J.     G.   WOOD.
preach for a clerical friend.    During the week he took
cold, and failed to throw it off as usual.      And, finally,
while waiting upon the platform of one of the Scotch
railway stations   on a bitterly cold and windy day, he
had sustained a severe chill, which a few hours later,
under similar circumstances, was repeated. This led to
internal inflammation. Still he was not in the least
aware of his real state.   Although suffering much pain,
he refused to see a local physician — by doing which, as
it afterwards appeared, he might have saved his life —
and merely wrote     to his own medical man, describing
his symptoms, and inquiring whether or not they were
serious.   In his home letters he did not mention the
subject of his health  ; and still he persisted in going on
with his work.
     On the night of Wednesday, the 26th, he did not
sleep at all, and on the Thursday was much weakened
by pain and want of rest. Still, however, he travelled
to Burton-on-Trent, and lectured on " Pond Life," at
St. George's Hall, in the evening.       On that night again
he did not sleep, but yet contrived on the Friday to
revise a number of proof-sheets for the press, to write a
short letter home — still without any reference to him
self — and to lecture again, for the last time, in the
evening.    But  he did so only with the utmost difficulty.
He could scarcely pull himself together to deliver his
lecture ; he was compelled more than once to leave the
hall, in order to obtain a Little warmth at the fire in the
ante-room;    and finally he brought his remarks         to a
close rather suddenly, omitting      the carefully elaborated

                THE LAST SKETCH-LECTURE.                 263
peroration with which he usually concluded.       Yet those
 who were present said that the lecture was as interesting
as ever, and the drawings      as rapid and exact, although
the   lecturer  was   obviously suffering much pain, and
clearly unfit to be lecturing at all. After the lecture the
drawing-frame was taken down and packed as usual, and
my father went to the house of some friends for the night.
     Here his appearance excited so much alarm that he
was entreated to see a doctor at once, and to relinquish
all idea of fulfilling his remaining engagements ; but he
still failed to realise his own condition, and insisted on
starting early next morning for Coventry, where he was
to lecture on the following Monday.       During the night
he became weaker, and there seemed        a latent meaning
in the words with which he thanked his host for certain
arrangements made for his comfort during the journey —
"
   You know   I would have done as much for you."    But he
took out his type-writer in the train, and attempted to
write an article, of which, however, he only completed
about half-a-dozen lines.
     Shortly before five o'clock in the afternoon he
arrived at Coventry, and drove at once from the railway
station to St. Mary's Hall, where the lecture was to be
delivered.    There he left his apparatus, saying that
he would come on the Monday afternoon to put up the
screen.    Thence he proceeded to the house of his old
friend, Mrs. Bray, with whom he had promised to stay
until the Tuesday morning, and who had been princi
pally instrumental in arranging for his previous lectures
in the town.

264                    THE REV. J.     G. WOOD.
     So far     his wonderful      courage    and  determination
carried    him on     ; but now, at last, he was compelled to
give way.       Almost immediately on arriving he said that
he feared he was very ill, and, after resting for a few
minutes,      asked that a prescription which he had with
him might at once be made up by the nearest chemist.
Alarmed by his appearance, however, Mrs. Bray suggested
that a doctor should be immediately summoned, a pro
posal to which he at once assented ; and in a very short
time one of the leading physicians of the town arrived,
only to find him in a state of utter collapse from the
combined effects of pain, exhaustion, and want of sleep.
A   brief examination       sufficed to show that the patient
was in a most critical condition, and suffering from an
attack of acute peritonitis, with very serious complica
tions   ;  so    serious,  indeed,    that   recovery,  humanly
speaking, was impossible.          Of this my father seemed to
be fully aware, for when, in answer to his own earnest
inquiry, the physician told him the exact state of the
case, he    merely replied,
                              " Just   as I expected," and asked
how many hours he had to live.                Being told that in
all probability the end would come in the course of the
following day, he received the information with perfect
calmness, walked upstairs with a little assistance, and
was put to bed.         By this time    the pain had become so
intense that injections of morphia were administered,
as the    only means of keeping the agony at bay.         Under
the    influence of these he became easier, and slept
during      a  great    part of the night and the Sunday
morning.

                           LAST HOURS.                      265
     Several   times he was asked whether a telegraphic
summons      should not be sent to my mother; but to
this   proposal he steadily refused his assent, on the
ground that her own state of health rendered her unfit
for the travel and anxiety.       Neither would he allow the
truth to    be   told her, for fear of the shock which it
would cause.        All that he would permit was a simple
preparatory message, stating the fact of his illness,
without details of any kind. And then he set himself
to prepare for the end.
     Early in the Sunday afternoon the pain left him — a
sure sign that he had not many hours to live.           For a
time he seemed to rally, and, asking for pencil and
paper, spent the next two hours in writing a letter
home.     Save that this letter is written in the faintest
of characters — probably owing to the hardness of the
pencil — no one would imagine for a moment that it had
proceeded from the hand of a dying man.           The writing
is as firm and steady as usual, there is not a trace of
incoherence,      or  even of haste, and,    amid  the   many
directions given, there is nothing superfluous, nothing
that would have been discovered in the ordinary course
of things without his assistance.        His mind must    have
been perfectly clear and under control, in spite of his
great weakness and the nearness of the end. And he
 was evidently fully aware of his condition, and quite
conscious that those       few pencil lines were the last that
 his hand would ever trace.
     His letter written,       he  signed  it with his usual
 firm, free signature,    and asked  that it might be posted

266                THE REV. J.   G.  WOOD.
in time for the evening despatch. And then for nearly
two hours he lay absorbed in prayer and meditation.
    At  six o'clock he complained of thirst, and asked for
a cup of milk.     Still his mind was perfectly clear, for,
finding that he could no longer raise his head to drink,
he asked whether there happened to be an invalid's cup
in the house, and, finding that there was not, suggested
that a small milk-jug would answer the purpose instead.
This was procured, and he drank his milk, asking
immediately afterwards for a large cup of tea, which he
drank also.      And almost    immediately afterwards   he
turned his head upon        one  side, and quietly  passed
away.

Authorship, although             a  sufficiently laborious profession
to those who depend upon the pen for their daily bread,
is commonly supposed to have this great counter
balancing advantage, that it can be carried on quietly at
home, without any necessity for a daily journey to and
from an office, perhaps many miles away.                           This is no
doubt true enough ; but it may yet be questioned
whether the ordinary man of business is not more
favoured        than the author after all.              For, although he
may be obliged to leave home                     early in the morning,
although he may not return until the shades of evening
have fallen, and although his work throughout the day
may be wearisome and exacting, yet, when he leaves

2b8                  THE REV. J.     G.  WOOD.
his office in the afternoon, that work is done.         He has
his evening to himself, to employ as he sees           fit. He
can enjoy a quiet pipe after dinner, or a friendly rubber,
without feeling that he is neglecting any duty.             He
need not burn the midnight oil, unless it please him so
to do.     And he can hear the postman's knock with
equanimity, for he has no dread of receiving a number
of communications requiring an instant answer, or an
urgent demand for MS. to be supplied without delay.
     But with a successful author matters are very
different.     He may, perhaps,      if  he be methodical — as
very few authors are — so map out his day as to devote
certain specified hours to writing, in order that the rest
of his time may      be free.   But this system of arrange
ment,   if it  be carried  out at all, generally proves more
theoretical than practical.         A   heavy batch  of proof-
sheets arrives unexpectedly,      and must be revised without
delay.    An index     has to be made out    ; an order arrives
for an immediate article      ; or a number of books have to
be reviewed at a few      hours' notice.   Probably a printer's
emissary puts in an appearance, with orders not to take
his departure until supplied with further " copy." And
                       "
then the " system        has to be broken through, and the
programme cast to the winds.
     And in the     case of an unmethodical writer, matters,
of course,    are far worse.    He is never his own master.
There is always work waiting to be done which should
have been done days before, and which must now
be done at     high pressure if engagements are to be re
spected and kept.        He may, perhaps, work hard all day,

                    GREAT POWER OF WORK.                     26£
 and yet there is a good deal to be done at night, quite
 irrespectively of any special orders which may come in
 by the evening post. And, consequently, although he
 may live at home, and work at home, he yet enjoys very
 little of what is generally termed " home life."        All his
 time is spent in the study, and the more he           does  the
  more there seems to do.
      Such was      the   case  with my father throughout
  almost all his career.       He could scarcely, perhaps, be
  described as unmethodical, for he was          never  behind
  hand with his work, and prided himself on always
  sending in his MS. rather before the time appointed.
¦ But he never would, and never could, tie himself down
  to write at certain      regular hours ;  and, as he nearly
  always had an immense amount of work on his hands,
  the consequence was that frequently we seldom saw him,
  except    at meal    times,  for days and weeks together.
  During the last few years of his life, indeed, strangers
  saw far more of him than ourselves, for after his lectures
  were over, and often upon intervening days, he was of
   course obliged to yield in some measure to the demands
   of society, and to spend in recreation hours which at
   home he would certainly have devoted to work. And
  no doubt this in great measure tended to the preserva
   tion of his health.
       For, when at home,         he was   terribly careless   of
   himself.    He   would work, day after day, with little
   or no intermission, taking scarcely any exercise, and
   sometimes    not leaving the house for a week at a
   time.    If visitors came he seldom saw them.         All his

270                THE REV. J.   G.    WOOD.
time was passed in work.      And probably only tbe en
forced periods of comparative      leisure, which now and
then occurred in his lecturing tours, saved him from a
complete break-down.
      His  power of work was simply astonishing.      When
I  first remember him he was always at his desk by half-
past four or five o'clock in the morning at all seasons of
the year, lighting his own fire in the winter, and then
writing steadily until eight.    Then, in all weathers, he
would start off for a sharp run of three miles over a
stretch of particularly hilly country, winding up with a
tolerably steep ascent of nearly a quarter of a mile, and
priding himself on completing the distance from start
to finish without stopping, or even slackening his pace.
Then came a cold bath, followed by breakfast, during
 which his attention was entirely engrossed by his letters
 and the newspaper.     After this an hour or so would be
 occupied with correspondence, which generally included
 the answering of natural history questions from all parts
 of the world.    For all sorts of people used to write to
 him on all sorts of subjects, and though these manifold
 queries occasioned great    demands      upon his time and
 patience, and were often of the most trivial and even
 ridiculous character, he never allowed them to remain un
 answered, but always sent at least a few courteous lines
 in reply.    Autograph hunters, too, troubled him a good
 deal ; but to these he replied much more curtly, gene
 rally returning the letter of request with the addition of
 the simple words, " Here it is, J. G. Wood."
       By way of a specimen of his correspondence with

                               LETTER-WRITING.                              271
intimate friends           I quote     the following letter, which was
¦written       to    a   cousin     shortly    after the      delivery of     a
special sermon in the early part of the year 1887.                           It
 is,   I think,     a  fair example of his letters, and is further
 interesting as giving his own description of his style
 of preaching : —
       I am very much pleased to hear that your people appreciated
  my small efforts.       As Mr. Swiveller remarks, after punching Quilp's
  head,
          " There's plenty more of it at the same shop ; a large and ex
  tensive assortment       always on hand.      Country orders executed with
  neatness and despatch"          So, if my good fortune should take me to
  C       , I shall  be  happy   to place at your command the contents of
  my very limited treasury.          I do not go in for rhetoric or special doc
  trines, and limit myself to the safe grounds of general exegesis.
       I  very much enjoyed         my   L      visit, and very much regret
  that M          P       , like J      , has laid herself up by thoughtless
  imprudence.        Your charming sex is an awful handful to manage,
   and whenever the judicious husbands are out of the way, the wives,
   like young sticklebacks, indulge in forbidden vagaries.
        The enclosed stamps are all that        I  can find at present, but if
   E        should find them useful, they are very much at his service,
   and, for the future,     I will preserve all that come to me.    I  hope that
   G        may at last soften the Archbishop's heart.        But Bishops, and,
   much more, Archbishops, seem to withdraw themselves                into their
   own Olympus above the clouds.
         Correspondence completed, another hour or so would
    be devoted to the          revision of proof-sheets for the press
    — always a labour of time with my father, for he made
    many additions and alterations, and generally returned
    the sheets to press with manifold paper strips gummed
    all along the        edges, each       containing two or three lines
    of additional or substituted matter.                 Then he would go
    back     to   his writing until luncheon               at half-past one.

272                     THE REV. J.     G.   WOOD.
And by this time he had usually accomplished              a tale   of
work which with most writers would hardly have been
completed in the entire day.
     But his day's labour was by no means concluded
yet.   After luncheon, in those days, he always lay
down until half-past three or four upon a couch in his
study ; but then he went back again to his desk until
dinner at seven, and ordinarily again for a couple of
hours more before retiring to rest.            So that fully twelve
hours out of the twenty -four, as a general rule, were
spent with pen in hand, recreation being reduced to
a minimum, and indeed almost to the vanishing point.
      At
       this time there was certainly some little amount
of regularity in his programme ; but in after years,
when a greater    amount of sleep became an absolute
necessity, he used to get through his work by the simple
expedient of entering his study the first thing in the
morning — generally about half -past seven — and scarcely
leaving      it,
           except for meals, until half-past eleven or
twelve       at night   ;   and during almost the whole of the
intervening time he would be working in one way or
another.   He might write all one morning, and never
touch pen the next.
         a            But then he would be repairing
a     drawing-frame,   practising his great coloured
                             or
sketches, or making out careful and elaborate notes for
book, article,     or lecture.        And even at meal-times —
dinner alone excepted — he was invariably engrossed
with   book.
       a     He read at all sorts of odd moments                   :
while dressing, or putting on his boots, in the train, or
out walking. If he paid call, and happened to be kept
                                  a

                    "NATURAL SELECTION."                    27:5
waiting for     a few   minutes,   he was sure to be found
deeply interested in some book taken up at random from
the table.     Yet  he assimilated  and remembered     all this
seemingly desultory reading in the most marvellous
manner.       He could usually quote all the most striking
passages from any book or poem that he had read more
than once, and kept all the vast amount of information
that he had picked up on various subjects pigeon-holed
away in the recesses of his own mind, yet so arranged
and labelled, so to speak, that he could lay his hand
upon it at an instant's notice.       And he also   possessed
the great    faculty of intuitively selecting the few items
of value from the worthless mass, so that the latter
passed away at once, while the former         remained     with
him for ever.
    These heavy and incessant labours my father main
tained, with scarcely a day's intermission, to the end
of his life.    Indeed, in all my memory of him,     I  cannot
recollect    that he more than once gave himself a
holiday of above a week's duration.           And even his
brief occasional periods of leisure were usually occupied
in visiting museums, menageries, or libraries, and
making out copious       notes for future use.    He had      a
perfect   multiplicity of note-books, of all shapes, sorts,
and sizes, from a microscopical volume of scarcely more
than postage-stamp size, which he carried in his waist
coat pocket, to the bulky quarto in which were arranged
drawings, photographs, cuttings, and extracts on almost
every subject under the sun.        For he by no means con
fined   himself    to  the topics of his own     professional

 274                THE REV. J.   G.   WOOD.
labours, but was well-informed on nearly every brancb
 of science, art, and literature, and took almost an equal
interest in all.     Two huge extract-books now in my
possession are filled with curious      scraps of information
 on almost    every imaginable subject, interspersed        with
portraits of living or recently deceased celebrities, short
poems, generally of a humorous character (for he was
extremely fond of comic poetry,      if characterised    by true
wit). and biographical notices extracted from the daily
newspapers.       Besides these he had fifteen or twenty
pocket-books,    each given up to some special          purpose,
three or four diaries in simultaneous      use, a
                                                  " memoriser,"
in which were jotted down engagements — principally
those for his sketch-lectures  — and    a   russian-leather case
or two for the safe carriage of letters or cuttings.       Then
all his books, and especially those of reference, were
fully  and carefully annotated.      In   his working-copy of
his   own    Natural History there        is nearly as much
information in the form of fly-notes,               pen-and-ink
additions, and neatly inserted extracts and sketches, as
in the three bulky volumes themselves.             And, finally,
for every book which he wrote he constructed a special
note-book,    in which were jotted down brief references
for every branch and detail of the ground which the
work was intended to cover.
     These notes, however, were usually very meagre, and
served merely to quicken his own memory as to things
 which he had seen or read.       A key-word or two, and
 perhaps a few statistics    : that, in many cases, is all ;
 and the record, to anyone but himself, was practically

unintelligible.     Yet in his own mind        he carried   the
master-key to all this seeming disorder.            He always
knew what information he had upon any given subject,
and in which of his multitudinous note-books to look
for it.    So that he never wasted     any time in reducing
this seemingly hopeless chaos of confusion        to order and
arrangement.
     So, too, with his own study.       To anyone but him
self it presented a scene of utter disorder.         A pile of
books lay heaped untidily around his chair ; for, as he
finished reading, he always put his book down upon the
floor beside him, so that a gradually increasing pile
surrounded him until he had one of his occasional fits
of order.    Bones,  skins,   horns, curiosities of all kinds
lay scattered about the floor.          His work-table was
covered with books, papers, letters, pamphlets, and a
 perfect infinity of miscellaneous   objects, large and small.
On     another table    near   by was a second collection,
 equally varied, and even more extensive.           On a third
stood a perfect stack of magazines and periodicals of all
 kinds, almost entirely consisting of those in which his
 own articles had appeared.       And numbers more stood
 upon the shelves, numbers       more were piled underneath
 the    couch,  and   numbers     more   still   carefully tied
 together, and put away in boxes.
     But this was by no means all.       In  different parts of
 the    room   were  cages   or  boxes  containing    creatures
 specially under examination.        There might      be some
 scorpions in one, half a dozen snails in another, and a
 hedgehog or a blind-worm in a third, besides a number

Possibly in a shallow jar upon the table, filled with
water, and with a layer of bees'-wax at the bottom,
would be     a  careful  insect-dissection.    The microscope
hard by would be ready for instant use.            And then —
scattered about in odd corners, on the shelves, under
the    shelves,  even   on  the   couch    itself— would  be  a
heterogeneous     mixture of odds and ends of all descrip
tions, each in reality having a place of its own, but all
in appearance constituting a scene of the most admired
disorder.     We always used to say, indeed, that my
father's study was more like a marine store than a room
in a respectable house ; but he was quite unmoved by
such sarcasms, and nothing annoyed him more than to
have any object in his room interfered with.
      And if any object      were   removed,    he had a most
wonderful      way of discovering its        absence.  In  this
respect   I fear I was   myself a very frequent offender, for
 I  used to borrow books or tools in his absence for some
temporary purpose, and almost invariably forgot to
 replace them.     After a time he found this out, and.
 wh?never anything was missing, used to go straight
 from his room to mine to institute a search ; in which,
 I am   bound to say, he was usually successful.
      His own writing-table       was a kind of small exhi
 bition in itself, for he always liked to have ready to
 his hand such articles as were in constant use, and made
 provision accordingly. So a small leather cross-piece
 on one leg of the table held a pair of enormous scissors,
 a band higher up held a smaller pair* while in a small

box screwed down to the table itself were a finer pair
still, used almost entirely for dissecting purposes. In a
number of holes bored through the woodwork at the
back were     an assortment      of bradawls and gimlets; a
small pocket just beneath the desk held a paper-knife ;
¦one a little lower contained          a two-foot rule ; close
beside this was fastened a pin-cushion.           From     a tack on
one side hung a pen-wiper, while from              a   similar tack
upon the other depended an almanack.              A little farther
on was a wire basket for holding letters which required
an answer, while from a nail close by was slung a large
slate,   with   sponge    and   pencil    attached.      And these
 were so arranged      that one and all could be reached
 without the necessity for rising from his seat.             On the
 wall close by hung a series of hooks, one for revised
 proofs, one for receipts, one for answered correspondence,
.and   so  on.   And    a   larger  wire basket, within         easy
 Teach, contained   time-tables,    a local    directoiy, and one
 or two similar chronicles in almost constant           use.
      Tolerably accomplished      at most arts requiring skill
 of hand, my father was a capital amateur carpenter, and
 was perfectly competent to undertake most of the little
 matters    for which a professional workman is usually
 called in.    Of his tools he was exceedingly careful, and
 kept the greater number under lock and key — chiefly,              I

 was also a very good locksmith and bell-hanger, and
 ¦even  a plumber in a small way        ;  and only in very ex
 ceptional cases was it necessary to call in a workman
 while he happened to      be at home.

 278                THE REV.      J. G.  WOOD.
     Upon    one  point he was always extremely fond of
insisting, and that was the exceeding usefulness of oil.
 Once a fortnight or so he always promenaded the house,
oil-bottle and feather in hand        ; and never was there a
door-hinge that squeaked, or a lock that refused to turn,
while he was in the house.           Every ball-cock was care
fully lubricated ; every screw was oiled before it wast
driven home.       And thus, no doubt, he saved himself
and others a vast amount of subsequent trouble, on the
                   " stitch in time."
principle of the
     Another    compound      of which he was remarkably
fond was "sealing-wax           varnish."    This he manu
factured for himself, pounding up a stick or two of
scarlet wax into a fine powder, dissolving it in spirit       of
wine, and so producing a brilliant scarlet paint, which
dried quickly, did not crack, and was not easily rubbed
off.   Of this he made great use.           All  his travelling
trunks and bags had his name, or his characteristic
monogram, painted upon them — in sealing-wax varnish.
The    cases  of his    drawing-frames     were   encircled   by
three   broad rings — of sealing-wax varnish.        Even his
umbrella-handle was curiously marked — with sealing-wax
varnish.     And every six weeks or so he would give
up an hour to renovating these markings, performing
the operation    with    great care, and no little attention
to detail.
     He was really   a first-rate  amateur bookbinder, again,
and mostly had three or four volumes under restoration.
He even tried soldering at one time, but        I do not think
that he was very successful at this, as we never heard

                 USE OF THE TYPE-WRITER.                                  279
very much about          it,   and he was distinctly reticent when
the subject was mentioned.                 And     he had quite   a   won
derful talent for inventing in small way, and managed
                                          a
to make      lot of curious contrivances of no little in
             a
genuity and great practical value.
     Owing       to the    severe  to his right hand
                                        accident
already referred to, my father towards the end of his
life was visited with threatening of the dreaded
" writer's                                                            itself
           cramp."             Since the time of the accident
—or       rather since that of the             comparative        recovery
which was all he ever enjoyed — he had never been able
quite to trust the hand, which was frequently visited
with nervous tremors              and    twitches, obliging       him to
steady    it with the left when writing, or holding cup               a
or   a   tumbler. But when the more pronounced symp
toms set in, and grew daily more decided, he procured
a portable type-writer, and thenceforward discarded the
use of the pen altogether, except for correspondence, and
sent printed instead    of written MS. to the printers.
     For this alteration, no doubt, the compositors were
truly thankful, for, while his hand-writing in letters was
beautifully neat and legible, his MS. hand was little
more than      straggling series of microscopical hiero
                 a
glyphics, the difficulty of deciphering which was in
creased ten-fold by his inveterate habit of making
numerous subsequent additions on small slips of paper,
from every one of which, when affixed to the side of
the sheet, ran       a  long line to the particular spot where
he desired     it    to be inserted.  As, in    single sheet of
                                                     a
manuscript, there would sometimes                   be ten or     a   dozen

280                     THE REV. J. 0.          WOOD.
of these additions, the lines from which                    crossed   one
another      something      like     the    foundation-threads        of a
spider's web; and as, moreover, corrections, alterations,
and interlineations        would be         scattered     about in pro
fusion   :   the state of the MS.           by the      time it left his
hands for press may be better imagined than described.
      Yet,         to say, the printers made few mis
              strange
takes in setting up his work.   Whether they put on a
special man for the work of interpretation, or whether
the compositors at last grew so accustomed to his
writing that they found no difficulty in      do not        it,I
know. But certain       that they rarely misread it,
                           it   is
and very often his proof-sheets             went back to press with
scarcely     a   correction marked         upon them.
      Of his proficiency with the type-writer he was very
proud, and was always ready to show and explain the
machine       to any friend who might                come to visit him
After   while he always carried
         a                        with him upon the

long railway journeys which his lecturing tours con
stantly involved. Indeed, during the last four winters
of his life, almost the whole               literary work was
                                           of his
performed        while actually in the train. From the very
first he was perfectly careless of appearances, and utterly
indifferent to any attention or excitement which his
proceedings                 He once walked through
                   might arouse.

load of bricks from the builder's yard to his house, as
he wanted them for immediate use, and no workman
happened         to be at liberty.         So   that he was naturally

         TYPE-WRITING IN A RAILWAY-CARRIAGE.               281
quite unaffected by the interest which his type-writing
proceedings excited among his fellow-passengers,         who
 gazed their fill at the elderly clergyman in the corner of
the carriage,    busily performing upon the keys of the
strange machine, and even made their comments there
upon in no inaudible tone of voice, without in the least
arousing him from his abstraction,         or impeding    his
flow of thought.
     Yet, by a strange contradiction, when writing quietly
at home in his own study, he was almost nervously
sensitive to any interruption.      The passing of a foot
step near his door, a false note upon the piano down
stairs, or the barking of a distant dog, would often
upset him altogether, and render him unable to write
for a quarter of an hour or more after the exciting
oause had passed away.       So that this perfect ability to
write in the train was most remarkable.         Well it   was
that he was able to do so, for his lecturing tours during
the winter months were so long and so frequent that
otherwise literary work must almost wholly have been
put on one side during fully one-half of the year.
     Strangely enough, neither bodily fatigue nor actual
 suffering (unless, of course, of a severe character) seemed
 noticeably to impair his power of writing.       At the end
of a long day's labour his style would be as pleasant,
his ideas as free and fresh as if he were but just begin
ning;    and  although throughout his life he suffered
greatly from dyspepsia, it had little or no effect upon
his work. Probably the incessant stooping over his
desk (just after meals especially)    was largely responsible

282                      THE REV. J.    G.    WOOD.
for this last     ;    and he did not improve matters by drink
ing large quantities of tea and              coffee,   of which he was
almost     inordinately       fond, and would partake          from     the
first thing in the morning until the last thing at night.
He was also subject to that curious but common de
lusion which holds that the efficacy of physic is in exact
proportion to the amount taken.      If a small dose did
him good he would double              it,   and expect the beneficial
effects    to be       correspondingly increased.         And in this
matter experience never seemed to teach                   him wisdom.
But his digestive system was weak from                    a   boy   ;   and,
though always            simple   and abstemious        in his diet, he
was seldom altogether free from his constant enemy.
       other ways his health was wonderfully good. In
      In
all the years that can remember him do .not recollect
                         I                        I
that he was ever really ill, save and except during the
anxious winter of 1877-8; and even such minor ailments
as    colds   almost wholly unknown to him. No
              were
doubt this immunity from sickness was due in great
measure to his early training as an athlete, which
strengthened           every part of his frame, and transformed
him from      a       weak and puny boy into almost        a   model of
physical and muscular strength.               A
                                    long and systematic
course of Turkish baths, too, rendered him almost proof
against cold, and also greatly improved his general
health. And so he was able, year after year, to work
day and night as he did, taking but little exercise, and
obtaining but little sleep, and often subject to mental        a
strain and anxiety which would soon have caused a
weaker man to break down altogether.

                   A COMMON FAILING.                  283
    Yet, strangely enough, in spite of his wonderful
constitution, he was always nervously anxious about
himself, would magnify a trifling ailment into a serious
disease, and  work himself into a perfect fever of alarm
over   an  indisposition of which others would have
thought nothing.      But this is a not uncommon failing
with those who are seldom ill, and who seem to appre
ciate no gradations between perfect health and dangerous
sickness.

Throughout almost the whole of his life — as was indeed
only to be expected — my father was in the habit of
keeping pets of almost every kind. Long before even
he went to school              he     was constantly bringing              home
creatures which he had found in his country rambles,
not at all for the mere purpose of making pets of them,
after the manner of most boys with a natural fond
ness      for animals,       but that         he might keep them for
a  while in captivity, and watch their habits at home.
During his school-days, snakes seem to have been his
special favourites;           not vipers, of course, but the evil-
smelling grass-snakes, which, however, learned in time
to retain their horrible odour uuless when touched by
the hand of a stranger.                  And in after-life there were
few available creatures which he had not for some time

                "APOLLO" AND HIS DOINGS.                  285
 had in captivity,   besides a perfect    host of the more
 commonly domesticated dogs and cats.
     The history of several of these            is given in
 "Petland," and " Petland Revisited."          There is the
 account   of "Apollo"    the  bull-dog, as ugly and un
 prepossessing   a dog as   ever lived, in the eyes of the
unprejudiced beholder ; but a pleasant, good-tempered
 beast withal, and one whose fidelity and obedience were
 something marvellous to witness.       My father had him
from the veriest puppy, and trained him carefully him
self ;  and the   dog  well repaid the care which was
bestowed upon him.      He would even give up a bone at
the word of command — a very unusual concession upon
the part of a bull-dog  — and    was as tractable a creature
with those whom he knew as anyone could wish. For
myself, when a child of about two years old, he had a
peculiar affection ; and very often we changed places,     I
taking possession of the kennel, and he sitting between
me and the entrance and     mounting guard over me.      My
nurse, however, was not in the least afraid of him, but
simply used to box his ears and haul him away when         I
had to be extracted.       But no one who was not on
intimate terms with him ever dared to approach him
at all.
     But "Apollo" was   a somewhat expensive dog to keep,
for once he ate a big hole in some park-palings, because
they were too high for him to leap over with a stick in
his mouth    ; and then, finding that when he seized his
master's   property by the     middle,  and   tried to pass
through the hole, he naturally failed, he set to work

once more and ate another big hole for the stick         !   And
on another occasion he followed my father into church
through the medium of a stained-glass window.    And

    Then there is the story of " Eoughie   : a stupid
beast, who was never of the smallest use to anybody,
and cared for nothing       and no one in the world except
himself.   " Bosco," a skye-terrier, is only casually
mentioned in
               " Petland Revisited." He was the last of
my father's own dogs, and lived with us from infancy to
old        " Jock," who came to us after we went to live

run, and making himself generally objectionable.         He
was a crafty creature,      too, and   whenever   he  saw   a
¦chance   of pecking anyone, would ostentatiously show
himself at quite the other end of his run, and be
apparently quite oblivious of his opportunity.       But his
wicked eye was upon his anticipated victim all the
while, and, the moment that he saw that his movements
were unwatched,      he would    sidle along  the  run,  and
then drive his beak with all his force against the legs
of the unwary visitor. And to the trousered and
knickerbockered half of humanity such a dig invariably
meant a deep puncture, and a smarting wound which
did not heal for several days.

       Grip died of too much linen, a couple of towels
having been blown from a neighbouring clothes-line
upon his run, and promptly torn to rags and demolished
before they could be rescued.        The bird did it out of
pure    mischief, and only ate the torn strips because he
knew that he was doing wrong, and took a fiendish
delight in doing it.     But his meal naturally disagreed
 with him, and he died. And none of us mourned over
 his grave.
     My father     also once made a pet of a chameleon,
 whose biography appears in " Petland."        This creature
 — one    which   was  curious and interesting in the last
 degree, but to which even the most enthusiastic           of
 naturalists could scarcely feel any particular sensations
 of attachment— fell    a victim at last to the jealousy of
 " Pret,"  who, like most pet animals, could not bear to
 see   any  attention lavished upon any living creature

besides himself, and took an opportunity        of slaying his
supposed rival in the temporary absence of his master.
     Once a blind-worm was brought home, and kept for
some time,     serving,   indeed, as the model     from which
the    description in the larger Natural History was
taken.     After a short time, nine little blind-worms
unexpectedly     made their appearance, and presented       the
strange    phenomenon       of  steadily increasing in size,
apparently without taking food of any kind at all. Yet
they went through all the actions of slug-catching, just
as though they were quite big blind-worms, instead of
little creatures not much more than an inch in total
length.
     " When I introduced the slugs," writes
                                                     my father,
" the odd little
                   reptiles acted just as their mother was
doing, followed the slugs about with their heads,
hovered    over them, and made believe       to eat them, and
then were quietly walked over by their intended prey -r
which, being nearly twice as big as themselves,
proceeded on their course without paying the least
regard to the tiny reptiles, whose bodies were not larger
than ordinary knitting-needles, and easily glided over
them, or put them to ignominious flight."
     Of toads my father had many, from the time when —
"  a  small six-year-old naturalist, with a" magnifying-
glass always     open in one hand, and an empty pill-box
                "—      " used to potter up and down the
in the other        he
         "
garden      in search of any natural history object that
might present itself. And he wrote a special article
about them      in Once     a  Week,   which   afterwards  was

                      VARIOUS PETS.                      289
reprinted in Out of Doors.     Lizards, of course, he had
of various kinds, among them a specimen of that
strange, spine-covered creature, the Tapayaxin, which
was sent him by post from North America, and arrived
in safety, only however     to expire    after a  very few
weeks in captivity.    Newts he frequently kept, gene
rally in a globe of water in his study, or in one of
those large oblong glass tanks generally dignified by
the title of "aquaria."     Of tortoises there were several
at different times, the   last being fastened to a post
in the garden by means of a long string passed through
a hole in the edge of its shell ; and two chicken tor
toises lived for a long time indoors.     Then there came
half a dozen scorpions from the south of Europe, which
theoretically were mine, but practically were mono
polised by my father; and two great Bulimus snails
from the West Indies,      which lived for some months
under a glass globe without doing anything at all to
justify their existence ; an injured bat, which was pro
vided with a similar domicile, and had to be supplied
with blue-bottle flies at the rate of about seventy
per diem, or rather per noctem ; and mostly a few odds
and ends in the shape of water- beetles, dragon-fly
grubs, or some other creatures which happened at the
time to be more particularly under observation.
     For cage-birds my father never manifested any fond
ness, save that he once kept quite a large number of
canaries for some time in one large cage, knew them
all separately and by name, and took the greatest
interest in their doings.   And once we had a parrot :
        T

290                 THE REV. J.    0. WOOD.
a   queer   bird, which displayed quite an unusual apti
tude for bringing out appropriate remarks, but which
had the temper of a demon.        But, broadly speaking, my
father looked upon the imprisonment of birds in cages
as little short of positive cruelty, and often said that
they were so changed by prolonged captivity that they
quite ceased to be their own natural selves at all.
     Besides all these, my father had quite a number of
what    I  may perhaps describe as outdoor pets. All
through the autumn and winter months, for instance,
he regularly fed a large    number of birds at his study
window, mixing a large dishful of oatmeal porridge,
bread-crumbs,      and scraps of meat, and placing the
contents    on   the window-ledge as soon as he went
upstairs after breakfast.    Of the presence of meat — or
fat — in the mixture he always made a special point,
saying that warm-blooded       creatures  like birds needed
something more stimulating than mere bread-crumbs
and oatmeal to keep up the bodily heat, and that the
meat took the place of the worms and insects which in
weather    less  inclement they would have captured       for
themselves.
     The birds soon found out that this food supply was
part of the regular daily programme, and half an hour
or so before feeding-time they used always to assemble,
pushing and jostling one another in order to secure the
best places.     The same birds came day after day, and
were soon well known by sight, thrushes,          blackbirds,
titmice, finches, robins,    and   sparrows   all contending
with one another for their share in the daily distribu-

                     FEEDING THE BIRDS.                           291
tion.   Of   course the last-named got the best of   it,   as   they
always do, their natural pugnacity and aggressiveness*
bringing them well to the front, and enabling them tc
hold their own against seemingly overwhelming odds.
And then would ensue     scene of rare confusion and
                             a
quarrelling and scolding, each bird doing its best to secure
the choicest morsels, and eating with all convenient
rapidity in order to obtain as much of the enticing food
as possible before the feast was despatched.        But then,
perhaps,    the snow would be lying several inches deep
upon the ground, and this morning refection would be
almost the only food that they would be able to procure
for the next twenty-four hours.
    All these birds knew to the very minute when their
regular feeding-time had arrived, and,      my father
                                               if
happened to be      a   little late, would tap impatiently and
repeatedly      at the window,     in order to accelerate his
movements.                      row of sparrows would
                  Sometimes quite   a
be sitting there and pecking at the glass when he
arrived with the dish. Then, of course, there would be
a general flight as the window was opened, and the con
tents of the dish were spread out. But almost before              it
could be shut again every bird would be back, and the
struggling for place and the strife of tongues would
commence.  This used to go on every morning until
the warm days of spring brought the insects out and         ;
then the attendance        would    gradually diminish          until
hardly  a bird arrived at all.
    The titmice were the most unfortunate of all these
birds, for their small size enabled any and all of their
        t   2

292                THE REV. J.    G.  WOOD.
comrades to oust them from any vantage-ground which
they might have taken up     ;  and this the said comrades
were never slow in doing.      So my father put up near
his window a kind of permanent feast, to which the tit
mice, and the titmice alone, should have access.        This
was managed by enclosing       a number of small lumps of
suet in a little bag of large-meshed network, and sus
pending it by three or four feet of string from an out
stretching branch     of a tall tree.   The titmice, being
marvellously proficient in the art of climbing, and quite
as much at their ease when hanging head downwards as
when in the ordinary position, were of course perfectly
satisfied with this arrangement, and might be seen upon
the ball of suet at all hours of the day, pecking away
busily — not to say greedily — at the suet within, and
speedily reducing it to a mere tithe of its former dimen
sions.   And very pretty indeed the odd little birds looked
as  they clung to the network, swinging in the wind,
and eating their meal without fear of molestation from
the sparrows.     For the latter, of course, were hopelessly
debarred    by   their physical structure from disputing
with them the possession of the dainty repast, and they
and their fellow-finches could only look        on, and   see
 the titmice enjoying themselves, without the remotest
chance of becoming participators in the feast.
                       "
     Other " outdoor     pets, too, he had at this time in
the shape of some lions and tigers at Margate.        These
belonged to Sanger's menagerie, to which, as it was
within walking distance, he was      a very frequent visitor.
 Indeed, while he was at home, he very seldom let a week

         HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH A LION.               293
pass without paying at least one visit to his favourite
animals.    And partly by his own natural talent for
going wherever and doing whatever he wished, partly,
I have reason to believe, by the still more potent aid of
an appeal to the pocket, he soon contrived to gain
admission, as it were, behind the scenes, struck up a
great friendship with the head-keeper, and was permitted
to do exactly what he pleased without any sort of inter
ference from anyone.     And   he soon came to be on terms
of the  most perfect friendship with the lions and tigers,
which would allow him to pull them about, examine
their claws, and, in fact, do just whatever he liked with
them.     And all this amiability was due to his habit of
taking a small bottle of lavender water with him when
ever he visited the menagerie,      sprinkling a few drops
upon a rolled-up ball of paper, and then throwing it
into the cage.    The animals used to go nearly wild in
their exuberant    delight. They would grasp the ball
with both fore-paws, hold it close to their nostrils,
and then draw in a succession of deep inhalations of the
fascinating perfume, purring loudly the while. Then
would come, perhaps, a loud roar, expressive of deep
enjoyment, and then more inhalations ; and so on.
And after he had visited them a few times they used to
detect my father in the far distance, and dance about in
their cages with excitement, roaring loudly, until he
came up and produced his paper balls.
    But my father had that peculiar knack, enjoyed
only by a few, of making friends at once with any
animal with which he happened to meet. No dog ever

 294                  TEE REV. J.          G.  WOOD.
 failed to respond when           he stooped to caress it           ;  no cat
 ever growled even          when      he took     up her kitten           and
 stroked    and admired        it.     All   seemed     instinctively at
 once to recognise         his love for them        ;  and all showed
 that they did so by the way in which they received his
 advances.
      Here is his own account of an adventure                          with a
 peculiarly ferocious and cross-grained dog                : —
     There was a Scotch terrier dog who lately died, to the very
great sorrow of his master, an officer in the 45th regiment, and the
very great rejoicing of his master's friends.     He was good enough to
honour me by admitting me among his friends — the only person not
belonging to the family to whom        he extended    that privilege.      His-
name was    " Mess," which was     a  military  abbreviation   of    " Mesty,"
which was an abbreviation of Mephistopheles, the name being given
to him in consequence of his temper, which really deserved the name
of infernal. No one, except his master, his master's family, and an
exceptionally favoured servant or two, could put a hand on him
without being bitten.    I  know a learned barrister who has been kept
in bed until a very late hour in the morning, because " Mess " had
come into his room when the servant brought the hot water, and
would not allow him to get up. As long as he lay still in bed, Mess
sat quietly on the floor ; but at the least movement, Mess sprang up
with a menacing growl, flashing eyes, and gleaming teeth, and the
unfortunate guest had to subside again, unable even to ring the bell
for help, and knowing that his host and hostess must be waiting
breakfast for him and chafing at his laziness.
     One day   I paid a visit to
                                     " Mess's " master, not knowing any
thing about the dog, and not seeing the dog when         I arrived.      Being
accustomed to an early walk before breakfast,       I started   off   as usual
on the following morning, and, on returning, met a little procession,
consisting of a nursemaid leading a donkey, on which were the two
daughters   of my host in panniers, and a remarkably fine Scotch
terrier, which was trotting along in front.           As soon as he saw
me the dog sprang forward, and I, not knowing anything of his

character, and thinking that he wanted a game, stooped down, patted
him, rolled him on his back, pretended to box his ears, put my hand
into his mouth, and, in short, let him have his game.          The nurse
maid stood by, almost paralysed with horror ; but why she should
be frightened seemed rather mysterious.
    On coming to breakfast      I   spoke in high terms of the splendid
dog with whom    I   had enjoyed a game, and the host was almost as
horrified as the nurse had been.                             I
                                          Not until then did hear about
the dog's temper   ;   but, whatever it was, it was never displayed
towards me, and    I  believe that   I am the only person not belonging
to the family who was ever allowed to put a hand on him.
      While he was at meals,            a favourite cat generally sat
 on my father's shoulders         ;  very often there was one upon
 each.     He was very fond of making them spring from
the ground       upon      his  shoulder,       walk along his out
 stretched arm, and take a piece of meat from between
 his finger and thumb ; and               I think that they took to
 sitting upon his shoulder merely that they might be
 nearer the    scene    of action, and so save time when the
 meat was held out.           One of these same cats, also, had a
 special fondness for my father's              own chair, which was
 cushioned in a manner which she particularly admired                     ;
 and   if he happened to go out of his study and leave the
 door open, he was nearly sure to find her there when he
 returned.     Nor did      she at     all hesitate, if he turned her
out and occupied the chair himself, to signify her desire
for a share of his seat, for she would leap up, and
 deliberately push him with her paws until he moved.
 This would go on until he left her sufficient space to
 settle down comfortably.                And there the two would
 remain for hours.
      He would do almost anything for                   a cat.    I have

296               THE REV. J.   G.  WOOD.
known him to leave his work, and to go down from the
top of the house to the bottom, on three separate
occasions in the course of a single morning, just because
it  occurred to one of our cats that she would like to
show him her kittens.      She would come to the door,
and mew for admission, and then sit       and mew again
until he got up and accompanied her downstairs; and
then she would go straight off to the basket where her
kittens were lying, and rub herself against it, and
then against him, purring loudly, and in every way
endeavouring to show her pride. Then he would stroke
and admire them, ask the cat whether she were satis
fied, and then go back to his work.     And in the course
of half an hour or    so the same   programme   would be
exactly repeated.   I  do not know whether he would
have    gone quite so   far as the Prophet Mahomet is
reported to have done, and have cut off the sleeve of a
coat upon which a cat was *lying asleep rather than
disturb her.   But he would always cheerfully give up
his time to supplying the wants of a cat, or indeed of
any   animal, whether those wants were fancied or real.
And he was never more happy than when surrounded
by animals with which he was intimate, and which, to
him, were not only companions, but true and actual
friends.

Busy worker though my father was, and able to labour
steadily on for weeks together with scarcely an hour's
intermission, he was yet, by the very force of Nature,
compelled to indulge in occasional periods of recreation ;
and, during         these,     he     contrived to make himself a
thorough master of many games of skill.                         Mediocrity
in these was absolutely unknown to him.                         He either
played a game well, or he did not play it at all.                         But
when he did play             it,   he studied   ittheoretically as well

in order that he might pick up           a  hint or two from their
superior acquirements.
     During his        university    career    he  became    a most
accomplished       gymnast, and could perform with perfect
ease   numerous      feats seldom attempted         by an amateur.
His   course of practice        was, in the first place, entered
upon for prudential reasons.             From his very birth he
was weak and sickly, and during the years of his child
hood, indeed, it always seemed doubtful whether or not
he would ever attain to man's estate.               But, by a long
and careful course of training in the gymnasium and on
the running-track, he contrived, not only entirely to-
overcome his constitutional weakness, but to build up
the physique which alone enabled him                 in after-years
to carry on his severe and incessant labours.
     In his well-known " Adventures of Mr. Verdant
Grreen,"     the   late   Rev. E. Bradley, better         known    as
" Cuthbert Bede,"         has  largely made use of my father,
                                         " little Mr. Bouncer " in
who stood for the character of
the chapters relating to the gymnasium.                 I  quote the
following from         a   short account       of my father as a
gymnast, lately contributed by Mr. Bradley to the
Boys' Own Paper.             Citing his own description in
                              says : —
 " Verdant Green," he
    " Opposite to th« door was the vaulting-horse,   on whose wooden
back the gymnast sprang at a bound, and over which the tyro (with
the aid of the spring-board) usually pitched himself headlong.  Then,
commencing at the further end, was a series of poles and ropes — the
turning- poles, the hanging- poles, the rings, and the trapeze — on
either or all of which the pupil could exercise himself ; and, if he
had the skill to do so, could jerk himself from one to the other, and

of his spring had passed away."

taking his aerial flight, and we used to compare him to one of the
" Bounding Bricks of Babylon," so amusingly delineated by Keeley
and Alfred Wigan in Albert Smith's burlesque extravaganza, The
AUiambra. Wood fairly revelled in these gymnastic feats, which he
performed with as much elegance as ease.
     Substituting for his name that of Mr. Bouncer,    I  spoke of him
                "
as follows : — Mr. Bouncer, who could do most things with his
hands and feet, was a very distinguished pupil of Mr. MacLaren ;
for the little gentleman was as active as a monkey, and — to quote
his own remarkably figurative expression — was ' a great deal livelier
than the Bug and Butterfly' (which was a name given to Mr. Hope's
Entomological Museum). Mr. Bouncer, then, would go through the
full series of gymnastic performances, and, finally, pull himself up
the rounds of the ladder with the greatest apparent ease, much to
the envy of Mr. Verdant Green, who, bathed in perspiration, and
 nearly dislocating every bone in his body, would vainly struggle (in
attitudes like to those of ' the perspiring frog ' of Count Smorltork)
to imitate his mercurial friend, and would finally drop exhausted on
the padded floor."
       These gymnastic attainments my father kept up to
 some extent after leaving college, and, even after his
 marriage, he more than once ascended a tolerably high
 tree, in order to hang by his feet alone from one of the
loftiest branches.
       For cricket he did not much         care.    He played     as a
 boy (although the game was then comparatively in its
 infancy), but met with a serious accident, breaking his
 right leg and dislocating his ankle through a severe
 fall.    After this he seldom played, and, indeed, took
 no special interest in the game, beyond                studying the

300                  THE REV. J.        G.   WOOD.
reports    of leading matches        as given in the daily news
papers.       For football    I  do not think that he ever cared
in the least. Lawn-tennis, of course, did not come into
fashion until his advancing years prevented him from
taking it up. Probably, the injury to his right hand
from the fall of 1874 would, in any case, have prevented
him from attaining           to any proficiency in the game.
But he nevertheless took a very lively interest in it,
and would generally come out and watch us for a while
as we played in the afternoon.
      Croquet, however, attracted            him far more, and he
reduced      it  almost   to    the  level    of one of the exact
 sciences.      When we removed to the larger house at
 Belvedere,     he had     the lawn      carefully taken up and
 re-laid, with a substratum of chalk, on the most ap
proved principles.         And then his custom was, when
tired with work, to come out and play a short game
 with himself, blue balls against red. The game was a
 very scientific    one.     Six hoops only, placed at sharp
 angles to one another, at great distances apart, and no
 more than five inches in width            ;  heavy balls, carefully
 selected and tested, that they might run as accurately
 as  a  billiard-ball   ; and a large, heavily- loaded mallet,
 with the handle carefully wrapped with string.               These
 were his requirements,          and without      them   he did not
 consider     the game worth playing.            Nothing annoyed
 him more than to be compelled                 to take part in the
 ordinary      garden-party      croquet.     He    always  rebelled
 against even the four-player game, holding that no real
 opportunity for skill could be given unless the players

                    SCIENTIFIC CROQUET.                    301
were restricted    to two,   with two balls each.    But his
misery    when — as   now and      then   happened — he   was
forced to serve as one of eight was really almost    pitiable
to witness.      But at last he hit upon       an expedient,
which had the double advantage of quickly releasing
him from bondage, and minimising the chance of his
being again pressed to undergo a similar martyrdom ;
and, ignoring his partners altogether, he would simply
run the round of the hoops at a single turn (which,
with no less than seven balls to help him, he could
                        "           "
easily   do), and then    peg   out and   go away.   After a
 time this custom of his became notorious, the desired
 result followed, and the detested eight-ball game wa&
 no longer inflicted upon him.
     Given what he considered         as the  proper require
 ments  — the   heavy balls,   narrow hoops, loaded mallet,
 and   lawn as true as a bowling-green — his        play was
 wonderfully accurate, and he was especially good in his
 management of the balls with a view to their future use.
 Thus the next player would always find himself at the
 far end of the ground, with nothing to aim at which
 was not partially protected     by a wire or a stake ; while
 his own following ball was sure to be in position, with
 the fourth ball in readiness to help it on.      The game,
 indeed, came with him to resemble billiards rather than
 croquet, and he played     it with his  head quite as much
 as with his hands.
      Of billiards itself, too, he was very fond, and sub
 scribed, while at Belvedere, to a small private club, so
 as  to be able to play a game whenever he could afford

302               THE REV. J.    G.  WOOD.
the time.    Just now   and then he used to play instead
of lying down in the afternoon — on which occasions        I
 usually accompanied him in order to act as scorer. But
the sleeplessness from which in those days he suffered
so much prevented    him from giving up his nap unless
under exceptional circumstances ; and generally an odd
game or two in the course of the week was all that he
could manage.
    Of swimming, in all its branches, he was a perfect
master, from his very earliest years.         When barely
four years of age his father was accustomed to take him
down daily to bathe in the river Isis, and he thus
acquired a familiarity with the water which enabled him
to perform all the feats of the professionals     with  per
fect ease.   He could swim in     a dozen   different ways ;
dive to almost any depth, and from almost any height ;
swim under water ; and, in fact, perform in the water
pretty well all that it was possible for man to do.
    And he was a very good long-distance swimmer,
thinking nothing of swimming half         a mile out to sea
when taking his morning bathe.          Once, upon one of
these excursions, he actually went to sleep in the water,
and remained quietly floating for some little time till a
sharp storm of hail awoke him.        But on another occa
sion he met with     a  far more    unpleasant   experience,
which left its effects behind it for weeks, and       barely
escaped    being attended by the most serious conse
quences;    for he swam into contact with one of the
terrible medusas, or stinging jelly-fish, whose envenomed
streamers passed   across his breast, and injected their

deadly poison into a thousand tiny wounds.       quote                    I
"the following from his own account of the accident : —
    One morning towards the end of                  July, while   swimming    off the
Margate coast,       I
                 saw at a distance something that looked like a patch
of sand, occasionally visible, and occasionally covered, as it were, by
the waves, which were then running high in consequence of a
lengthened gale which had not long gone down.       Knowing the coast
pretty well, and thinking that no sand ought to be in such a locality,
I swam towards the strange object, and had got within some eight or
ten yards of it before finding that it was composed of animal sub
stance.    Inaturally thought that it must be the refuse of some
animal that had been thrown overboard, and swam away from                          it,
not being anxious to come in contact with so unpleasant a sub
stance.
    While still approaching          had noticed a slight tingling in the
                                       it

                                   I
                               took the " pins-and-needles

regions while swimming,            I                          sensation for
a symptom of the accustomed cramp, and thought nothing of it. As
I swam on, however, the tingling extended further and further, and
began to feel very much like the sting of a nettle.           Suddenly the
tcuth flashed across me, and       made for shore as fast as
                                   I                            could.I
    On turning round for that purpose,         raised my right arm out of
                                                   I
the water, and found     that  dozens  of slender and transparent threads
were hanging from          and evidently still attached to the medusa,
                             it,
now some forty or fifty feet away. The filaments were slight and deli
cate as those of     spider's web, but there the similitude ceased, for
                         a
each was armed with a myriad poisoned darts that worked their way
into the tissues, and affected the nervous system like the stings of
wasps.
     BeforeI       reached shore the pain had become fearfully severe, and
on quitting the cool waves             it   was absolute   torture.Wherever one
of the multitudinous threads            had come    in contact with the skin there
appeared      light scarlet line, which on closer examination was
               a
resolvable into  minute dots or pustules   and the sensation was much
                                                    ;
as  ifeach dot were charged with      red-hot needle gradually making
                                               a
its way through the nerves. The slightest touch of the clothes was
agony, and as     had to walk more than two miles before reaching my
                   I

304                     THE REV. J.          G.  WOOD.
lodgings, the sufferings which      I endured   may be better imagined than
described.
     Severe, however, as was the pain,      it was the least part of the tor
ture inflicted   by these apparently     insignificant weapons.     Both the
respiration and the action of the heart became affected, while at
short intervals sharp pangs shot through the chest, as if a bullet
had passed through heart and lungs, causing me to fall as if struck
by a leaden missile.     Then the pulsation of the heart would cease for
a time that seemed an age, and then it would give six or seven leaps
as if it would force its way through the chest.             Then the lungs
would refuse to act, and     I stood gasping in vain for breath, as if the
arm of a garrotter were round my neck.              Then the sharp pangs
would shoot through my chest, and so da capo.
     After a journey lasting, so far as my feelings went, about two
years,  I  got to my lodgings, and instinctively sought for the salad-oil
flask.   As always happens under such circumstances it was empty,
and   I had to wait while another could be purchased.             A copious
friction with the oil had a sensible effect in alleviating the suffering,
though when      I happened to catch a glimpse of my own face in the
mirror   I  hardly knew it — all white, wrinkled, and shrivelled, with
cold perspiration    standing   in large drops over the surface.
     How much brandy was administered              to me   I almost fear to
mention, excepting to say that within half        an hour I drank as much
alcohol as would have intoxicated       me over    and over again, and yet
was no more affected by      it than if it had been    so  much   fair water.
Several    days   elapsed before   I could   walk with any degree of com
fort, and for more than three months afterwards the shooting pains
would occasionally dart through the chest.
      On two subsequent occasions this painful experience
was repeated,          but as in these cases the envenomed
streamers touched           the    foot only, the effects were not
nearly so severe.
      On the ice my father was as accomplished as in the
water.       Like most who have thoroughly mastered the
intricacies of figure-skating he cared for nothing else,
and was perfectly satisfied with a small pond, so long

                     SKATING AND RUNNING.                     305
 as  the ice was smooth and free from obstacles.           And,
 given such a pond, he would spend an hour or so in
 perfect happiness, cutting threes and eights and all the
 various figures which only an accomplished          skater can
 achieve.
      He was also     a  fair long-distance runner, with con
 siderable powers of endurance, but no great speed ; and
 his daily three-mile run, which he kept up until about
 his forty-fifth year, scarcely seemed to fatigue him in
 the least.    And at one time he was not unfrequently in
 the habit — on Sundays more          especially — of paying   a
 visit to  a  distant friend, travelling by train one way,
and walking or running the other.             Sometimes, when
he    reserved   the    train   for the   return  journey, his
adventures     were rather amusing,       for he never would
allow himself more than just sufficient time to reach
the station, and was not infrequently left behind.           On
one    occasion   he turned up at half-past three        in the
morning, having missed his train, but having managed
to obtain a lift for part of the distance in a belated
tradesman's cart.        Another time he came home on the
engine of a goods train, b}' means of a small douceur
to the driver, who obligingly stopped just outside the
station in order to allow him to descend.            Of course
he had no business to be there         ; but he had the most
wonderful knack of going where he chose, and doing
what he chose, without interference from anybody.           He
once obtained one of the very best stalls for the Handel
Festival    simply by asking for it ; he found his way
behind the curtain of a London theatre in order to

306                 THE REV. J.       G.   WOOD.
discover    the secret of a thrilling
                                             " fire-scene," and no
one said him nay       ;   he even in some     mysterious manner
invaded the sacred precincts of the Speaker's Gallery in
the House of Commons, without the usual formality
of obtaining      an order.      And   so   well known was this
 enviable faculty among us that we             always used to say
that he would succeed even in getting presented at
 Court if he wished, without any preliminaries or intro
 ductions whatever.
     Of my father's indoor amusements, music was the
 chief ; and this, indeed, was almost a passion with him.
 He was no vocalist, for his voice, good enough when              a
 boy, was irretrievably damaged by the common mistake
 of continuing to        use  it after it    had
                                                   " broken," and,
 though he could take his part in a chorus, it was quite
 useless for solo work.       Nor was he a pianist. The only
 instrument, indeed, which he played at all was the
 euphonium     ; admirable,     perhaps, as a constituent in a
 concert orchestra or a brass band, but scarcely suited to
 the narrow limits of a drawing-room.                No doubt his
 performances must sometimes have been a sore trial to
 the neighbours, more especially         as in those days — when
 I  was   about ten years old —      I used to play the cornet
 after   a   fashion,     so   that we     might     practise duets
 together.     We both belonged for some time, also, to
 an amateur brass band at Erith, which met for a weekly
 practice    under   the leadership      of a band-master     from
 Woolwich.       But my father's chief       reason for taking up
 his noisy but somewhat unwieldy instrument, and also
 for inducing me to take up mine, was that we might

               ORCHESTRAL MUSIC IN CHURCH.                307
take an active part in the introduction of orchestral
 music into Church festival services. This was a subject
 in which he took great interest, and we played together
 in a Gregorian Festival in St. Paul's Cathedral, at
 Harvest Festival    Services at St. Stephen's, Lewisham,
St.   Philip's, Battersea, and the pretty little parish
church of Darenth, Kent. Just at the time, however,
at which, under the tuition of the late A. J. Phasey,
he was becoming     master of his instrument, he received
the injury to his right hand already described.         And
though he several times subsequently spoke of resuming
his practice, and did occasionally attempt to do so, he
never really took up the euphonium again.
     Of instrumental music,      however, whether himself
performing or not, he was always very fond, and, when
we lived at Norwood, used regularly to attend the daily
performances of the famous orchestral band at the
Crystal Palace, under the leadership      of Mr.     August
Manns.       With his usual happy         knack,   too, of
succeeding    where   anyone   else would  certainly    have
failed, he managed to obtain an order admitting him to
the private rehearsals for the Saturday Concerts   ;  for on
Saturday afternoons he was generally engaged, and so
could not attend the concerts themselves.         But his
strong point, as far as music was concerned, lay in the
organisation and conducting of choral music.        Besides
undertaking the precentorship        of the seven great
festivals which have already been described, he trained
and managed the parish choir of Erith, Kent, during a
period of several years, and also conducted an amateur
         u  2

 308                 THE REV. J.       G.  WOOD.
 choral    society,   which     met    at   private   houses,   but
 occasionally gave public concerts.
      His   method    of conducting was peculiarly his own.
 For   an  occasional false note he cared very little ; but
 false   time,   or   false    accent,    used  to   trouble    him
 exceedingly.      I have   often known      him to come down
 stairs from the top of the house in order to set right a
 bar that was not quite       correctly played in one of these
 respects.    In  the same way, when practising his choir,
 he would have a single line, or even a single bar, of a
 hymn repeated again and again until it quite suited his
 fastidious requirements.        But in this way he got his-
                                                        "
 choirs to sing with a precision and " swing                seldom
 attained by those not under professional tuition, and his
 own choir of Erith was famous for miles round for the
 high state of excellence to which it attained under his
 rule.
      Of course there were occasional objections,           on the
 part of some of the choristers, to a system in which so
 much attention was paid to detail ; and now and then
 very amusing little scenes would result. Of one in par
 ticular my father was never tired of telling.             Certain
 malcontents    were greatly dissatisfied      with the manner
 in which a particular piece of music was taken.              Each
.had suggestions to make, and of course these different
 suggestions were altogether contradictory.           At  last one
 of the members rose and said that, as there was clearly
 much dissatisfaction, he had a proposal to make which
 he thought would solve every difficulty         ;  and that was,
 that   the   members     of the choir should conduct          and

                 WHIST AND "BVMBLU-PUPPY."                    309
the Rev.      J. G. Wood should sing ! This proposition
naturally had the effect of closing the controversy ; and
«ver afterwards the conductor's task was an easier and
a more agreeable one.
     Among other amusements my father was very fond
of whist. But it had to be whist, true and serious, for
                   "                 "
nothing of the       bumble-puppy order would he endure.
 The game was a game to be played in silence, with
due regard for the solemnity of the occupation ; fail
ing to return      a partner's lead was a great and grievous
fault,    requiring to be expiated by due penitence and
contrition, with much self-abasement and promise of
amendment ; and        a   call for  trumps unobserved was
regarded with a sort of wistful sorrow, as of one who
feels deeply, but is too saddened to scold.         Scold, how
ever, my father never did, at whist or at anything else.
 He erred, indeed,    if he  erred at all, rather on the side of
over-indulgence ; and I do not think that in all my life
 I  more than once heard angry words from his lips —
and then only under circumstances of the very greatest
 provocation.
      Chess he used to play at one time, and he played it
 well  ;  but he gave it up on account of the strain which
 it caused on an already sufficiently taxed brain. But of
 backgammon      — which    he played    after a fashion   of his
own — he      was extremely fond     ; and while he was laid
 up with the accident to his hand we played almost every
 evening, he having instructed me in the game for
 this    special  purpose.     And at one time he devoted
some little attention to mistram, which he tried — with

 310                  THE REV. J.       G.  WOOD.
 some   success   — to raise to the rank of a game of skill
 from   that of a game of chance.               Other indoor games
than these       I  do not think that         I  ever knew him to
play.
     His principal indoor recreation always consisted in
reading; and in this he was omnivorous.                 Newspapers,
novels,     pamphlets, magazines      :    grave or serious, witty
or wise   ;  all were seized upon and read in all sorts of odd
moments.        And he mostly had his pockets full of odds
and ends of literature which he had picked up at railway
bookstalls.       He also,   I am  sorry to say, had a bad way
of borrowing books, and either forgetting to return them,
or else leaving them somewhere              without    the slightest
recollection     of having done so.        In just    the same way
he used to leave       his linen behind him at the various
places at which he stayed during his lecturing                tours ;
and some used to come home by parcel post                ; and some
never came at all.         So that alter about        three tours of
average length he always required a new outfit.                With
other people's books, of course, the matter was far more
serious ; and     I am afraid that his inveterate forgetful-
ness   in this respect was the          cause    of many losses to
many people.
     In  reading and in conversation           alike, there was one
subject with which my father would have nothing what
ever to do    ; and that, strange to say, was the subject of
politics.     No matter how fiercely the storm of contro
versy might wage       ;   no matter how great might be the
excitement      throughout      the country on some burning
question of the day      ;  no one could elicit his views on

                  HATRED OF POLITICS.           .                311
the subject, no one could ever ascertain whether he had
any views at all.     What the reason for this curious
reticence might be    I   never could discover ; but it was
very deeply rooted.        He impartially read the news
papers of both sides, but invariably kept his opinions to
himself.     When voting-day      came   round he went and
voted, as became a man and a ratepayer             ;   but no one
ever knew to which side his vote had gone.           '
                                                       And almost
the only way to offend him was         to persist in talking to
him upon the one subject which he abhorred, or to press
for a statement of his views upon matters which all the
rest of the world were eagerly and excitedly discussing.
     Although   we saw but    little of him when at home,
and although, even upon the few occasions on which he
left his study, he was commonly engrossed in the parti
cular subject upon which he happened to be working,
my father was always      a  delightful companion, with the
power of thoroughly       entering into and sympathising
with the hobbies and pursuits of those much younger
than himself.      In   society,   too, he was        always   very
popular.     He might talk, or he might not            : that, to a
great extent, was a matter        of chance.      But, when he
once began to enter into conversation, and to interest
himself in the topic of discussion, he was one of the
pleasantest of talkers, always ready and apt with quota
tion, anecdote, and illustration, full of humour, and at
the same time very careful       and accurate in his state
ments.     In the words of one who knew him well, from
the time of his matriculation to the end of his life,          "he
was   an excellent   conversationalist, and no matter how

312              THE REV. J.    G.  WOOD.
many hours he had been toiliDg, he always seemed fresh
for his work, and pleased to have   a friendly chat."
     Perhaps the best tribute to his popularity in society
was the fact that he was always equally welcomed by
all, of both sexes and all ages.      Everywhere that he
went he made new and staunch friends       ; and the number
and tone of the sympathetic letters      received after his
death bore eloquent   testimony to the universal favour
with which he was regarded, and the     deep and real sense
of the loss which all who knew him felt that they had
sustained.
