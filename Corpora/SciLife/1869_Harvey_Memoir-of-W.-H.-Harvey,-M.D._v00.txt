OF THE WARM REGARD ENTERTAINED FOR HIM
                     BY DOCTOR HARVEY,

      THIS VOLUME IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY

                           THE EDITOR.
                 PREFACE.

The following Memoir was originally intended for Dr. Harvey's
personal friends only ; but the number of these was so large,
he was himself so universally beloved, and his character--as
exhibited in his letters -- so peculiar, and in many ways so
interesting to the ordinary student of biography, that it has
been decided to publish it.

  A place among the great scientific theorists of his age cannot

be claimed for Dr. Harvey. His lame as a Naturalist rests
mainly upon his conscientious labours in that vast field of
description and classification in which he was from first to last --
from the first dawn of his genius in his happy schoolboy days to
its premature setting--so enthusiastic and indefatigable a worker
Here his marvellous accuracy and minuteness of observation,
and exquisite delineation of the objects which came under his
untiring eye and hand, can only be appreciated by the earnest
student of Nature who goes with him over the same ground in
the same spirit.

   His character, as a Botanist thoroughly devoted to his
vocation, and thoroughly impressed with a sense of the divine
beauty and magnificence exhibited in the lowliest seaweed,
can only be fully seen in his letters to his most intimate friends.
In these we get into the very heart of the man himself ; a man
of whom it might be said with the fullest truth :--

                  " To him the meanest flower that blows could give
                       Thoughts that did often lie too deep for tears."

With these private letters, which may be truly called autobio
graphic, the Memoir is therefore almost entirely occupied ; the
viii PREFACE.

few gaps in the series being filled up with brief notes of expla

nation by    the Editor. The mass of   his correspondence  with his
illustrious                             Agardh, Agassiz,   Darwin,
              brethren --the Hookers,
&c., &c.--has been for various reasons omitted. It was not

deemed expedient to break the chain of these strictly autobio

graphic letters by others which, however interesting to those

concerned with the minutiae of descriptive botany, could scarcely

be expected to interest the general public.

   As a piece of biography, the Memoir is valuable chiefly as
the record of a life thoroughly consistent to the end -- and a

remarkable life too ; for in Dr. Harvey were united a positivist's

zeal for truths of fact with an enthusiastic faith which had in

it something mystical. Exactly what he determined in youth

to accomplish he accomplished ; the work which he took upon

himself to do he did, honestly and thoroughly ; the fame which

he desired to achieve he achieved. In life he was strengthened

in every difficulty and trial by a trust in an overruling Provi

dence, which never faltered and never betrayed him ; in death

sustained by a Christian fortitude, which remained calm and
firm until death was " swallowed up in victory."
In the churchyard at Torquay, where he himself desired to

be buried, beneath the plain marble slab which bears the name

of William Henry Harvey, repose the mortal remains of n

good man and a great Naturalist.

             " 'Tis well ; 'tis something ; we may stand

                   Where he in English earth is laid,
                  And from his ashes may be made

               The violet of his native land."

                         CHAPTER L

                         BOYHOOD.

William Henry Harvey was descended' from a Quaker family
of Youghal. His father, Joseph Massey Harvey, was the eldest

of five brothers, two of whom became merchants in Cork.

Joseph settled in Limerick, where he married Rebecca, the

eldest daughter of Thomas Mark of that city, and became one

of its principal merchants. His residence was Summerville, a

country-house prettily situated on the banks of the Shannon.

» There, in the February of 1811, William Henry was born ; and,

when indulging in visions of foreign travel, he used often play

fully to allude to the great comet of this year, as the star of his

destiny. He was by several years the youngest of eleven children,
and thus naturally became a great pet. Yet, being the solitary

baby of the household, his infancy and childhood were more

lonely than is usual in so large a family. His only playmates
J.were the son and daughter of Mrs.  Fennell, his mother's

widowed sister, who then resided in the city of Limerick, but

who afterwards formed part of the family at Summerville.

His early love of botany he attributed to the companionship

of an old gentlewoman, an intimate friend of his mother, whose

delight was to carry him to the garden, and teach him the

names of the beautiful flowers with which it abounded.
   In few instances can it be more truly said that " the child is

father to the man ;" for the boyhood of few men presents a

greater number of those traits which in riper years formed the

charm of his character.

                                     R
1 MEMOIR OF DR. HARVEY.

His earliest enjoyment of the seaside was at Youghal, and

there were gathered his first shells, which in time extended to a

considerable collection of both foreign and native. His taste

for conchology, as well as other branches of science, was fostered
by the intimacy then formed with Robert Ball, afterwards so

well known as an eminent naturalist, with whose family he there

became acquainted. In 1844 Mr. Ball was appointed director

of the museum in Trinity College, Dublin, and by Dr. Harvey's

election to the botanical chair in the same year, the friends

were again brought into happy association until the lamented

death of Dr. Ball in the spring of 1857.

The first boarding school to which William was sent was that

of Newtown, near Waterford. There he soon outstripped his

schoolfellows, and at the early age of thirteen was removed to

Ballitore school, in the county of Kildare, then conducted by

James White, who joined to extensive attainments in classical,

scientific, and general literature, a knowledge of the various

branches of natural science, which enabled him to appreciate,

and induced him to foster the peculiar tastes of his pupil.
At this school, where man)' of William's brothers and cousins
had received their education, he found wider scope for his

tastes, and more congenial society ; not only as regarded his
school companions, but among the families of the village, which
at that time contained an uncommon proportion of persons of

cultivated minds and literary acquirements. Here also the

field of natural history opened more fully to the cravings of his

youthful enthusiasm.

The French teacher in the school at this time, Theodore

Eugene Suliot, was a young man of singular talent, who fully

understood the mind of his gifted pupil, and a cordial intimacy

quickly sprung up between them. Mr. Suliot thus writes (in
forwarding to the editor what he calls "a few relics of that

delightful friendship with the most engaging boy it was ever
                          :--
my    fortune to know ")            us during my intercourse with

his departure for the Cape, but they are lost, with many other

like memorials of bygone experience. After his return to Ire

Iland we never met, save during those few golden hours spent

at Miltown Malbay, wandering with him on the seashore, pick

ing shells, gathering seaweed, and basking in the sweet light

of his childlike playfulness and innocence, seemingly unspoiled

by years or contact with the world. After that time all intercourse

Iceased ; not from any diminution of regard on either side, for he
never forgot a friend, but our paths diverged.     continued

plodding on in my obscurity, occupying till lately only a subor

dinate position in the profession of teaching. He was led, by

the force of genius, to devote his thoughts and energies to the

beautiful science he had loved from his boyhood, with a dim

unconscious anticipation of the rich reward which she had in

Istore for him. hailed his growing fame from afar with delight
Iand pride. At distant intervals managed, through mutual

friends in the old country, to send messages of sympathy in his

Ilabours and triumphs ; and heard with sorrow of his failing

health and peaceful close.1 Alluding to walks we had together

Iwhen was a teacher in Ballitore, and he my ideal of a charm

ing, innocent, gifted boyhood, he writes :--

                                                            " ' Miltown Malbay, 1826.

   " In the prospect of soon going home for the holidays, he
writes from school : --

  " ' I have thought of remaining here by myself during

the vacation, that my collection of butterflies may be more

perfect.'"
   In a letter written from home Mr. Suliot is requested, when

in London, to go to some bookseller's shop, and ask for Cuvier's
I"Animal Kingdom," and look whether

specific descriptions or only generic ones.

know this particularly."
   William delighted at this time in Moore's works, and was

especially charmed with Lalla Rookh, on which he descants at

considerable length in this letter.

Writing in 1829, he is surprised that his friend should be so
                            discover that he is "
b"lSinedlfisahsnensost,"to  he says, " has not     proud, ambitious,  and selfish."
                                                   yet broken out     in any very

alarming degree, but the seeds arc there. They have thrown

up their elastic cotyledons and their now slender but voracious

plumula."
   As chemistry had some place in the general scientific interests

of the young student, his parents entertained thoughts of
placing him with an eminent chemist in London. A better idea

of the mind of the schoolboy at this time cannot be given than

that drawn by himself in the following letter to an intimate

cousin.

   I am quite deficient in having studied mosses so little, but
I have a great desire to get acquainted with them. They are

Inot at all so difficult as people imagine. Wert thou to examine

a simple moss, thou wouldst be in raptures as was with the

exquisite beauty and regularity of the fringe which surrounds

the mouth of the capsule. Most persons think Cryptogamia a

difficult and useless study. This might be true in the time of

Linnaeus, who but planted the seed. Under Hedwig it sprung

up and flourished, but it was reserved for our countryman

Hooker to perfect the flower.

William's brother Jacob had emigrated to America, and

settled as a merchant in New York. He was very much

attached to his young brother, and frequently wrote to him

whilst he was a schoolboy in Ballitore, where he himself had

been educated. To these letters William frankly replied,

revealing his ideas about his future with perhaps more freedom

to this distant brother than to those at home. He tells him that
" he is neither fit to be a doctor nor a lawyer, lacking courage

for the one, and face for the other, and application for both."

     I am a very fickle animal, so much so indeed, that my
Inickname is Butterfly; yet in spite of this have had a

constant taste for natural history, so far as it is regulated by

Ian acknowledged system. Since my attention was turned to

chemistry, have also been steady in liking it as a science,

Ithough not caring much to dive into theories which are so

continually varying, that when am grown-up, Davy, like his

predecessors, may be out of fashion, and instead of being looked

upon as a great experimental philosopher, may be branded with

the epithet of a blindfolded theorist. His discoveries are by no

means placed beyond doubt, for it is just as easy to understand

his celebrated theory of chlorine in a totally different manner

from that in which he explains it.

they are seldom brought over, consequently are not often to be

may be on the voyage, by steeping them in water they will

revive, so please send some with the shells.

in London at length prevailed with them, and a place was

assigned to him in the counting-house, where his time was
chiefly occupied as a kind of factotum to his father, whose

advancing life and constitutional delicacy rendered such atten

tion necessary.

On his return from school the cousins before alluded to

became his constant companions, and participated in all his

pursuits, amongst which was the formation of a botanical
garden ; and " William cares for nothing but weeds," became a
frequent remark. In 1829 they were separated, by his aunt's

going to reside in Clonmel, and the correspondence which was

then briskly kept up between them gives the best picture which

can be presented of the progress of his scientific pursuits for

several ensuing years. Other young naturalists may be en

couraged as well as interested by learning from these pages the

course of study which these young men marked out for them

selves, pursuing it with an earnest zeal that rendered industry

a pleasure, and which, overcoming the hindrances attendant on

their business occupations, made them avail themselves of every

leisure moment for scientific improvement.

Miltown Malbay, in the county of Clare, had become the

seaside resort of the Summerville family ; and there, on the

shores of the Atlantic, rich fields of marine botany opened to

William's researches. Spring tides were his high festivals.

Late and early he was on the rocks, following the receding

waves to grasp the seaweeds, or bending over the urchin-beds

and the pools studded with sea-anemones.          with his

cousin, many readers, and especially the uubotanical, may

find that the editor has exceeded the bounds of interest ; but

casting aside the greater part of the letters, and all matters of

private and family nature, which no doubt greatly enlivened

them, she has carefully endeavoured that no extract should be

given without its seemingly desirable object, either in the way
of pointing to some interesting plant or new book of study, of

as marking some further step in advance on that ladder of

science which he was climbing with such eager and persevering

industry.

I have got " Loudon's Eneyc. of Plants," but am not quite

in love with . it as a dictionary, for the specific characters

are not the best. The genera are also much cut up and put in

bad characters. Convattaria 1 is divided into two genera, and

the chief difference (who would think it?) one has axillary
flowers, the other spiked. Again,

The young naturalist, however, was not so absorbed in his

favourite pursuits as to be either inattentive or indifferent to

the political changes which affected the welfare of his country,

as well as to those still more important and stirring events on

the continent of Europe which followed the downfall of

Napoleon. The grasp which Ire took of these movements, and

his ardour in the cause of national freedom, appear in letters

addressed at the close of this year to his brother in New

York.  To Mr. J. Harvey, New York.

the entire county of Clare was lit up with bonfires on the night

those got up by our worthy Captain Bock, proving to the people
of England how grateful the people were for being en

of the Government has come clogged with fetters which,

though in reality trifling, appear monstrous to our prejudices.

It was most amusing to see the papers preceding and following

the king's speech. The high church papers all of a sudden

The following extract may make our young naturalist appear

as a somewhat fierce democrat and revolutionist, while in fact he

was in disposition and temperament much more of the aristocrat

and conservative. His sympathy in the cause of freedom, here

so warmly expressed, may be looked upon merely as an outburst

of youthful ardour, kindled by his hatred of tyranny, injustice,

and wrong.

  It may be said besides that Moore and Byron then influenced

young   poetic  minds quite  as strongly  as Longfellow and   Tenny
son do  in the  present day  ; and " The  Torch of Liberty,"  handed

from nation to nation, as depicted in the so-named poem, could

hardly be read by so enthusiastic an admirer of Moore's fas

cinating poetry without awakening an echo.

   I Jwas in great fear when the first news came from

Paris, while the three days of uly were progressing, that some

conciliatory measures would have been adopted which would

have spoiled all. But no. The Bourbons were never more

delightfully blind. They galled to the uttermost, and then

there was no retreating, and they have taken their farewell of

IFrance for ever. Charles is pleasantly settled at Holyrood
House, where    believe they still make a show of royalty

pretty similar to that kept up by the ex-Stuarts. His unfor

tunate ministers will probably forfeit their lives in a few days,
if they have not done so already. This severity

   Hitherto William had pursued his scientific researches with

little assistance or encouragement, beyond what books and the
sympathy of his cousin afforded. But now an intercourse was
about to spring up which not only added largely to the happi
ness of his life, but strongly influenced his future career, and

confirmed the choice of cryptogamic botany as his peculiar

study.

   In the summer of this year he and Mr. Fennell visited
Killamey, and there found the Hookeria Isete-virens, a small
moss, heretofore unnoticed as an Irish plant. By means of this
discovery he introduced himself to Sir William, then Dr.

Hooker, Curator of the Botanic Gardens at Glasgow, and thus

began an acquaintance which quickly ripened into a warm and
lasting friendship. This distinguished man soon perceived the
earnest zeal and carefully minute investigation of the young
botanist. He generously afforded him every assistance and

advantage possible for his advancement in the science, and thus

won his ardent gratitude.

    The specimens were forwarded to Glasgow with the following

letter :--

Iwant of a personal introduction. As the plant occurs in plenty
in one of the situations attached,  think it highly probable it

may be found in many other places, and very extraordinary
J.that it was overlooked by T. Mackay, as it is found within
Ithree or four yards of his habitat for the Trichomanes.

We got home from Miltown a few days ago, and found a

long letter from Hooker awaiting me. .

   He has sent me a       parcel of mosses by    steamer (not yet
arrived), also a present  of Agardh's " Systema  Algarum," a scarce

book, and one which will be of great use to me in determining

Ispecies. He will be very glad of some Biccia natans, so try and

get more, and send it alive, with a particular habitat, that may

certify it to him as found by thee. He has given me his address

Iin London, that may write to him while there ; and invites me
Ito Glasgow, saying shall be most welcome to investigate his

duplicates of every sort, and have the free use of his library.

I cannot help thinking how fortunate it was that I got up so

early that morning at Killamey, and found the branch of
Hookeria lsete-virens. All our success since may be traced to
Ithat.

  It is full time for thee to get a microscope. To possess dry

tion, is not to have any knowledge of them at all.

  A heavy sorrow was now about to cast its shadow over

William's sensitive mind, for which he was unprepared when

the preceding letter was written, namely, the death of his
mother, which took place on the Christmas Day following.
Mrs. Harvey was held in esteem and reverence by all who were
acquainted with her. Her character exhibited in no ordinary
degree the fruits of true religion. She was humble, charitable,

and benevolent. She had great strength of mind, yet she was
timid and yielding, and was gifted with a vigorous understand

ing and sound judgment, united to a most winning simplicity
a?id naivete. Beloved and honoured by her friends, it was natural

that she should possess the warm affections of her children, and
William especially was devotedly attached to her. His grief

for her loss was excessive, and even when time had placed this

bitter affliction in the softened distance, he could not allude to

his mother without emotion. Though highly valuing sympathy,

his deepest feelings were at all times hidden under silence and
reserve. He shrank from displaying them even when with his

most intimate friends, and generally had recourse to his pen for

the relief of expressing them. His correspondents often in this

respect enjoyed an advantage over those with whom he had

intercourse. Writing to Mr. Suliot in 1826,  he says,

While under the above-mentioned sorrow, he turned for

solace to his favourite science, which then, and afterwards in

days, shed over him

I can find time for, in investigating an enormous parcel of

Algse from Dr. Hooker, viz., all Carmichael's specimens, and

also sundry parcels from Mrs. Griffiths, of Torquay."

   His leisure hours were now devoted chiefly to the crypto-
gamic branches of his favourite science, and he was so for

tunate as to be kept constantly supplied by Dr. Hooker with

packages of plants from various quarters of the globe for his

investigation. This pleasing employment led to an acquaint

ance with the labours of the greater part of those celebrated

botanists whose researches had been similarly directed. In

many instances a correspondence resulted, and their collections

were sent for his inspection, which enabled him to add rapidly

to his store of knowledge. Thus he became placed in that

position of intercourse with those eminent men which had been

the object of his highest ambition ; and his letters contain

many grateful acknowledgments of the advantages thus ac
quired, through the appreciation and introduction of his kind

and honoured friend.

Among the correspondence which at this time sprung up, was

that with Mrs. Griffiths of Torquay, so frequently mentioned in

his future letters, and with whom he formed a lasting and inti

mate friendship.
In the April of this year he went to Killarney, and on his
return he writes to Mr. Fennell :--" Our Viola lutea is curtisii.
I Ihave no patience with such pseudo species.

Iin a small lake near Cromaglaun Mountain, Killarney. I

thought was gathering L. glutinosa, or probably should have
searched with more vigour. "lis a lovely little shell."

Soon after he had returned from this solitary visit to

Killarney, his father was attacked with hemorrhage from the

lungs, and for some time required his close attention. He was

consequently obliged to relinquish a trip to which he had
eagerly been looking forward-- " The delightful pleasure," he says
in a letter, " of exploring the Scotch mountains in company with

Dr. Hooker," by whom he had been invited to join the party.

He    however managed to work with       his  accustomed    "induhsatvrye

   Change of air being recommended for the restoration of his
father's health, William accompanied him to Kingstown, which
was chosen as a seaside residence for some months. " Dublin

Bay," he writes, on this occasion "is not the best place for

Algse. It is impossible, however, unless you go with your eyes

shut, to visit any of our coasts without finding something new."
That this, in his case, was verified, appears in the following

letter, which also discloses his prospect of the long wished-for

visit to Glasgow.

My dear Friend,               Limerick, 29th October, 1832.

There is an auction of books going on in Dublin, the

catalogue of which contains many curious old botanical works.

It is too late to send thee one, but by writing at once to

Mackay, he might pick up something of value for thee. They
are part of the private collection of a daft Irish gentleman,

whose passion it was, till he ruined his fortune, to attend all the

principal auctions in Great Britain and Ireland, and to fill his
house, stables, barns, and even his coach-yard, with all manner

of curiosities. He was so fond of pictures that they were

ranged six deep (one over the other) on the walls of every room
in his house, besides having a large picture gallery. His

mahogany tables were numberless, and his china services
without end. Many cartloads of minerals, shells, fossils and

Iinsects were lying for years unpacked in his out-offices, where

have seen them, and the creditors found in a lumber-room some

hundreds of Chinese gods huddled together, not to speak of the
stuffed beasts, birds, and fishes. He collected books with the

same reckless avidity, but once they were bought and sent home,

the matter ended --he never looked at one of them again. The
Igreater part he could not read if he would.

Mr. J. M. Harvey found the occupation of so large a house as

Suminerville too great a charge for his declining years and

to the devoted young botanist.

The banks of the Shannon presented   a     richly luxuriant and

diversified vegetation. In one direction lay a broad tract of

peat bog, where many rare plants were mingled with the heath
and other common clothing of its moist surface. The Drosera or

sundew glistened among tufte of white moss and reindeer lichen,

and the delicate pink Andromeda recalled to fancy the story of
its fabled name, while the spiked flowers of Utricularia adorned
the pools. At some distance on the opposite side of the river

   According to his usual habit, he rose early, and occupied the

time till breakfast in examining his own plants, and making
drawings of them, if not engaged with the collections sent him

by his botanical friends. His evening walks amid the beautifu

scenery encouraged his dreamy fancies, and the poetic vein

frequently broke forth in sportive rhymes, as well as in verses

I am about taking a dip into a sea where I cannot see my

exotic or general botany -- a gulf from which never hope to be

should be spared. The idea took, and the tree was let to stand

for as long a time as the robin should frequent it ; and so it

remains standing unto this day. Now read my moral. The

had a house at Kilkee, a watering-place on the same coast,

equally remarkable for its magnificent scenery, and offering
similar advantages to the lovers of algae. Nor were its cliffs
less rich in plants of interest, the banks of the path leading to
which were tufted with the lovely little bog pimpernel, perhaps

nowhere to be seen in greater beauty.
   His luggage on these occasions often excited the merriment

of his friends, the greater part being a formidable array of the

requisites for drying seaweeds, consisting of a quantity of coarse
towels and blotting-paper, together with boards for pressing,

which were furnished with leather straps and buckles. It was

amusing to follow him to the shore, see his coat thrown off, his
shirt-sleeve tucked up, and his bare arm plunged into the crevice
pools between the rocks, from whence he drew forth the rare
and delicate weeds so concealed under the green waving Ulva;

Though apparently so contented with his home, the desire

of seeing the vegetation of foreign countries in its living beauty

was still strong within him, and an opportunity seemed at this

time afforded of realizing the cherished day-dream. Mr. Daniel

Wheeler, a friend of his father, was about to pay a missionary

visit to the South Sea Islands, and William thought it might
be practicable to accompany him; but he soon became con
vinced that his father's life was too uncertain to admit of his

leaving home, and filial duty and affection led him to abandon
for the present all idea of foreign travel. To the cousin who

frequently lectured      him, both seriously and playfully,   for  his
                                                              and  not
Ifan"cy  for roving, he  wrote as follows :--
         do indeed find
                         my place to be by my father's side,
I Iin the ' Bay of Islands ;' and hope may keep my place in
Ithis respect at least, however may fail in other duties. Had
I Inot been convinced how the case stood, should have been
Imore seriously bent on carrying my point, for still think that
under common circumstances it would have been of the highest

advantage to me to have gone abroad ; but with ray father so

Idelicate and advanced in life, 1 have done much better to stay

at home. Besides, am the child of his old age, and he has

therefore the more peculiar claim on me.
" You say that ' cultivating the mind is not neglecting our
duty.' Whether it be so or not entirely depends on the crop
we are rearing. E. A.1 the other day enlarged very beautifully
Ion our first parents having been placed in the garden ' to dress

it and to keep it.' Now if introduce into the garden of
my mind all sorts of wild plants, to the exclusion of what may
Ibe called 'the olive and the grape,' will not such a cultivation
be a neglect of duty ?   find, by seeing the effects of science

on the most learned naturalists of the day, that the utmost
knowledge may be accompanied either by deep humility and
piety or by insufferable arrogance and hardness of heart. ' To
look through nature up to nature's God' may be good in
poetry, but is by no means an obvious effect of knowledge in
fact. Yet what is more beautiful than to see a man who has

         1 A minister of the " Society of Friends.-'
          CONTINUATION OF HOME LIFE.                   39

pushed knowledge and discovery to human limits, viewing his

Ilabours with * childlike humility ' and simplicity ? What if

use the epithet ' Newtonic ' instead ? Newton's was indeed a

rightly cultivated mind, which produced a fine harvest of duties
performed. How many a fruitful olive-plant is almost choked
with a quantity of wild convolvulus ! But there is room enough
for the convolvulus to twine itself among the rose-bushes and

Ibrambles without doing harm. Why then does it fasten itself

on the poor olive ? Alas ! why should pursue the allegory."

          Ashbourne, March 12tb, 1834.

We have very entertaining lectures just now going on in

Ichemistry by Professor Davy, a nephew of the great Sir
Humphry.  attend them, and feel something of my old

chemical fire revive. Some very curious facts relating to

Ithe vast magnetic power of the voltaic circuit.

'tis comfortable to find one's follies less contemptible than those

    Apropos of the love of knowledge, thy reason for not attending
Professor Davy's lectures appears odd. Surely the pleasure of
gaining something, however little, even with the probability of
never learning any more, ought to be a sufficient inducement.

be a right excellent addition to your party.

Note also the places where the sea-coast is limestone, and where

slate or trap. This knowledge is of vast importance to the

algologist, for though the roots of sea-weeds appear less designed

for furnishing nutriment than those of other plants, yet there is

          CONTINUATION OF HOME LIFE.                                    -11

   The year 1834 was destined to be one of the most important
in Mr. Harvey's life, bringing as it did events and changes

deeply affecting his future prospects, and which seemed to bear

him at once further beyond the threshold of manhood than the
attainment of years was likely to have produced in one of his

peculiar temperament. The first of these was the marriage of

his sister, the circumstances arising from which may be given in

his own simple words as written to Dr. Hooker.

   "My only sister is about to be married and settled in the

metropolis, and my father wishes to live with her in preference
to remaining here at either of my brother's houses -- and very

naturally, for she has been his careful nurse these many years.

INow 1 am a kind of addendum to my father also, seeing am
Ithe youngest child and the pet, and of course follow him

wherever he goes. As regards botany the change is a happy
one for me, for I shall at last have some persons within reach to

Isympathize in my pursuits. As regards other feelings it is

also happy, for should not like to separate either from my
father or sister. The only drawback that my habits of busi
                         is,

                            I

shall probably be again unsettled. But trust may not be

long so.  have lived in idleness long enough, and am grow

wherever he intrudes. My horror at such an old age grows

stronger every day."

The above arrangement, which proved so satisfactory on both

sides, was but of short duration. On the 18th of the following

October, Mr. Joseph M. Harvey was suddenly removed  by                  one

of those attacks to which he had been for some years subject.    ;
The shock was instantaneous, and on William the stroke espe

cially fell. He accompanied his father's remains to Limerick

and was affecting to witness his speechless sorrow, from which

he found difficult for some days to rally.

The following letters continue the narrative.
42 MEMOIR OF DR. HARVEY.

                    To Miss F.

                    Limerick, November 11th, 1834.
I IAs to myself, my dear S., am quite well.
                                                      know how

thou hast been feeling for me, and thy sympathy is very
Iprecious.
            have indeed been stripped of my chief stay, and at
Ia time when least expected it. It is nothing to say that the

shock was stunning.

  IEvery day feel more and more that my foundations have
Ibeen shaken, and that am thrown on the world to stand or to
Ifall. have not only lost my sweet companion, my more than
Iindulgent father, but am deprived of my early protector,
Iunder whose Ming have so long and so thoughtlessly nestled.
  INot but that have abundance

I Ishall be desolate or lonely. Surely
                                still to be thankful for--
                                 have not to dread that
                                cannot be so while have

Imy sister and thyself left. How different would my situation

have been had this blow come when was younger, and less

Iable to push my way in life !
      have often thought, and latterly more than ever, how un

worthy we all are, and myself in particular, of such parents,

and of possessing such treasures for so long a period. Each

Ilived the full allotted portion of human life, beyond which it is
labour and sorrow.  do not wish to ascribe reasons to Omni

Ipotence, but, watching by the bedside on the first night of death,

   felt that, in mercy to him, he was taken. He had finished

his course ; he had kept the faith. There was no more for him

Ito do, and, with regard to his family, he had seen his chief
wishes fulfilled.   enclose a copy of his last letter to

E. A., written just a week before his death. It shows of what

spirit he was to the last, and, taken in conjunction with his long

and exemplary life, it is really a beautiful letter.

                                    To Dr. Hooker.

                                                   Ashbourne, Limerick, November 12th, 1834.

       My dear father's removal was indeed most sudden, but to

Ihimself, believe, it was no surprise, for since my dear mother's

death, three years ago, he seemed weaned from earth, and to

be preparing for a purer and better world. Yet it was beauti
CONTINUATION OF HOME LIFE.                               43

fully instructive to those around him to see him take the

greatest interest in every benevolent undertaking, either for
national improvement or for the prosperity of Limerick, while

at the same time it was quite evident that his chief thoughts

were in a far higher sphere. Indeed, his children cannot look

with other than grateful feelings on his long life of usefulness

and Christian charity ; and if there be any consolation in know

Iing that we have the sincere sympathy of all classes of our

fellow-citizens, rich and poor, it is ours, for do not exaggerate

in saying that our loss is a public one.

   My feelings are those of one who has had his foundations

Isuddenly swept from under him. Notwithstanding that have
Ia sister and affectionate brothers, cannot help feeling that my
Iguide is gone, and must now stand or fall by my own counsel.
INo earthly arm can supply the place of that have lost.
IMy stay in Dublin is now suddenly closed.
                                            am unwilling

to enter into any mercantile speculation in the present strange

times, and have long had a strong desire to see tropical climates,

Iwith the view of extending my own botanical knowledge, if
I Iadd nothing to the general stock. Now I am well aware that,

unless when young, shall never set out. But am not rich

enough to go touring round the world, spending here and there.

If I Igo abroad, it must be in a way not to return poorer, if do

not return richer.

  I have been reading Dr. Lang's history of New South Wales,

Iin which he holds out fair hopes to persons like myself of
moderate means.  am induced to look to this colony on ac

Icount of the governor, Sir Kichard Burke, being a most particular

friend of our family, to whom could always look up, and so

should feel less from home than almost anywhere else -- not to

speak of the peculiarity of the natural history, and its being

the country of Brown. Pray give thy opinions as to my plan,

Ifor on this step will doubtless depend the success of my whole

life. would therefore be cautious in casting the die.

   His doubts and anxieties about his future destination were,

however, most unexpectedly removed. One of his brothers
was offered the appointment of Colonial Treasurer at the Cape
of Good Hope, and it was at once decided that in the event
of his acceptance of the office William should accompany him.
44 MEMO lit OF DR. HAR VET.

Thus were his ardent desires fulfilled and a new era opened in
Lis life. The following confidential letter to Dr. Hooker relates
the event and his feelings with regard to it.

                 To Dr. Hooker.

My dear Friend,           Morley's Hotel, London, 11/25, 1834.

    IThou wilt be surprised to get a letter from me from

London ; but this world is such a whirligig, that have deter

Imined henceforward to be surprised at nothing. After my last

letter was written had much consultation with my friends in

ILimerick, and seriously weighed the pros and cons of Australia.

Their final opinion, which agrees with thine, was, that should

go out there merely on a botanical tour for two or three years.
IAs to a permanent residence there, never contemplated such
Ia thing.
           certainly should be strangely hard-hearted to cut

my numerous friends and relatives in that outlandish manner.

But circumstances have since occurred which have put my

Australian trip out of my head for the present, and put another
in its stead. Just before the Whigs left office, a high official

situation at the Cape of Good Hope came into the gift of Kice,1

I Iwho at once nominated my brother Joseph to the appointment.
  need hardly add that go with him. To be sure, the Cape is

old ground. Its botany, though beautiful and interesting, has not

charm of novelty as that   of  New    Holland ;      but  we cannot
all our wishes. Is there  a"   Flora  Capensis      ?"      had long

IZealand, but now must rest satisfied with one of the Ca'pe.

                                                  London, Morley's Hotel, December 1st, 1834.

       Having just returned from my first visit to " the greatest
botanist in this or in any other age," a visit of three hours, and

Inot being disappointed in my expectations, must give you the

benefit of my lucubrations. What weak creatures we are !

I Iwith him than have often felt in company which thought

measurelessly less about. He is tall, slight, and apparently about

fifty years of age (he must be more) ; quite grey, but not bald,
full of youthful vigour and strength of intellect. His eye
is usually dull and unremarkable, but when he speaks and wishes

to convey his meaning, it is full of depth and power, showing a

remarkably shrewd, sharp observation ; his voice low, and his

Imode of delivery careless and dripping --an odd expression --

but mean to say, like the uncertain tinkling of water--not a

Icontinued flow, but now strong, now small. He certainly

struck me as the most learned botanist have ever come across ;

but this not by any display of knowledge on his part, but by

chance observations that let you into his knowledge without
himself seeming to know it. First we talked algae, of course.

These he had studied in his early days on the coast of New

IHolland and on the north of Ireland. His knowledge appeared
at once clear, comprehensive, and minute.  do not mean his

knowledge of the present state of the science, for as to names

and systems as now adopted he could not be expected, to care
much. But of what he had known then he appeared to have a
clear remembrance, even of species. He showed me the famous

Claudea, and some other highly curious things. He has not

many algae, but all those he has are the most wonderful and
rarest of the tribe. Many are unpublished, and will probably
continue so till his death. We talked of ferns. Immediately he

began to speak of the elastic rings of the capsules, of the forms they
assume in different tribes ; on the reticulation of the seeds con

sidered as generic character, and of the venation of fronds. On

all these he made many observations which could only strike one
Iwho had deeply studied the subject. felt myself miserably super
Ificial.
          mentioned a genus of mosses. Instantly he spoke of

the curious structure of the cellules of the leaves, &c., &c. No

matter what subject we started, he fastened on the very inmost

part of it. He showed me a large collection of fossil woods, many

of them highly curious and beautiful. These he has dissected

in the most exquisitely delicate manner, so that the most

insignificant vessels can be distinctly seen under the microscope,

Iand the fossils are cut so thin that they allow the perfect
transmission of light.  cannot enter into all he said and

showed of the little vessels in these antediluvian vegetables, but
4G MEMOIR OF DR. BARVEY.

I may say that in one specimen he has detected a byssoid

fungus, which had grown on decayed wood, and had been

petrified along with the wood it grew upon. Thus one of the

most fugacious of plants has been preserved in statu quo for

thousands of years. He showed me the Bafflesia,1 and told

me he was about to publish a paper upon it. All his papers

Iare considered botanical gems. Then he talked of the Cape.
   told him of my thoughts of settling there for some years,

and of writing a flora of the colony. He said, some of the

Ipleasantest botanizing he ever had was on Devil's Mountain,

near Cape Town, and he thought could not pitch on a more

Idelightful field of study. Though the ground be trodden there,
there is much to explore and to revise.                            may reckon, he

thinks, on fully five thousand species. Pleasant work !

Nothing new about the administration of public affairs, or the

hopes of private ones. There is much difficulty in forming the

government ; and many days, if not weeks, may elapse before

Ithe arrangements are finally settled. Touching botany, spent

a pleasant evening yesterday at my friend Mr. Ward's, to whom

W. Christy took me. He has been most successful in his

method of growing exotic ferns in glass cases. Our own little

Hymenophyllum was growing in the most charming luxuriance,
Iand had extensively spread over a rockwork --a most difficult
plant to cultivate, it is so impatient of drought.                          was quite

enchanted with a parcel of Cape plants Ward showed me. You

with deep regret of     the death of  N. B.   Ward, as recorded in     the

June 13th, 1868. He died on the 4th of June, at the advanced age of seventy-

seven. He took a lively interest in the preparation of this memorial of his friend.
48 MEMOIR OF DR. HARVEY.

  I dined yesterday with- Mr. Ward, a botanist not perhaps

unknown by thee. He is very zealous and ingenious, and has
an herbarium of about 25,000 species. He is particularly fond
of ferns, and indeed of all Crypts. He has been trying experi
ments in cultivating ferns and mosses, and in the former has
succeeded to admiration. He finds that many stove ferns suc
ceed in the smoky atmosphere of Tower Hill, and require far
less heat than is generally supposed to be necessary for them.
In fact he gives them no artificial heat at all. His plan is to
keep them in an excessively moist atmosphere, by preventing
the escape of vapour. He actually grows them in glazed boxes
hermetically sealed, and leaves them undisturbed for six or

Ieight months together. Nothing could flourish better than

those saw. In those sealed boxes he has had some excellent
parcels of live ferns from Van Diemen's Land, which arrived in

Iperfect health and vigour. He hopes to succeed equally well

with exotic mosses, and see no reason why he should not.

Another experiment he has under process, but I fear with small

Ihopes of success, is growing mosses which had long been dried.
   don't see why the seeds of mosses should not revive as well as
those of ferns ; and should he fail in his attempts at the old
stems, he may in this way hope for young ones.

   From Plassey, where William spent the Christmas of this
year, he writes thus to Mr. Fennell.

           To N. B. Ward, Esq.

DEAR SIR,                         Dublin, January 29, 1835.
I avail myself of the opportunity of a friend going to

I ILondon to send you a few British algae, which are not so well

worth the carriage as had expected when promised them

ot you in London. But my stock of many species is exhausted,

Iand have scarcely replenished any this season.
  I ought to have told you, when we were looking over those

ICape plants at your house, that expected shortly to sail for

the Cape ; but at that time my plans were only half formed,
I Iand so deemed it best to say nothing about them.
                                                     may now
Itell you that expect to sail with my brother's family in a few
Imonths, and that shall probably remain in South Africa for

some years. Natural history, particularly Botany, and especially

Cryptogamia, will probably be my chief amusement, and it is
I Ifquite likely may visit different parts of the colony.
                                                           you
Iwill allow me, should be glad to open a correspondence with
you : and if you will but give me plain directions for making

and packing your live plant cases, it will give me very great

pleasure to send you home our best ferns and mosses in this

way. The Cape ferns, you know, are nothing very remarkable ;

Ibut there are some beauties, and confidently look forward to
Idiscovering many more. Of mosses and Jungermannia, ought

to discover at least 100 new species, and of my favourite Algse

my harvest should be still more fruitful.

  If you will be good enough to write me instructions for the

packing cases, I shall be glad to hear from you.

                                 I am, yours very truly,

                                                                  W. H. Harvey.

                                                                     Dublin, February 10, 1835.

      Well, what of the Cape ? To me the prospect, though not
monetically speaking bright, is one of much pleasure and profit.

I look forward to many charming discoveries in that beautiful
I Ipart of the world ; and if do not achieve wealth, at least

hope for a moderate competence.

  IIt is an old saying, A man does not change his mind by crossing

the sea -- forget the Latin, and who said it--so 'tis yet to be

proved whether the atmosphere of South Africa will have suffi

cient vivifying effect on my capacity to cause it to germinate

handsomely. Botany is a bore ! What a pity to be chained

to a science which empties the pocket continually, and never

returns anything thereto. To the mind, it is true, it does

Ireturn a vast amount of pleasure, and a sparing quantity of
instruction.    wish we had stomachs like butterflies. The

caterpillar very properly has a stomach which almost fills its
whole body, but no sooner does it cease to crawl and has got

wings, than this organ shrinks to a very small space, and never

afterwards requires more nourishment than a few drops of honey.
How convenient would such a formation be for a botanist. He

Imight then defy the frowns of fate, and add interminably to his

stores. Interminably ! forget Death.

While the preparations for the voyage were being completed,
William paid farewell visits to his friends in Ireland, and also
to Dr. Hooker, in Glasgow. Of his school haunts, he writes to
a relative :--

Ithought of Gray and Eton College. Though care not for

plants changed, like their owner -- Ballitore empty. ' Within

   saw it. The fox cover is full of lovely fungi, and one, the

Were you here you would be oppressed with the immen

sity as well as with the vanity of human things. Surely, after

our lives being spent in the pursuit of knowledge of all kinds --
What is it all ? Empty possession. But this is foolish. How
ever, it is a natural thought, and obvious to me, in the midst of

countless books and plants, many of them covered thick with
Ithe dust of years. But am not frightened or discouraged, and
I Iwhy ?

to pursue as an amusement. While in the world we cannot

Iit. Dr. H. and have been sorting lote of ferns for the last

week, and only got them into a rough state this day. We are

Inow busy selecting collections from them, one of which shall

bring home with me. Dr. H. has given me a copy of his
" Icones Filicum," in folio, with 240 plates, a charming work.

It was quite as unexpected as it is a Valuable gift. The cost

is 151. The expense hitherto prevented my buying it.
I have got 140 species of Peruvian plants from Matthew
I--many rare things among them.
                                        have also subscribed to a

man going to Columbia, a country hitherto very little known,
and producing many extraordinary things. A new Irish plant

has been discovered, a scirpus (8. Savii). We must try and

find it in the Andromeda or Parnassia bog. It is a shame to

Irish botanists that it had to go to Switzerland for a name.
It has been in Dr. H.'s herbarium nearly twenty years, where
it was overlooked and forgotten --an instance that the human
Imind cannot be stretched beyond a certain tension.

   1 Mr. Fennell settled on his property, and farming became his occupation,
but exposure to cold produced disease of the lungs, which made steady though
lingering progress, and his death preceded that of Dr. Harvey by about

seven years.

           CHAPTER III.

           VOYAGE, AND SIX MONTHS AT CAPE TOWN.

The Carnatic sailed from Portsmouth on the 12th of July, and

entered Table Bay on the 17th of September. The following

extracts, taken from a journal kept by Mr. Harvey during the

voyage, and addressed to his sister, may be interesting to the

reader as characteristic of his mind during this period.

   July 23rd. After breakfast   we were  amused   with    the first

windward.  what sailors say be true, this ought to betoken a

change of wind, for they are said to come from the direction in

which the wind is about to spring up. Mother Carey's chickens

(Procellaria pelagica) were flying about us many times to-day,

Iand we have seen them on two or three days before, though

August 1st. Lat. 24° 18' N., long. 21° 8' W. This day is

notable, not only as being that whereon a monarch formerly

was wont to chastise his helpmate, but is distinguished in my

history by entering for the first time the torrid zone. A few

Idays ago spoke of a swallow ; to-day a poor wanderer, the same
I presume, kept flying round the ship, but it proved to be a

martin. He entered the cuddy many times. Poor fellow !

Where can he find flies ? It was proposed that the ladies should

employ themselves collecting cockroaches, and stringing them

on threads for suspension in the shrouds, to serve as a substitute

for winged things to our swallow.

fourth week of our captivity. To-day we had service on the

quarter-deck, under the awning, to much satisfaction. Mr.

tection from low spirits, far superior to Cowper's "winding

wonderfully deficient) may have afforded him a more intense,

though not so constant an enjoyment. Botany is useful, because

you have always plenty of novelty to turn to, always some
thing to do, either in the arrangement, dissection, determina

tion, or description of your plants. And if you have not, the

mere admiration of those delicate works of the Creator always

 affords me great pleasure.

    For the rest, you may abuse this luxury as you do many
 another, and the natural bent of the human mind is perhaps fully

 as much to abuse as to use its blessings ; but are we therefore to

but like many other pleasant hours, it leaves scanty points for
the journalist. To the sailors it is also a merry, time. This

evening they had a dance, affording abundant amusement to

   August 4th. The sailors caught a bonita ; and saw two black

gulls winging their solitary way across our bows, happy, doubt
less, in having any companionship in such a waste of waters.

The bonita, which is cousin to the porpoise, is a very pretty
fish, of an elegant spindle form and brilliant blue painting.

smile all round the empty room, then cross his hands with a

look of imbecility. Again he would look up and spread his mouth

into a wide but soundless laugh, apparently in enjoyment too

deep to be controlled, and forced thus to vent itself; then take

a sip, rub his nose, settle his spectacles, look up, look down,

Iand all about, and then laugh, laugh with a truly beautiful

expression. Long stood regarding the pleasing prospect. No

experience of one formerly, and to-day hath it been ours. The

world abroad presented a melancholy picture ; a failing breeze,

a falling shower, and a dark, dull, heavy sky, with a close, warm,

thick air. Now you feel our situation. At dinner, however,

the acme of distress was felt.

    Can you fancy a more comfortable predicament to be in ?
You never saw rain ; no, never. You may have seen and felt
a shower, a dropping from the sky ; but to pour in full fury as
a tropic waterpot, you know nothing of it. First came dense
myriads of large drops as thick as they could be sieved out ;

then between these came down another set, so rapidly yet so
distinctly, that they catch the former, and burst upon them, so

as to make a spray. Then you have pouring rain and mist
together. Thick work this. But our knowing ones make light
of this heavy affair. " Wait a while," say they ; " this is but a
poor sample of what happens in the solstitial latitudes." " Oh,"

mourn the buried breeze. " We ought to see a shark to-day,"

said some    one. "Yes," replied Evans, "there was         "onAe  haunting

over the stern to watch the motions of our destined prey.

Ladies and gentlemen, children and grandsires, all with a

common eagerness bent their 'eyes on the monster. He fol

lowed close upon our heels, attended as usual by about half-a-

dozen pilot-fish, the prettiest little things you ever saw, about

six incles long, and beautifully barred with bright blue and

black ; no mackerel was ever more beautifully dressed. These

benevolent little fishes swam close before the monster's nose,

ready to inform him of any prey which might be in view, for,

from the position of his eyes, he cannot see objects floating on

the water. First we flung him out a roll of brown paper ; the

pilots darted at smelled, and let float by. Next a nice

gave more favourable account of this savoury morsel, for

in pulling, so after flounder or two the brute left us. But

we were      no means tired of him, nor was his faith in us much

broken, for he followed on, and we determined to follow up.

Again the line was thrown with more dexterity, and the bait

opposite his nose, our boatswain slackened fast, and let it run

temptingly to the mouth. A snap, a swallow, and the hook stuck

fast in his jaw, followed by a shout of exultation from all the

hunters. After playing him awhile, he was brought close

under the stern, when a stronger line with a noose was let down

and slipped over his body. It caught him " in medias res,"

and he was hauled out of the water, and exposed dangling in

mid air to the admiring spectators. Of Miss G. it may be said,

terror as much as pity at this moment seized her, for he swung

backwards and forwards opposite her cabin window, every moment

threatening to swing in holus-bolus. And what a mess that

would have been in a lady's room ! But fears were idle, pity vain.

Another noose was fastened to his tail, and thus entrapped, he
was dragged along through the water, " now no more his home,"

to the bows, where he was hoisted, till he reached the forecastle.

Thither we all went. Having been duly displayed, and his

eyes damned by the sailors in quaint terms, the butcher

      proceed now to open his stomach, for it is always a matter

of curiosity to know what delicate fare has lately occupied such

a palate ; and surely this wont disgust you. What do you

think we found ? Nothing but the intestines of a sheep that

had been heaved overboard this morning, and the cook's apron,

which he had lost two days ago. Truly we laughed when this

add that he was fried and eaten. Some declared that it was

will tell you it is lucky to catch a shark, for it will bring you a

a shark when becalmed, say I.

to avoid such foolishness. For my part oftentimes an intense

desire for land comes over me, it may be at mid-day or at the

dead of night, and then an inexpressible impatience pours down

again. After this who would touch him ? He got a reprieve,

and was sent to an empty hencoop, where he yet lies, and bids

morning. It was such as to put me in mind of a fine calm

Sunday in the heart of the country, and the people going

to mass, with their red cloaks and white caps, and greeting

each other with, " A blessed morning, the Lord be praised."

Such an atmosphere ; a blue sky and bright sun, has always an

excessively pleasant effect on my spirits. It gives me a feeling

of extreme happiness, and a portion of love to all persons and

things. There is likewise a sense of praise and gratitude

entirely unpremeditated which can scarcely help forcing itself on
the mind. Different persons will be affected thus by different

Istates of the atmosphere. Mine is the morning air, calm with

bright sun ; others prefer evening and a rich sunset ; and suppose

others expand at noon. Now my lady-patroness might make a

simile about flowers, that open at different hours, much to the

purpose. The Pimpernel, the Sunflower, the Evening-primrose,
I place the Pimpernel, for want of a better, as a flower for sunny

distance, than the host of oddities, grinning like baboons and
jabbering like monkeys, jumped down upon us, and voraciously
grabbed our luggage. In an instant all our trunks and

packages were at their mercy. The ladies looked affrighted ;

Imost striking objects were the Proteas, of which gathered
Iseveral. Moreover passed through fields of our large Briza

as red geraniums and Ixias, in variety of all colours and sizes.
 Orchidese of preposterous forms, and Umbdliferse ; but such
oddities ! Fancy a star of leaves spread quite flat on the ground,

with four or five sessile flowers stuck in the centre. Polygalas

Ivarious and beautiful, and Lobelias very pretty. Every blade of

grass in fact had something peculiar. But fixed on the Roetta

as the plant you would most like. It has a stem some four

inches high, glandular, and numerous glandular, hairy, oblong

leaves. A large single flower, white as the purest snow, sits on

a slender stalk, and in the sunshine spreads into a cup-shaped
corolla. Six graceful styles, of singular length. Now it struck

me as utterly simple, graceful, and pure. The view from the hill
was very beautiful. The bay in the foreground, bounded by noble

mountains, and the town beneath my feet, white and regularly

built. A very fine panoramic view of the capital of the colony

Iand its environs. On my return found our party at breakfast,

and exhibited my spoils, to their great diversion.

After breakfast William proceeded to Baron Ludwig's, with
                                    Sir William
his letters   of introduction from  a ^little fairy   Hooker.   "The

South Africa, not forgetting such exotics as he can get from his

Iforms. You may judge of the ardour with which the Baron

pursues his favourite science, when tell you that he has brought

4000 loads of soil, and removed 2000 of stones to and from his

garden. The grounds are handsomely laid out, and walled in

as well as a suburban villa near your Babylon. He has also

glass for the tropicals. You would be charmed with the sight

of Tillandsia growing on the trees in the open air. Now the

Iwith great pleasure, and always feel grateful to you for taking

whether Table Mountain itself with all its treasures gives more

genuine or purer mental pleasure."

William's constant habit of analysing his feelings and can

didly disclosing them is always apparent in the letters to his

Iintimate friends. September 22nd he writes to a cousin :--
   " You will be glad to hear that am likely to make many

discoveries. The present pleasure is to me far more attractive

Ithan the after fame. There is a purity about it that renders
it more excusable to the conscience.          mean to say that the

pleasure arising from the contemplation of beauty in the works

of God is less destructive to religious feeling than that which

springs from the after-celebrity obtained by the discovery. Both

pleasures, though in degree allowable, have their dangers ; we

are so prone to make idols of our blessings.

but as usual, it ends in further aggressions on our part. We

life. When will this cease ? Never, till we interpose a wall

Iof kindness and brotherly love between us and the poor natives.

No other wall will protect us or them, and such a wall fully

Ibelieve might be established if our rulers were willing to show

full, impartial justice. fear however the old system, modified,
perhaps, will still go on, and while it does the frontier must

be insecure.

   So far William's bright anticipations had been fully realised,
but a dark cloud soon spread over his prospects. His brother's
health, which on the voyage had been somewhat affected
by the tropical climate, quickly gave way on land. He was
prostrated by a fever of such a character as to leave him
totally unfitted for his official duties, and the physicians recom
mended, as the best means of his complete recovery, an im
mediate return to his native climate. Leave of absence was
granted ; but not until late in the spring of the following year
could the needful arrangements be completed, or sufficient room
be obtained in a homeward-bound vessel for the invalid and his
family. William, though having in prospect a transfer of the
appointment, the duties of which he had fulfilled almost from
the time of their arrival, did not hesitate to return with his
brother. The latter appeared at first to gain benefit from the
sea air, but no sooner did they reach the warm latitudes than
the disease returned, and he sank beneath its force some long

weeks ere they reached England.
   William's patient acquiescence in this disappointing turn of

events, his steadfast reliance on the constant exercise of the
Divine arm, and the pleasure he found under all circumstances
in the works of Nature, can be in some measure understood

from the following letters :--

                                                                                 Stellenberg, December 14.

go to Table Mountain, arching over the mountain rills in

inimitable gracefulness, with the airiest branches, and the most

delicate fresh green pinnate leaves. It is really an object to
stand and look at, till your eyes overflow with that mixed feeling

of gratitude and love that the sight of an exquisite production

of  nature inspires. Then the Todea Africana is  perfectly noble.
    occupies the same systematic place with us   as to structure,
It

though different in habit, that the Osmunda does with you.

Splendid pinnatifido pinnate lanceolate fronds, six to ten feet

high, standing in circles from shaggy bases of a firm shiny

texture. Are they not lovely ? Adiantum very common on the

hills, in shady, moist places, and exquisitely beautiful. Even

our humble plants, such as rushes, are noble-looking. Take for
instances a Juncus, which Thunberg has named /. serratus, but
Iwhich ought to be J. palmetta, for it is not only like a miniature
palm, but is called palm by the common people.      must

try to put it before you. First get into the midst of a black
bog full of cobras and puff adders. This is its habitat -- but who

would think of snakes when there is a grove of rushes in sight ?

From the ground rises a black and rough trunk, as thick as the

leg of a lusty son of Adam, three to six feet in height. From

the summit of this springs a crown of large broad leaves, like

that of a pine-apple on an immense scale, and from the centre of

these rises a panicle of flowers excessively branched, and very

graceful, some three or four feet high, perhaps more. Alto

gether it is a noble plant.

    IWhat next? Lobelias in profusion, blue and yellow, which
are very puzzling and variable in character.     have a new one,

Iabout an inch high, with white flowers not much larger than a
pin's head, and very like those of Montia fontana.  call it

Lobelia montioides. The ground begins to be carpeted with

Ligldfootia, a beautiful little under shrub, with blue starry flowers.

It is nearly related to Campanula. What ! Shrubby campanula?

Yes. Almost everything here is shrubby. Nearly all the

ICompositse, for instance. We have tree-like groundsels.
      need not say anything of heaths and geraniums, for these

you have by heart already, except that the bulbous geraniums

plague me greatly. Authors appear to have mischievously

multiplied them without any regard to character. Many of the
dull-flowered are deliriously scented, like; the night-blowing

stock, and we often bring them in for their evening perfume.
The bulbs were very gay when we landed, but are now nearly all

out of flower.

The articulated cactus-looking plant mentioned in my first

Iletter is a favourite hedge with washerwomen to dry clothes

on. find it is a Cactus with a yellow flower, an exotic of

course, the cacti being all American. It is now in blow along

the road-sides. The Mexican Aloe or Agave is also a common

hedge plant, and very striking with its magnificent panicles of

flowers. A favourite tree in the gardens here is the Nerium,

or Oleander, which grows to the height of thirty or forty

Ifeet.
      have written to H. a full account of our villa. Only think

of our having a grove of pomegranates to shade the sink in the

Iback yard! They are now 'quite showy with their bright

scarlet blossoms. Apropos, have eaten plantains, and think

them but mawkish indifferent stuff, but they are worth culti

vating, were it only to look at, for they are very picturesque.

  I have taken a walk to the flats, and got sundry novelties.
IAmong them are two new Orchidese, and a pretty little bulb had

not before seen, by name Gethyllis spiralis. It somewhat re

sembles a white autumnal crocus, and flowers without leaves.

I had also the pleasure of finding for myself a nondescript
Watsonia, which Sir J. Herschel had sent me from another

Istation a few days ago.                       was amused
   While walking about in a low marshy place,

by watching a large secretary bird, stalking about, soberly and

gracefully, within a few yards of me ; but he would not allow
I Ime to approach near.
                     need not say in what neighbourhood

was, as you doubtless know that his food is snakes. He was at
I Iluncheon.
                am now so used to these reptiles that never

think of them except when they cross my path, which is but

Iseldom. Tortoises and lizards are very common, while snails
are great rarities.  have as yet seen but two species, and of

fhese only about half-a-dozen individuals. The garden is alive
with frogs, which regale us every night with their hateful,

Iwearisome chuckle, thoroughly discordant.

      have just received a parcel of North American plants from

IProfessor Torrey of New York, many of them both interesting
and pretty.     heard yesterday from Hooker of poor Drum

I Ihave abundant reason to bless the day that set sail,

and to be thankful to the Almighty for having so overruled

my wishes to the general good of the party. To feel myself of

no use in the world to any one was often a sore thorn in my

side. So now, to be useful, has all the charm of novelty. To
you, who have been so all your life, taking it up gradually and

imperceptibly, it must seem absurd to have any feeling about

so common a matter. But just fancy a person living (I regret

to say) to the age of four and twenty, dreaming about poetry

and plants, suddenly and quite unexpectedly forced by distress

Iing circumstances to act as the head of a family. You cannot

wonder that feel the responsibility. To preserve equanimity

and cheerfulness ought to be my object ; and how can these be

better maintained than by cherishing the belief that Providence,

for his own merciful purposes, has for the present cast my lot

here, and by being grateful to him for ordering designs which

had originated in purely selfish motives, so as to contribute to
I Ithe welfare of others.
Ifeel that none is due.  take no praise to myself, for fully

                         came here to gratify my own schemes.
IGod sent me for a far different purpose.
                                           acknowledge his

goodness, and desire to be thankful for being allowed a subor

dinate place in his merciful Providence. You may say, " Wil

Iliam has been reading M. Guion, has turned Quietist on our

hands." No. What write has not been learned from her,

but by sitting at Joseph's bedside.

    I have but a dull picture to send you of ourselves. We

have now fully determined on returning in the spring, as there
seems no chance whatever of J.'s recovery here. You would
wonder how poor E. keeps up as she does ; but do we not see
the back of even the weakest fitted to the burden ? We are
indeed surrounded by great mercies, and the more the hand of
affliction is on us the stronger they appear. Truly,

IThe officials have all been most kind, as well as the governor,
with whom       sat half an hour yesterday. He is a nice old

gentleman, friendly and kind, without any state about him, and

possessing all the best qualities of excellency, without either
Istiffness or pride. This brings me to the first levee attended,
Ibut of this shall not at present speak.

                                     regret to say that, being down
Iat a place called Muyrenberg, on False Bay, imprudently

exposed myself to the joint effects of sunshine and salt water,

which brought on an attack of erysipelas on both legs and

Iarms, that has given me no small pain, and what is worse, has

confined me to the house. This is very sad, for am burning

with impatience to make some excursions, and the weather is de

I I Ilightful. But am not quite idle ; for as cannot go out, amuse

myself   with making anatomical      dissections of seaweeds, with

silvery white strand, and bold rooky capes. Here grows Hemi-

dried fragment gives no idea of a trunk ten feet high, crowned

by a tuft of tripinuate fronds, measuring from four to six feet.

                             CHAPTER IV.

                      SECOND RESIDENCE AT CAPE TOWN.

The death of Mr. J. Harvey took place on the twenty-sixth of

April, and in June the melancholy group reached England.
The Cape appointment being readily obtained, William, after
spending a few weeks in the home circle of his relatives, returned
to a lonely residence in Africa, led back, as he has himself said,
by duty rather than pleasure, the charm of novelty, and the high
hopes which had gilded his first voyage having passed away.

   He writes on board --

                                                               Ship Wellington, August 19th, 1836.

       " Once more upon the waters "-- even so. We have been now
a week at sea, and the time has glided by without much trouble.
We have literally had nought but gentle breezes, pushing, for
they are too gentle to call them blowing, us along. Biscay has

Ibeen like a millpond. We hope to see Madeira on Tuesday

next. What a state of suspense am in about Tristan Da
Cunha. Only think, Captain Liddel has been there four times,
and is quite fond of going there when it falls in his way, so we
have a fair chance of seeing it. The last time Captain Liddel
was there, in 1835, he allowed all the passengers to take a run

on shore.1

   Apropos of Tristan Da Cunha, Captain L. draws very nicely.
He showed me to-day his last year's log-book, in almost every

to him from its tree ferns.

page of which was some little sketch, with something written
underneath in very good taste. For instance, there was a sketch

of the Land's End, then of Madeira, Teneriffe, &c., likewise a
beautiful little drawing of Tristan itself, as well as sketches of
almost every ship he had spoken, waterspouts, albatross hunts, &c,

in fact, of everything remarkable that occurred. It must be

delightful to himself to look back on all these log-books, and to
recall the scenes in their original vividness. How much better
than many an album. He has now eleven such volumes, and

Iis working at the twelfth. He is a very amiable and good man.
  particularly like the terms he is on with his officers, and the

way he treats his midshipmen, of which there are five or six
on board. You know in general they are treated scarcely

different from common sailors ; but not so in the Wellington.

They are regularly invited in turn to dine in the cuddy, and the
Captain always makes it a point to take wine with them, and to

help them to such delicacies as they do not meet every day.
These little attentions show what the man is made of.

   The two cases from Loddiges' in superb vigour --fresh green

leaves and new shoots most luxuriant. So much for Ward's

Imethod.

   Ah, that were less idle --that " my mind to me a kingdom

were." How little worth are one's thoughts without settled
Ioccupation ! One cannot muse at all times ; but do look for
Iward very seriously to the future, and (as yet) think have
Imade a right decision.  do not return with my former buoy
Iancy, it is true ; feel sobered, and in sobriety have made the

I Ielection. How it will end depends on higher counsels than
mine, and thus am disposed to leave it.     intend to do my

best. There are things beyond our control.

       My feelings on this my second voyage are very different
indeed from the joyous excitement that accompanied my first,

Iyet am not cast down. The inducements to persevere in the
I Iline of life have chosen, are, trust, sufficient to make me go

Cape politics are stale, dry, and unprofitable. The Caffres

are our only disturbers of repose, and without disturbers how

can we have politics ? It is true, as you have read, that our

government recommended the seat of government to be trans

ferred four or five hundred miles up the country ; but the

people at home declined compliance, to the universal satis

faction of every one, save the botanical member of council,

Iwho feasted in anticipation of the wondrous treasures of
Uitenhage.  believe the only thing Lord Crlenelg has done

to please the people here, is this refusal to remove the seat of

government. It would be the ruin of Cape Town and of the

bulk of the public servants who have property here. But we

should then get excellent fresh butter and eggs, things not so

plenty at this end of the world, and what would not one

sacrifice for them ! By the way, the next time you want cows,

come here for them. We can give you a drove for the price

you give for one. They sometimes fetch fifteen shillings a

head instead of pounds. Yet milk and butter are egregiously dear.

The latter never under eighteen pence per pound, and often (as
now) three shillings, scarcely even to be had at that price, and of
very bad quality. There must be sad mismanagement on the part

of farmers. The Dutch farmers generally, are doggedly attached
to their old customs -- thorough Tories in improvements, and

slovenly to boot. Witness Cape wool, which by the last London

prices brought three pence or four pence per pound, while its

sister, Australia, was up nearly as many shillings. Alas ! that

so it should be. Then the cochineal insect, which is so valuable,

abounds in profusion around Cape Town. Millions are yearly

Iborn and die, and no one gathers them. Why do not lift up
Imy voice, as honest old Manse,1 and testify ? Alas for me,

stand forward and dare public talk. My benevolence is purely

of bramble and underwood, the only way of getting out of which

was by crawling on my hands and knees along the stony bed of

Ia mountain rivulet, and in some places only a height of two feet

penetrable. In all places had to pioneer and break my way,

for about a hundred yards, but that was sufficient to fill me

got many of his beautiful mosses, and  had therefore the

greater pleasure in picking the Hookeria laricina, which he

had discovered in this very spot. It is a lovely moss, and a

I Ihave only lately purchased Shakespeare, having existed up to

allied to Crassula, and truly lovely ; an umbel of white and

carmine flowers (inside white, outside carmine) somewhat the
shape of stonecrop, but much larger. You know all the parts

of the flower ought to be seven (whence the name) ; but there
are few things in the world just as they ought to be, and so this

flower varies in six, eight, or nine segments.

The Hesperanthse, not seen by me last year, sober, quaker-like

so delicate as our own dear Hesperis, or as the evening Pelargonia,

that the Cape twilight so plentifully rejoices in. But the Dutch

Ihear that my slumbers are breaking.

       am about preparing a small octavo book, called " Genera

of South African Plants." It contains descriptions of all Cape
Genera, in as simple language as possible, with remarks on

their habit, places of growth, and probable number of species,
&c, arranged after the natural method, but like Mackay's
" Flora," having a table of the Linnean prefixed, as well as a

brief introduction to botany explaining the more common

terms. This is intended to be sent to resident doctors, clergy
men, &c., scattered about the country, to excite their idle minds
to send specimens into Cape Town, and to cultivate a taste for
botany generally in the colony.

Let me describe my study. It looks out on a garden just now

full of weeds. There is a trellis-work outside that obstructs the
strong sunlight, the shadow coming from vines which are in
summer luxuriance. At a little distance is a green railing,
my boundary, and through and above the bars at a considerable

cemented to suit my fancy. So much for outwards. Inwards,

lore, with a very slight mixture of other varieties ; and behind

   December 5th. No Table Mountain for this week ; even my
energy cannot think of a walk of twenty miles, with the thermo

plants there now that especially want to gather; but these things

I Ihave now to thank you for a letter have just received

from Griffith, who seems to be fast amassing an enormous collec

tion, and who offers most liberally to forward my views to the

Iextent of his power, in Indian botany. Such a correspondent

specially wanted, one who could give me Indian plants, and who

cared to take in return those of the Cape. Where there is a mutual

Iinterchange of desirables we shall probably get on pleasantly, and
both our herbariums be benefited.  have just written to him :
his letter is dated " River Hooghly," and he was then on his way

to Assam, via the Khasia hills. From Assam he was to go to

Bootan, in the Himalaya country, and thence to Thibet. A glori

ous field of observation to a person animated by his spirit, and

Iwith so accurate an eye as his has proved to be. He promises

to send me his first parcel on his return, which suppose cannot

be till far on in the next year, but he gives me no clue as to

when his journey would terminate.

    IYou will be glad to hear that have found a very pleasant

botanical friend in a Mr. Bunbury, who has come out with

General Napier on a pleasure tour. It is quite refreshing to

meet a real botanist after so long a fast. We were up Table

summit is very frequently enveloped in mist, especially at the
season when the Disa blossoms. But it is very cold also, and
the mist comes accompanied with a strong cold south-east wind.
After this succeeds the scorching sun of lat. 33. So much for

general circumstances : the particular ones are, that the plant only

grows along the steep, boggy, spongy margins of a stream which has
water in it at all seasons, but which in winter must be so swollen

as to cover the plant. Here, the margin is 'completely clothed
with the Disa to the exclusion of other plants. But imme
diately beyond the Disa is a margin of Restias, which growing
taller than the Disa, and bending over the stream, afford con

siderable shade to the roots and leaves, at the same time that

they leave the flower-stalks room to peep out at the sun and

Iexhibit their large blossoms. All these, except the cold wind,

can be easily managed in a case, and should hope that our
plant would have the good taste to forgive us that part. The
shade, moist atmosphere, and soil, seem the chief things to

provide.

   Writing to Mrs. Leadbeater, he refers to the death of a favourite
nephew, who had been carried off by malignant fever in the
autumn of the previous year :--

    " The death of poor James was indeed one of the most trying

Ibereavements that has ever visited our family. The more
Ithink of it the more feel it to be one on which many others

may hang. It is a nipping of the main sprout of the tree, and

who will say that there is vigour to supply that which is taken ?
He was indeed but young -- a boy ; but one of such promise, and
just verging on manhood ; and to his loss was added the sudden
ness of the stroke by which such almost realized hopes were

blighted."

    IThe trustees of the British Museum have recently written

to our Government, and believe to those of other colonies,

begging circulars, for specimens of Natural History --plants as well
as other things. From whom does this emanate ? or are the plants
wanted to feed vermin in the Museum cellars ? If, however,

Ithorough reform in that Institution, it would be foolish to waste

specimens on it. hope when they do go about it they will form
a Geographical Herbarium. Such a one in the British Museum,
where there is ample space and funds, would be invaluable. Any
one, then, wishing to travel in any particular country, might at his
ease consult the plants of that country without wading among
the endless cabinets he should otherwise be obliged to ferret

through. I have a favourite day dream of having such a herbarium

under my management, and of living the life of a bookish old
bachelor within those venerable walls.

return in six or eight months with flying colours.         hope he

may, for he has been made a victim. And why ? Because he
does not think the natives are "irreclaimable savages," and

recommends the discontinuance of fire and slaughter. Nay,

acknowledges their rights of property, &c. Even in Cape Town

he is far from popular. It is considered rather showing the

that entailed a vast amount of labour, which, added to his hours

of duty at the Treasury, could only be accomplished by close

application ; fatiguing walks of miles in search of plants being his
only relaxation. He worked on, however, under failing health,

hoping when his task was finished that he should be able to

enjoy the refreshment of a trip for a few weeks to the interior,

but the pressure of business was such at the time, owing to the

political state of the colony, that he was obliged to forego the

indulgence. The arrival of Captain Stockenstrom at Cape Town
just then occasioned much excitement, and Mr. Harvey warmly

entered into his cause. Soon after this event he was obliged to

succumb to illness and seek leave of absence for a voyage home,

which soon effected a favourable change. He landed in England

thin and worn, and his energy and spirits much prostrated, but

his native air and the presence of the loved home circle soon re

stored him to his usual health.

Mr. Backhouse, whose visit to Cape Town afforded Mr. Harvey

much gratification.

                  LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

On landing in England, Mr. Harvey, before crossing to Ireland,

proceeded to Torquay, for the pleasure of becoming personally

acquainted with his valued friend Mrs. Griffiths, with whom he

had familiarly corresponded for so many years.         He gives     the
following account of this visit in a letter to one of  his cousins
                                                                    :--

                                     Cork, July 17th, 1839.

Enclosed are seeds of Vicia sylvatwa, and of a pretty white

cistus, both from Torquay ; also of Matthiola,] which grows on the

northern shore of Devon. The Vicia was in superlative flower

upon a cliff, at an exquisite little cove to which the Misses G     .

introduced me. We had many pleasant walks over the hills and

by the sea-cliffs and coves. The distant prospects of sea and

Icountry are pretty ; but, on the whole, Torquay is not that gem

of beauty which had pictured it. It is too much built --too

fashionable. Babbicombe is really a charming little nook, but

it begins to have too many houses, and is on the road to become

vulgar.    Ivery much like what expected, only in better

  I lately had a long letter from Dr. Griffith, giving an interest

ing account of his proceedings in the western parts of India.

His collections in various quarters have been most extensive ;

Ibut he had left the bulk of them in " deplorable confusion " at

Calcutta; and suppose years will elapse before he is able to

set them to rights. Meanwhile his field-labours are rapidly

extending. He seems a person of indomitable energy, and

appears to bear the climate admirably. He will do great things

yet, as he makes notes and drawings of all he meets with.

IMenzies when you see him.

method of growing plants. It is provoking to have it so often

misunderstood.

I take advantage of the new postage to enclose you speci
mens of an extremely beautiful plant. It is one of a collection
Iwhich lately received from Hooker to name and to take dupli
I Icates from.
                shall tell him that have sent this to you, so
Iyou will please consider it from him, for merely take liberties

with his property. You will please appropriate one-half, and

Ihand the other over to our venerable friend Mr. Menzies. But

first should be glad you would show it to Robert Brown, and
ask him is it not the same he formerly showed me in his col
Ilection ; also whether he has named it anywhere ; and if not,

to show cause why should not dedicate it to my friend Miss

Ball, a most zealous and successful Irish algologist, and who

would rival Miss Hutchins had she equal opportunities. You
will see it has the substance and fruit of Sphacelaria, but the

be in other plants, you know that in the Algae it is usually

considered of first-rate value. Alas, that it should be so

fugacious ! for some of the specimens, as you will perceive, have

faded into a dirty green, from which it passes to white. In its

green state it might be taken for a Sphacelaria, and indeed closely

Iresembles S. Callitriche of Agardh, from the Falkland Isles, so

much so that almost fancy Agardh had a faded plant ; but of

this there is no proof. However, there can be no question

that if Agardh had a specimen in its red or original state, he

  It is amusing to witness the many freaks in which the Albert

mania continues to exhibit itself in the shops. Albert every

thing, from hats to shoe ties ; nothing too small or too large to

be under his patronage. Another thing which strikes me is
the increase of Greek names for shows. For instance, Picture

IGalleries are now Pinacothecse, which of course is a great im
provement.  forget the name, but it is equally difficult to the

mouth, for the patent machine for hatching eggs, where, as saith
the advertisement, " countless living creatures, from the wren

to the eagle, are ushered into life by artificial aid," &c. You

gaze on a large tray of eggs, in the last stage of incubation, and,

as the fortunate moment arises for the young being to make its
debut on the theatre of life, behold ! a crack, a chirp, a leg, a

Ihead, and finally the body of a living chicken ! Dear, but 'tis

a strange world ! When see the animal magnetism, which I

Ion wKat to expend his sixpence. Well, let us take things as
they turn up without consideration.  have just come from a

moonlight stroll to the Colosseum, down the Corso, through the

Via del Foro ; then by the base of the Capitoline Hill, through

the Forum Romanum, under the Arch of Titus ; walking on the

Via Sacra, passing the Caesars' Palace and the Temple of Peace,

and so coming at last to the Gladiators' Bloody Circus. The

night was everything that one could wish, perfectly still --the

moon nearly full and dazzlingly bright, the sky Roman, and

the city silent as the desert. Just as we passed the Forum, an

owl on the Temple of Peace began hooting to another perched

amid the  confused piles of ruins, where the Caesars' Palace stood,
          him made answer meet." How fortunate ! enough to
" who to

make us compose, had we the romance of our young days !

There were no other sounds. Rome at night is perfectly still,

and the streets nearly empty, save of tourists. The Colosseum

has far surpassed all my preconceived notions--its vastness, and

the perfect beauty of its present ruined state, combined with the

recollection of its former grandeur, render it most imposing.

About half the outer walls, which are of cut stone of a reddish

brown colour, has been carted away to build palaces and

churches ; but what remains is wonderfully perfect and fresh,

and the dismantled part is now so beautifully clothed with

shrubs, mosses, and flowers, that it perhaps adds to the beauty

of the whole. The late popes have taken much care to preserve

what remains by building buttresses and repairing broken

arches. This has been done without at all disfiguring the

building; these modern props being of the same stone and

architecture as the ancient. And what be the shrubs and kinds
of flowers that act the part of the robins in the " Babes in the

IWood," &c. ?--shining-leaved laurustinus, ivy, cypress, acanthus

(looking more beautiful than ever saw it ; it makes a glorious

old-wall plant), wallflower, a beautiful purple anemone, and a

Igreat variety of smaller plants, many unknown to me. But

have omitted one of which there is great abundance under the

arches -- Adianhim-cap-veneris, which makes a most lovely

drapery. With such softening as these plants give to the

decayed walls, the unsightliness of the ruin completely vanishes,

and one heartily subscribes to Byron's expression, "ruinous

perfection." The more you see of the more you are struck

 with its vastness. Even at a first glance there is nothing to

Idisappoint you in this way, which is by no means the case with

many other large buildings. One thing about it was not
 prepared for-- to find that it is dedicated as a Christian church,
and that a large cross stands in the centre, where Nero's
statue stood. What a contrast ! Were this all, it would be

well, and we Christians would certainly have no right to
complain that the arena of blood was converted into one of
prayer, but the circus is defaced with fourteen little altars,
over which are ill-done paintings, representing passages in our
Saviour's life, and on the walls is stuck up an inscription,

that a year and forty days' indulgence may be obtained by

Ikissing the holy cross -- cheap terms, truly ! Similar signboards

are so common here, that should not think this worth mention

Iing but for the place where it is stuck up. Almost every church

has something of the kind. N.B. don't think the Roman
Church a bit altered in these respects with the times. However
she may appear to you in Ireland, here she is just the same old
lady as ever she was. Well, no matter. What next ? St. Peter's ;
a church or temple, which has vastly surpassed my notions,

Ithough have not perfectly seen it as yet, not having been in the
Idome. You know am prejudiced against the Grecian archi
Itecture in Christian churches, and even after seeing St. Peter's,

   still think there is nothing so suited to our religion as the
Gothic, whose very irregularities are an advantage. But St.
Peter's is so vast and stately, so richly adorned with marbles
and statues, with gilded roof and mosaic floor, and yet the
whole so nobly chaste, that it insensibly wins upon the mind
and compels it into feeling the sanctity of the place. Many of
the Italian churches are so overloaded with ornament, that you
are as much disgusted as with a vulgar Lady Mayoress
dressed in the pink of the fashion and full flounces. But this

is not the case here. It is so large that there is room for an

almost unlimited set of statues, and accordingly there are
countless marble monuments of popes and such like, besides
the statues of the apostles and saints, with great abundance of
little angels, &c. There is not much painting save around the
roof, at a considerable elevation. This is quite an advantage,

for most churches here are a great deal too much painted.
Then the immense length and height of the aisles, the breadth

Among the monuments one which you would have looked on

with much interest--that of the last of the Stuarts. It records

the names of James the Third and of Charles Edward, and the late

Cardinal of York, the last of the ill-fated line. Opposite the

tomb of the queen of James the Second. To-day we were eight

hours in and about St. Peter's, having gone early this morning

to hear mass in the Pope's chapel, see the procession of the host,

and afterwards see the Pope wash the feet of thirteen pilgrims,

and then wait on them at table. Of course there was terrible

about twelve inches high, and in the centre figure of the

we got into an Armenian church at the commencement of

service, which, to judge by the crowds of strangers that followed

us in, was one of the sights of the day. The service was

chanted in Armenian by about ten priests, dressed in very

showy vestments of divers colours--to wit : green, rose colour,

crimson and yellow, according to their rank, with sashes of

gold, and blazonry thereon. They wear beards. The bishop

was a remarkably fine-looking old man, with a long white beard

and superb vestment, and got through his business in a very

stately manner. 'Tis strange that what we saw should be called
Christian, and founded on the New Testament. To be sure we

did not understand a word of what was saying, and that makes

a serious difference; but the ceremonies and clothing were

very unlike our ideas of the simplicity of Christianity, though

not more so than in the Roman Church, with which the

Armenian holds communion. This morning we went to see a

Jew and a Turk baptized, which is one of the annual sights of

Easter. Unfortunately there was little appearance of convince-
ment. At this time no Turk could be found, but we saw a
Jewess made a Christian of-- whether hired for the purpose or

not, cannot say : a vast deal of mummery about it and a great

of St. John in the Lateran. This tomb is in a large circular
room, placed under a chapel, and dimly lighted by a grating in
the roof, which is the floor of the chapel. The sarcophagi of
the family stand round, and near the middle of the apartment

is this exquisite group in marble. It is shown by the light of a

   Easter Sunday evening. This morning early we sallied forth
to St. Peter's to see High Mass performed by the Pope in person,
and to see him give the pontifical blessing. At the upper end
of the church a throne was prepared under a fine canopy of
crimson velvet and gold trappings, and raised on seven steps
covered with rich carpet. This was in the centre, immediately
under the eastern window, which contains a transparent
image of the Holy Ghost and Glories. On either side were
benches for the cardinals and bishops, and at the right hand,
near the altar, below the cardinals' benches was another throne,

smaller than the preceding, and with fewer steps. The area
was enclosed by gentlemen of the body guard in splendid uni
form. Round about stood the profane and faithful vulgar blended
together, and among them we. About ten o' clock a sound of
martial music was heard, the great doors of the church were
thrown open, and the procession entered. First came lesser
orders of the clergy in black ; then some in violet and lace,
others in scarlet (names unknown) ; the bishops, in silver and
gold tissue, with white silk mitres. Then cardinals in silver
and gold, very richly embroidered, with train-bearers. After
these the officers of the household ; then the cross and seven

candle-bearers. Then a long line of officers bearing the Pope's

different mitres and his grand tiara, blazing with jewels and

gold. Then the Pope himself, carried in a crimson chair on

men's shoulders, under a silver and gold tissue canopy, sup
ported by sixteen golden poles, and having at each side a man
bearing a pole with a huge fan of ostrich feathers. After his

holiness came his personal attendants, which closed the proces

sion. They came up the whole aisle of the church accompanied

by a military band, and soldiers ranged at each side. A very

splendid procession, but, to my heretical eyes, rather unseemly
in the house of God. As they passed the altar they made
homage, the bishops and cardinals doffing their mitres ; and
when the Pope came up and was set down, he took off his triple
crown, putting on in exchange a gold tissue mitre ; then he
knelt down and said a prayer, the cardinals, &c, kneeling about
him. He then rose, and was led to the smaller throne, where he sat

down, and while the choirs were chanting, received the homage
of his court ; the privileged kissing his hand, the lesser his knee,

and the least his foot -- a strange place, it seemed to me, for a

Christian bishop to choose in which to receive honour from man !
When part of the service went on he removed to the higher throne,
where he remained seated the greater part of the time. Occasion
ally books were brought to him, and he read a few words, to which

the choir responded. At length he came forward to the great
altar to celebrate the mass. Here we had an excellent view of

him, as we were standing just below the altar. On the elevation

of the Host, every one knelt --cardinals, prelates, guards --all,

save the heretical English, who stood stock still. We were,

Ihowever, too numerous a body to feel ashamed of our conduct.

On the whole, am disappointed with the ceremonies of the
Catholic Church. To me they are not impressive, for they are
not simple enough in my mind to suit the majesty of the subject.
What are all these fine clothes and candles and ostrich feathers ?

With a semi-barbarous people 'tis all very well ; and the kissing
of the books and the bowing to the altar ; but when one thinks
for a moment, while it is going on, of the book on which all this

parade is said to be founded, and remembers our Lord's discourse
with the woman of Samaria, the very splendour of the scene,
instead of impressing you with holy awe and feelings suitable
to the worship of God, disgusts you with its littleness, and
wearies you with its mummery. My admiration of the Reformers

The prettiest sight of the whole was the illuminations --St. Peter's

on Sunday night, and the fireworks from St. Angelo on Monday.

Imagine the vast mass of St. Peter's lighted up with some 5000

lamps from the base to the cross above. These have much the

effect of the brass nails ranged in lines on a large black trunk.
This, for the first hour. Then, at a given signal, instantly

sprang into life thousands of flaming torches, which converted

the whole surface of the church into a blaze of light. At a little

distance, say a mile or so, where the whole could be taken in
at a glance, it had greatly the character of a diamond-beetle

under the microscope, the flitting of the lights adding much to

the brilliancy. The fireworks from St. Angelo were splendid,

but nothing very emblematical of the day. They were said to

represent an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The crowd were

orderly and very quiet, and our pockets were not picked. Italy
is a glorious climate, but a sorry people --liars from beginning

to end, beggars from the highest to the lowest.

      do not at all wonder at that seeming deadness that you

complain of. It is most natural that the mind should sometimes

fall into that state, though it is very painful to bear. Persons

on  the rack, it is said, after the first half-hour, become  indifferent
to  pain--not insensible. And so it is with grief.           After the

heart has gone through many trials, it seems as if the new

ones, even though they be great, could not add to the weight

of those it already has. A quiet sort of resignation insensibly
succeeds --a looking forward to another world, and a feeling that

it is not worth while to think of the sorrows of this when it is

so transitory. Religion doubtless soothes the mind, but even

the irreligious fall into a somewhat similar state.

CHAPTER VI.

THIRD RESIDENCE AT CAPE TOWN.

                                   Cape Town, October 12, 1840.
I arrived here on the 5th inst., after a passage of seventy
Idays --a week of which we were detained in the Channel.
                                                          was

Inot altogether idle during the voyage, and so not given up to

unhappiness, and am now settling down in good health and

spirits at the scene of my labours for some five years to come,

keeping a steady eye to my good resolutions.

  I found my house in good order, and my green-house ready
I Ito receive plants ; but foresee that shall have to get a man
Ito bring water--four buckets a day--if grow Orchidese or ferns.

This is a sad thirsty climate, and it is most difficult to keep the

Iatmosphere humid. Most of the plants brought out with me

Iare alive. Amongst those mourn for are the fuchsias, both of

which suffered from being put in too moist a case. Salvia

patens has had a hard struggle, but a hopeful shoot is springing

up. Nepenthes distillatoria is in perfect health. One of the

Epidendra blossomed on board ; and a fine Cypripedium is just
now pinking the tips of its bud. The garden out-of-doors looks

fresh and green, but is just now covered with a luxuriant crop
of nettles and Polygonum aviculare, but will soon put on a new

face, as we work vigorously at it In the cool of the morning.
M and E have been great vegetable growers this year.

They have been eating their own potatoes for three months, and
have three months' more supply. M
                                   digs the potatoes every

morning, and it would amuse you to see how carefully we pick

up the little ones, down to marble size, for when carefully

scraped they do for putting in the soup ! we cannot afford to

lose any.

  J. Backhouse is still here, and has just come in with some
THIRD RESIDENCE AT CAPE TOWN.                                    1 '.'9

Iseeds he has collected in the interior. There is also a specimen

of a new genus of Zygophyllese, which call Backhousia Australis.

It is a peculiarly appropriate plant to record J. B., if we look

for those pretty analogies, or rather allegories, that Linnaeus

was so fond of finding out, for the flower is plain enough for a
Quaker, and of small and modest dimensions, while the fruit

(hy which a tree should be known) is the largest in the order,
and of a bright glossy red, so that a bush in berry must be a

very handsome object. The allegory, however, must not be

forced too far, for those berries that look so beautiful without

are empty within --of no more substance than the bladder cherry.

J. B. will probably be here for some time longer, and I look for

many pleasant rambles with him. He takes four hours' exercise

I Idaily for health's sake, but is in the habit of walking in the

heat of the day, which am not able for, so shall confine
myself to his evening exercise. He has established a school

here for the children of the poorest classes --both coloured and

white. Those who can afford it pay, and those who cannot are

taken gratis. There are at present about fifty scholars, but

Iroom for more, and when it has been at work a little longer it

will, hope, go on well. J. B. takes no violent measures to

get scholars, or to overcome prejudice, but by little and little
gets along. He has been fortunate in securing an excellent

master and mistress. The man was a Quaker, and educated at

Ackworth, but I believe left the Society of Friends ; however, he

afterwards became serious, and had an idea that it would be

required of him to come here and engage in education ; but not

Ibeing sufficiently clear in the matter, he put it away and went to

other business. However, for some reason which forget, he took

to sailoring, and his vessel was wrecked on our pleasant shores,

and so he stayed, offered himself to the Wesleyans, and for

some years conducted a school for them, till it was given up.
He married one of their body, also a teacher, and so went along,
still wishing to devote himself to the instruction of the poor ;

but the Wesleyans no longer having occasion for his services,

J. B. raised a subscription among his friends at home, purchased

the schoolhouse -- a very neat building --and settled Jennings
in it. The rest of his acts are they not written in the "Book of

the Travels of J. B. and G. H. W ?" 1

I am very busy gardening. This morning planted . a large

to procure a gardener -- even a common labouring man--to dig

   The following letters evince Mr. Harvey's freedom from sec
tarian bias, and may serve to show how, with that same innate
love of truth which, from boyhood, he had held of such import
ance in an investigation of the mysteries and wonders of the
natural kingdom, he now sought to discriminate between truth
and falsehood, as regarded the laws of Christ's kingdom upon
earth, and examined into the doctrines of the Church of which

he eventually became so faithful a member and so able an

advocate.

In reading " Wilberforce's Correspondence " to-day--a book

that contains many good-for-nothing letters, but several of an

opposite character--1 was so much pleased with a passage that
occurs in one from Alexander Knox, the friend of Bishop Jebb,

Ithat, as cannot have the pleasure of reading it to you, 1 will

Ie'en transcribe, as think it will find an answering chord in

Iyour mind as it does in mine. The whole  letter  is interesting,

but here is what allude to :--
"We cannot but persuade ourselves that the growing dis

sonances in religion (which, in point of fact, are undeniable),
and the increasing cries of ' Lo ! Christ is here,' and, ' Lo ! Christ

is there,' will at length dispose the truly upright of heart to

pant after some more settled order of things than recent times

have exemplified. The jar of words, and the conflict of parties,

  an effectual stand may bo made against the presumption of
  Ifnovices and the wiles of the deceitful.

to  terminate ? My friend (Dr.  JoefbbG)oda--ndnotthaisnkinttehraptreittedis   to

himself by each ignorant or self-conceited individual -- but as

illustrated by the converging rays of those who have been
successively lights in their generations. ' The opinions,' says

Vincentius, 1 are to be collected of those Fathers alone who,

  with holiness, wisdom, and constancy, living, teaching, and

persevering in the Catholic faith and communion, have enjoyed

the privilege of dying in Christ faithfully, and of dying for

Christ happily. It seems to us, that to trace out this concur

  rence is in reality to recur to God's work for elucidation of His

Word.' Such persons as Vincentius describes, were what they

were, through the operation of the Divine Spirit ; the virtues in

which they excelled were the fruit of that Spirit, and the

concordant principles by which that fruit was nourished and

matured, could be no other than rills and rivulets of that river

which proceedeth from the throne of God and of the Lamb.

What, then, is the unbroken agreement of results and principles

in this most interesting retrospect but, in a sober sense, the

witness of the Divine Spirit to His own truth ? If, therefore, it

has in any instance pleased that blessed Spirit to speak ob

scurely, can we do more wisely than to examine how the same

adorable Agent has wrought, in order that the principles of

heavenly chemistry, delivered in the written Word, may be

explained by the practice of the all-wise Artist in the laboratory

of His Church ? Thus we conceive unity of sentiment on the

very matters that now divide Christians to be rationally and
luminously attainable, and it is our persuasion that it will be

attained, for our Saviour's prayer cannot always remain un

answered. Sooner or later Christians will be one, that the

world may believe, and perfected in one, that the world may

Iknow."                         like, especially the spirit in

   There is much in this that

drawing on, and they may be nearer than the present ap

pearance of the world warrants our supposing, when some

thing like what Knox looks for--at least its dawning --will arise

on the world. His letter is written in 1818, and has not the

Ithrough the multitude of irrelevant matters that surround us,
hope we should find that it has. But it seems as if it were a

law of Providence, that great changes, such as this would be,

proceed by little and little, so as to be hardly perceptibly

Ifadvanced up to a certain fixed time, and that then they blaze
forth with an unexpected light.  we look back at the

advances which the human race have made in anything, whether

in religion or civil liberty, or even in science, we are struck with

Ithe jumps mankind appear to make at certain epochs of their

career; but fancy the jump is much more in appearance than in
reality. A truer simile would be found in the attraction that

takes place between the several drops of water oozing through a

bed of sand, beneath which they find at first a comfortable bed

and reservoir, till drop after drop gradually added from the

neighbouring beds, at length the stream finds its exit in the

shape of a vigorous spring. To any one ignorant of the long

previous process, the appearance of the spring would seem

Isudden and miraculous, whilst it was merely the result of the

regular course of Nature. Now, think with the writer, that
the present state of the Christian world is like the gathering in

of the drops. They are coming in and tending to one centre of

attraction ; but unfortunately there are inequalities in the

par excellence -- the very centre to which all things tend ; and,

Itherefore, do not deem it expedient to go out of my way on
Iher account. There are some things which cannot at all

traditional deduction of the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands

Ifrom the early days, through the dark ages down to the present

time. know it is easily enough made out that there is a long

line of popes, and that through their ministration what is called

a regular succession has descended to the English bishops. Now

Ithis would be all very well, and would freely admit the validity
Iof the claim if could first find out that the popes had the

apostolic spirit in their gift -- "that on whomsoever they laid

hands they should receive the Holy Ghost." But for the satisfy

ing of my mind,    at least, it is only  necessary to look back                              at these
" successors " of  St. Peter to be       assured that they had                               no such

gifts themselves, and so could not give what they had not. It

reminds   one of the   pleasant title the kings of England took as
          of France,"  when they had not an inch of ground in the

cession, when, for years before the Council of Constance, we have

three popes living at once, busily employed in cursing each

the day of his fierce anger." In the sermon, the application

was, of course, made to the sufferings of our Lord on the cross ;

but it is the language of every heart suffering under a keen

bereavement. And is there no source of consolation in turning
the mind from the individual sorrow to that far greater --that

unspeakably great suffering and affliction which He must have

felt as a man on whom was laid what as a mere man He never

could have supported ? To me, there is ; and it seems the only

satisfying refuge to which the harassed mind can turn and hide

its grief in thoughts that insensibly raise it above its own

individual sufferings. The hope of meeting hereafter is not of

itself sufficient, for there is nothing to dwell on and to rest
upon in the interim. It is at best but a dim shadow, scarcely
Idiffering from what one feels on looking at a picture.

objection to the Athanasian is the curse. It may be so --the
Igates of heaven may have this bar--but it is not for mortal man
to fix  it.       cannot declare that every one who                does  not " so

but that the whole substance of Christianity is contained in the

right reception of the doctrine of the Trinity, for the simple

reason, that without this doctrine there can be no atonement ;

this creed,   however,                                  it would  not keep me

opinions as to the evil tendency, yea, and origin of " dissent"

are as strong as our worthy friend the Doctor could desire, and

Iyet, strange to say, cannot see my way clear to forsake the
Idissenting body among whom was born. It would be a great

still think that our objections to the form of Christianity to

which we have been accustomed since childhood, ought to be

very definite indeed to warrant us in forsaking the way of our

parents. We cannot doubt the genuineness of their religion;

the inference is therefore, that though perhaps another way may

be better, this is at least good. There are three degrees of

comparison, say the grammarians, and while we are within the

have begun at Hooker.     have but just commenced with him ;
Iit is therefore premature to speak ; but the more consider the
Isubject, the more regret the loss in the Protestant world of the

Catholic idea, that idea of unity, the loss of which has produced

the swarm of sects. This loss appears to me to have originated

Its inspiration may not indeed be compared to that of Scripture,

but ought it not to hold the second place ? Instead, therefore,
of complaining that it is a relic of Popery, and crying out for

changes here and there, my only wonder is that it has so com

pletely escaped contamination. It may be that " the smell of

the fire" has here and there remained on the garment; but it

does not amount to a stain or a hole, and holy indeed ought to

CHAPTER VII.

                                   COLLEGE APPOINTMENT.

When Mr. Harvey returned in 1840, to resume his official
duties at Cape Town, after his leave of absence and continental
tours, though apparently restored to his accustomed health, his
susceptibility to the influence of the African climate had not
been overcome, and towards the close of the year 1841 he had
a renewal of his former illness, which obliged him finally
to abandon all idea of any further residence in a climate
for which he was evidently so unfitted. In the spring of 1842
he once more arrived in London, where, after submitting for
some weeks to medical treatment and care, he felt well enough
to enjoy the society of a few of his friends, and also to take
a short excursion in the Isle of Wight, previous to leaving
for Ireland.

   The reader will no doubt readily enter into the feelings
arising from blighted prospects, and the frustration of long-
cherished hopes, under which the following letters were written.

there are very few sea-side walks, and no strand. As for Algae,

The soil of the hills is chalky, and they are beginning to turn

brown in anticipation of summer. There is but little water in

the Chines or gullies that form the chief lions of the place.

ing has already spoiled some of the prettiest nooks.
142 MEMOIR OF DR. HARVEY.

   Directly on returning to Ireland Mr. Harvey sought the
bracing air and retirement of his favourite Miltown Malbay,
which gradually restored his strength, though his complete
recovery was slow, retarded as it was by the feelings naturally
arising from being without the prospect of a settled occupation.
These are touchingly dwelt on in a letter to his dear friend
and relative Dr. F., who had been much with him during his

illness.

                      Cream Point, Miltown Malbay,

                                                July 1, 1842.

to you, and then allowed the dulness of the hour to conquer, and

Icommitted the paper to the grate ; but now that have a note

Ifor all see, likely to be so for some time longer. But for the

Irest, have been troubled with alternate fits of wretchedness
Iand apathy, with few glimpses of anything like a healthy re

signation to the will of God, so that the less tell of my
spiritual state the better for those that hear me.
I am obliged for the beautiful extracts from Wilberforce's
Isermon, which  have read twice, and shall again refer to.

There is indeed a voice of awful warning in the first part which

bitterness of my own thoughts. Like the ostrich hiding its

head in the sand from its pursuers, this only gives temporary

relief. This is the cause of my not having written to you, and

of my being thus deprived of the consolation which your ex

the neglect of small as of large mercies.

   The remainder of 1842 and 1843 were passed by Mr. Harvey
without any settled employment, except as he found interest in

his favourite botanical   pursuits. The August of         1843 was    s"peMnyt
with his sister's family  at Wicklow, from whence         he writes,

   Having once more taken up his residence at Plassey, he
writes in October to one of his friends, " Yesterday commenced

at the office, and will henceforth be regular attendant thereof.

It pleasant to have regular occupation again after , such

long spell of idleness, and has the wonderfully good effect of

making me get up early--not to be in time for breakfast, but to

Ithat Laud was everything bad and shocking, perhaps it may serve
to plead a little in his favour.                    fear our worthy Dr. F   r

At the close of this year, the prospect of being appointed to a

situation then vacant in Trinity College, Dublin, unexpectedly

opened. His feelings at this important crisis in his life may be

well understood as depicted both in his gay and grave manner
in the following letters : --

you are strictly correct. She of that persuasion, and more

in my eyes. The respectability of the connection, and her

being addicted to Botany, are what have peculiarly won my

affections, and made me enter the lists of her admirers. To

conclude this long preface, she resides in Dublin, which will be

very pleasant. She has good house of her own in College

one time she was in the habit of taking in boarders (very re

spectable young men, attendants on College), in which line she

has made some money, though her principal income is now

Iderived from estates in various parts of Ireland, which she has

come into by inheritance. They were granted, hear, in the

     I have been canvassing for a post which is vacant in Trinity

College, Dublin, namely, Professor of Botany and Curator of the
Herbarium, a combined office, to which a moderate salary and

comfortable College-rooms are attached. It is an old bachelor

place, and would in many ways suit me very well. The only

Ithing on the face of it disagreeable is the lecturing, but don't
Ithink should mind that much, as it is lawful to have the

subjects for the class written down, and the pointing at diagrams

and exhibiting specimens, with which lecturers vary their talk,

would take away from the continuity of speaking, which might

   The arrangement thus humorously alluded to, as being quite
satisfactory, was nevertheless not exactly that which Dr. Harvey

had at first expected. It was contended that the honorary

degree of M.D., which had been conferred on him by the
University, did not qualify him to hold the Professorship, and,
after much debate, it was ultimately decided to separate the two
offices, Dr. Harvey being appointed Curator of the Herbarium,
while Dr. Allman was elected to the Botanical Chair. In 1856,

Dr. Allman obtained the Professorship of Natural History

in the University of Edinburgh, and Dr. Harvey succeeded

him, without any opposition, in the Botanical Chair of Dublin.

genial society, he devoted himself to its duties with all his

Icases and one large hamper. The latter is filled with dried
fruits. Last Sunday spent with Dr. F  r, at Banstead. The

country is very pretty ; no village worth the name, only a few

scattered houses, an inn, and a church at some short distance

through the fields. Banstead lies on the chalk, which you know
is always hilly, with fine short grass ' cropped by nibbling sheep.'

There are woods, and hedgerows, and scattered houses, an ex
tensive prospect over flatter country, a common, and ' downs,'

and those downs are just now ornamented with thousands of

purple blossoms of Cnicus acaulis, a common English plant,

though not found in Ireland. It has no stem, but a bright

purple thistle blossom sits on the ground in the middle of a star
Iof leaves.
             picked up specimens for drying. The Doctor and

"Two plants of Fourcroya gigantea are now coming into

blossom at Kew. They look like the American agave lifted

on a trunk or stem. About three weeks ago both plants

started flower-stalks, which grew at first at the rate of two

feet, and now grow one foot per diem. The stalk at first was

as thick as a man's thigh, and looked like a giant head of

Asparagus. It is now twenty-seven feet high, and pushes out
into the open air through the roof of the greenhouse. It is still

growing, and may grow three or four feet farther. The side
branches are coming, and when in flower there will be a large

number of greenish-yellow blossoms. It is feared the plant

      As far as appears, the odd-looking thing that you found on

Iyour dahlia stems is the Sclerotium varium, a sort of fungus ; but

  have sent specimens to Mr. Berkeley, the highest authority in

such matters, and so if it prove to be anything grander, you shall

know in time. You could not do better than take to gathering
old sticks, and rotten straws and leaves, on which a new world of

vegetables find subsistence. Many of them are highly beauti

Now is the time. This is the summer of fungi.

as much to yours. The day before yesterday, at two o'clock p.m.,

IWestern Islands, Shetlands, and possibly Iceland or Norway,

We sailed at seven that evening, and here we are now going in

for a Western pilot. From this we go through the sound of

May and push on northward, landing at such of the Western

Islands as we take a fancy to, and hope ere long to see John

IO'Groat and the Ultima Thule beyond him.

from T. P. to take me in his yacht to the Hebrides, Orkneys,

and intend to take the yacht through the Leith Canal to the

delicate frame. While going amongst the sick, conducting a

soup-kitchen, and trying        every means in her power to keep

famine at bay, she heedlessly exposed herself to the severity of

bitter frost, and caught cold, which terminated in bronchitis,

                 That ere my latest breath,

IYon know the lines well. The first part of her wish has

been granted, and trust the second also, though we know

not now, and may never know it till we shall meet 'at

the end of the days,' should we be strengthened ' to stand

member from our little circle ; it ought to be another cord

loosened, another step advanced on our own journey. Would
that it were truly so !"

   Though the year 1847 must appear little more than a blank
in these pages, it was by no means an idle one with Dr. Harvey.
The drawing and describing for his "Phyeologia Britannica," in

addition to his College work, so fully occupied him as to afford

little leisure for any correspondence beyond the letters con

nected with his labours, or such scientific ones as are not within

the scope of the present memoir. The following, however, to
his friend Mr. Thompson, seems well suited for insertion here,
as marking the candour which was so prominent a feature in

both characters. It undoubtedly has reference to the "Phyeo

logia," to which Mr. T. had contributed many of the habitats.

I Lad hoped to be on my way to London to-day, but have

remained here to canvass for the Professorship of Botany to the

Royal Dublin Society, the obtaining of which would connect me
Iwith the beautiful garden at Glasnevin.
                                          never entered on a
Ipersonal canvass before, and am heartily sick of it. At first

rather felt amused, seeing a number of different characters, and

being treated like a gentleman in one house, like a troublesome

fellow in another, and like a needy beggar in a third. Nine-

tenths of the persons called upon were ignorant of my having

any claims to support, and some of them favoured me with

lectures on what a botanist ought to know ; others told me they

would vote for their friend, who, they supposed, was as good as

another, and very many had given pledges to vote for a candidate

Iwholly unknown to them, " to oblige a friend." Now and then
   met a refreshing man who talked rationally on the matter, and

though he did not promise his vote, said he would give it on

the day of election to the candidate who appeared most eligible.
ISuch men always left with pleasure, as vanity whispered that
I Ishould bag them in the end.
                                have met with great kindness

from several who are strangers personally, but who are guided

Iby what they know of me as a botanist. Some of these have

greatly assisted me in canvassing, and thus trust the foundations

of friendship are laid between us, unless my failing as a lecturer

should disappoint them.

   The account of your Scotch tour interested me much. It

must have vastly added to the pleasure of going through such a

Icountry to have for a companion one who saw with a painter's
eye and a poet's mind.     should have been glad had it suited

me to have gone with you.

     I heartily congratulate you on your removal from the smoke
Iof London to the pure air of the country, and much like

Clapham Rise. The common is one of the prettiest about
London, though many are pretty. No man will enjoy the change

more than you, and none can deserve enjoyment better. You

You are sure to be friends.

You have not told me the fate of the fernery at the square,

whether it is to be intrusted to Mr. S      , or to follow yon

would be a pity to disturb the old ones, as they are classical ;

and besides, however suitable to their present position, would he

Iaffection (like a cat) for that old house, and should not like to
see it stripped and bare.    hope the baby roses may still

I should have thought it would have been easy to have got a

Igarden at least as large as that at the Square ; and for my own

enjoyment think a small garden infinitely to be preferred to a

large one. A small suburban garden, full of varieties and botanical

oddities, like Dr. Neill's, at Edinburgh,  is the one which (unless
                                           most pleasure from, and
I Ihad a large fortune) should expect
Isuch trust you have got.

   In the spring of 1849 Dr. Harvey received an invitation to
deliver a course of lectures at the Lowell Institute of Cambridge
(Boston). The opportunity thus afforded of visiting North

America, and of being introduced to many of the eminent

scientific and literary men of that country, was gladly embraced,

and the prospect extended to a botanical exploration of various
parts of the coast. Added to this was the pleasure of becoming
personally acquainted with the widow and daughters of his
brother Jacob, whose death had taken place in the preceding
year. He had married a daughter of the late Dr. Hosack, of
Hyde Park, on the Hudson, and had acquired a distinguished
place among the merchants of New York. As a citizen he
took an active and intelligent interest in public affairs, and

especially in the international questions frequently in agitation

between England and America ; his great and constant desire
being to prevent any collision between the two countries. His

joyous humour, warmth, and kindness of heart, and his refined
hospitality, endeared him to a wide circle of friends. He was

ever ready to exercise his services on behalf of his poor

emigrant countrymen. The respect and esteem with which
Mr. Jacob Harvey had been regarded paved the way for a
warm and friendly reception of his brother in many circles

throughout the Union.
   The course of lectures delivered by Dr. Harvey comprehended

the subjects proposed in the following letters to Dr. Asa Gray,
of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

                         CHAPTER VIII.

       TOUR IN THE UNITED STATES.

Dr. Harvey sailed from Liverpool in the Europa, to Halifax,

where he landed on the 24th of July, 1849, after a fair passage

of ten days, and was warmly welcomed by his old Cape friend
Mr. E., with whom he took up his quarters during the few days

of his stay, which were chiefly spent in exploring the neigh

bouring country and in dredging for seaweeds.

He describes the shores of Nova Scotia, as seen from the

deck of the steamer, to be not unlike some bleak parts of the

north of Scotland, save that instead of the Scotch fir, the hills
                                                                                                       " Such wooding," he

us, soon getting scraggy-- a wilderness of them very picturesque.

some first impressions. 'Tis like twenty Birkenheads and a

dozen Liverpools, with slices from London and Paris, all

huddled together, and painted bright red, with green windows.

Wide, dirty streets, where everything may be thrown, and
where it lies -- the cleansing operation being performed by

chloride of lime, which salutes your nostrils as you pass along ;

--badly paved and rough ; no two houses of the same size and
form consecutively --a rambling city, extending for miles beyond

the end of the continuous houses. Busy streets in the older

part, well-built stores full of goods, and plenty of busy mankind

about them. Huge shops in Broadway, built of white marble,

and very spacious within. Huge quack medicine stores, and

grand houses of quack-doctors ; some handsome churches, and

many funny-looking ones. The public buildings handsome

enough. On the whole, a great heap of houses, noises, and smells,

and 300,000 or 400,000 people. The whole passage up the bay

is to build very grand houses ; and there are many which look

doctors, oilmen, and milkmen, dwell in such. Every newer

stable will be superior to your house." So he builds a cut stone

stable right opposite to his friend's door, much grander looking
than the grand house of his friend. Some of these houses cost

80,000 to 120,000 dollars. Our voyage from Halifax took

about fifty-two hours : calm weather, and pleasant enough.

broad leaves, much larger than we see on oaks ; others have

leaves so like chestnut, that, till you look very close, they seem

like chestnut-trees. The hickory is like a walnut, with very large,

dark-green leaves ; and the black walnut has a mixed character,

between walnut and ash. The underwood is sumach, already

morning set out with my friend Professor Bailey on an excursion

to the eastern end of Long Island. We crossed the ferry at

Brooklyn, entered the railway cars at half-past nine, and set

out on a trip of ninety-four miles to Greenport, a distance

accomplished in five hours. The road lies through a very level

uninteresting country, the whole of Long Island being merely

a high gravel bank covered with a thin soil ; the grass at this

season, after a long drought, too brown for beauty, and the trees

of small size. Many cultivated spots near the New York end ;

then a long belt of low forest land, covered with varieties of

oak and some pine. Then a space covered with a dwarf species

of oak, which, even when fully grown, and loaded with acorns, is

no bigger than a gooseberry-bush.  Then there were extensive

plains covered with grass, and patches of a small shrub (Iva

fruticans), which indicate a saltness in the soil. The plains

appeared to be several miles across, and must have a prairie

aspect. Then we had more scrubby forests, and then a succes

sion of ponds, covered with water-lilies, and a variety of pretty

flowers, only seen from the railway car. Then swamps and salt-

marshes ; then arms of the sea running in, and finally Green-

port itself. We passed through many "cities" and towns on

the way, with fine names, some with large public buildings, and

very long, very wide, and very straight streets, and even squares
and places ; but very few with many houses. One street, called
East New York, is laid out on a great scale ; but there is only a

house here and there, at the distance of several hundred yards.
Greenport is thinly built in the same fashion, covering a large

fallen in with the disagreeables of such places. Nothing could

be more civil than the attendants ; and the chambermaid, who

Ievidently wondered much at my proceedings, nevertheless

brought me water and dishes as wanted them, and cheerfully

too. The charges very moderate ; six shillings (a dollar and a
half) covered all the day's expenses, and nothing extra to

Iservants, or expected by them. After three days of making

messes, with water and seaweeds, tendered the chambermaid

half a dollar, which evidently highly impressed her with my

Iliberality. We had a good day's dredging, and returned on
Friday to New York.  was struck in the railway and at

Greenport with the great majority of well-featured persons, as

compared with our countrymen. There is a strong peculiarity

Iin the American face ; but the number of persons with regular

features, both men and women, think much greater than in

IEngland and Ireland. Handsome women at the table-d'botes

   We drove one afternoon to see the Croton Aqueduct, about

twelve miles distant. The stream of water is carried on arches

ninety feet high, across the Haarlem River. There are fifteen

arches ; the water-tubes about three feet diameter. The drive,

after passing the city, is beautiful, leading near the banks of the

Hudson, of which there are constant peeps ; wooded banks

and scattered houses, weeping-willows and Lombardy-poplars

plentifully introduced. There however, much neglect visible; is,

delivered in plain, simple, and earnest language. The church

Early in September, Dr. Harvey left Hyde Park to visit the

Falls of Niagara.    Writing      from Troy, he                again expresses his
admiration of the  Hudson.       " Having now,"                he says, " traversed

landed me at a snug little inn in the heart of the woods and

close to the waterfall. The road here was delightful as to
views, but very ill kept as to surface : a part laid with planks ;

very smooth, like so much wooden pavement, then came sand,

and then rough, unbroken stones and ruts. Part was through

genuine forest, full of tall old trees of various kinds, many dead

and dying; hemlock-pines in all stages of decay, standing,

Ileaning, and fallen --all huddled together in picturesque fashion.

Notwithstanding the badness of the road, greatly enjoyed the

drive through the trees, having the advantage of the slanting

light of afternoon shining brightly through the leaves, which
Ihere and there showed symptoms of red and yellow.

half-past seven, set out to explore the Falls. We entered a

grove, found a path conducting to a very steep flight of steps,

descended then down another, till at last we safely landed on the

rocky bed of the Mohawk, and heard the sound of a distant

unseen fall. Here the river has forced its way between two

nearly perpendicular walls of limestone, some 200 feet high,

covered with hanging woods of the most beautiful variety of

trees. Some huge lignum vitae, as big as our tallest larches,

particularly delighted me. Moreover the hemlocks were very

picturesque. Perhaps Sir W. Scott's description of the retreat

     I was glad to get off from Trenton yesterday, by a country

stage which brought me to Utica, in time to catch the train for

any other route in the neighbourhood would be as rich. Lake
Erie is exactly like the sea, with a pebbly beach and waves

with water clear as crystal, tumbling and dashing over rocks

on a gradual descent of more than a mile,- perhaps two or three

from the point where it flows smoothly, till it finds an end in the
precipitous leap of the Falls. As yet no Falls were visible, but

their position was indicated by a cloud of spray, and their

proximity by a steady sound.
   Goat Island in mid-channel is as large, at the least, as our Innis-

fallen, and is beautifully wooded with a variety of trees, amongst

which are large lignum vitse. These are the conical fir-trees

Messiah performed, but we often have parts of it in our College

from thence to New York by Lake Champlain and Saratoga.

   20th. Yesterday we had a dinner-party, the lion of which was

Sir J. R. ; but to me my neighbour at table, Professor Agassiz,

shared largely in the leonine honours. He is a very remarkable

man, with a most capacious forehead, ardent eye, and expressive

mouth ; and the inside of the man does not belie the outside. T.
may remember him at the Dublin Association. He is the same

person with fifteen years' development of mind, during which

period he has had ever-extending opportunities of bringing his

great powers into operation. He has here a large field for
zoology, and is an omnivorous worker in it. No doubt he will

secure a permanent station among the chief illuminators of the

science. Richardson was very entertaining, though he required

to be led out, not pouring his information for any one to pick up.

The thermometer where he wintered last year stood between 60°

and 70° below zero. An astronomer at table, Mr. Bond, said

his thermometer only went 7° below zero last year, and the
greatest he had seen it was 18°. This seemed nothing compared

with the Polar winters. In latitude 68° Sir J. B. found trees

of one hundred feet high, twenty to twenty-five inches diameter,

and with 450 rings of annual growth. The annual rings were

of varied thickness, showing that the summers vary considerably
in those latitudes. After dinner we drove into town to attend a

conversazione at Dr. Warren's. Here were a number of

IBostonian doctors, to some of whom was introduced. One of
1S4 MEMO1H OF Dli. HARVEY.

them was Dr. Pickering, who accompanied the United States Ex
Iploring Expedition, and with whom talked about the Cape,
I Iwhere he had stopped for a few days.
                                             hope shall meet him

again. Dr. Warren is nephew of General Warren, who was killed
at the famous battle of Bunker's Hill, and is of course very proud

of his kindred. There was a picture of the hero in the room,

and three oil-paintings of the battle, and two cannou balls from

the field as table ornaments. There was also another highly-

prized relic in a richly-gilt frame, which was handed about to
                 It was a sheet

IPalace, July 20th, 1838." The Queen is very popular here, and

her picture frequently displayed on parlour walls, and have

seen it coupled with General Washington at inns. Dr. Warren

Ihas a fine collection of fossil remains, and possesses the finest

known specimen of the Mastodon --finer, am told, than the one

now at the British Museum, and which was formerly exhibited

in Dublin under a spurious name.

Saturday at eventide, we visited the Observatory, and saw the

great telescope, the finest instrument in America, and with not

imn a"nyHesrucpueleriso,r"s  anywhere. We    had a view of a rich cluster of stars
                             which, through  an ordinary telescope, looked just

like a blot or hazy star, but in the great one, the same object stood
out in the sky in perfect distinctness, every star in it (and there
seemed to be thousands of them) shining in his own proper sphere.
We afterwards spent the evening with Professor Agassiz, who gives

Dr. Pickering, who has been all round the world, engaged in
the United States Exploring Expedition. He has published a
magnificent book on the Physical History of Man.
The plates for the United States Exploring Expedition were

and fishes --innumerable beautiful and grotesque forms. Agassiz
is a very remarkable man, and if he lives a few years will do
wonders in Zoology. At present he is working out the history
of embryo animals --tracing the development of the young

creature through every tribe from the lowest to the highest,
and he has already made out many remarkable facts which will

be of the greatest service in fixing systematic Zoology on a

firm basis. It is delightful to see and to hear him speaking,

for his whole countenance lights up with his subject, and

with true enthusiasm. At other times he enters into general

conversation, and is pleasant, and quiet, with perfectly simple

Imanners.                          am delighted chiefly with

to be the tree under which he first drew his sword in the great

28th. Two of my lectures are now over ; the first, a written

one, rather fatiguing, owing to the size of the room ; the

Isecond being delivered from notes, much less so. Some say

they are interested, but am not able to fill the house. About

four or five hundred attend, but that is not thought large in these

parts. The evening audience are chiefly men ; the afternoon one

Iwith the drier details. On one of my idle days, Dr. Gray and
went by rail to Beverley, where his father-in-law has a sea

side residence. The railroad took us through some old towns, of

which a noted one was Salem, an early settlement, and a primitive-

looking place. Another was Lynn, where every man is a shoe
maker and fisherman--fishing in the summer, aud sewing leather
all the hard weather. This trade is the great staple manufacture

of these parts, 18,000,000 of dollars being the annual value of

the shoe-trade in Massachusetts. The coast round Beverley is

very pretty, hill and dale, with large masses of natural rockwork
peeping through the soil. Mr. L.'s place is quite on the shore,

sixty acres, tastefully laid out, the ornamental not intruding on

the wild spots, and these adding a charm to the others. There

are little bays, and little rocky nooks with trees to the waterside ;
and the wide extent of Boston Bay in front, with the islands at

its mouth and the ships passing up and down. It is a charming

spot to spend a summer.

            IGray and                   November 10.

       Dr.             walked over a few days ago to Mount
Auburn,     the principal cemetery here. It is very extensive,

naturally wooded, full of hill and dale, with streams in the valleys.

It is laid out in walks and avenues, and thickly peopled with

tombs in a great variety of patterns. On the whole, it is a very
picturesque " City of the Dead," and it must be beautiful in

spring and summer : at those seasons it is one of the most

favourite resorts of the Bostonians, who come out in crowded

Iomnibuses at all hours of the day to walk about among the
tombs.      am told that formerly they had pic-nics there, crack

ing their nuts and jokes on the gravestones, but this is discon

tinued. At this season it looks somewhat dreary, the ground

being thickly strewed with dry leaves.

Professor Longfellow honoured me with a visit a few days

ago. He lives about a mile off, in a large old house formerly a

manor-house, and Washington's head-quarters when in these

parts. His second wife is the heroine of Hyperion. Last even

professors are a sociable set of people, and have the pleasant

got talking to the Greek Professor (but not about Greek). He
has arranged to go with me to see Laura Bridgeman. She is

intimate with his sister, who lives near the Asylum, and often

drops in to pay her a visit. She continues to advance in ac

quirements, but latterly, in reading history, is much distressed
at the wickedness of the world. She wonders at it as something

monstrous, and it becomes more and more difficult to explain
to her the motives for political movements -- wars and so forth.

To her, the whole history appears a tissue of unmeaning cruelty

and crime.

     have seen Laura Bridgeman, but have not much to add to

the accounts you are familiar with. She is now about nineteen.

She came into the room with her friend Miss White, laughing

and talking most glibly (with her fingers). Something had
highly diverted her, and kept her for some time in brisk mirth.

Her friend told us she was describing how some rats had got

into her room and gnawed holes in her clothes, &c. She held

Iher friend's hand, and kept playing the fingers about with such

extreme rapidity that could hardly follow them, and could

not see a single letter she made. Her friend as rapidly touched

her hand, and thus the two hands kept up conversation. Her

face changes instantly with the passing thoughts, and so vividly,
that you would sometimes think her deeply distressed when

I Ishe is only describing something unpleasant. When she heard
  was from Ireland, she asked did know " Father Mathew ?"

She has a great affection for him, and, while talking about him,

suddenly seized her companion by the waist and then embraced

and kissed her, a habit she has when anything that moves her
affections is passing through her mind. Then she asked about
the poor people in Ireland, and whether they would have food
enough this season ; and was quite distressed to hear that there

was likely to be a scarcity. She takes great interest in passing

events, particularly in hearing of any reform or amelioration.

Miss White, her companion, devotes herself entirely to her, and

seems admirably suited for such a vocation.

   Dr. Howe says that, although "it was found very difficult to
commence with a case like Laura's, that now, by the experience

of hers and that of Oliver Caswell, the instruction of others

similarly affected has become quite easy. The problem is

solved, and there are regular rules to be followed, leading to
positive results. Oliver Caswell is not nearly so interesting as
Laura, not having her great talents. He talks and compre
hends slowly, but there is a happy expression in his face.
Dr. Howe says that he and Laura are the happiest persons in
the establishment ; perhaps because they have no care, and are

tenderly cared for--and do not know the extent of the privation

they lie under. The institution here is not confined to the
blind, a class having recently been added for idiots, several of
whom are now under care. Dr. Howe says that the degree of

idiotcy is to be measured by the amount of language--that any
person with hearing, and without the power of articulation,

is an idiot. Several such have been under care, and are found
to be susceptible of instruction, and of being taught to speak.
He does not look forward to their making much progress, but
finds that they can be taught decent habits, and several simple
trades or occupations ; in fact, raised very considerably above

the state in which the institution finds them. It is delightful

to see such an institution in operation, and so well supported by

Iendowments and grants from the State.

anecdotes, very well told. He is a large man, with a quiet

                    I have put the finishing stroke to my

IBoston engagement to-day, and am a free man again. The

last words have been spoken ; and wound up with a text from

the Apocrypha, which will be found in last chapter of 2nd

Maccabees, not the last verse, but the one before it. The last

week has been a busy one, having four dinner-parties, two of
which were on lecture evenings. Last Thursday was " Thanks

giving day," the great New England holiday. You know

the Puritans when they landed here on Christmas-day fasted
that day for spite, and have ever since disowned it. So, as the

years bring it round, they annually appoint another day

towards the close of the year for Thanksgiving, that the harvest

has all been housed, and the country preserved from misfortune.

The Governor issues his proclamation, which is read in all the

pulpits, and the appointed day is commenced with church-going

and ended with feasting. All the shops are closed, and there
is rest from work. It is also the time for family circles to

assemble. Old and young meet, and have all sorts of games

not direct descendants were close collateral ones. Three or

four smaller fry came in before the cloth was removed, so we

counted over forty. We sat down to table at 3 p.m., on account

of the children, and rose soon after five, when the sports began,

and a scene of boisterous mirth ensued. We had blind-man's-

buff, hunt-the-slipper, thread-the-needle, and other intellectual

sports, for a couple of hours, concluding with a cockfight ; two

gentlemen, dressed up in paper painted like cocks, enacting a

capital fight. Some of us then started for the house of another

old gentleman of similar octogenarian age, where we found a

similar lively scene. Having stayed here for another hour or

two, we then returned to our former quarters, where we found

the little ones gone to bed, and the rest --from ten years of age
--still amusing themselves. Some capital charades were acted.
Dr. G-- and myself then set out for another party, a grown-up

one, at Mr. Ticknor's (the historian of Spanish literature), where
we found a brilliant assembly talking and having occasional

music. Here we staid till an early supper caused the rooms to

thin, and we left before eleven, and walked home, arriving just

Iat midnight. So we had nearly nine hours of Thanksgiving
festivity.      walked home with Agassiz, who is about to be

married the second time. He has a son, a fine boy of ten or

twelve, and a daughter. Some time back, when he put his
little boy to school -- as he wished to keep up his instruction in

Natural History -- he offered to give occasional lectures at the

school for the benefit of all the other pupils as well. The offer

was gladly accepted ; and he has been in the habit all the
summer of giving a weekly lecture. A week or two ago, at

the close of the lecture, he was requested to stop, and then, to

his great amazement as well as pleasure, one of the pupils

stepped forward, and, in the name of the rest, presented him
with a handsome silver " pitcher," bearing an appropriate in

scription. You should see how his face beams with delight

on mesmerism, in which he is a decided believer. Mr. Cooper

is a burly figure, large and square, with a baldish head, grey

hair, and reddish face, with a somewhat sailor-like manner.

He has been in the American navy. One would not guess by
his appearance that he was a man of genius, or an author by

profession. Dr. Wainwright, the clergyman, was also of the

party. We have just come from hearing'' him preach [against

the inordinate love of wealth, and against display of fmery, which

Ihe says is a besetting sin. There was a pretty full congregation ;

but in the American churches to which have been there is but

little mixture of the different grades of society. They are more

Ilike proprietary chapels for the wealthy classes than parish
churches for all.  suppose this is the result of their peculiar

parish organization.
   Here a " parish" is not a district bounded by geographical

limits, and containing all that may reside within them, but it is

a body of people who organize themselves (like a club), elect
officers, choose a clergyman, and build him a church, so that

there are parishes of poor people and of rich people, distinct
one from the other. Your next-door neighbour may be a

member of a parish miles off, at the other end of the city.

The parish also moves about; thus, Gracechurch parish did

belong to the old end of the town, but the greater part of the
parishioners moved up town, still retaining their connection

with Gracechurch. This being an inconvenient state of things,

the next step was to move the church, so now Gracechurch has
gone up town after its pew-owners. The old church was sold for

60,000 dollars, pulled down, and the ground is now covered with

fashionable stores. It seems the rector thought he should have
a richer congregation if he moved up town, and so he has.

There was tremendous competition for seats in the new fabric,

and the whole sold at large prices, so that modern Gracechurch

delphia, drove through a flat  country, sometimes of   salt marshes,
sometimes of meadows, then     peach-orchards, towns,   and " pine-

barrens" (sandy ground covered with low pine-trees and oaks),

till we reached the Delaware, within five miles of the Quaker
City. We then stepped on board a boat and steamed down the

broad river, the banks of which at this season looked dreary

from the remains of the half-melted snow, and the trees being

desolate and leafless. The city soon came into view, stretching

far over a flat of considerable extent, with nothing in sight that

   We landed at a crowded wharf, and were some time pushing

our way over fearfully dirty streets, and through interminable
cars and waggons, till at length we emerged into the city

proper, which is built, as you know, with perfect regularity, all
the streets crossing at right angles, and their order being red
brick houses with white outside shutters and white marble base
ments and steps. Fewer streets have trees than in New York

and some other cities. Uniformity is pre-eminently the feature
of the place. One street is so like another that it is quite

necessary to look up for the name. These names are simple
enough, and a stranger is at no loss, who can count his fingers
and remember this doggrel :

             " Chestnut, walnut, spruce and pine,

               Market, arch, race and vine."

with Mrs. W                   , and in the evening went to hear Lucretia

Mott, a Hicksite preacher, deliver a lecture on the rights of

women. The occasion was this : a Mr. Dana, of Boston (poet

and so forth), has been lecturing in Philadelphia on sundry

matters. Among the rest, he gave two lectures on woman,

Lucretia, and so she determined to lecture in reply. There was

Ia highly respectable audience of 600 or 800. She addressed us
for nearly two hours.                  agreed with much that she brought

                     rails."   Among her instances of illustrious women

were Miriam, Deborah, Jael, Judith, Joan of Arc, and Elizabeth

Fry. She claimed for women perfect equality, a wife was not

to obey her husband, but husband and wife were the arms of a

Ibalance, and whichever was weightiest was to have weight (the

illustration is mine but conveys her meaning so far as could

catch it). Women were unjustly treated in being taxed while
they had no votes and were uneligible to office, &c. The

laws affecting women's property were reviewed and roughly

handled, and in this respect a hard case was made out. Non-

resistance was held up, and women's preaching, with a variety of

other matters. Her delivery was good, but a little rambling,

with repetitions, and she was rather obscure on the points where

I wished her to be most definite.
  ITuesday, called on Dr. Hare, late Professor of Chemistry in

Ithe University, who took me to the Laboratory, and introduced

me to Professor Rogers. There met several persons, among

whom was Dr. Leidy, a young man, who will be famous if he

lives, and goes ahead ; according to present promises. He has

been finding new plants. Where ? In the stomachs and intes
tines of insects -- several new genera and species, very curious
and beautiful, opening up quite a new field of research. These

plants are not indicative of disease, but exist in the healthiest
Iindividuals.
               afterwards met him at the Academy, and he

accompanied me over the museum, the collection of birds in

which is said to be the finest in the world. Agassiz and the

Prince of Canino, both good authorities, say that there is no such

Isingle cabinet in Europe. They have two kinds of Apteryx, one

of which, was told, is unique. There is a specimen of the other
in T. C. D. They have 180 kinds of humming-birds, and ostriches

in proportion. There is a splendid series of toucans, &c. The

fossils are very fine. Here also is the largest collection of

human skulls --of all nations, tongues, and peoples -- to be found

anywhere outside a catacomb.

To this museum is appended a rich library of natural history,

containing most of the beautifully illustrated works on

ornithology, besides a very fair set in other branches, amongst

which is the Phycologia. The whole of the birds and fossils and

a great part of the books are the gift of Dr. Wilson of Phila

delphia, a young man of about five and thirty, who will not even
allow himself to be thanked for his donations, much less will he

have them called by his name. He has expended (they say)
some 25,000Z. sterling for this museum, and is still giving. His

object is evidently to place the science of his country on an

Iindependent footing, and this is surely a noble one.
In the evening  went to an ordinary meeting of the

Academy, and heard part of a paper read by Dr. M. on skulls,

wherein he asserted, as his opinion, founded on a most extensive

examination of human skulls, that all mankind are not the

children of Adam, but that several distinct species of men

have been created in different countries, just as divers species
of other genera have been formed. What is stranger still, he

says that this opinion is not controverted by the Bible, but may

Ieven be illustrated and confirmed by it. Whom did Cain marry ?
The following morning         drove, with Commodore R. and

some others, to Girard College. This beautiful building, of

white marble, with its noble colonnade of Corinthian pillars,

and which cost 2,000,000 dollars, is merely an orphan schod,

his whole property --some 7,000,000 dollars-- for this purpose,

with the special proviso that no minister of any religious

denomination should be ever allowed to set foot within the

  did not see any of the prisoners, but visited some of their
empty cells, the walls of which were covered with frescoes, in

colours extracted from the old cotton fabrics that had been

given them to dress for the paper-makers, the brushes made of

their own hair, and other contrivances to match. The frescoes

Bhowed considerable taste and patience. The walls of one were

covered with Arabesque patterns--very elaborate -- and those of

the others with figures and inscriptions. The number of inmates

is usually 300. They have little yards in which now and then

they are permitted to exercise, and there are larger spaces

where delicate prisoners can have a wider range, but in no case

are they permitted to see each other or to converse. The

system is said to work well ; but it is thought that the terms of

confinement might be shortened with advantage, as the chief

object of the treatment is reformation, not punishment.

Prisoners sometimes seem to be reformed after a time, and then

the improvement passes away, and their sorrow for crime

becomes changed into revenge towards the community for
having locked them up so long, so that when set free, it is not

with any feeling of gratitude that they return to the outer

world. They are allowed to communicate with their friends

once in six months, and are constantly employed in manual

labour, some trade being taught to those who are without the

knowledge of any. All are taught to read and write.

I can imagine that the whiter season here may be very

agreeable to those who have not to work in the open air, and

Iwho keep good fires at home, but the poor must suffer keenly.

To-day observed a little boy, and afterwards a woman, picking

Icinders out of the heaps of ashes along the streets --cinders so

very much burned that should not think they could be lighted,

but, added to the fuel, they may serve to keep fire alive. Who

would have anticipated such wretched shifting poverty in this

land of plenty? but in a large city there must always be

Ipoverty. On Christmas-day the thermometer was at zero, and
Ithought it rather cold : it pained the face when walking against
the wind.  have just decided that buckwheat cakes and

sleighing are both humbugs, though very much talked of here,

the one being delicious and the other delightful. The streets are

Iwhite with snow, and numerous sleighs of all sizes are running

up and down Broadway and along the by-streets, but was not

tempted to mount into any. It seemed cold fun. The snow is

not yet thick enough, and so the sleighs jog and jolt along,

but the happy people crowd into the vehicles, and fancy them
selves gliding smoothly. They remind me of the Irish sedan
I(bottomless), prized only for the " honour of the thing."
On Friday dined with Mr.                        , in one of the fine houses

Commander-in-chief of the United States army, and one of the

Mexican heroes. The dining-room was fitted up like a Gothic

American oak. We sat in wide arm-chairs, so that there was

Ithat city. may have omitted to mention Greenhough's statue

of Washington, which stands on a wide area or square at the

back of the capitol.

  It is a colossal figure, sitting on a chair of state, the whole

raised on a pedestal. At a sufficient distance the figure is

commanding, being in the style of an Olympian Jupiter ; but on

approach, you are struck with the strange incongruity between

the head of Washington and the naked sculptured body ; the

latter being quite nude, save a blanket rolled about the legs, a
part of which hangs over the right arm. The idea of the

sculptor seems to be the moment of his resigning his commis
sion, for he holds in one hand a sword, with the hilt turned from

him, while the other is raised as if he was giving a valedictory

Iaddress. As a work of art, am incompetent to judge of it ; but
I rather pitied the poor old hero, sitting on a cold stone in the

river, and we had much ado to push through it. The stream is

five or six miles broad, and had a noble appearance.

  The situation of Eichmond is beautiful. In the Capitol is

a very interesting statue of Washington, the only strictly accu

rate one in existence. It is by Heudon, a French artist, brought

from France for the purpose, and domiciled for months at Mount

Vernon, while he took casts and measurements of Washington

in every position ; and here he has given us in marble the man

as he stood, in every miuutia of his dress, and the figure in exact

proportion, yet withal, he has managed to preserve sufficient

grace. The head is perhaps too much thrown back, but this

either to the mountains or shore. The winters here are not

without frost, which sometimes kills the orange-trees. There

are evergreens, and a profusion of roses in the gardens. The

Magnolia   is also here. It has a somewhat thick  of palm (the
palmetto)                                          trunk, which

rises twenty or thirty feet high, with a crown of fan-shaped

leaves at the top. It is not so pretty as the European palmetto,
but nevertheless has a very picturesque aspect. It forms

admirable piles for driving under water, as it is very tough, and

suffers much less from boring insects than any other kind of

wood. The common forest-pine here is the Carolina, which,

with its long tassels of leaves, is an extremely fine-looking tree.

       We left Charleston on the 22nd in a steamer, on a brilliant
day, with the sea as smooth as a lake, and the sky clear. The
passage for about fifty miles was in the open sea, but in sight of
the low flat shore covered with timber, and then we entered
narrow channels formed between a number of islands and the

mainland. These are the famous " Sea Islands," on which the

best quality of cotton is grown ; but they do not seem to be

Ihalf peopled or planted. A great part of the land is still

covered with pine and with the palmetto, which have men

tioned before, of which there are several species ; one kind does

not rise much above the ground. Along the shore are sundry
species of Yucca, or Adam's needle, which have a striking
effect. They are now loaded with fruit. We steamed all

the day for one hundred miles through the narrow and

sinuous channels between the islands, and at 10 p.m. found

ourselves alongside the wharf at Savannah. Shortly after,

Imyself and traps (rather bulky) were safely lodged in the

Pulaski House, or best hotel ; soon took possession of my

quarters, and had the satisfaction of being sung to sleep by a

mosquito.
   Though it is only January, the weather is like that of our

warmest summer days ; but it is rather odd to feel such weather,

and then to look out on leafless trees and on ground where

withered leaves and dead stalks abound. But a change will

soon come, and already the violets are in the woods, and the

wild jessamine (botanical name GeUemium, with a flower the
shape of a yellow Bignonia) is beginning to open in every sunny
spot. The grass also is springing up, besides which, a large
portion of the forest is evergreen, and there are roses, camellias,

and narcissi in the gardens.
   Savannah, though an important place of trade, is more like a

large village than a city. The houses are small ; the streets

Iwide and lined with trees, looking like rural avenues. There

are many small squares, and, am told, thirty-one churches of
one kind or another. The city is built on a sandy plain, which

is elevated some twenty or thirty feet above the rest of the
country, and thus stands high and dry. The country is rather
monotonous after you get accustomed to the vegetation. You

are, at first sight, struck with the number of new trees, but

more especially with the long moss (Tillandsia) hanging in
thick mournful tresses from every oak, the tufts from one to six

feet long. In a   "celimveete"ryoahkse,rewhthicehrearaeredraspoemde  noble avenues

their shade. Such trees contrast well with the glossy magnolia,
and when you add to these the strikingly beautiful Pinus

palustris and the swamp cedars, with a host of others now out
of leaf; and then clothe the ground with spring flowers, you

fancy that the Savannah woods, a little later in the year, must

bo something paradisaical.

Driving out into the country we encountered a two-storied

house moving down the road (perhaps to enjoy the cool of the

evening). They had it raised on logs, and were canting it along
with handspikes. On our return homeward they had got it

fixed up where it was intended to be. Of course it was a wooden

house.                                      «

ILast evening attended a quoit-club -- the Saturday evening
Iamusement of the elite of Savannah.
                                      witnessed two games,
and some very good throwing. It is complained of that all the

playing is in the hands of the older members, the juniors being

too lazy to join in ; so it is thought the club, which has lasted

for thirty years, may expire from a failure of efficient players.

The young men lounge on the chairs and smoke cigars, and
drink brandy and water --a sad falling off.

This morning went to church and heard a sermon on the

Iduty of fasting. The subject was treated in a rational and
effective manner.      suppose the clergyman chose it because

                                      Key West, Feb. 5, 1850.

If you turn to the map of Florida, you will find, stretching

from its extreme southern point towards the westward into the

Gulf of Mexico, a number of small islands, called keys --low

sandbanks, coral reefs, or flat limestone islets, covered with

mangroves, and a scanty vegetation of tropical character. Well,

Key West is the name of one of these islands, near the western

extremity of the chain, and the town of Key West is the capital

and only city on the island, and numbers 3000 inhabitants.

Now, having fixed my position on the map, let me take up the

thread of my story. We left Savannah the 1st inst., and a few

hours  afterwards were   steaming down the Savannah   river to
meet                    a fine ocean steamer, plying  between
       the " Isabel,"

Charleston and Havannah, and calling at the Key on her way.

We got on board this larger steamer at 4 p.m., at the mouth of

the river, and started down the coast, which is similar in cha

racter to that of Carolina, already described. At twelve o'clock
on Sunday night we arrived at Key West. Half an hour after

Irickety wooden pier ; a pleasant plight to be sure ! asked

Ithe post-office keeper to allow me to put my trunks and very

look for lodging. He politely complied, and furnished me with

a guide to the Boarding House, for which we were, just starting,

resource, the guide proposed should step into a coffee-house

but they also were full. The proprietor, however, handed me

Here my luck began to mend ; for the bar-keeper remembered

a certain Mr. McCarthy, who had not yet been knocked up,

They are as different as an eagle on its eyrie from the same

   This island is about ten miles long, and is formed of a sort of

modern oolitic limestone ; viz., oolite in the process of forma

Ithe Monday following, and have delivered three lectures at the
Smithsonian Institute.  did not intend more, but was pressed

for a fourth, so agreed to it. The audience is a highly respect

able and intelligent one, and they seem pleased with what they

hear, notwithstanding that my manner is the very reverse of
IYankee fluency.
                        give it to them in the same stumbling,
Iblundering way that practise in Dublin, and yet they seem

to like it.

   The meeting at Charleston, though small, was a very pleasant
one, perhaps more so than if it had been larger, for all the

sections met together ; and thus we had a variety of papers and

subjects, and the observations of different classes of men were

brought out, on each other's pursuits. Thus we had physical

science men, making remarks on natural history papers, and

vice versa --and often the mutual connection between the most

opposite pursuits and sciences was thus made apparent. Even

Imy Algae were lugged in, by men who had been investigating

the course of the sea currents ; and was surprised to hear
Iincidentally (since
                      came to Washington) that some random
Iobservations which had made about the distribution of the

IAlgae on these  coasts had preceded me here,  and  were  thought

interesting.     repeat one little story :--
Professor Bache, the superintendent of the coast survey-- a
man of first-rate reputation in physical science -- gave us an

account of the examination of sand, dredged at various depths

on the coast by the officers attached to the survey. Many
hundred bottles of this sand were put up --carefully labelled,
depth and situation noted, &c.--and were then submitted to a

naturalist for examination. That gentleman found in the sand

multitudes of microscopic shells (see account of Foraminifera
in (Seaside Book), and also that the species varied in the dif

ferent parcels. Further, that according to the depth of water,

the species were different ; and this with so much certainty, that
it required but an examination of as much sand as stuck to the
deep-sea lead to tell the depth of the water. When Professor
Bache sat down, Lieutenant Maury of the U.S.N, got up.

He has written much on meteorology and oceanic currents ; is

superintendent of the Observatory here, and well known at this
side of the Atlantic, as also among scientific men at our side. He

said that the paper just read seemed to him to be the first step

in what he might call conchological navigation, or groping one's

way in hazy weather, by aid of a knowledge of the bottom ;

and then he told a story of having been himself out in an open

smack, without nautical instruments on board; how a dense

fog came    on, and they did not  know where         they were.                              But the

the meeting, and brought forward many very brilliant, though

evils, through which not merely Ireland, but England, has to
Istruggle in the coming half century.

help looking anxiously forward in many ways. As to church

matters, the decision on the Gorham case has created much

scandal, and may lead eventually to great changes in the

position of the English Church. There is a growing desire

Iamong her sounder members for freedom from state trammels ;

and believe she has life enough to throw off the yoke, and to

survive and flourish, if only this could be done by a united

movement in all ranks, both of her clergy and laity. But that

bishops appointed by the state should head such a movement,
is not to be looked for, until the State has oppressed them

beyond endurance. It is idle, however, for me to give vent to

such thoughts.

the Atlantic2 in something over ten days, so we shall say
nothing but that there's a pair of them, and long life to them,

across some of these days in as good style, &c.
   As to jealousy between the two nations, it is every day

Ibecoming more foolish, which is the natural result of a closer

intimacy, but trust it may all wear out in time. We (I speak

nationally) think you (nationally again) very prejudiced, and
you think us so, and in my sober opinion we are both very right
in our estimate of each other, but we are both pretty blind to
our own failings. However, the more we get mixed together
the more this sectarian rust will brush off, and then what

  I was really very glad to see him --meeting him here recalled
Iall the other pleasant faces and agreeable people that had

met in Charleston, and thus turned him into something of an

I Iold friend. So set to, to discourse Mr. S., who found had
Ileft Charleston almost as soon as did, and so had nothing new

to tell me. But he was very full of a book that he has just

written, the object of which is to prove that all mankind came

from Adam and Eve, in opposition to Dr. H. and Agassiz, who

say it is no such thing.
   What he wanted of me was to tell him where to find Pro

fessor Scouler, one of our savants, who is also an ethnologist

and a unity man. The college porter could not tell him where

Scouler lived, or whether there was any such person as Scouler

in Dublin--or in the world. Oh fame ! here was a learned

doctor of Charleston come across half the world to see a learned

doctor of Dublin, and finds the janitor of Trinity College

ignorant of the very existence of the Professor. Fortunately

Dr. S. remembered my name, and still more fortunately (a

Ireverend friend wanted,
                              proposed to start in search of Dr.

Scouler, and so off we set, at past ten o'clock at night, to find

the Doctor, who lives in lodgings in the suburbs, more than a

mile from College. When we got to the house, the servant

seemed disposed not to let us in, but on sending my name up

stairs  (I  said nothing of   my friend), we were   osfho"wontiuump,  and
there       found the Doctor  enjoying his notions                    cum

at a table, smoking a long pipe ; a large j>aper of tobacco (a
heap, twelve inches diameter, and eight inches high, on an open

sheet of paper), and a folio edition of Aristotle in Greek open

on the table before him. When he saw the stranger the pipe

was laid down, and they tackled to the unity of the races.

    I did not write to you last week, being the 4th of July,
Iwhen was too much absorbed in loyal grief over that melan

choly anniversary to venture a pen across the Atlantic.

   There is no need to tell you what has been with us the

absorbing topic of last week's conversation --the great loss the

country has sustained in the death of Sir Robert Peel. Only

sixty-two years of age, and for forty years he had stood in a

prominent public position, and for  Amllanpyarotfiesthohsaeveyeuanrsite^dfilleidn
the first place in the ministry.

mourning his loss, and showing respect to his memory ; and

especially in the manufacturing districts marks of public

sympathy have been awarded. The Assembly of France

paid a higher compliment to him than our own House of

Lords, in placing a minute on their journals expressive of
sympathy --a most remarkable tribute to the memory of an

Englishman from Frenchmen. The same week witnessed the
death of the old Duke of Cambridge --a good old soul, but no

loss to the public generally, save to the many charities where

he presided, and for which his presence at their public dinners

Iused to encourage subscriptions. And now to-day has died

here poor Jack Spain, an old cripple that used to employ to

bring parcels between the college and the quay. He had a

donkey and cart, and earned a miserable livelihood by carrying

parcels, but was so much of a cripple that his customers had to
help him to put up anything that was at all heavy. And now

he has died while the bells are tolling for a royal duke. The

contrast is so great between the conditions of these two that if

we are to judge of man by his physical and mental development,
one is tempted to believe in the " unity of the races," in spite

of Dr. H. and Agassiz. When you see such a hiatus between

two who are certainly descended from a common stock, there is

hope for the Negro still.                      I look forward

Ithere through the country, but nowhere as yet very severe, and

though some of the crop will be lost, hope fully three-fourths

Iwill be saved. The quality of the potatoes this year is as good

as ever remember it.

The month of August was passed by Dr. Harvey in company

with some relatives at Cushendall, a village on the northern

shore  of the  c"owuanltkyinogf  Antrim, where he describes his  time as
being  spent,                    about" and the " dirty work of  picking

and cleaning seaweeds." While at this place he received
a letter from Mrs. Alfred Gatty, a lady well known in the

literary world. He found in the intellectual mind of his new

correspondent a kindred delight in the kingdoms of nature,

from which she has drawn so many charming "Parables,"

attractive alike to both young and old.
   Their intimacy increased with their knowledge of each other,

and gradually ripened into warm friendship, and the survivor's

affectionate appreciation of her friend is touchingly displayed iu

the interesting tribute to his memory already noticed in the

Preface to this Memoir.

Mrs. Gatty has kindly furnished the editor with the following

brief account of the commencement of her acqaintance with
Dr. Harvey :--

IYorkshire, a specimen of what took to be the Chrysymenia
Orcadensis of Dr. Harvey's ' Manual,' in fruit. Fruit on this
plant was a desideratum, none having been observed on the

Orkney specimen, and some uncertainty hanging about the

Ispecies in consequence. But knew so little of Algas at the
Itime, that had no confidence in my own opinion, and it was not

till after some weeks' hesitation that I ventured on what then

seemed the formidable1 step of addressing Dr. Harvey personally

on the subject, enclosing a sketch of the supposed Chrysymenia,

and offering to send the plant itself, if worth his attention.
  " It is an old story, one that has happened to hundreds of

cheered and charmed by the loan of the thirty-eight numbers then out, of the

others, and Dr. Harvey's kindness on the occasion is but one of
many similar instances. But the plant is still a rare one, and
his letters tell its history very prettily, besides showing the
amiability with which he received the least morsel of assistance
from amateurs, however ignorant."

   " The correspondence which had opened so auspiciously for me
went on for some months upon Algae. Dr. Harvey professed
himself glad of a correspondent from ' a new part of the coast,
and one little explored ;' and I, on the other hand, was proud to

find myself in the position of even making an attempt at being
useful to the author of the ' Phycologia Britannica.' But this

was not all. Very, very early the kind-hearted sympathetic
nature of the individual man showed itself unmistakably. In

the letter in which he assured me a correspondent from a new

part of the coast was valuable, he said how glad he was to hear
' another instance of pleasure derived from the study of natural
history, taken up for amusement either in sickness or sorrow,'
and sent a copy of his ' Seaside Book ' for my children. Dry
letters of information his never were, even on dry subjects.
While still addressing me as ' Dear Madam,' and treating of
nothing but Algae, he would indulge in a little outbreak of fun."

" Letters on marine botany, however, even when amusing as

well as instructive, are hardly in place in a memoir ; and it was

many years before our correspondence became less special in
Iits character. Yet it was through marine botany it did so. In

compiling an introduction to the study of seaweeds, a ' Horn

Iterms intelligible to young students and amateurs ; and took

council with him on the subject. To what purpose, a few letters

selected from the mass of kind ones written to help me in my
work, and which will appear in their proper place, will show.

That his help was needed was enough for Dr. Harvey. He was

ready with it at all times  and seasons, answering questions,                  giving

mere folly to write on so hackneyed a subject as the Causeway,

On Sunday last at Cushendall (it was stormy Sunday, and we;     I
were shut up in the house) our quietude was broken by seeing

Causeway.    was very glad to meet them, and we had half-au-

hour's pleasant chat before they set off. They moved at rapid

rate, driving through the country at the greatest speed, and

stopping for nothing by the way. Here at the Causeway they

merely called en route, running down to the shore with guide

and back again, and, of course, missing all the beauties of the

cliffs, which to us are the chief charm of the place. The Cause
way itself is of course the most wonderful part of the shore, and
you may walk over it in half-an-hour and bring away a tolerable
memory of its structure ; and you may see, in the same space of
time, the neighbouring cliffs^ which are very beautiful in their
way, and a fair sample of the rest ; but there are splendid walks
along the tops of the cliffs for miles, following the indentations
of the coast, where every turn opens some new and beautiful
or grand form that such hasty tourists miss altogether. The
basaltic pillars extend a long way, in some places being very
perfect, in others obscure, and sometimes curved or twisted,
sometimes straight. Then there are cliffs where the rocks are
stained red, brown, and black, which contrast well with the

green patches that cover their less precipitous sides, while the
white waves, dashing at their feet, add another colour to the
picture. The general aspect of the country round is bleak and
bare in the extreme, but not the less welcome to us on that
account, as it the more strongly remiuds us of our favourite
Miltown, where we first saw the ocean, and where there is not

Ia tree for miles around. When you come over mean to bring

you here and to insist on your staying long enough to see it
properly. There is a very comfortable hotel. There are sundry
matters to pick up on the shore and plenty of seaweeds. Among

Ithe latter have just picked up a battered stem of a large
Iseaweed, which gathered in perfection at Halifax, and which

is new to our shores, but my specimen, covered with barnacles,
seems to have been long adrift, and may have been washed
across the ocean to these shores, so that it is hardly honest to

Ipublish it as an Irish plant. We have three more days to spend

here, and hope they may be fine. Yesterday was charming, at
Duuluce Castle and the rocks about it.

       What a sad death occurred at one of your New York hotels
lately, that of Mrs. Bell Martin, an heiress in her own right to
half an Irish county ! Her father used to say that the avenue
to his house was thirty-six miles long! for you travelled that
distance after entering his estate before you reached it. In
fact he was more like a petty prince than a private gentleman,

and was commonly called "King of Connemara." Irish

extravagance and election expenses for several generations, with
carelessness and indolence in managing the property, encumbered
the fine estate with enormous debts; but nevertheless his
daughter succeeded, it was supposed, to an income of 10,000Z.,
per annum. Then came the famine and pestilence, and swept
his tenantry off the face of the land. Then the poor-rates, to

weary with the constant report of meetings and speeches about

Ithe new Popish bishops. For the last month they have been

daily filled with the subject, and heartily hope the result may

be that some good and sensible measures may be taken to put

the poor church in a state of organization, which will enable her

to meet the enemy. Nothing can be more anomalous than her

present situation. She has bishops, but without episcopal

power. No bishop can control his clergy except through the

civil courts, and then there are so many appeals from one court

Ito another, that it is ten to one but the bishops will be worsted

after having been put to enormous legal charges. How wish

city, is a small place, but beautifully situated. It is built on

and among a number of small hills, with deep valleys between ;

the houses neat and of stone (Armagh marble), and the streets

clean. There is a very respectable public park for the citizens,

neatly enclosed, and with gravelled walks. But our attraction

was the cathedral, which stands on the highest hill quite above
all the other buildings. We arrived after a two hours' drive on

an Irish car, and entered the church just as the Psalms were
begun. The service was choral, of course --well performed, and

the music very good ; but what delighted me especially was to
see nave, aisles, and every part beautifully clean -- a rare thing
Iin our cathedrals. Most of them are dilapidated --shame on
our bishops, deans, and chapters.  was also greatly pleased to
find that there were no pews -- all open seats -- the rich and poor

treated alike, and half of the congregation were of the humbler

classes. All the seats were cushioned with the same stuff, and

each person had a hassock to kneel on. There was nothing to

prevent a mixture of ranks in the same seat ; but on looking

over the congregation you saw that each had gone to the side

where it saw most of its neighbours. The building has been

restored from dilapidation by the present primate, who expended

20,000£ of his personal property on the good work ; and it does

him great credit. It is in early Gothic style, before very pointed

arches came into fashion. Compared with an English cathedral,

the whole is small and simple. I never enjoyed the choral

service so much, or felt that it was so un operatic.
   After service, we walked about the town, and climbed an

other hill, on which a Roman Catholic cathedral is being built

in a style of magnificence which will quite throw the Old Church

into littleness. The famine, however, interrupted the work,

and for the last five years nothing has been done.

   On another hill is the Observatory ; but as it was Sunday

we only climbed this so far as to get a view of the primate's

park and palace -- a worthy residence for the chief of the church,

and such as St. Paul never enjoyed, nor even St. Patrick. The

Ipresent occupant is a very estimable character, and greatly

beloved by rich and poor ; but, am sorry to add, is nearly

eighty, so that we cannot hope to have him much longer ; and

we may have in his place some good-for-nothing supporter of

Government. Oh, the poor Church ! No wonder we do not

Dr. F                                              T.C.D., March 20, 1851.

       Iand attended a meeting last evening to hear

some addresses detailing the operations of the Irish society,

established, in connection with the church, for the purpose of

instructing the Celtic population of our western and southern

counties, through the medium of the Irish language. This

society (a voluntary one) has been at work for some years, and
is now showing fruit ; so that you need not be surprised (should
you live many years longer) to hear of Ireland becoming anti-

Roman, while England, or at least her aristocracy, are Roman

izing. One of the speakers was the Rev. T. Moriarty, a most

devoted clergyman, who has now a large congregation, the

result of his labours for the fourteen or fifteen years that a wild

mountainous district in Kerry has been under his care, which
till then had not had a Protestant minister since the Reforma
tion --nor was there a Protestant in the parish. Now, however,
the scene is changed. At a recent confirmation held by the

bishop, a hundred and forty were confirmed in one church, which

has a congregation of over five hundred. The change in faith

Iis exhibited in the greatly improved condition of the peasantry.

  cannot enter into the long history, but may send it to you in
print one of these days. Mr. Moriarty told us many anecdotes

illustrating his mode of dealing with the people, and also of the

magical effect which the Irish language has in reaching their
Ihearts, clearly showing that it is a most important moral

agent. One of his stories shall try and relate :--

About two years ago, soon after the rebellion of 1848, Mr.

Moriarty was travelling on the mail car from Killarney to
Kenmare. They left Killarney in the evening. The road (a
very picturesque one) winds among the mountains and through

a very wild country, beautiful by day but gloomy enough by
night. Going up the first hill, they overtook two country

fellows who seemed rather groggy. They had some wild talk

with the driver ; and, saying that they would be in Kenmare as

soon as the car, they jumped over the fence and started off

across the country. The car went on, and the circumstance

was nearly forgotten, when, on ascending one of the long hills

(it

                                              ;
being now quite dark), the same two fellows jumped out

again on the road, laughing and boasting that they were before

the car. Up they mounted (sans ceremonie), and squeezed

themselves in between the passengers. Immediately they

became boisterous singing rebellious songs and others, damn

ing the Protestants and lauding the Pope, dealing in curses of
the most fearful character --and all this in both English and
Irish --till not only they, but the driver and all the passengers

(Mr. Moriarty excepted) got wild with excitement, whooping
and hallooing at the top of their voices.
                                                                     pretty fix this for

and he then began to sing in Irish translation of Heber's
lines, " Thou art gone to the grave, but we will not deplore

thee," &c. (which has been beautifully translated into Irish by
Conellan), and this he sang to the exquisite old Irish air,

"Savourneen Deelish." The effect was instantaneous. The
rude and violent passions were quelled --the car was stopped --
he had to sing again --then to repeat the words slowly, and
                            it

to end with expounding them. So, taking the song as his text,

he preached to them on the side of the road, in the darkness,

while they stood attentive and respectful listeners. During

the remainder of the journey into Kenmare, he was the chief

of the car. He had won their hearts completely, and this

were not surprised at their effect. Mr. Moriarty is a native of
Kerry, and is himself a convert. He is thorough master of the
Irish character, and of the many avenues to the Celtic heart.
At one moment he is full of wit and fun--in the next, touchingly
pathetic ; again, strongly persuasive and eloquent ; and, by
acute cross-questioning, he forces admissions which lead to con
viction. When such gifts of nature are combined with devoted
zeal and active benevolence, one cannot wonder at his success.

IAs to the papal aggression debates, am thoroughly sick of

the subject. The country is much misinformed on the true

state of the matter, and hardly knows what to be at. Our

      am glad to hear that you have seen Niagara, though your stay

there was greatly too short for a full enjoyment of that glorious

scene. As a waterfall it is indeed unequalled, and those who

are disappointed in it are either unreasonable or unthinking.

Yet I think Mrs. Jameson, the art-lady,1 expresses disappoint
ment. It must be from some defect of vision, or from a wish

to be different from the rest of the world. On me the effect

was very much as you describe. An overpowering feeling of
awe at the display of quiet majesty --a feeling partly made up

from the scene passing before my eyes, and partly from the

thought that those waters had been rolling in the same manner

unruffled, uumuddied, and undiminished for untold ages : that

summer and winter, storm and sunshine made no difference more

than as a passing shadow. These, and the thousand kindred

Ithoughts which they suggested, have left an impression on mj

saxifrage from the roof, which roof, although no bigger than an

ordinary round table, bore a considerable fauna and flora on its

flat.

    I find the days and nights too little for my work at

present, having two folks pulling at me, and having to leave
home again in a' week, to give lectures in Clonmel, all which

Icuts up my time for gossip to a minimum.
       suppose you know we have been to Switzerland, and how
we attempted to climb Mont Blanc, but came back next day
from the Grand Mulets like drowned rats, beaten on every
tack. Wind and weather assailed us, and we had to retreat.
Our first misfortune occurred in crossing the glacier below the
Mulets. Here you know the ice is very much crevassed, and
the traject is made by many zigzags along narrow ridges of ice,
and by jumping ice-ditches, or crossing them on ladders. We
were well in the middle of this work, when we had a storm of
thunder, lightning, and hail, after which time fine moments
were the exception, stormy ones the rule. We continued, how
ever, to advance to the Mulets (at 11,000 feet). These you
know are a rather steep ridge of tall black rocks standing in
the middle of the glacier. Here were our quarters for the
night, on a shelf just big enough to hold the four of us, with a
wet blanket to sit on, and an old tablecloth stretched over our
heads. Above was the cold sky, from which we were favoured
with rain, hail, snow, and vapour at various intervals during the
night. When morning rose, we found nothing but dense
clouds in every direction, and as we could not go on, we were
forced to go back. Hardly had we set out when the cloud
changed to heavy rain, unabated during the whole of our way

back to Chamounix. So much for all I shall probably ever see
of Mont Blanc. Our party were Hooker, Thomson, J. P., and

W. H. H.
    Of course we left Chamounix next morning, route by Mar-

tigny, Vevey, Borne, Thun, to Interlacken, where we left the two
ladies, and set off for a fortnight of wnlking. From Lauter-

brunnen we crossed the Ischingel glacier to Kandersteg --a
glorious walk, but rather fatiguing, it being one of fourteen

 hours, four of which were in heavy snow, and two others on a
 moraine of loose sharp stones. But the scenery repaid the toil .
 Then by the Oemmi to Leuk, and so on to Zermatt at the foot

left it by the Weiss Thor for Macugnaga.                             am sure you did

not pass the Weiss Thor. We had to descend all but a preci

pice from 12,000 fset to 4000 (the level of the valley), a most

monkey-and-cat proceeding. In one place we had literally to

hold on by hands and toes, with our faces to the wall, and

nothing visible below save a cliff going sheer down into a white

misty vapour, which steamed up from the valley. Fortunately

there was no wind. The descent was partly by rocky precipices

and partly by steep snow banks. Neither Hooker nor Thomson

had seen such a place in all their travels, and certainly there was

nothing on Mont Blanc so disturbing to the head. We crossed

Ithe Moro in a fog, and so back to Visp, and up the valley to the

Grimsel, where remembered the album you spoke of, and saw

the mosses, &c, and Agassiz's writing. Hence to Interlacken,
Lucerne, &c, and down the Bhine. We stopped at Wiesbaden

to attend the German scientific meeting, and the ladies read

Longfellow at Heidelberg under an umbrella. Then Cologne,

Brussels, and the Belgian cities, and very glad to get back to

                           CHAPTER XII.

  VOYAGE TO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE OVERLAND ROUTE

                             TO INDIA --CEYLON.

In August, 1853, Dr. Harvey, with the approval and encourage
ment of the Board of Trinity College, set out on that voyage

to the South Sea Islands which had been from his boyhood the
subject of his dreams and wishes. He could not look forward
now with the fearless, joyous anticipation of his boyish days,
for time and the vicissitudes of life had told, in a more than
ordinary degree, upon his peculiarly sensitive temperament ;
but he still retained sufficient elasticity of spirit, as welT as
mental and bodily vigour, to render this long-desired survey
of the Southern Hemisphere a very delightful prospect. But
he did not now undertake it so much for personal gratification,
as with the hope of enriching by his researches the Algological
department of the College Herbarium.

   The particulars of this extended voyage and travel are, like
those of his American tour, to be found in the letters to his

sister, which form as before a pretty complete journal. It had

been his intention, at his return home, to have revised them for
publication ; but his failing energy, increased botanical engage
ments, and more especially, his distrust as to their favourable
reception with the public, led him to abandon the idea. The
editor will now endeavour to confine her extracts to such parts
as appear desirable from their bearing on Dr. Harvey's character,
regard being had at the same time to the incidents and objects
which seem best calculated to render the narrative interesting.
His first letter bears date 10th of August, and is written on
board the Mediterranean steamer after having landed at
Gibraltar, where he and his party explored the places usually

attractive to strangers. When climbing the rock, Dr. Harvey's

observation was of course directed to the vegetation. He saw a

small tuft of maiden-hair fern (Adiantum capillus) springing out
of a dry rock by the road side, and at once concluded that at

another season there must be plenty of water trickling through

the limestone ; and a few other dried-up mosses and fems told

him a similar story. The Poke tree appears to have especially

Iinterested him. He writes : " After climbing some way, we

reached the guard-house, where was struck by a novel-look

ing tree thirty or forty feet high, with a trunk as thick as my

body, and well covered with leaves. When at a little distance,

Iseeing pendant green blossoms, took it for a Spanish chesnut,
Ibut on coming closer was utterly astonished to find it a

Phytolacca, or ' Poke.' Perhaps the ' Virginian Poke ' may

be seen in College gardens, a small vulgar-looking weedy thing,

like a largo Chenojwdium more than anything else, and that
was my preconceived notion of ' one of the family.' But the

Gibraltar Poke is a very beautiful and thickly-leaved shady tree,
Iwith no trace of herbaceous matter about its branches.

known there was an arborescent species here, but little expected

Ito see it on such a grand scale. Had it not been in blossom,

should not have recognized it. It is common on the rock every

where about."

of an hour spent in the cathedral, where high mass was being

performed, with<Jhe full ceremonial of dress, incense &c., "it was

pleasant," Dr. Harvey writes, " to go for a few minutes into the

gardens with thousands of dates in fruit and oleanders in flower                           :

the city. It

   All the long day we were tugged through the canal, and just

as the sun went down we reached its junction with the river of

Egypt. As the sun set, the full moon rose before us on the broad

waters of the Nile the sky was beautifully clear, the region

the evening sky, all very lovely.

My eyes have now become as familiar with the date palm as

with the hawthorn or the sloe. Moore has quite mistaken its

character where he mentions --

calenders in the " Arabian Nights."

   As the day went on all eyes were of course bent in the direc

distance, very faint in colour, but sharply defined against the

sky, and looking quite as gigantic at this distance as they after

   about half-past  eight in the evening,  under a bright full moon," in

a van holding six passengers, with a convoy of four accompany

road for the first stage, after which all cultivation ceased, and

they entered on the stony or sandy flats of the desert. Here
they soon overtook the caravan of camels with the luggage, " a

long line of patient burden-bearers tied together, and following

with measured tread in single file." The night cool and pleasant.

They stopped for refreshment every four hours, when he found a

cup of hot tea a complete preventive of thirst.
   " There is little," he writes, " to be seen in the desert but the

' riddlings of creation ' (quoting Bums), and a few stunted

shrubs, or a tree at long intervals, and all along the road-side

the skeletons of hundreds of camels that have died there. The

Arabs will not kill the dying camel, but when he falls down and

will not rise again, he is unladen, his burden distributed to the

others, and the poor brute left to die of hunger and thirst.

After day-break we passed one of these unfortunates, still alive,

but with a great hole in one side, from which on our approach

two ravens flew up, and there were several vultures perched at

a little distance waiting for their meal. They do not touch him

while life lasts, but quickly strip the carrion from the bones.

You could see nothing for them to eat, but no doubt they find

pasture."

   After eighteen hours of desert journeying, the travellers

reached Suez, where, in the cool of the evening, at low water,

Dr. Harvey took a stroll on the yellow sands of the sea-shore.
Scooping up some handfuls of shelly sand, he found it to con

250 MEMOIR OF DR. HARVEY.

From Aden Dr. Harvey sailed for Point de Galle, Ceylon,

where he landed on the 5th of September, and was welcomed
with hearty kindness and attention by Dr. Kelaart, to whom he

had been furnished with a letter of introduction.

In a country drive of eight miles with this gentleman on the

evening of his arrival, he made his first acquaintance with the

tropical scenery of this beautiful island ; and his delight was
Ilittle exceeded by that which he had experienced on his first
landing at Cape   Town.     "How longed," he         writes,  "for
Mr. Ward, as we  drove for                          ' Ward's

looking out of one window or the other. The first part of the

drive we entered a cocoa-nut forest. Thousands of this lovely

palm-tree at all ages, their trunks bending in every direction ;

the great leaves of the young and vigorous ones, and the smaller
crowns of the old, showing the ' rise and fall ' of vegetable life

very strikingly. The large drooping plumes of the Caryota

look like those on hearses, if one can fancy them magnified
for a giant's use. It would make a superb colonnade for a

cemetery. The evening fell, and on our return, as we drove

along in the darkness, the air was sparkling with fireflies.

  I rose early the next morning, and crossed the harbour in a

canoe, over high ground-swells, very pleasant to ride over, as the
Iboat sat like a cork on them, bolt upright. When we landed,
   and my servant started up a narrow pathway through the

jungle, full of wild flowers and shrubs, and shaded by numerous

Iscrew-pines.  After some time we got to the seaside of the

point, and     went down on the rocks to pick. It was just

possible, by running in and out at the retreat and advance of

every wave, to pick a bagful of Algae, while showers of spray

were giving me a pleasant bath.

as approached.

it gave, as for a fancied protection from elephants and bears,

which abound in these forests, and which my coolies expected

to see start from every bush. We went in single file, the torch-

the tanks, and passed their traces repeatedly. Of these there

could be no mistake, the great foot-prints marking the road

monkey or ape with white whiskers, several of which were leap

ing from tree to tree, and making a great noise. Plenty of

jungle fowl, pigeons of many kinds, green and blue-plumaged
birds unknown to me, and now and then a hawk or a kite were

seen. At any other than this sultry season, no doubt much

more of both animal and vegetable life would have been
abroad, but in some places there had not been rain for four or

five months.

On the evening of the 20th we got to Galeaga, forty-six

miles of our route. About three miles short of this place we

were overtaken by a thunder-storm, with heavy rain, much noise

Iand vivid lightning ; and as thought it better to walk with
Imy umbrella than lie in bed to be rained on, started off from

Ithe bearers, and had a quick, invigorating, delightful walk

through the rain for the rest of the stage, which enjoyed as

a young duck would have done, the previous heat had been so

overpowering.

  INext day pursued my journey ; and after having proceeded

Btream, but in a muddy patch of water, to which bullocks in

hundreds resorted. It was full of small fish, which came about

Ime and tickled me, trying to bite. Similar tame fishes flocked

round me by hundreds in the small rivers where bathed. Our

Iresting-place for that night was Damboul, seventy miles from

Trincomalee, where remained half a day, for the purpose of

visiting some famous rock temples, said to be two thousand

years old, and probably built by an earlier race of Cingalese
than the feeble people that now claim them. We started in

the cool of the  morning, as the    res"t-Whohusaet,"kesaeipderI,  told me    there
would be mass    at seven o'clock.                                  " surely   they
are not Roman Catholics ?" "Oh, no, sir," said he, "it is a
IBuddhist mass."
                  hired a guide, and set forth. After a short

way, we turned from the road into a shady path, to ask permis

sion from a priest. His house was well set up, with a grove of

cocoa-nuts and a planted garden round it. No doubt his

reverence is in good case. He was dressed in the usual yellow

robe, and graciously allowed us to proceed. We then began to

ascend the naked face of a steep granite rock ; and, after

mounting some way, entered a gully, through which steps had

been cut. This brought us out on a platform of rock, where

Plumerias had been planted for ornament, but they looked rather

dry, and here we entered the enclosure of the temple. These

temples are not buildings, but cavernous excavations near the

summit of the rock. It seemed to me as though advantage had

been taken of some natural hollow, which had been cut deeper,

the front being closed up by a wall. There are five of these

hollowed in the rock. To describe one describes all. You

enter a low door in the front wall, and find yourself in a dimly

lighted cavern, of no great height, but of considerable area.

A few windows having been opened, you see that there are

images, some small and some of colossean dimensions, ranged
all round, with curtains hanging before them, and painted

canvas ornamented with thousands of pictures of similar deities

stretched over the roof. One colossal figure, thirty to forty feet

long (or perhaps more), was lying on its side in each of the
temples. Other figures were in high-crowned caps, some of

which we were told were "kings;" others, "gods," were stand
ing erect, but the most numerous figures--amounting to hun
dreds --were sitting crosslegged on stools, or thrones, or chairs,
                   CEYLON.                        255

round the temple, leaving a broad passage or aisle behind them.

These were all images of Buddha, and were distinguished from

the others by each having on his head the representation of a
flame (like the " cloven tongues as of fire " that sat on the
apostles). You know that the Buddha is a sort of spirit, which

comes down from generation to generation on different indi

Ividuals, converting them for the time into a sort of incarnate

God --whence, suppose, the multiplication of images. And

as there is some truth, perhaps, lying hid under every supersti

tion, we have here a recognition, running back into times long

preceding the Christian era, of a sensible revelation from the

Deity to mankind. Of this the flame on the head seems a

fitting emblem. The universal expression of the faces of these

Buddhas was melancholy and devotional. The images were all

painted bright yellow. Some were of solid rock hewn out of

the mountain, but the greater portion were built of brick and

Imortar. The place is kept in perfect repair. We did not

witness the mass, which regretted ; but in one of the temples

the perfume of incense remaining from the last celebration was

very obvious. On the face of the rock outside, the guide

pointed to a long writing, deeply and sharply cut in some old

characters not now known, which no doubt gives an account of

Ithe temples. Dr. Hincks would have taken a rubbing, which
   did not, being unprepared therefor.

After leaving Damboul, the road became much more open.

IHere two species, one shrubby, the other tree-like, of Cactoid

Euphorbias, which had seen previously here and there, became

so abundant as to be very striking objects. The largest of these

shrubs, but hung loosely in the air, and looked dried up to half
Itheir diameter, but were yet alive at the core.

                                             Pcradenia, September 24.

I have just arrived here, and am in Mr. Thwaites' comfort

able house, but have nearly forgotten the thread of my story
in seeing him, and feeling that the mail will close in half an
hour. From Matelie to this place the country is utterly dif

ferent and most beautiful --a perfect paradise of wooded hills,

open valleys with rich vegetation, and glorious forms of tropical

plants.      The road for  part  of the way led through   coffee  planta
tions,   now laden with    ripe                          at this  season.

Here and there were wild spots --the ground covered with
ferns --Aspl. nidus sitting on old trees, and great store of flowers,

&c., &c. One old tree was quite covered with an epiphyte

orchis. There was Indian shot, and several others of the same
family -- balsams, small passion-flowers, and lots of other
Icreepers --a red "blackberry," which ate, and found insipid.
IPalms again abundant -- the cocoa, Areca, Caryota, &c., &c.
Iwas lost among the new and strange forms.
                                                         shall write a
Idescription of Peradenia when know it better. At present
I am only conscious of having driven through an avenue of

tropical plants, and seen other avenues spreading on all sides

through fields, and parks, and lawns, with a border of hills like

the happy valley of Rasselas.

                                                                                                    September 28.

  I have been received by Mr. Thwaites with the most brotherly
I Ikindness. - Were at Plassey could not find myself more at

home.

   Now for Peradenia. -- A botanic garden under the line is very

unlike Glasnevin, for there are no hothouses, and what is more

wanted is a eooZ-house. The grounds cover 140 acres, surrounded

on three sides by the river ; and beyond the river are wooded
hills rising one behind the other, and indeed the distant ones may

be called mountains. There are valleys and vistas between the

hills, and lovely peeps up and down them. There is a satin-

wood bridge of one light openwork arch thrown across the river

near the entrance to the garden, the grounds of which are

diversified like those of         Glasnevin  on   asmlaalrlgehillssc,al"e.in  Mr.

Thwaites's house is        built
midst of the garden        "--a   pretty little verandah cottage, with

flowers and climbers in front. At the entrance of the garden

is a fine group of palms, of which the famous " Talipot" is the
grandest. Beds of yuccas are at either side, together with
enormous Uranias (travellers'-tree), which have acquired large

trunks by age, and resemble great fans of peacocks' feathers
--such as are carried before the Pope on grand holidays. When
the sheath of a young leaf is pierced, out gushes a stream of
very good water, whence the name of " travellers'-tree." The
garden is very well kept for a tropical one, where weeds grow
so rapidly. Thwaites pointed out several large trees, over
twenty feet high, which he had planted as seeds only three
years ago. Weeds here are frequently shrubs or trees which
must be uprooted. The Caryota palm is a very troublesome

weed in the garden. It bears a profusion of berries, which are

scattered about by squirrels and birds, and spring up everywhere.
The beautiful Thunbergia, which we prize as a hothouse plant,
is here a most troublesome weed, clasping small things like our
wild convolvulus. Apple-trees grow here like raspberry bushes,

only clusters of suckers from root buds --neither branch nor
stem. In this state they live, but make leaves only. Few of

the fuchsias can be cultivated. The corymhiflora grows the
best, but can only be forced into flower by destroying its leaf-

buds ; yet China roses do very well: Sweet-briar keeps its scent,
but rarely blossoms. Violets will not do here, but grow in
colder places. The chocolate trees are laden with fruit, and so
are the nutmegs. Bread-fruit we have daily at table. The
oranges are green when lipe, sweet, and well-flavoured, and
better than those we get in Ireland.

                                                                                                        October Gth.

     IOn the 29th ult. Mr. Thwaites and set off for Pallagalla,

forty miles from this, the estate of Mr. Wall, a coffee-planter in
the high country. We were out in all six days, one spent in

had intended on setting out. My visit to Ceylon has been

should have arrived in December and stayed till March. But
'tis a folly to fret ; so for our ride to Mr. Wall's.

    The roadside was often rocky, the rocks in wet places covered
with ferns, of which the most beautiful was Blechnum oricntale,

                                                                                                                s

with pinnate leaves six or seven feet long, the young ones pink

or crimson, changing to pale glossy green. We passed through

the village of Gampola, a coffee centre, in a basin surrounded

by hills covered with coffee plantations. From this village the

road rises for ten miles in inclined planes up the sides of the

hills, in one continued but gradual ascent, the plants changing

with the elevation.

Ferns now abound, and tall lemon-scented grass, its flowering

stems six or eight feet high overhanging the road. Brug-

mansia arborea is a common hedge-weed, and very trouble

some. Gloriosa superba was common, in splendid blossom ; how

unlike the pale-faced apology that graced my conversazione.

Here its colours are crimson, orange, and gold, in their strongest

tints, and its blossoms peer out of the roadside brambles.

As we advanced on our way flowers abounded more and more.

Every wet rock was gay with purple or white balsams, of which

there are many beautiful kinds. The Didymocarpus is a very

pretty little plant, and the Klugia a great beauty, with racemes

of brilliant cobalt flowers. We passed several large waterfalls,

any one of them sufficient to make the fortune of a Swiss

valley. Here they only obtain a casual notice.

As we proceeded, the general aspect of the view ceased to be

tropical, and reminded me more of Devonshire scenery. The

next two days we spent in the jungle, and botanised, making

Pallagalla our head-quarters, but we found little of much value.

We saw noble tree-ferns, twenty to thirty feet high, and

thousands of smaller ones carpeting and festooning every spot
in the thick dark jungle. Rain setting in, we encamped for a

day and night at another coffee-planter's, where we were

hospitably entertained. His plantations extend to 1000 acres,

including different places. Here the plantations are bordered

with rose hedges. It being Sunday, we met several planters at

Mr. E.'s house; their talk not very edifying. Next day we

started for a walk of seven miles to the house of another

planter ; our coolies, ten or twelve in train, carrying our luggage
and plants. We ascended a steep mountain pass, through dense
Ijungle, where were plenty of land leeches, and, as stopped to
Ipick some off my gaiters,  said, "Well, they are not much

I Itrouble after all," when looking at my wrist, there was a great
leech sucking his fill ; this was the only bite got.        must

admit these leeches are annoying ; you cannot stand a moment

on the grass without seeing a troop of them coming towards you

from every side. Fast they come, and are soon up your legs if

you are without gaiters, and they are always hungry. The naked

legs and feet of our coolies were streaming with blood. They

abound everywhere in the grass and dead leaves, nor can you,

when walking in the garden, leave the gravel without being
attacked. We slept at Mr. P.'s house ; and Mr. Thwaites's

carriage met us next day within eight miles of home, where we
Iarrived safe and well.

                                Colombo, Ceylon, November 1, 1853.

IBetween Peradenia and Colombo we passed several of
the great talipot palms in full flower, the first  had seen.
This is the largest of the fan palms. It takes they say nearly

a century to gather strength for flowering, then it throws up a

huge flower stem, like a tree, from its summit, covered with

myriads of white flowers, bears seed, and dies. Of the leaves

they make tents, mats, hats, baskets, umbrellas, and many

other things. The umorella is very primitive, made by holding

the thin part of the leaf, the broader part shading the wearer

from the sun. When women are working in the paddy fields,

stooping on all fours, twenty in a row, with these leaves tied on

their backs and coming over their heads, they look like large

beetles, and very grotesque. It seems to be always women who

weed the rice fields. Before leaving the hills, we passed many

noble specimens of Cycas (sago palm), which would make the

heart of M. leap within him. Stems twenty to thirty feet high

branching like candelabra, and each branch crowned with leaves.

Four miles from Colombo we crossed a broad river by a bridge

of boats, and soon afterwards the native town or pettah begins,

Idrove out to see the Bishop of Colombo, to whom had a letter

Ifrom Mr. Ward. He was very friendly, and asked me to join a

dinner party in the evening, which did, and found a company

of seventeen, among whom was Sir Anthony Olipliant, Chief

Justice, an old acquaintance of mine at the Cape. After dinner

we had music, viz., anthems and hymns, the latter sung in

chorus. The night being dark, the avenue from the gate to

the house was lit up with cocoa-nuts fixed on sticks, filled with

their own fat, and furnished with stout wicks. They made capital

Iextempore flambeaux. The Bishop is a very agreeable man, but

very unpopular with the greater part of the persons have

come across in the island : the fault they find with him is that he
Iis too high church.
                      suppose he tries to act consistently, and
Ithey prefer a laxer rule than the church has ordained.
                                                         fancy

many of the parishioners are dissenters, who assent to a very

lax churchism, either for convenience or for fashion's sake, but
who know not what spirit they are of. These cry " Puseyism !

Puseyism !" at what is really only sober Church of Englaud

after all. He is building close by his house a very pretty little

church as his cathedral. It would be a modest parish church

in England, but here it shines forth as the only stone church in

the island, all the others being lath and plaster. He told me it
had all been built by native workmen, with the exception of

the carpentry work inside, which is all being done by a

handy soldier, whose heart is evidently in the work. The seats,

desk, &c., are of satin-wood, very handsome and durable, and

cheap here. They are very tastefully carved in ecclesiastical

fashion, and when finished will be beautiful. A handsome stone

font was sent from England, and bells and candlesticks are on
Itheir way. All will be in keeping. A native choir are in
training, so anthems will not lack.  asked the bishop what

the building had cost. He could not exactly say, but that it was

paid for, from the commencement, every Saturday night, and

he hoped it would continue to be so ; it does not owe a penny.

The work is solid stone and wood, and the building so planned

that it can be enlarged to any required size without injuring its
beauty. It is now finished, except to put in the windows, which

are coming from England, and to pave the chancel with encaustic

tiles. The whole is very creditable to the designer and workers.

Attached to the cathedral church is a collegiate school under

the bishop's rule, for general education of Europeans and natives.

There are eight boarders at present, about a hundred and fifty
Iout residents, and twenty in the native orphan school.
                                                         hope

this may prove a nucleus of a better condition of the church

than at present exists in the island.

Before leaving Ceylon, Dr. Harvey spent a fortnight at a

little inn at Belligam Bay, for the purpose of collecting

algae, where he was comfortably lodged, and found good accom

modation for drying plants. Here he was joined by his friend

Mr. Thwaites, who came principally to see and take leave of
him. He writes : " Mr. Thwaites arrived yesterday. He will

Iexplore the neighbouring jungle while I work at the shores, and

though we shall part and meet from day to day, hope we shall

be much together." It proved a time of good success. Writing

Ito Mr. Ward, November 20th, he says : --
   " only commenced my algoa hunting ten days ago (the
monsoon not permitting access to the shore till then), and the

first day's work introduced a new Claudea and a Vanvoorstia
{nigra), specimens of both which I enclose, that you may have

Isays: -- "Had done as well in the first two months of my

On the 12th of December, Dr. Harvey left Point de Gaile

in a steamer for Singapore, where, after a few hours' delay,

passengers and luggage were shifted to another vessel about to

start for King George's Sound, New South Wales. The passage
through the Straits of Malacca, with the near view afforded of

the Malayan shores, was not devoid of interest, though the

features of tropical scenery had now in great degree lost their
charm of novelty. At Tenang he and his fellow-passengers landed

to visit a waterfall and in this drive of four miles he found
the same sort of country as in Ceylon -- similar flat roads bor
dered jungle, the same palms, and bananas, and wooded hills
--very pretty, but tame to his eye, now accustomed to " this

everlasting greenery." The culture here, however, of the nut

meg instead of the coffee-tree afforded some diversity, as well

as the   appearance    of  tvheeryrudriafflerpeonpt,ulhaetiownr,itews,ho",   being either

and costume from the long-haired Cingalese." He describes the

nutmeg as a very pretty tree, with leaves in size and shape like

those of the apple-tree, and always laden at the same time -with

both fruit and flowers; the latter, though different in structure,

resembling in form those of the arbutus the fruit like peaches,
                                        ;

and very ornamental.

The letter proceeds :--" We sailed again in the afternoon, and

for an hour or two passed close along the shore, land at each

Iside, like lake and river scenery. Malacca looks very lovely at

this distance, but am not tempted to make its acquaintance

more fully. This evening we passed through floating masses of

green scum, which filled the sea so much that it looked when
turned up by the paddles like so much green pea-soup --a per
Ifect sap -green.
                   did not collect any, as my microscope was
Istowed away in the hold, and so could have made no use of

the green matter ; a poor excuse, for it ought to have been at

hand. It was probably a minute Oscillatoria, or perhaps only

the spores of some green seaweed. Whatever it may have been,
it was immensely abundant -- enough so to entitle the place to

be called the Oreen Sea."

day at Albany, on Princess Royal Harbour, King George's

Sound.

To begin with the first impressions of what he calls this

topsy-turvy country; after having had an exploring walk in the
neighbourhood of Albany, he writes : " The vegetation here has

quite the appearance of that at the Cape ; the same small

shrubs and dry-looking trees of Proteacece, though they are

both generically and specifically different. Bariksias, Dryandras,

Hakeas, Franlclcmdia, etc., are common. About the town some

Cape shrubs and geraniums are completely naturalized. At

Ipresent the prevailing hues of the flowers are white and yellow.
   am told that a month ago, blue, red, and purple were the

most common, and that the whole of the country was one

mass of bloom. The oddest things are the rush-trees, like mops

with thick black handles, ten to twenty feet high. Imagine

these strange objects scattered over the country, sometimes
very thickly. The trunks are always black, from the fires which

are constantly lighted by the aborigines, and which sweep over
the country for miles. The boggy spots have in abundance

tlie curious pitcher-plant (Cephalotus), with a cluster of beautiful
cup-shaped leaves, each with its lid, at the crown of the root ;

no stem, but a slender stalk bearing a few small flowers at the

Itop. It is only known at this spot, and is ' one of the lions.'

huddled up round a fire in the middle of the hut, or lie rolled

up into balls on the ground. They will not willingly come

under roofs, and have a holy horror of soap and water. Their

favourite cosmetic is a red ochrey earth, with which,- when

mixed with grease, they smear their heads and faces. They

are diminishing here as elsewhere, and seem to die the faster,

the more care that is taken of them, and the more it is attempted

to civilize them. Several persons have brought in boys to train

in their houses, when they leadily acquire our language and

adopt our habits ; but when they come to fourteen or sixteen

years, they mostly die. Some who survive will go back to bush

life again, the charms of red ochre and grease being superior to

cleanliness. Archdeacon Wollaston had reared a boy from child

hood who was an intelligent and useful servant, had adopted all

our manners, attended church and family prayers regularly, and

could answer any question usually put to Sunday-school children.

When he was about sixteen, Mr. Wollaston was moving from

Buubury, where he lived, to this place, two hundred miles

distant. The boy came with him half way, then said he

would go no farther, but must go back to his old father, who

was a wild bushman ; and so he threw away his clothes, and

went off to take to blanket, paint, and grease again. Yet he had
lived with Europeans for many years, and, to all appearance,

had been a good Christian.

    The prospect of a harvest of Algae at King George's Sound

continuing but small, Dr. Harvey resolved to try his fortune at

Cape Kiche, having received a friendly invitation from Mr.

Cheyne, a gentleman who had a farm on that shore, to make

his house his home for some weeks. Thither, towards the end

of February, he accordingly went ; but before setting out on this

new kinds." In sending seeds           of land plants,                the Boronia megas-
tigma, and others, he writes, "        One rarely can                 get ripe seed here.

Some plants seem seldom to ripen any seeds, and others are

attacked by troops of maggots, which are deposited in the young

pod, and eat the seed as it matures. This is especially the case

with leguminous plants. The cabbage-tree {Nuytsia flonbwnda),

one of the commonest and most showy of the flowering trees,

and which produces annually sheets of golden orange flowers,

thicker than the leaves, so that the bush looks a blaze of gold,
has never been known to produce a single seed from all this

display. How many centuries since the present stock were

sown we cannot tell, but the only increase is by underground

suckers from the roots of the old trees. These spread to a great

distance, and then form a new stock for themselves. Probably

this tree has some underground parasitic attachment, as it

belongs to the same natural order as the mistletoe."

    The journey to Cape Kiche, being Dr. Harvey's first ex

perience of bush-travelling, claims some notice. He left Albany
in company with two of Mr. Cheyne's carts, their drivers, the sister

of one of them, and a convict servant. As the rate of travel

was three miles an hour, he preferred walking to a seat in the

cart ; so, with the convict as his companion, he amused himself

with picking       t"hseudnduemnelyrouupsseftl,owceorms pbleytetlhye  way. They saw      one

proceeded on their way ; and after twenty-four miles of travel,

have my pannikin filled --and had it accordingly. Our meal

consisted of bread, cold pork, and mutton, the usual bush fare.

After supper we all lay down; the two waggoners and myself

side by side ; the lady slept in one cart, and the convict under

the other, making himself as cosy as circumstauces allowed

of, but decidedly in the worst place."

long after the smaller matters are consumed. Along the

margin of the line of flames, number of crows were hopping,

picking up the crickets and other insects as they fled from the

fire and troops of black cockatoos come to the burnt ground

to pick up the seeds which are plentifully scattered by the heat.

Most of the seeds here are contained in very strong, thick,

woody seed-vessels, which only split open after long basking in

the hot sun, or after bush fires. Such are many of the

Proteaceie (Banksia, Halcea, &c.). The bush had been purposely
set on fire by Mr. C's men, for the double purpose of destroy

it is expected to do after the rains. One sort of yie poison-

bush affects the cows with blindness, another brings on rapid

inflammation. On the road we started several kangaroos,

often quite close. They stopped to look at us, and then hopped

away, leaping over the bushes in double-quick time. There

are very melancholy- voiced frogs here, regular howlers, and

others that make a noise like groaning, or as if inclined to be

sick in the stomach. The cockatoos are awful screamers, and

the crows drawl out a long plaintive whine, between the wail of

a child in distress, the bleating of a sheep, and the bray of an

ass; a compound discord of these three. The strange palm

like rush-trees (Kingia) are very fine about here, and particularly

remarkable for the large mass of decayed leaves which cloak

the upper half of the trunk. Usually these are burnt off, the

fire rarely injuring the life of the trunk, but only blackening

it and destroying its leaves. New leaves, and generally

flowers, quickly spring out, but the cloak, which is the result

of several seasons, is never seen where fires are frequent.

Some few small birds chirp, especially after sunrise, but on the

whole the woods are very quiet, none of the shrill insect noises

which fill the American forests. Pigeons, and red and blue

parrots, start from the thick bushes with very noisy wings.

Leaving Albany on the 2nd of April, after a journey of eleven

days, Dr. Harvey arrived at Perth, Swan River, where he met

with a kind reception from Mr. S., the colonial secretary.

   Passing over his bush   journey,  and   the botanising it afforded,
we find our traveller "   housed "   in a  tolerably comfortable inn

ut Freemantle, the port of Perth. His first walks in this

neighbourhood presented to his notice many things too curious

and interesting to be omitted. In a ramble over the hills,

Icoming to .a sandy pathway, " was struck," he says, " by

seeing a number of little funnel-shaped holes, like those made

by the ant-lion for catching his prey ; but these are the traps

of an underground toad, who sits at the bottom of the hole,

about two feet below the surface, doubtless ready to gobble up

any insect that falls in. On the blown sands were also

abundantly seen sinuous ridges, precisely resembling those so
common on the flags in the streets of Limerick, and which in a
certain publication called ' The Seaside Book ' are referred to

the trails of the marine mollusca. Now the present tracks

mark the underground roads of the mole cricket of this place ;

and if they were consolidated into stone, might puzzle future

geologists who were only up to the marine cause, as the little

Iridges left by the wind resemble those left by water ripple.

Going further, noticed a Banksia tree with some huge woolly

nests of inextricable leafless branchlets. They were not unlike

Hottentot's heads, and are formed when a certain little fly fixes

on a young flower-bud as a nest for its eggs. It pierces the young

bud, and deposits its eggs, and this strange branching excres

cence immediately commences, the plant constantly trying to

form its flowers, while the poison of the insect puncture as

constantly produces monstrous branches.  Sap continues to

flow to the irritated spot, and so the growth there is most

vigorous, keeping up an abundance of juicy nourishing food

for the youug maggot. Such is the history of all the galls, &c.,

found on trees; they abound in this country, but none are

Iso monstrously developed as those of the Banksia cones."

   April 18th. walked to Mongais Lake, a sheet of fresh water

about three miles from Perth, to look for freshwater shells ; but

I only found a Physa, very abundant, and very variable in
Iform, unless confound several species together. Among the

trees which wooded the lake was Banksia prionotes, a handsome

species, with rich orange heads of flowers as large as ostrich
eggs, and very showy. On the 19th Mr. Drummond, the

botanical explorer of this colony, arrived, having come upwards

of forty miles to have a chat with me, and to ask me to visit
him in the country. He had formerly been in charge of the

Botanical Gardens in Cork, and emigrated to this country

twenty-five years ago, since which time he has travelled over

most parts of and to him we owe our knowledge of at leastit,

three fourths of its vegetation. He is a venerable looking

man, with snow-white hair and long beard, square-built frame

and ruddy features, and an intelligent eye, that lights up with
enthusiasm when on his favourite subject. His habit for years

has been to traverse the country in the collecting season with

his three ponies and one or two natives, and to live for months

together in the bush, shifting his quarters as he exhausts each

neighbourhood.  He had many things to tell me about the

local vegetation, and particularly of several new and curious

genera which he had recently discovered in a newly-opened

country three hundred miles to the northward. He gives a

most glowing account of its vegetable riches, reports two new

genera of Proteacese, besides innumerable beautiful species of

the same order, and a superb Vertieordia, with brilliant crimson

flowers as large as half-a-crown (the usual size of the flowers
of the old species being a threepenny piece), and the shrubs

perfect sheets of bloom, so beautiful that the waggoner who

drove him used to stop and turn his bullocks out of the road, to
avoid trampling down this plant. Mr. D. gathered so much of

day we had a walk together by the river-side and over the

must try to give you some idea of this fair island with so foul
a name, which is Dutch, and means " Bat's nest," the Wallaby

or kangaroo-rat being plentiful here.

The reefs, like those at Freemantle, are limestone, and re

semble tiligree-work, putting on the most diverse forms, often

reminding me of miniature hills and valleys ; in some places

extremely difficult to walk on, from the sharp points that stick

out everywhere.  Many parts are all honeycombed.            Those

under water, accessible at spring-tides, are still more extraor

dinary. Some of these extend in horizontal shelves, merely
fixed in the centre like mushrooms on their stalks. The

Irock pools are of magnificent dimensions, and ten or twelve

feet deep ; the water clear as crystal -- had almost said as

air; and when the surface is calm, the view therein is extremely
beautiful. The sea anemones do not equal those at Miltown,

nor are there richly-studded urchin-pools, but this is compen
sated for, in the richness and luxuriance of the Algaj which

and much diversified in form. Some are like ostrich feathers,

and equally large and soft, others like the tails of squirrels or

Persian cats. Others, again, like strings of beads. Mixed with

the red Algae and Corallines they have a beautiful effect.

Rottonest has one fault at this season. There is but one tide

in the twenty-four hours, and it so happens that at spring tides
(which are the only times the reefs are bare) low water occurs

The most common tree is a cypress (Cattitris Preissii), with leaves
of a bright cheerful green, a very unusual tint among the

sombre-leaved trees of Australia. Two kinds of Acacia form

dense shrubberies difficult to walk through. A leguminous
shrub called Templetonia is also very abundant, and just now

the gayest plant here, being covered with its large crimson

flowers. A hoary shrub called Stenochilus, with flowers not unlike

a Salvia, varying from yellow to orange or blood red, is common,

and a   narrow-leaved Clematis ties the shrubs   together   in a  way

   Dr. Harvey had now nearly completed the first year of his

projected travels, and with the exception of being somewhat dis
couraged and out of spirits at Trincomalee, the course of events
had flowed smoothly, and he had met with little to interrupt his
enjoyment. But a sharp sorrow awaited him at Melbourne,

which for a time occupied the place of every other thought.

One of his cousins, a young man of promise, who had left home

for the colony a few months preceding his own setting out, died
suddenly just before his arrival. He had anticipated with
pleasure finding him at Melbourne, and the news of one away,
like himself, from home and kindred, being thus suddenly cut off,
could not fail to affect him very sensibly. His heart was filled

with the deepest sympathy for those on whom the stroke had
most heavily fallen, and one or two of his letters written in

reference to the sad event, exhibit so truly his genuine tender
ness and depth of feeling, that it would seem hardly doing

justice to his memory were the editor to withhold them.

The plot of ground in which he lies is a short distance from

Taking up again Dr. Harvey's journal-letters from Melbourne,

the first record to be noticed is a ride of seven miles to Mr. A.'s

diggings. On his way he observed the St. Mary's thistle,

"abundantly diffused and of gigantic size." The botanising

ground near Melbourne, he writes, "proved but scanty, the

fields being too well covered with grass to allow of many plants

save buttercups and daisy-like Composite. When carefully

looked for, a few minute plants may be found, among which is a

little Veronica, scarcely two inches high, but with large blue

flowers. About three miles from town, where the road struck

into a gum-tree forest, the grass was gay with a little starry

flower (Hijpoxis vaginata), and a blue squill-like plant (Cassia
umbellata). A few Orchidese and a little Drosera were also

picked up. On a sandy heath Epacris impressa, to be seen at

the College or Glasnevin gardens, was extremely abundant, and

others also, for one of the neighbouring villages is called

Kildare."

  IOctober 15th. have had two weeks' experience of Port Fairv,

and have made a considerable collection of algae, but not so manv

new species among them as I had anticipated. Perhaps the
Imost interesting one to botanists will be a new and perfectly

distinct Ballia, which purpose calling B.'Robertiana, a name

which will include in sound, though not in sense, both Robert

and Miss Ball. It is quite as beautiful under the microscope

as the old one, but being of a brownish-red colour, it is not so

Ipleasing to the eye.
   Strolling on the beach of Port Fairy, beheld for the first time

the famous giant oarweed, Sarcophycus potatorum, with a stem
as long and as thick as a man's leg, and leaves like cow-hides

Istretched out, but measuring from twelve to twenty feet long.
   shall be puzzled to find specimens small enough to preserve,

Ibut must at least bring scraps.

   One day Mr. H. and rode from Melbourne to Tower Hill

lake, about nine miles from town. On reaching the steep bank
of the lake we looked down 200 feet into what must have been

an extensive crater in old times, but is now partly a lake and

partly a marsh. In the midst is a wooded island, rising like a

cone 300 feet above the lake. There are two or three summits,
in which there are said to be small craters. The borders all
round the lake have similar marks of volcanic origin, and all
are beautifully wooded. We had only time for a hurried

Iscramble down the steep sides of the lake ; and the ground being

covered with rich grass, got but few flowers, but among them
was the little Australian forget-me-not, with white flowers, the
beautiful Ajuga Australis, a fairy violet, a nettle, and an indigo.
On the waters of the lake myriads of a little floating fern,
looking like duckweed, were swimming. Its name is Azclla.

For its size, which is only an inch across, it is extremely pretty.
   In a walk to Toorak, where the Governor lives, a very pretty

Iplace, picked Brunonia Australis for the first time. To the

eye it is like Jasione montana, but with taller and naked stalks,

and deeper blue flowers.

genus, which is closely analogous to Desmarestia in habit and

in its peculiarity of rapidly changing colour in the air. All

the species when growing are a pale fawn grey with iridescent

tints, but a few minutes after they are brought into the air they

become a beautifully clear rose red, and they preserve this

colour in drying.

The trees in this neighbourhood are principally she-oaks

(Casuarinse), which have rather a sombre look, being more like

arborescent horsetails than anything else. (Specimens may be
Iseen at Glasnevin.) All the twigs are jointed, and have little
teeth at the joints, where they easily separate.  have found

but few additional land plants here. The only fern is the

   Dr. Harvey left Melbourne on the loth January, 1855, for
Georgetown, Van Diemen's Land. Here he introduced himself
to the Episcopalian clergyman, the Bev. Mr. Feraday, and was
fortunate in finding in him an enthusiastic lover of natural
history, and especially of Algae. He had a boat and dredge,
and at once volunteered himself a firm ally and assistant.
During the month of his stay they had many excursions

Launceston, and travelling from thence        stoge-coach to

Hobart-town, enabled him to become acquainted with the

interior of the country.

Before leaving Georgetown the sad news of several deaths

among his botanical friends reached him, none of which, he writes,

owing to the time lost on the way, took fully fiiteen, as we

regularly pulled up at every public-house, whether the horses

were to be changed or not, and had        stop of about twenty

minutes at each. The only cessation to this drinking was in

the middle of the night, when the houses were shut up.

We had a stoppage for supper at two a.m., and for coffee at

myself and the pew-opener--as large a congregation as would

probably be found in St. Paul's, London, at the same hour.

I thought it a day of very small things. After breakfast Mr. N.

took me to the public library, and made me free of it. Its

chief nucleus seems to be the library of Mr. Bicheno, who was

Colonel Page's companion when he visited us at Miltown, ami

who afterwards was Colonial Secretary here.

   February 28th. Met a phrenological party at G. W. W.'s
house, --paid ten shillings for having my head felt, and got a

sheet of gammon and spinach in lieu thereof.

IMarch 1st. Sailed for Port Arthur. There was a large party
of chained convicts on board, guarded by soldiers.       lay below

on a sofa with a book, and fell asleep, but fortunately awoke just

as we approached Cape Raoul, the first remarkable point, and

a splendid object from any and every side, being a narrow

jutting headland of basaltic columns nearly 300 feet high at the

highest point, and from fifty to eighty at the lowest, standing
together like the pipes of an organ, the top in many parts broken,
so that single pillars stand out like pinnacles. Parts are like

Gothic architecture, and as we passed close beneath, the dis

position of the rocks varied from moment to moment, every few

minutes presenting a new view. The columns are not very

perfect, being more like those of Fairhead than of the Causeway.
Another point, Cape Pillar, is a still finer basaltic headland, but

of this we had only distant views. Port Arthur is a place of

extreme beauty, though the den of thieves.

  IMarch 7th. took an excursion to Eajjle Hawk Neck, a narrow

strip of sandbank which unites Tasman's Peninsula to the other.

It is fifteen miles distant from Port Arthur. My friend and

host, W. A. H. Boyd, furnished me with a brisk little pony, which

carried me very pleasantly there and back. For the first nine

miles, the road, a bridle-track, is carried chiefly through a dense

forest of tall trees, with a thick undergrowth of bushes, and

rank grass and sedge. One of the sedges was a giant of its
kind, growing twelve to fourteen feet, with tall brown panicles of

flowers. The roa'l brought me to the shores of Norfolk Bay,

where is a convict depot. From this spot to the Neck (about six

miles)  the road   is carried along the shores of the narrow inlet
which   so nearly
                   forms an island of the peninsula. It is from two

show of teeth, by dogs which were tied to bushes close to the

sides of the road. These precautions are to prevent the escape of

convicts, by giving timely warning to the sentinels ; and lest the

unfortunate runaway should elude all these Cerberi, a line of

dogs, each a few yards apart, is drawn the whole way across the

Neck, a few also being placed on stages erected in the water. A

row of safety lamps, for night, also extends across, while close

behind these walks the sentry, and thus the runaway is kept

Ifrom crossing over. Boldly passing the sentry, inquired for

the officers' quarters, and alighting at the cottage of Lieutenant

G. of the 99th Regiment, the officer then in command of the

Iparty, presented my letter of introduction -- was asked in,

and introduced to his wife and family. We had luncheon, and

Lieutenant G. then offered me the choice of a walking stick

from a huge bundle, which must have contained over a hundred

--all different, and of his own making. Many were from

Norfolk Island, where he had been stationed, and some were

Ivery curious and handsome, but modestly took only a very

plain one, and thus armed, we set off for the shore.

   A walk of an hour brought us to the first curiosity, which
was a spring of water that never dried up -- a great recom

mendation in Australia. Here Mr. G. had placed a rustic seat,

   Returning to the beach, we proceeded to the last wonder--a

Isort of " blow-hole," or puffing hole, not at all equal to ours at

Miltown. Here found a curious little seaweed in such pro
fusion that it made the sea, not only red, but thick, the waves

coming in like billows of raspberry jam, each plant being about

the size and appearance of a crushed raspberry. Lieutenant G-.
told me he had often noticed it in this one spot, and no

where else.

Retracing our steps, we then walked a mile along the opposite

beach, to see some flat rocks which are held to be a great
Icuriosity. They form a sort of flagged pavement.
                                                                   expected

to see a second Giant's Causeway, but it proved to be only an

expanse of (I think) compact sandstone rock, with a very regular

cleavage, like a flagged pavement. The stones can be, and are,

lifted out   of their places for building purposes, smooth and
squared.

IMy principal object in visiting the island was to explore the
shores with dragging-nets for Algae.   proceeded round the

harbour, dragging with various success. We were terribly

plagued with the huge floating kelp of this country, which

Iwould get tangled in our hooks and hold us fast, so that we were
often baffled. However,    collected   so"mspeorgt o"odcastcphecinimgecnrsa.yfishIn,

a large animal resembling a lobster, but more thorny, with

smaller claws, &c. We moored the boat to some of the kelp

near the cliff, where the water was twenty or thirty feet deep,

with a clear bottom. All had nets fixed to round hoops, which

were let down, a bait was put in each net, and the crayfish came

nibbling round, and when one got over the hoop into the net,

the rope was hauled in and the prize secured. The water was

Iso clear we could see all that was passing below. Excellent
eating they proved to be.  should mention that the boat's crew

consisted of six convicts under sentence, and that the steersman

and a constable in charge were armed with loaded revolvers, to

maintain discipline. Howbeit you would not have known this

without being told, as the crew were verycivil and attentive,

assisting me in seeking for seaweeds, and anxious to procure me

good specimens. One of the convicts in fishing hooked a small

shark, which he immediately cut open, and extracted a pair of eggs

(mermaids' purses), which he presented to me, and which are now
on the way to Trinity College, Dublin, on board the Bory O'More.

       also visited the new prison on the silent and solitary system,
where none but the worst criminals are kept, and those only
for limited periods. The hall, from which radiate three wings
or corridors, is surrounded by a number of exercise yards.
Along the corridors are seventy cells, fifty-five of which were
occupied. Each cell, which is lofty, and fairly lighted from the
top, contains a table, chair, store, and shelf to hold books, bed,

washing materials, &c. The beds are rolled up by day. All is

kept beautifully clean. The men never see each other from

the time they enter till they leave, and are never allowed to

speak, except in case of great necessity, to the attendant, and
then only in whispers, all ordinary communication being carried

who were confined for over a year in neighbouring cells -- only
a wall between them. They marched to chapel every morning

and evening together, and sat there side by side, yet the
management is such that neither knew his brother to be his
fellow prisoner. When they leave the cells for chapel or
exercise, cach man has a cap drawn over his face, and the
chapel seats are so arranged, that while all the countenances are
visible to the clergyman and an officer in charge, the convicts
can only behold these two faces, without obtaining a glimpse of

their fellow prisoners. It is thus during the whole of their

term. They are permitted one hour's solitary exorcise each day.
Their fare is a half ration, without tea or tobacco. 1 erfect
silence prevails. The floors are of sandstone, but to prevent
footsteps from being heard, a carpet is laid along the centre of
the hall, which is kept lighted during the night, and there is
also a lamp in each cell. Through a spy-hole in every door the
officer can see the prisoner, without his being aware of the in
spection. There is a library for the use of the inmates, which
consists chiefly of moral and religious books. We peeped into
a cell, and saw a man reading at his table. The severest
punishment inflicted is to lock up the delinquent in a dark cell,
which in a few hours generally brings the most refractory to
order. Some trades are allowed to be exercised, such as shoe

grown.  have since found the same agarics abundant in other

places.
   One of the few curiosities at present displayed in the museum

at Sydney is in its way a strange one, winch was dredged in the

harbour. It is a ginger-beer bottle, to the neck of which

several oysters have fastened themselves, and one has laid hold
of a tobacco-pipe, round which the shell has grown, and he holds

it in a knowing attitude, like any other gentleman.

  IDr. Bennett has been very kind, and insists on my becoming

   May 10th. Saw Mr. Boyce the missionary, and in a few words-

arranged with him for a passage to the Fiji Islands, in the
schooner John Wesley, which belongs to the mission, and is

employed in carrying supplies and conveying the missionaries

from port to port and station to station.

Isome of the shallow tide-pools
                                 collected Martensia elegana
I(one of the pretty networks now first found here), and also

picked up a Coralline and a Conferva. Most of the rocks, how

ever, are quite barren.

   May 12th. Visited Mr. McLeay, the celebrated entomologist,

Iand author of what is called " the circular system," of which

(once upon a time) was an admirer. He has a fine house in
a beautiful park of sixty acres, all within the city of Sydney.

He cultivates many rare trees, shrubs, and plants, and from his

grounds there are charming prospects.
   May lQth. Left per steamer for Newcastle, built at the

mouth of the Hunter river, and the great outlet of the coal

district in New South Wales. We arrived next morning just

Ibefore sunrise, a golden light suffusing the whole eastern sky,

and the thinnest thread of a moon that ever saw. On the

strand, facing the open sea, of a small island called the Knoddy,

I gathered a few Algae, amongst them the rare Delisea pukhra.
IWhile here had a walk with Mr. Moore to a fern valley about

four miles distant from the town. Our route for almost the

entire way was along the seashore. Part of the track led us

over some hills by the margin of the cliffs, the views from

which were varied and beautiful --a bold coast to the south

ward ; and northward a long sand beach and distant mountains.
The valley is a narrow wooded ravine, with a stream running

through  it,Iamong large rocks and blocks of stone. Trees of

many kinds arch over the water. The most striking objects,a

however, were the huge masses of Asplenium nidus, and Platy-

cerium Akicorne, two most noble ferns, which fasten themselves

on the trunks or branches of trees, or take possession of jutting

rocks. Many other pretty ferns covered the soil, climbed up

the trees, or stuck on the faces of flat rocks. Of all collected

specimens. We had heard there were twenty kinds in the

valley, but don't think we found much over dozen. Many

Epiphytical Orchidese were scattered about. None were in flower,

but from their abundance they must, in their season, be beautiful.
We saw in tree one of the large opossums called the " Native
bear." He kept quietly looking at us for some time, and then

getting among the leaves, remained motionless while we were

  IThe following day went dredging, but without profit. By
Ifavour of the governor had the use of the harbour-master's

boat. The crew consisted of two New Zealanders and two
ISouth-Sea Islanders, capital boatmen.
                                          spent another day

collecting Algro and shells, and found a plentiful stock of

Delisea pukhra, which is a deep-water plant, and only cast up

Iafter storms.               went to Hexham, ten miles up
   Before leaving Newcastle

the Hunter river, to visit Mr. Scott, who lives on an island con

taining about 3000 acres, the greater part of which belongs to

him. He came in his boat to meet me. He has a very pretty
cottage and garden. In front of his door stand a pair of fine

Norfolk Island pines, and near the house were date-trees in

fruit. Behind it a garden of orange-trees, numbering 1100, the
Ifruit of which sold last year for 700Z.
                                          found him a most

agreeable, well-informed, educated gentleman, and with two

clever and accomplished daughters reared (like Miranda) on the
island. Their chief amusement is finding and rearing cater

pillars and taking drawings of the moths and butterflies that

come from them. They have many exquisite drawings of these

insects in all their stages, from the eggs to perfect growth.
Mr. Scott is preparing a work on the Lepidoptera of Australia.

IHe gave me a box of shells for the Museum, Trinity College,
Dublin, chiefly from Moreton Bay.  returned the following

morning to the house of my hospitable friend Mr. Bennett at

Sydney, and busied myself in preparing for my voyage to the

Fiji Islands; my object in going thither being the opportunity

thus afforded of visiting some of the coral reefs in the Pacific.

I expect to bft four months among this group and that of the

Friendly Islands.

                  CHAPTER XV.

NEW ZEALAND. --FRIENDLY AND FIJI ISLANDS.

The John Wesley sailed from Sydney on the 15th June, 1855,

and arrived at Tonga on the 26th of that month, after a delay of

about a week at Auckland. Being the winter season the voyage

was rough and disagreeable.         Dr. Harvey's companions on

board were Mr. Thomas, the Wesleyan missionary, and one of

his fellow-labourers ; and the estimate he formed of these pious

and devoted men caused him to search into the history of their

mission work, and to witness With the warmest interest its

wonderful results. There       is little to  be    taken   from what  he
calls " the mere                scrap of a   tour  " that  comprised  his
                  tantalizing
" acquaintance    with New     Zealand," which, like the shadowy

island of 0 Brazil in the legend of the Miltown fisherman, had
been his " phantom of pleasure seen distant in youth."
"About breakfast-time," he writes, "we passed 'The Poor

Knights,' a number of high, rocky, and craggy islets, poor enough

in all conscience, and many similar ones were passed in the

Icourse of the day. The whole scene was very wild and dreary,

and only ran up on deck occasionally, and then down shiver

ing to my nest to get warm again. All the day we were

running close-hauled against a strong southerly wind. The

same bleak and rugged character, as far as we could see, marked

the coast, and it looked anything but inviting to a settler. In

the afternoon we passed a large island called the ' Great

Barrier,' and we were then supposed to be at the mouth of the
' Thames,' but it was rather a very wide arm of the sea, forming a

deep bay, that we entered. Heavy squalls, accompanied with

Itrain and forked lightning, proved a clearing up of the weather.
     was dark when we anchored in good shelter about ten miles

from the Heads, and in the morning, which was bright and fine,

Ibut very cold, we beat into the harbour.

   " After having established myself at the Masonic Hotel, called

Ion Dr. Sinclair, the Colonial Secretary, to whom (he being a
botanist)  was well known by name. He received me very

warmly, and after chatting some time, proposed a walk to Mount

Eden, a crater cone behind the town, about 400 feet high, from

which there is a very extensive view, the object being to show

me the localities at a glance. Just where Auckland is built, the

distance from side to side of the island is only six miles, and on

either hand many long arms of the sea penetrate the land,

forming splendid harbours. The country is bare of trees, and
resembles the bleaker parts of Ireland and Scotland. The New

Zealand flax grows abundantly everywhere on the hill-sides,

and is now in seed. Where the land is cultivated the green

fields had to me a home-like aspect. The country is volcanic,

and many old craters are scattered about. Formerly the cove

craters (which look like Irish Raths) were strongholds of the
natives, but about forty years ago a tribe inhabiting the

northern end of the island came here and fought with the

Auckland tribe, till they left none remaining, and so the craters

are now grassy mounds, though with traces of former occupation.

The natives about the town are all in a civilized state, though

Isome are still tattooed.

   " On the 20th called on the Eev. Mr. Lloyd, brother to
Dr. Lloyd, Trinity College, Dublin. In the afternoon Dr. Sinclair

proposed walking with me as far as St. John's College, six miles

Ifrom town, near which Mr. W., son to our King George's Sound

friend, has a farm, where was to spend the night and following
Iday. We had a very pleasant walk, the way being enlivened by Dr.
Sinclair's anecdotes and cheerful conversation.  found the W.'s
Isettled about half a mile beyond the College, and was warmly

welcomed. Round their house are several large specimens of

the dragon-tree of this country; a singular-looking object, each

of its snake-like branches being crowned with a large tuft of

Ileaves. Its flowers, now gone to seed, are very fragrant. On

Sunday, July 1st, attended morning service with the W.'s at

their village church, and in the evening walked to town for

evening service at St. Paul's, where Mr. Lloyd's voice had a home

sound to me."

  IJuly 2nd. Went with Captain Drury (to whom brought

letters from Admiral Beaufort) to the north shore of the harbour,
collected some shells, and found a small, but curious Alga

(Mierodictyon), new in this place ; generally speaking, the rocks,

which are thickly studded with oysters, are poor in Algae.

ICaptain Drury is in command of a surveying vessel, and has

promised to collect for me spme things which cannot now

obtain. On the 3rd he took me to a curious volcanic island,

Range Toto, forming the south head of the harbour, a cone

600 feet high ; the surface cindery, the cinders in many places
large, and heaped together in the wildest confusion ; fields of

Ioysters, but scarcely any Algae. Dr. Sinclair and Captain Drury

have been most kind, and have also found a fellow-worker in

Mr. Knight (Auditor-General), who has a fine microscope, and

is an excellent draughtsman, and who is to send me drawings

and specimens of the smaller Algae.

IJuly 6th. Walked to a valley where were some tree-ferns, but
only a few were in their season of beauty.  gathered seeds of

Itwo species, Oyathea medullaris and C. dealbata. The first is

the noblest tree-fern have ever seen. Its trunk (in the dense

Iforests) is often seventy feet high, but from twenty to forty is

the highest saw it. The crown consists of twenty or more

huge fronds, each of them from twelve to eighteen feet long ;
the stalks are as black as ebony, and as thick as a man's wrist,

and the feathery fronds curve over most gracefully. The

0. dealbata is a smaller and more slender species, with the under

surface of the leaves white, contrasting well with the dark rich

green of C. medullaris. Dicksonia Antarctica (the Van Diemen's
Land tree-fern) was also abundant in this valley, but it looked poor
and stunted beside the graceful Cyatheas. By the bank of the

rivulet Lomaria procera grew splendidly; its fronds eighteen

feet high. Trichomanes were there, but not in fruit. One of

the handsomest of the smaller fems was Todea pellucida, twelve

or fourteen inches long ; transparent and delicately feathered.

There were but few flowering plants, except a Leptospernum,

resembling a small myrtle, which covers all the hills around

IAuckland.   visited Hobson's Glen, a similar locality about

were mingled wildly together, the dragon-tree standing here
:ind there, and a little stream with tall reeds ran at the bottom.

IHow delighted Mr. Ward would have been ! Moreover the

stream at its outlet was full of water-cresses, on which made

my luncheon, and thought of my spring breakfasts at the Quay.
On the whole the botany here was poor in species, but this is
the best remaining spot near Auckland ; the real forests and
glens are too far away for my limited time to allow of my

New Zealand preach at St. Paul's a very eloquent sermon,
delivered with much earnestness and fervour. He had only just

   The vessel left Auckland on the 15th of July, and on the

sight ; " its low, flat shores," he writes, " clothed with groves of

                                                       Tongataboo, July 26th, 1855.

       As Mr. and Mrs. Thomas were old acquaintances of the
natives, they were surrounded on landing by a large crowd ol'
all ages, anxious to shake hands and " jeoto of'a" (small is my
FlilUNDLY ISLANDS.  297

love), the usual salute for " how do you do." Though some
were wild enough in appearance, they were all friendly and
quiet in manner. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas have lived among

them for twenty-five years, and have seen them pass from a
savage, heathenish state to their present Christianized, and
comparatively civilized condition. Some were fully dressed in
European style, save the bare feet ; but most of them had only
a piece of native cloth or calico, wrapped round the waist, and
reaching a little below the knee. Most of the grown persons,

both men and women, have the hair cut short, their great
desire being to make it grow coarse and strong. They brush it
straight up, oil it plentifully, and rub in lime for hair-powder.
This short hair gives the women a very masculine appearance,
which is increased by their commonly large stature and coarse
limbs. Some of the young dandies and dandyesses allow the

hair to grow long, and when thickly anointed and brushed
straight in all directions, the expression of the face becomes

singularly wild and savage : such a head would make a capital
sign for the Sun Fire and Life Office. Before the arrival of
the missionaries, all wore their hair in the sun-like fashion ;

but now, those who are considered steady members of society
cut theirs short.

    Our walk from the beach to the Mission-house was through a
shady lane, bordered with neat reed fences, and overshadowed

with cocoa-nut, orange, banana, bread-fruit, and other broad-

leaved trees. On one side were the Palace gardens ; on the

other the enclosures of the town. There are no streets, but a

succession of small enclosures called Abis, each having one or
more houses on the enclosed space. The only noise heard in
passing through the streets was the hammering of the tapa, or
native cloth ; a noise that begins before daylight every morning,
save Saturday and Sunday, and continues unceasingly until

nearly dusk in the evening. It is like the distant sound of

beetling engines, or the rivetting of iron vessels in a ship
builder's yard. The making of this cloth is the principal
occupation of the women. The material is the bark of the

Chinese paper mulberry, winch is hammered and dressed till it
is converted into a sort of tough felt, like paper, which is then

painted. Before the introduction of calico it constituted the

entire clothing of the people. It does very well in dry weather,

but will not bear rain. I took up my quarters at the Mission-

house, where we were hospitably received by Mr. and Mrs.
Davis. Soon after we had got settled, Mr. Thomas proposed a
visit to an old chief named Abraham, uncle to the King, and
who acts as Governor in his Majesty's absence. We found him
at home, but not being well, he received us in his bed-room.

The house was a rude shed, consisting of two rooms, the inner
one being the sleeping apartment. He Mas squatted on the
floor, dressed in a web shirt and drawers, and with cotton gloves.
He was a pleasant-faced old gentleman, with frank manners,
but not ill-bred. We stood in the outer room, and he sat in the

doorway of the bed-room. Pigs, dogs, and people (his retainers)
had free access to the outer room, in the middle of which was a
fire. There was but little furniture -- a sieve, a Cava bowl, and

a pot or two. We afterwards visited Shadrach (the chief justice),
who bears a high character for worth and talent. His house

was much more comfortable than Abraham's, and better fur

nished, and there were more European luxuries. The inner

room had glass windows. In the outer was a frame hung with

coloured glass bottles (of scented oil) ; there were also other
ornaments. The house itself was neatly built in native
fashion ; that is to say, like a very large basket turned bottom
upwards; the walls reeded, and the framework of the roof
supported by cocoa-nut pillars. There is no good water on the
island, so those who are particular are obliged to catch the rain
in troughs and tanks. As we went along from house to house,
the children of the village ran after us, every now and then
coming up to shake hands with us, and smiling in very friendly

I Ifashion. Such was my first day's experience of the Friendly

Islands ; and may add, that so far have found the natives

wonderfully well-behaved and civil, not crowding on you or
teazing you as in Ceylon, but keeping back as soon as they

Iunderstand that you wish to be alone.
    '11th. walked out on the coral reef opposite the landing-

place. It fringes the whole north side of the Island, in some
places extending a mile or more from the beach. A great part

of the surface was worn and dead, but in the pools the coral
was alive. Near the outer margin of the reef, these pools were
numerous and dee}), and in them many beautiful corals were

growing luxuriantly. They were various: some branching or

leafy, others knobby or massive ; some bushy, some tree-like or
saucer-shaped on huge disks; some sessile, others on stems.

The colours Taried from white to brown, purple, green, yellow,
flesh-coloured, and dull red ; and many reflected rainbow tints,

changing with the angle, particularly at the tops of the branches.
The water was clear as air, and through it multitudes of little

sapphire fishes (Coloto) darted among the coral branches. Sea
weeds were very few, and almost all of the green order,

amongst which were Malimeda and Bryopsis. Star-fishes of the

long-armed class (Ophiura and Ophiocoma) were abundant, and
a large brown feather-star was frequent under stones. Great,

crawling everywhere.      caught at one, which immediately

difficulty in getting my hand free : it did not sting me, however.

I picked up a Cidaris and an Echinus (urchin), and saw another
Ispecies of the latter which did not venture to touch, re
Imembering how had been stung by one (I think the same
species) at Key West: it has long, slender, and very brittle

spines, covered with highly poisonous slime. Near the edge of

the reef Nullipores1 abounded in places left bare at low water.

I noticed that some of the living corals were bare also, but pro

bably they did not long remain so, for it was a low spring-tide.

A huge and beautiful species of Alcyonium (a soft coral called
dead man's toes) grew where it was left exposed at low water.
In this state its substance shrank up under the sun and became

of a pale-brown or sponge colour, but when its animals were

expanded under water, this lobed, fleshy mass was thickly

spangled with golden stars, and looked very lovely. Several

Inaked Mollusea, of gay colours and beautiful forms, glided amid

the corals, but could only do them homage, and release them

anemones; in fact, quite an Allmanio paradise.  found but

plentiful, but the other Algae were few and far between, and

there were few shells. In the evening the voice of hymns came

up from all the scattered houses of the village.

with hymns, extempore prayers, and sermon."

  The history of the conversion of the Friendly and Fiji

islanders, from the darkest state of cannibalism and heathen

barbarity, to that of comparatively Christianized civilisation, has

become so well known since Dr. Harvey's visit, that the details

of his journal in this respect have lost much of their freshness.

The sketches, therefore, here presented to the reader will be

confined chiefly to such as have personal relation to his sixa

months' residence and explorations. A letter written at this

time to Mr. Ward will sufficiently show how deeply he was im

pressed by what he heard and witnessed concerning the natives,

and his anxious desire to aid the missionaries in their good work
as far as lay in his power. His appeal regarding the medical

fund was at once responded to, and the supply of medicines

kept up till within the last few years, when its continuance was

believed to be no longer necessary.

                        To N. B. Ward, Esq.

My dear Ward,           Tongataboo, Friendly Islands, July 29th, 1855.

           have become much interested in the missionary work
which now going on in these islands, since have seen for
I

      ; is

                  I

                                I
                                           by I
myself some of the fruits already gathered in           the Wesleyan

Missionary Society. You know my predilections are not in

favour of sectarianism, and hitherto                    have abstained from

supporting any but the missionary societies of the English

Church nor should now depart from this line of conduct, did
                           FRIENDLY ISLANDS.              301

I regard the Wesleyan Missionary Society as a sectarian body.

Here at least the mission is conducted in a truly Catholic

spirit. The natives hear only the plain unadulterated Gospel

which we all receive, nor would they be aware (but for the
presence of a Jesuit mission among them) of the unhappy dif
ferences which have rent the Christian Church. The mis

sionaries take the New Testament in their hand and expound

the truths of Christianity in their fulness and broadness ; not

troubling the natives with curious questions and speculations.

They have also translated into Tongese, an abridgment of our

noble Liturgy, which is always used in the chapel service. The
result has been the total extinction of heathenism in these

islands, accompanied by a change in manners truly wonderful,

considering the short time that the mission has been established.

The last human sacrifice occurred but fourteen years ago.

Previous to that time they were common, and always on

the death of a high chief; either one of his children or wives was

strangled, and others of his relatives often maimed or grievously
w" ofruinedneddli.nessAt"
                           that time also, the  natives,   notwithstanding their
                           to strangers, were   thieves   and liars, and though

less savage than the Fijians, were living in the habitual sins

of heathenism. Now, they are a quiet, peaceable, and well-

ordered Christian community, and many have given unmis-

takeable evidence of the reality of their conversion, and become

able assistants to the missionaries in carrying on the work of

Christianization. Recently (in comparison) the Society has
established a mission in the Fijian group, where already the

converts number 10,000, incfuding several chiefs. The Fiji

Islands are said to contain nearly 200,000 inhabitants, and

those not yet under missionary care are savages of the worst

character. They are cannibals to a fearful extent, habitually

feeding on human flesh ; not from revenge or from necessity,

but because they prefer it to other food. They eat their enemies
or prisoners when in their power ; but, if unsuccessful in catching
these --their lawful prey-- they will cook their own wives or
children. Not long ago a case occurred at Fiji, when a wretch
ordered his wife to heat the oven, and when she had heated it
she asked him, "Where is the food?" "You are the food," was

the savage reply, when he instantly clubbed her, and then

cooked her for himself and the party.
302 MEMO lit OF I)R. HARVEY.

The captain of the vessel tells me that the hist time he was

in Fiji, in 18-17, he saw a hundred human bodies laid out at one

time, ready for cooking at a great feast. Sometimes they cook

a man whole (which they call a "long pig"), then put him in a
sitting posture, with a fan in his hand, and ornamented as if

alive ; and thus they carry him in state as a grand head dish for
a feast. Others chew little bits of raw human flesh (as sailors

Ifchew tobacco), and put them into their children's mouths.
Ithis picture be not sufficiently revolting, must refer you to the

published reports of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, where you

Iwill find plenty of similar or worse accounts -- accounts which

have heard confirmed by many witnesses not connected with the

mission work. Now picture to yourself a people like this,

numbering perhaps 200,000 souls : see a small band of mission

aries,  with their wives  and families, going and    s"itatinligvidnogwnsaacrmifiocne,g
them    with their lives  in their hands (literally

holy and acceptable to God "), and thus remaining on without

human protection, through evil report or perhaps persecution,

for years and years, seeing scarcely any fruit of their labours till

their heads are growing grey, or until some of their number

have been laid in a Fijian grave. And then behold this same

mission, after twenty years' labours, appealing by its 10,000

Iconverts to the sympathies of a Christian world. Contrast these

pictures, and think you will join with me in praying that God

may prosper this great work, and that speedily.

So far for my preface, and now for my main object, which,
Iwhen have stated the case, will^explain my reason for writing
Iall this to you, instead of to some other of my friends.  find

that the missionaries here, and at the other stations, are in the

habit of distributing, at an almost nominal charge, large

quantities of medicine ; these being entirely provided by the

devoted men out of their slender pittances. The funds of the

Parent Society, though large, are so overburdened, that no

assistance can be given in this respect. The missionaries there

fore must continue to bear this expense themselves, or see the

Ipoor creatures round them suffering and dying without assist
ance.   need hardly add that the ability to minister to disease

is a valuable aid to a missionary's more especial work ; indeed,

in my opinion, so much so, that all persons educated for mis

sionary work ought to receive a proper medical training ; and

if possible medicines ought to be supplied to the missionary in

Isuch quantities as to enable him to distribute gratuitously in
case of necessity. At present, as             have already said, the

medicine chest is a very serious annual expense, and particularly

so as the missionary is often obliged to purchase in Sydney, at

the extravagant colonial prices.

Now my object is to try and raise a small sum among our

personal friends to be laid out in medicines either by you or by
Mr. Deane, through whose connection with the medical pro

fession, we might be assured that the supply would be of the

Ibest quality, and at the lowest possible wholesale price. With

the aid of our mutual friends in Dublin and London, think we

might be enabled to furnish both the Tonga and Fijian mission

with medicines for a year or two at the least, and should the

fund  thus raised   prove, by  bthe ethbelesmsienagnsofofGoad,litgtrleea"teProltyhnaensiawne

with cleaning shells. We passed Hunga Tonga and Hunga

Habai, and by sunset were near the volcanic Tofua, which was

smoking.

August 1st. About sundown we got under shelter of the little

island of Haafeva, about thirty miles from Lifuka, which was

our destination. The night was very fine, the stars most

lustrous : Venus at one side of the ship, and Jupiter at the

other, cast broad bands of light across the sea.

August 2nd. Our navigation became intricate, having to wind

our way amid innumerable coral reefs, often passing so close as

to see the corals in great beauty in the deep sea reefs, with fishes
swimming among them. We at last succeeded in entering the
harbour of Lifuka before sunset, but we remained on board for

the night. Some canoes visited us, in one of which was a

schoolmaster, by name Eliezar, a pleasant-faced, robust native.

   On the 3rd we landed, and were kindly received by Mr. West.

IAlthough it was raining heavily, was so anxious not to lose
Itime, that started with an umbrella to visit the south coast ot

the island. It yielded little except common shells and drifted

Algae. Where the coral rocks were somewhat elevated, they

had become partially changed into porous limestone, not unlike

Ithat seen at Rottenest, West Australia.

which landed, and sent the canoe round to meet me. found

were Calothrices and Lyngbya, which covered the rock in wide
Ipatches. In some of the deeper pools near low water
                                                      found

abundance of a beautiful red Alga (Desmia), previously seen at
ICeylon, and in some of the shallow ones collected another of
Imy Ceylon Algae, which had then named Valonia Forbesii, in
Icompliment to Mr. Forbes of Matura. Now when again met
Iwith the plant could not but associate it with poor Edward

   On the evening of the 8th we went on board the Wesley,

morning we sailed for Vavau, where remain till the Wesley

returns from the Navigator's Islands.

                                                                Sydney, December 12th, 1855.

I reached Sydney a few days ago, after an absence on my .

island tour of exactly twenty-five weeks. My last letter was

written from Vavau on the 17th of August, and after so long a
Ibreak in the thread of my narrative have hardly courage to
Iresume in journal fashion.
                             remained three weeks at Vavau as
Ithe guest of the Rev. Mr. Daniels, by whom was hospitably
Ientertained, and helped forward in all had to do with the

natives. The harbour of Vavau is spacious, and the scenery

lovely, for, being landlocked, it has the appearance of an inland
lake, surrounded with hills and slopes at various distances;

these being clothed with tropical vegetation of the fullest green,

on which the changing lights and shadows fall. The cocoa-nut

trees, rising with their slender stems over the smaller shrubbery,

are very conspicuous, and the garden patches of banana con

Itrast well with the dense jungle of the uncultivated spots. As
Iglided along the shores in a small canoe, was often reminded of

those of Killarney, the surface of the hard coralliferous rock being

similarly waterworn into a fanciful honeycomb filigree. This rock
                                                                                x

is often deeply covered- with a plentiful supply of very fertile

vegetable mould. There are no streams, and the wells, which,
along the shores of the harbour, spring close to the sea, are all

brackish, being overflowed at high tide. The missionaries

collect rain-water for the table and for washing. The natives

mostly drink the milk of the young cocoa-nut --a very different

beverage from the vile stuff you find in the old nuts brought

from the West Indies: the juice of the half-ripened nut

plucked fresh from the tree is delicious, "a real fountain of

sweet waters," always cool, even in the hottest day, so admi

rably has nature guarded it by a thick husk ; but if the nut be

kept many days after being gathered, the juice becomes sour.

The natives mostly use the sea-water for washing, and the bark

of a shrub nearly allied to Bhamnus, and which is common

along the seashore, serves as soap. They wrap parings of this

bark round the garment or piece of cloth to be washed, and

then knead the article under water in washerwoman fashion,

beating, pulling, and 'squeezing till a strong lather is formed,

along with which the dirt oozes out. It is said, however, to rot

the clothes from excess of alkali, but this may in part arise

from the use of the sea-water.

The form of the hills in Vavau bespeaks volcanic action, and

the whole island seems to have been slowly raised up at suc

cessive periods by a force acting below it. The rock appears to

have been hardened by heat, but not to the extent of destroying

its fossils. Close to the town a remarkable conical hill affords

a beautiful and extensive view over a wide margin of sea,

studded with small islands, and flecked with coral reefs, con

spicuous at many miles' distance by the lines of white breakers

which constantly mark their position.

Hardly had we reached the Mission-house on our landing,

when a long procession of the natives was seen, slowly winding

along the narrow roads, and singing hymns on their way. It

was composed of men, women, and children, dressed in their best,

and ornamented     with leaves and flowers.       None  "  were   empty-
handed, every one  bearing some offering of "  mea ofa     (love  things)

in gratitude to the missionaries for their teaching. One carried

a pig, others a yam, a piece of cloth, a fowl, &c. Some few

brought money, and the children bore long wreaths, ingeniously

made, of sweet-scented flowers. Our party stood before the

I Ithen came forward to shake hands, in which joined till was
Ifairly tired, so many hands were offered.
                                            generally spent

more or less of every favourable tide on the coral reefs, the

Igeneral features of which have already described. One day

the mission families, including children and servants, accom

panied me on an excursion to the summit of a high hill distant

about three miles from the house, and on our return from ascend

ing it we had a native pic-nic, my first experience of Tongan

cookery. A message had been sent forward to a village near

the hill, and the natives came out to meet us. They were told

we should stop to rest on our return, and we then pursued a
shaded pathway through a thick forest, gradually rising as it

wound around the hills till we reached the top of the highest.

The day was lovely and the view charming. On coming down

to the village we seated ourselves under a tree to await the

serving of the dinner. It soon made its appearance, and con

sisted of two pigs baked whole, and brought in baskets, being

wrapped up in plantain leaves ; we had also baked yams and

taro root (Caladium esculentum), a kind of large arum plant,
besides a native soup made from cocoa-nut, in the same manner
as almond milk is prepared. Cocoa-nuts, both hot and cold,

served for drink ; the hot being taken during dinner, and the

cold as a dessert. The whole repast was set before Mr. Daniel

as the principal guest, and he sent portions to all in turn. My

Ishare was about a quarter of the smaller pig and a huge yam ;

like Benjamin's portion, five times as much as could dispose
of. The hot cocoa-nut milk was drunk out of little cups neatly

made on the spot, by folding a young banana leaf, and leaves of

the same useful plant served us for plates and dishes ; while the
ribs of the leaves acted as soap and water, brush and towel, all

combined in one. Water however was poured on our hands

after the repast to supply the want of finger-glasses. All the

food was very cleanly cooked and very good, and we did it full

justice with plenty of help from the natives, so that when we rose

from table the two pigs and most of the yams had disappeared.

IWe . came home in the cool of the evening and enjoyed a cup of

hot tea, the most cooling drink that know of for a warm climate.

   When the John Wesley returned from Navigator's Islands,

Iwe sailed for Tonga, where was again heartily welcomed by
IMr. and Mrs. Davis, and made more addition to my Algae both
Ithere and at Lifuka, which again visited before going to the
IFijis. At Tonga met with a very remarkable star-fish of

the pentagonal type, as large and as thick as a 4 lb. loaf of

Ibread, but it has greatly shrunk in the drying, and is now quite

flat and only an inch in thickness. Three others have cut open

and skinned, and have their skins and skeletons. In the stomach

of each was a fish some inches long. How such a sluggard could

Ipersuade a lively and sensible fish to walk into his stomach is
to me a mystery.  have two new genera of Algae, and at the

least three well-marked species of one of them.

    On the 8th of October we started from Vavau on our voyage

to the Fiji archipelago, and towards evening we sailed close

by the island of Loti, now a volcano in fierce activity, though a

little more than a year ago it had been considered by the natives

from time immemorial to be a quiet, well-behaved island. It is,

as is usual, conical, and in some places broad streams of lava

rock stretch from the summit to the sea ; while other parts

where the fire had not reached were still green with the

luxuriant foliage of the tropics. The natives report that since

the volcano broke out, a large fresh-water lake has been formed

where previously there was none such, nor were there either

streams or fountains.

   Our voyage though slow was pleasant and favourable. We
reached our first stopping place, Lakemba, at daylight on the

13th, where we lay off and on during our stay, the shore being
reef-bound and the waters outside the reef too deep to afford

Ianchorage. The island is mountainous and very beautiful.
Ilanded at the mission station and started for a walk, continuing

my way over the tops of several hills till came to a gully,

Iwherein was a stream shaded over with shrubs and tree-ferns.

  scrambled down and gathered sundry matters on its banks.
The vegetation was very different from that of the Friendly

Islands, being also more diversified, and to me more interesting.

The decomposed volcanic matter, richly manured with the
vegetable detritions of ages, forms a soil of exuberant fertility,
which is also sunned, fanned, and well watered. The same may

Ibe said of all the other Fiji islands that visited. They are
           FIJI ISLANDS.      300

mountainous, picturesque, well watered, fertile, and pleasant to
Ithe eye.
           found several plants on this occasion, amongst which
Iwas a very remarkable fern, Polypodium Horsejieldii, but met

with it only on one hill. Its leaves resemble those of cow

parsnip more than of a fern.

King George of Tonga arrived the same evening that we did,

with a fleet'of thirty-five large canoes, carrying 2000 men besides

the women and children. It was a very pretty sight to see so

many double canoes sail together into the harbour ; for though
our vessel had to lie out at sea, boats and canoes enter through

a narrow opening in the reef, into a small basin of still water.

The double canoe at a little distance looks like a raft, on which

a house is built, and it is driven by a huge top-heavy sail of

matting. The crew and passengers cling all round and at top,

as in a Neapolitan caliche, and a war canoe sometimes thus

carries as many as 500 men. King George was on his way home,

after having acquired much glory in helping the Fijian king to

put down a formidable rebellion that had nearly upset his

Iauthority.
      landed at Vewa on the 17th, and had a botanising walk in

the bush. The island is covered with timber, and the trees are

I Iwell stored with Epiphyte orchids and ferns, many of which

   gathered. At the Mission-house asked for a guide, and was

fnrnished with a man called Koroe, who climbed trees for para

Isites, gathered flowers, carried my bundle, and was very agree

able, and quite pleased when, at parting, gave him a fourpenny

knife. I asked whether the name Koroe had any meaning, and

was told that it was a very honourable title, something equiva

lent to a C.B. in England, and only given to a person who had

committed at least five murders.

  IOn the 18th visited Bau, the capital of Fiji, and perhaps

the largest and best-built native town in the Southern Pacific.

It is situated on a small island close to the mainland of Fiji,

the insular situation having been chosen for purposes of defence.

This town was the chief seat of cannibalism and devilry of all

kinds, and perhaps has witnessed more savage crimes than any

other spot of its size on the face of the earth. About two years

ago, after a continual refusal for eighteen years, a Christian

missionary was allowed footing here, and the change since that

time has been extraordinary. The few temples that still stand
;sio MEMOIR OF DR. HARVEY

no longer  exist ; the  idols                                                              hate

ful crimes connected with that devil worship have ceased. One

Irealizes them a little, when standing as did on the spot where

only eighteen months ago there had been a cannibal feast at

which multitudes perished. Can you fancy a single unprotected

man and his wife, with two small children, going to live amid

such scenes, prepared to bear all things, to hope all things ?

Surely nothing short of the charity that never faileth could

support any civilized person in such circumstances. But all-

enduring charity is the germ of that great power which, like the

stone cut out without hands, shall at length become a mountain

and fill the whole earth. The great temple at Bau was

accidentally burnt down, and all that remains of it is a double

tier of upright stones, each from six to eight feet high, which

resemble the Stonehenge architecture ; a significant fact, recall

ing to one's thoughts what the state of England was, before the

at home, so we walked about the house and looked at his wares.

Thakumbau (the king) is a man of considerable ability, and he

Ihas played a very distinguished political part in Fiji, but
     fear his Christianity is of a low type ; yet, bad as it

   Dr. Harvey's visit to the South Sea Islands, which in addition
to constant bodily exertion, brought vividly before him so much
matter for painful reflection, affected his health more than any
experience incurred during the two previous years of travel.

over him, and the following letter seems to have been written

under this feeling : --

Iawake unable to sleep, that must write to you this morning.
I accidentally awoke about midnight, and my thoughts recurred

could not help recalling that of 1831 and my dear mother, and

1846' and dear S  . Then came to mind a little verse which
I Iwrote when S

I Iwas afraid to interfere, and so never showed it to any one.

   A morning without clouds begins to shine :

ller spirit, breaking from its earthly prison,
   Now rests in perfect peace and love Divine.

Then let us too our chastened hearts lift up,
   In sweet communion with the blest above,

To Him who drained for us life's bitter cup,
   That He might fill it with Redeeming love.

                            involuntarily pictured him as also

waking up suddenly at midnight, and similar thoughts of home

and love, and of those that had gone before, coming to him, and

with them memory of the hardships he had passed through and

of those that seemed before him ere he could realise an inde

pendence ; also of the many temptations that surrounded him

Iwhile mixed up with such a loose society as that of a gold colony.
   could then readily fancy the buoyant spirit so subdued as to

be brought to feel the release a happy one, and as if his only

trouble on that night may have had reference to his father and

sisters and mother.

  It seems no doubt as if it were a hard matter to be called on

I Ito die at so great a distance from all you love, and at so short a

notice ; but believe (from what have myself felt more than
once) that all those circumstances lose their terror and bitter

Iness, when contrasted with the prospect which the near approach

of death awakens in the trustful spirit. For myself, could

have been well contented to have passed away last night, so
firm was my reliance on Him whose presence seemed to be with

me. Australia is as near the gate of Heaven as any other place.
Therefore it does not become us to repine as those that have no

hope, or to murmur because it has pleased a most merciful
Father to hide his doings from us. His ways are not our ways,

nor his thoughts our thoughts. Farewell.

   The foreshadowed illness proved an attack of fever, under
which Dr. Harvey was prostrated soon after sailing from Sydney*
the effects of which continued until his arrival at Valparaiso.
Here, with the same providential care which had attended him
through all his wanderings, he met with friends in Dr. and Mrs.

Ancram, and Mr. and Mrs. Alison, who administered to his
recovery with all the attentions that the utmost kindness could
bestow. To the last-mentioned lady he addressed one of his

earliest letters after his return to Ireland.

CHAPTEE XVI.

HOME LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE.

Early in October Dr. Harvey reached home, after an absence
of over three years. In November he writes to his friend Mrs.
I IGray : " have now been a whole month landed, and
                                                     ought

Iother friends in America." " had hoped to have come home

by the States, and just to have looked in on you, but finding

I Iwhen reached Panama that should have to wait a fortnight
Ifor a steamer, preferred to push homeward, so as to arrive at

the beginning of College term."

Meanwhile the chair of Botany had become vacant in Dublin

University by the appointment of Professor Allman to that of

Edinburgh, and Dr. Harvey was unanimously chosen to succeed

him. The chair which he still held in the Dublin Society

House was about the same time transferred to the Museum of

Industry ; and this change appears to have led to some increase

of duty, as he tells Mrs. Gray that he is too busy to write letters,
having, besides the drudgery of sorting and sticking his Austra

lian Algae, the prospect of having to give additional lectures,
in consequence of the Professorship at Dublin Society House

being converted into a Natural History and Economic chair.
He mentions, moreover, his being requested by the College to
give a Zoology course to the class formed for " Civil Service

I Icome round." After particular mention of some relatives he thus

ends : " find most of my other friends as left them --the
prosperous still prospering --the unfortunate still afflicted."

  A tone of sadness pervades the letter, for the shadow of his

sister's illness hung heavily over him. Her death took place
about six months after, to which reference is made in the follow
ing letter : --

My dear Mrs. Alison,                                                         Trinity College, Dublin, 4th July, 1857.

       IYou will see by the edge of my paper that have had

since my return home to submit to a separation which is the

I Imost trying that could befal me -- the death of my dear and

only sister, with whom have lived since was a boy, and with

whom was bound up much of my enjoyment, and the strongest

remaining tie that bound me to home. She entered into all
my pursuits with as much interest as if they were her own, and

I naturally feel a blank which can never be filled up, and in

many ways begin to find myself an old man whose ties are

loosened, and who has nothing to do but to continue his course

but soon after failed. She bore all her suffering most

patiently and meekly, and from the first resigned herself to her

met her casually. All this we can look back to, and then look
forward to that future reunion after short interval, " where

there shall be no more sea," no more separation or tears.                                            I, I

either in stone walls or in ill-kept dykes. The trees in England

  I left drying paper with Mr. F. Field, but if more be wanted,

old newspapers will do perfectly well. Half a dozen pieces
should be dried of each kind, if so many can be found. Small

plants (annuals, &c.) should be plucked up by the roots, and
dried in one entire piece. Specimens of larger plants should

be broken in sizes from twelve to sixteen inches long. Two
boards, and a big stone or half hundredweight, are all the appa
ratus required, and all the care, to give dry papers now and

Iagain in the process of drying. Number the specimens sent ;

keep a corresponding set, also numbered ; and then can send
you the names, referring to a list of numbers.

During this and the following year Dr. Harvey wrote few

letters. The next which appears to require insertion in this

narrative refers to the approaching death of Miss M. C. Harvey,
the daughter of his eldest and only surviving brother. Stripped
as he had already become by his sister's death, this fresh loss

sadly increased his sense of loneliness.

Her lessons and collects had for a long season, and " in perils by
land and sea," become his daily food. He was fortunate also at

this time in having the companionship of his cousin, the late

eternal rest. Would that we were all as well prepared to meet

death as she is ! Her life has been a short one, and she was

little known beyond her own circle ; but no one who was much

about her, or knew her, could help loving her, and she will be

sadly missed. It was very pleasant to sit by her side and see

the beautifully peaceful and bright expression of her coun

tenance. She could not say much, for speaking brought on the

cough ; but every now and then came an intelligent smile, as

meaning that she knew how very hopeless her disease was ; and

then she expressed her willingness to go at any time that it was
the Lord's will, feeling chiefly on her mother's account. She

could not speak on this subject to her mother without agitation,

and so she wrote her a note in pencil, telling her how she felt.

not be a true expression ; for the end here is but the 'beginning

One day a lame man came and left his crutches there, and

hundreds of people come to the pump every Saturday, so as

sometimes to block up the road, and carry off the holy water as

a remedy for all diseases, but especially for sore eyes. They

   During the vacation of this year Dr. Harvey joined his friend
Dr. Hooker in an excursion through the counties of Sussex,
Devon, and Cornwall. Some of the objects which most engaged
their attention on this tour are described as follows in a letter
to one of his American nieces :--

                                        Trinity College, Dublin, September 25th, 1858.

    IArundel Castle in Sussex would, am sure, have pleased

you, not only because it is a very fine old castle -- nobly situated

on a height as a castle should be, and overlooking a broad and

beautiful country --but because it is historically interesting

from Norman times, and its possession gives the title of earl to

whoever  inherits it ! This is one of the very  few instances in
England  where nobility does not spring from "  a creation " to a

certain family and heirs, the title being here given by William

the Conqueror to whoever should inherit this property. Thus

it has passed from one family to another through female

heirs, and at present belongs to the Duke of Norfolk, whose

eldest son is styled Earl of Arundel. The old castle is partly a

ruin, but a modern one has been built round its keep, and in it

the duke very often resides. We only visited the ruined part,
320 MEMOIR OF DR. HARVEY.

which stands on a mound in the centre of the great quadrangle,

and overtops the modern portion. A narrow staircase leads to
the top of the walls, from which you overlook a very rich

landscape. The keep is roofless, but a net is spread over the
top, under which a number of large owls are kept. They build

in the ivy and yew, and live on the bounty of the noble owner.
   We visited both Salisbury and Exeter Cathedrals, but our

day at Exeter was spent chiefly in Veitch's famous Nursery
Garden, which is an immense establishment. We were much

interested  in his   collection  of plants, both open   air and hothouse.
One of the   latter  had in it   about thirty kinds of
                                                        Pitcher plants --

more by far than any other garden in the world could show.

Mr. Veitch employs collectors in various countries, and by this

means he has introduced more new and fine plants into England

than any other private person.   We dined with him, and he
was very kind to us.

   Penzance was our head-quarters for nearly a week, from
whence we diverged to sundry . places, including the " Land's

End," but it hardly repaid us for the trouble, the sea cliffs, of

which we had heard so much, being greatly inferior in height
and boldness to those in many parts of Ireland and Scotland.

You have probably read of St. Michael's Mount, a conical

islet connected with the land by a causeway covered at high

water, and on which is situated a very picturesque monastic

building, now converted into a private dwelling. A family

Inamed St. Aubyn, to whom the Mount belongs, live much here

in the summer, and certainly it is the snuggest eyrie have

ever seen. They showed us old carved bedsteads and chairs of

oak, which they said were five or six hundred years old. On

the wall of the central tower is St. Michael's chair, famous for

ifthe privilege it confers on man or wife who first sit in it :

husband, then he rules ever after ; if wife, she is mistress and

more.

Another excursion was to the Scilly Islands. What most

interested us there was a curious garden, commenced about

thirty years ago by the gentleman who leases the islands, and
who has successfully grown a number of plants in the open air

which in England are usually seen only in greenhouses. There
are great hedges of geraniums, and a multitude of Australian,

Cape of Good Hope, New Zealand, and Californian plants.

IIt is full time that should reply to your welcome letter

received early in December, and now January is growing apace,

a new year opening, and the snowdrops and crocuses making

busy preparation for their gala. We have as yet had neither

frost nor snow to disturb them, and so they have it all their own

Iway. The violets have not ceased blooming all the winter.

I I Ithank you in advance for the new volume of Holmes's Poems,
which have no doubt shall enjoy.      read little modern

poetry, because the fashionable poets are so very high-flown,

... Ismoky, and cloudy, that it is too much trouble to peer through
at their meaning.  must not conclude without a few words

for the "Old Folk" here, who remember you with affectiou.

you will find some (perhaps much) of the "Memorial"1 interest

city, truthfulness, and love. To those who knew her of course

the effect is stronger, for it seems like hearing her own sweet

voice again.

   they could in broken French, and had a good deal of talk.

   Poerio of course told them stories of his imprisonment of ten

   years in a dungeon, chained to felons and murderers, without
   books or writing materials, or " the human face divine," save in

   its most degraded form. How he lived through it all amazes

   himself, but he is now luxuriating in free air. Some one in

   Cork gave him a Dante, which was a great joy. They left to

   Fiji Islands, to trade with the savages. He there fell in with a
   native chief who had learned Christianity, and who was kind to

   him. They traded together for some time, and when the
   American was returning home the chief said, " We are now

   Iabout to part ; let us pray together." " I cannot," said the

   Iother. " never prayed." " Then," said the savage, " will
   pray for you ;" which he did with so much fervour that trie

   before. During his homeward voyage his heart became

privations, and sufferings to bring out good ; disciplined and
schooled perhaps severely, yet it may be to everlasting profit.

The August of 1859 was spent in company with some relatives

at Ballybunion, a small watering-place in the County Kerry at
the month of the Shannon. " Our days," he writes to Mrs. Gray,

I" pass quietly and without much variety --little to be done in

Imany years.
                like it much, particularly the first and third
stories. It is pleasant reading for a hot day stretched on the

grass under a tree. The old romantic spirit seems faithfully

rendered, and the language is simple and musical, without any of

the fantastic excrescences that deform so many of Tennyson's

poems and those of his imitators."

From Ballybunion Dr. Harvey passed over to England, and in

a letter to Miss Harvey, New York, he gives an interesting account

of a visit to Cambridge, during which he had the pleasure of

being present at an agricultural fete given by Professor Henslow

to his parishioners. " It is," he writes, " very pleasant to witness

the greatly improved condition of the people since Mr. Henslow
took them in hand. In old times the parish was noted for

thieves and vagabonds, and the church was empty ; the only

frequented places of worship being a few dissenting meeting

houses. The people are now steady and comfortable, and take

the greatest interest in their gardens, and in agricultural im
provements, and both church and schools are well filled. Un

fortunately the weather broke just before the fete-day, and we

had a cold dreary downpour most of the time, which greatly

spoiled the picturesque effect, and kept away strangers, but it

did not damp the spirits of the villagers, of whom about four

hundred came to the rectory. The show took place in the

pretty sloping lawn extending from the house to the church,

which with its old Norman tower is a handsome object, seen

through a vista among the trees. At one side of the lawn was a

marquee, fitted up as a temporary museum, displaying a number

of curious and instructive objects, on wbich from time to time

the professor gave what he calls 'leeturets,' or familiar ex

planations. The prizes were small, the highest being only

three-and-sixpence, and it was pleasant to see that mere nominal

sums were sufficient to incite the competitors ; who, no doubt,

valued the eclat of having their carrots, turnips, or onions
ticketed ' First prize,' ' Extra prize,' &c., much more than the

money which the prize represented. Such shows as these are

now gradually extending in England, and in many ways they

will be extremely useful to the poorer population, and also to the

wealthy class, by bringing them more in contact with the hopes of

the poor and their every-day life. It is customary for two or more

of such societies, in different parts of the kingdom, to compete

together for what is called a sweepstake prize, and this year, in

such a competition with two other societies, out of fifteen prizes

Mr. Henslow's people won eleven, which announcement pro

duced great cheering. At the close of the day the booth was

cleared of its vegetables, and about three hundred sat down to a

plentiful tea, where bread and butter and plum-cake went

round till all were satisfied. The tea was brought out in pails

and huge jugs, after which the chief prizemen drank the health

of the society in Cambridge College ale, then the whole

think so. It can foster production, and incite growth, but
(I hold) there must be a germ to begin with, at least so far as I

simulate organic substances is the artificial perfumes and spices

formed out of fousel oil, but the oil was there to begin with.

struck with the real poetry of one picture that he unwittingly
brought to my eye. He was explaining how they should first

settle the mission, before their houses were built and their

people gathered round them. As for themselves, why, the

native huts would shelter them, that was nothing. But how

was their church to be ? He told us then what makeshifts he

had to resort to in his colonial missionary work, and that they

now purposed to avoid these, and to start from the very

beginning with a thing set apart, consecrated to worship. So

is infinite in mercy, and his compassions fail not. All is

mystery, even when the best of us are called to the account ;

and where we know so little we must rest in faith and sub

mission. "His way is in the sea, and his paths in the great

Iwaters, and his footsteps are not known." These words occurred

to me in thinking over this news, and know not how to write,

but to bid you trust in Him who knows the secrets of all hearts,

and can best decide on the proper length of days allotted to

every separate life. It is impossible to offer comfort, but one

may try to lead the thoughts trustfully to the feet of the Cross,
to Him who underwent death for every sinner.

Ispecies" were created, and what they were like, trow not.

IThat they were vastly fewer than the forms we now call species,
  think probable, but also that they were vastly more numerous

than Darwin would have us believe.

   The imperfection of geological record may be argued both
ways, either as Darwin does, or we may say --if all things that

ever lived had been all fossilized and could all be found, then

we should trace back existing species and genera throxigh aU

times to the beginning, and the supposed succession of new types
revealed by geology would disappear! Monstrously absurd,

perhaps, but not worse than Darwin's supposition ; for if we trace

Chiton, Lingula, Anodon, and many other existing genera down

to Silurian, and find the living species scarcely divaricated from
the oldest fossil, and if we
                              consider that a  vethryerefewareyeaforsrtyag--o
scarcely a fossil Chiton was  known, yet now
going down to Silurian may we not argue that, if all Sihiria

were laid bare, a vast number more  of similarly  "  undivaricated
genera and species would turn up ?   To what         lower deep "

below the lowest deep must we dive to find the four or five

originals from which Darwin assumes that everything diva

ricated, if natural selection from the Silurian period to the

fpresent day has made nothing out of a Chiton but a Chiton

And so of other genera ? The whole question is removed out of

court. Evidence ceases at Siluria, where Chiton, Ling-ula, and

Anodon differed as widely from each other as they do in the

year now shining.

I IBible (so say in Tenth Conversation, written in 1855).
Iregard those chapters as should a magnificent overture to a

Igrand opera. They open up the mind to great conceptions of

the glory and power of the Creator, but never (since long ago,
baby days) looked on them as a literal history of what took

place. Creation is one of those deep things of God too far

sunk into the fathomless sea to be seen by man, or understood

or made plain by revelation to his language or senses. Now

and then we catch a flash of light from some half-revealed truth

out of the depths, and then 'tis gone again.. (I think now of
those large luminous creatures that you see  yinout,he"tfraoipr icaasl
flashing under the ship many fathoms below                              sea,

moon," and quite as apparently large.) But to speak of the
days of creation and what occurred on each day (as if we heard

Ithe ticking of the dial-plate of time, and could watch the hands

slowly moving round), think no more rational than it would
be to try and discover to what music it was that the " morning

stars sang together." Let us by all means have the literal
interpretation of the text. Let us rejoice in any light it throws

on subjects that no language can express, and no Jbrain of man

CHAPTER XVII.

HOME LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE.

Although surrounded by friends, and occupied more closely

than ever by his College duties, Dr. Harvey's life had been

rendered very lonely by the blanks left in his family circle

during the past few years. But the spring of 1861 brought an

important change in his circumstances. On the 2nd of April
he was married, in Limerick, to Miss Phelps, a lady whom he

had long known. His choice was most fortunate, and his remain

ing years were as happy as devoted affection could make them.

But almost immediately after his marriage his health gave way.

While lecturing at Glasnevin, the first symptoms of haemorrhage
from the lungs appeared, and were succeeded by a severe attack,
from the effects of which he never entirely recovered. His

physicians expected that a sojourn for a time at his beloved

Miltown Malbay might suffice to restore him to health. He

lierived temporary benefit, but the following spring brought re

newed delicacy, and thus he continued to fluctuate for the short

allotted period of his days, the insidious disease never altogether

losing its grasp, though hope again and again revived.

The Social Science Meeting was held in Dublin during the
August of this year (1861). Dr. and Mrs. Harvey had looked
forward with pleasant anticipation to seeing Dr. and Mrs. Alfred

Gatty at their home during the session, but Dr. Harvey's ill
ness sadly overruled this pleasure. It was arranged, however, tha:
these English friends should include Miltown in their tour to
the west of Ireland, and thus secure the mutual pleasure.           An
account of the visit will
this brief trip to Ireland,  be found    in Mrs. Gatty's  sketches   of

coast, and when it rains we have either books or writing. This

is a queer wild place, without a tree bigger than a bush to be

seen for miles, so that all the beauty and enjoyment of the

place lies about the shore itself. There the aspect varies so

much from day to day that we never tire of it. At the spring

tides we have the excitement of looking for a beautiful blue

shell called (Ianthina), which floats on the surface no doubt from

thousands of miles distant, coming to us with the waters of the
Gulf Stream.

at Ecclesfield.

   You ask me to tell you of the Exhibition. All Exhibitions

have a similar character as a whole, but the excitement this

year was wholly unlike the "World's Fair" in 1851: then
there was the charm of novelty, and the active superintendence

of Prince Albert, and every one was in the best possible good

humour with every one and everything. All was sunshine of

the brightest and serenest, and so every one enjoyed himself to

the utmost. None of this halo rested on 1862-- the poor

Prince was in his early grave, the Queen secluded herself, only

visiting the palace by stealth, in the strictest privacy, so that

few knew she was there at all. So, though the contents of the

show of 1862 are allowed to be far superior to those of 1851, the

general effect was less beautiful. So every one says. The Jews

who saw the first Temple, wept at the dedication of the second.

Those who did not remember the first Exhibition, alone could

do justice to this last. . . . The picture galleries were to me

and to many others the most enjoyable part of the show. The

English school, ancient and modern, was very fully and well
Irepresented. To me it is with painting as with music.

in this --that could not shut my eyes to the inroads that time

has made in the health of my dear old friend Sir William
Hooker. He was almost confined to the sofa the whole time,

and though cheerful and patient beyond most, yet it was so

different from his old buoyant activity that it felt sad. He has

passed his seventy-eighth birthday ! Still his mind is bright

and vigorous, and sight and memory remarkably good, and he
is as anxious as ever to promote his favourite science. Nor is

there yet any shake in his clear handwriting, and his pen runs

as fast as ever. It was two years since I had been at Kew, so

I saw the greater change.
  I have read reviews of Trollope's book that you write of. It

Professor Bailey of West Point. He is now a Professor in a

New Brunswick College, and seems to wish to do every justice

very nice letter, and it gave me great pleasure to receive it.

                                 Winton Road, Feast of St. Paul, 1863.

Thank you very much for Dr. Vaughan's " The Book and
I Ithe Life," which had intended getting.
                                           have as yet only read

passage in the first to which you cannot give a full assent, but

you judge rightly that it coincides with my views long held and

adhered   to, long before those latter-day doubts came into
fashion.
matters   I do most thoroughly think that the revelation of
          Iof science was never designed, and implicitly as
should follow the revealed word in all its doctrinal teaching, if

Iit told me a fact of science, such as that water on cooling to 40°

becomes specifically lighter till the surface freezes, should not

believe it for the word's sake without experimental tests. Yet

I do assuredly believe that that irregularity in the case of

water, which we know is of such vital consequence to all

creatures that live therein, was designed by an Allwise Fore-
Ithinker --before water was --as a special means to effect a
special end.   mention this familiar case just to show the

Irepugnance of my mind to receive any science as a revelation,

and, with Dr. Vaughan, think it derogatory to the Almighty
Ito suppose that He would reveal to man what man by searching
can find out.  think it fairly proved by the cloudiness and

endless   contradictions, and    "thmeandrebaymsleaanrdchiinngtocawnnhoicth     meta
physics   (abstract) lead, that                                              find out

God," nor solve the moral problems that he finds in himself,
Iand therefore these are, if anything be, the proper (and think
Ifthe only proper) subjects of a revelation.
                                              we contrast the

Bible with pretended revelations, we find that it steers clear

of the attempts to teach scientific  facts such as they (the
Hindu books, and the old magical     books of other nations)

largely profess to do.

What Dr. V. says of the absurdity of foretelling a scientific
"truth," which though accepted as a truth to-day may be

proved to be a lie to-morrow, is very just. Science is always in

progress ; always polishing off old surfaces and bringing out

new. In her eye nothing is final, her faith knows no repose,

looks forward to no future rest. She cannot conceive either of

a beginning or an end, neither hath she any goal conceivable

  have ever stood out against the geological apologies for Moses.

The more that science gets footing among the clergy, the less
will they feel inclined to accept the fancies of those apologistic

Iharmonists. Such apologies will assuredly lead to defeat. An

illustration which heard to-day in church struck me at the

moment as apt to our present topic. The preacher spoke of the

ark being taken by the Philistines when the Levites had

brought it to the battle upon assurance of victory, and he said

this was because they had made an improper appeal to it. Now

it struck me that the conduct of those Levites was parallel to

that of the clergy when they bring forward the Bible to dis

prove a scientific fact, and as recent events                  have  sufficiently
shown, with the worst results to the cause of
                                                              " the  truth." Is

not the Ark of God now in the hands of the Philistines ? But

        We came home yesterday from our summer tour, which we

Igreatly enjoyed, and hope we are all the better for it. We were

just a month out of England, going through France to Switzer
land, and returning by Belgium. Weather mostly very
pleasant, and when it failed us we fled. We spent some days
at Kew with our friends there, and also at Clapham with

IMr. Ward, and with Dr. and Mrs. Gray at the British Museum.

finishing off the last volume of his "Sp. Filicum," and think
already beginning to nibble at another book, which he thinks
it is a pity not to do as a coping stone. So we go on ; but how

       We are really very bad letter-writers, and getting worse

and worse every day. It is not that we forget you, for % have

distinct memory of many intentions to write, but somehow the

days went by and nothing was done. We had our usual holiday

of three months, a part of which we spent in France and Switzer

land, where we had not been for some years. We just left home

when the weather became stormy, and so prolonged our summer

for a good five weeks, leaving Switzerland again just as the

lower hills became white with snow, and the place began to look

dreary. We then paid visits to some of our friends near London,

staying a happy week at Kew.

clever, one of Kingsley's best things. There are multitudes of

allusions, sarcastic and otherwise, to scientific facts and men,

Iwhich perhaps may not be so clear to one not versed in the

matters referred to, but think you (as a Professor) will be able
fully to appreciate the fun. You know the quarrel between

Owen and Huxley about the Hippocampus minor (which
Kingsley travesties as Hippopotamus major) ? Then Professor

Ptthmllnsprts (if you add     vowels   to the consonants you will
find what words they spell).     Then   the history of the " Do as

that means. We are going to-day to a performance of Handel's

performed in Dublin, a fact of which our folk are proud.

great new conservatory, which is much larger than the old

palm house, is beautiful. It is filled with' such half-hardy trees,

shrubs, and plants, as need only a winter protection, and many

are now coming into flower. Already there are gum-trees and
acacias in full bloom ; the smell of the latter like meadow sweet.

There is a gallery round the house, near the top, and the view

looking down on the trees, &c., most charming. All are

planted without pots or tubs in open borders, with walks be

I IIn May contracted a troublesome cough, which have not

been able to shake off, and as country air seemed the best

medicine, the first week in July we set off for the County

Wicklow, accompanied by Dr. and Mrs. Hooker of Kew, with

Iwhom we spent a very pleasant time among its picturesque
lakes and mountains.  had not been there for twenty-five

years at the least. Our head-quarters were at the Seven

Churches, "by that lake whose gloomy shore," &c., where,
finding a comfortable inn, we made excursions on cars from it
in all directions. The weather was superb, splendid sunshine

and blue skies, such as we don't often have, even in summer.

When our friends left us, we went on to Limerick and County

Tipperary, and in August returned to Dublin, intending to

finish the summer in the Highlands of Scotland, but my cough

being rather worse than better, Dr. S  sent us to Normandy

for warm dry air and general change. Thither we of course

set off, going via Jersey, where we stayed a few days, and then

went on to St. Malo, where we landed 26th August. Here we

crossed the harbour to St. Servan, where we found a comfort

able boarding-house. St. Servan is much like any other

French country town of the old school. It is close to the sea,

and has pleasant suburbs within easy distances. When we got

there the climate was most delicious-- clear air, warm sun, and

Ipleasant sea breezes; and we should have seen much of the

vicinage but that fell ill, and was left too weak to do much

more than crawl about before the summer was gone and the

blustery weather coming. So towards the end of September we
set out homewards, and during the ten days it took us to

Ireach Southampton we had most lovely weather, for which great

blessing hope we felt thankful.
   The country as we passed through' Normandy and Brittany

was very pretty and picturesque, and the fine old towns very

quaint and interesting. Our route lay by Dol, Avranches,

IVire, and Caen, to Havre. We rested two days at Vire, a

simple a reception from a Frenchman. He has a nice old house

and old-fashioned garden, and he and his wife, who is an invalid,

live on their income in quiet happiness. It is a very primitive

spot ; no rail yet to it. We got to his house by a narrow country

road, just broad enough for our wheels, and so full of holes and

rough places that it was an agony to be driven over it. But the
end repaid our trouble. His whole time seems to be spent among

his plants, and he has a herbarium that almost fills his house,

leaving only three or four rooms for the family. From Vire we

had a long day's journey to Caen, the old capital of Normandy,

where William and Matilda were buried, each in the chancel of a

noble church. The churches remain, but the tombs have been

broken, and the bones scattered. Caen is full of quaint old

buildings, besides the fine Gothic churches. Now my travels are

over ; for we went to Havre by steam, and then to Southampton

and London, and so on to Kew, where we spent a fortnight with
Sir W illiam and Lady Hooker most pleasantly ; then to Dublin,

arriving 14th October.

                                              CONCLUSION.

The winter of 1864-65 passed over without any apparent change
for the worse in Dr. Harvey's health, but the cold winds of
spring, always so trying to invalids, and peculiarly felt in
Dublin, seemed to accelerate the progress of the disease. The
unfavourable symptoms increased, and his physicians again
recommended a warmer climate. Arcachon, on the south-west
coast of France, was the place decided upon, on account of the
supposed beneficial effect of the aroma of its pine forests.

                                                             Arcachon, Gironde, March 16th, 1865.

       We reached this place yesterday morning from Paris,
having travelled (chiefly by night) thirteen hours, and getting
here at ten a.m. We had a stoppage of an hour at Bordeaux
Station, and so we arrived tolerably fresh at our lodgings. We
were hardly arrived when Mrs. G. sent in her servant with a
hot-pot of delicious English tea, and bread and butter, and she
has continued her kindness in every possible way. We are most
grateful to her, a perfect stranger to us save by her husband's in
troduction. You will want to know about the place. Well, it
is in fine weather to all, and in all weathers to some, a most
charming place-- very picturesque, much more varied in level

Ithan had anticipated, and the pines not at all sombre. They

are of all ages, but few large. There is a village where we, the
humble-minded, are housed ; and there are villas of all shapes
and sizes for the rich, here and there, through what is called the
forest --a very open one. The undergrowth is chiefly arbutus,
now in fruit. Houses painted all colours of the rainbow, and
many are of fantastic shapes.

You would be amused at what we call " a wind " here. Any

breath that stirs a leaf or does but move the little twigs of the pine-

tops we regard with suspicion, and seek to guard against ; and to

hear people talk, you would think it was really blowing. We
keep as much as possible in the perfectly still places where the

sun shines.

No perfume yet from the pines, nor will it come till the

April 26th. We took a charming drive to La Teste, a village

about three miles distant, at the head of the bay. The road

very pretty, bordered with deciduous trees, which are just in

their newest and freshest green dress, and these backed by

dark pines, under which the large yellow broom was profusely
in blossom. Then, after a while, the road opened at one side, to

the broad harbour, and we had meadows                      (rare things here) on
the other side, and the sun shone, and                     the fresh but gentle

       We continue to like this place. Only two days as yet so
hot that we did not care to go out. On every other day,
though bright and shadeless (save for our umbrellas), a delicious
sea air, never amounting to wind, fanned our cheeks, and set the
leaves of the plane-trees in tune, which make a noise like that
of rain rustling on foliage--not unpleasant.

   Last Sunday was held the fete of Corpus Christi (fete Dieu),
and the streets through winch the procession passed were
strewed with green naggers and ferns, and all the houses hung
out white sheets ; but this is all we saw, for the procession went
by while we were in church.

      Some long time ago you wrote me about the Greek service
Iheld at your Trinity Church, and asked me to say what thought
Iof it.   am no theologian, but, like many persons in the present
Iday, should rejoice to see Christians of all denominations

united so far as to be able to worship together, still allowing to

every man his liberty of conscience in smaller matters. There

is a prayer in our book (not in yours 1 believe) in the office for

so fond of it that we read it every Sunday morning in our

family prayers. It is a golden prayer, and so beautiful, yon will

love it also and perhaps use it. As to the Greek Church, you

know that the only essential difference between her doctrine and
                                                                  --the proces

break the unity of the Church ? Nine-tenths or more of the

clergy, and a vast majority of the laity, would probably say it
is ; and if it be, it is irreconcilable, the Eastern and Western

IChurches are severed for ever. So they are, so long as the pre

sent dogmatic symbols are retained. But trust and pray that

a day may come when men may see that doctrines which are far

above the grasp of the highest human mind are unfit to be made

tests of orthodoxy or badges of a party. To fight for the

Western view of the doctrine appears to us to be clearly taught

in Scripture. It does not appear to be so taught to the Eastern

mind. Each Church regards its opinion with equal reverence ; each

seeks equally to honour God in the view she takes. Who shall
judge between them ? Is it a subject which it is absolutely

My dear Mrs. Alison,  -\Yinton Road, Dublin, 10th March, I860.

      Last evening's post brought me the Jersey newspaper, con
taining the sad, sad news from Bogota -- news so completely un
expected that it has shocked us both very much. You looked

forward so cheerfully in your last letter to his winter voyage,
and it seemed so very desirable at the time, that the shock is

the greater. We do indeed most sincerely sympathize with you,

and pray that you may be supported in this greatest of all trials

by the Divine arm, which alone can bring resignation under

every affliction. At present you will hardly realize the full

Iextent of your loss. The stunning effects of a sudden bereave

ment know well, and that it is only day by day, as time goes
on, that the survivor feels the full stroke. But at the same time

the spirit is more subdued, and more prepared to receive the

consolation that God provides for all his dependent ones, and

Ithe cry is uttered, " Whom have in heaven but Thee, and there
Iis none on the earth that desire in comparison of Thee-- Thy

will be done." May God, my dear friend, be your support and

stay now and for evermore ! . . . Mrs. Harvey joins me in love
to you and G., and we both feel for you from the bottom of onr
hearts. God bless and comfort you, and make His face to shine

upon you !                           Your affectionate friend,
                                                        W. H. Harvey.

   During the winter of 1865-60 Dr. Harvey's health appeared
much the same as in the two previous seasons. In February,

however, haemorrhage, returned, which was succeeded by increased
debility, and Dr. S. advised that the remainder of the spring
should be passed at Torquay, to which the invalid willingly
assented, and the more readily that Lady Hooker was then
residing there, which gave pleasure to the prospect. The
voyage to Plymouth, though undertaken as the easiest route,

proved very fatiguing, and he arrived at Torquay much ex
hausted. Here he was met by his kind friend, whose affec

tionate welcome acted as a temporary revival, and in whose

house he and Mrs. Harvey took up their abode. He writes

My dear Mrs. Alison,

      Your letter of 7th only reached me last evening, and

Ialthough not allowed to write much (for am very weak, and
Isoon tired), must send you a few lines to say how grateful

I feel to you for having written to me so soon, and also for the

letter, and F. Field's beautiful lines.

  II have been thinking of you continually since got the paper,
Iand had lately almost made up my mind to write to G., and

beg her to tell me how you were. The letter from Bogota

indeed is most consoling in every way, but how [ pitied the dear

man in his long mule journey, when in so weakly a state ! Oh,

it is painful  to think  on ! but  God was with  him throughout and
               and 'tis  He alone                our bed in sickness."

                                   am now seventeen days here, but
I Ido not yet recover strength. Indeed am weaker, and think

My face is the only unemaciated part. We are here with my

370 MEMOIR OF DR. HARVEY.

   Written by his wife to Dr. Fisher, enclosing above :--

                 Many times before, and this morning, he spoke such
beautiful words of resignation, and words of comfort to me. He
prayed that he might await the Lord's time with patience. He
thanked God for his many mercies to him, and said His love and
goodness had followed him all the days of his life in this pleasant
world. Yes, he said, it had been a pleasant world to him.
The Lord has been very gracious to him and us. His mind so
calm and clear, and such lively faith and hope in the merits of

his precious Saviour. Even to the last he is thinking of others.
You will see, though very faint, his dear signature at the end

of your letter."

It was thus the pure spirit cast off its shroud of mortality,

and peacefully passed away. Fondly watched over by his

wife and nephew, he closed his gentle eyes and fell asleep,

on the 15th May, 1866.

13y his own desire his remains are laid in the cemetery at

Torquay.

Dr. Harvey's friend of many years, Mr. Ward, visited him in

those    d"yiInghahdoutrhse,  and many months after he thus wrote of that
visit :                       great privilege of spending a day with him
Ishortly before his departure, and in all my long experience
never saw a countenance more illumined by that ' peace of God

which passeth all understanding,' and this heavenly state con

tinued to the close of his existence. May our last end be like
