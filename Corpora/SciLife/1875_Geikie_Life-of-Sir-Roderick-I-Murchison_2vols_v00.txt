                  PREFACE.
   COMPARED with foregoing periods of history, the
nineteenth century has been marked by the extent
and rapidity of its social transitions.    These must
undoubtedly be ascribed in great measure to the
strides made by the    physical  sciences.    Without
claiming for Geology any prominent      share in them,
we may yet contend that this branch of science has
done much to open out those wider views of nature
and of man's place here, which have so powerfully
influenced the tone and tendency of human thought
and speculation at the present tune.       So that the
history of a man who was a conspicuous actor in the
drama of the establishment of Geology, as a science,
may possess more than a merely individual interest.
    The life of Sir Roderick Murchison was cast in
this time of notable transition.     Living   on terms
 of intimacy with not a few of the leading men of his
day, he himself bore a part in the leavening of the
 community   with an appreciation   of the nature and

  vi                       PREFACE.
  value of science.       For many years he was in the
  habit of keeping     a  record of the events which he
  witnessed, or in which he took part.          In  the belief
  that the story of his life might have some interest
  and usefulness for those who should succeed him,
 he used now and then during his later years to de
  vote his spare hours to the task of reading over his
 early journals, and superintending          their transcrip
 tion in whole      or in abstract     under    his own eye.
 In   the course of tune      a goodly     series of closely-
 written volumes grew under the hand of the amanu
 ensis,  but their author at length perceived that their
 details could hardly possess        sufficient   interest for
 general readers.       In  the spring of 1871 he pro
 posed to me that       I  should undertake      the task of
 reducing his memoranda into a connected narrative.
     Having accepted the office of biographer,         I found
that, in addition to the journals, there existed a vast
mass    of miscellaneous letters and papers going back
even     into  last   century.     It  appeared      that Sir
Roderick for many years of his life never destroyed
any piece of writing        addressed to him, — notes of
invitation to dinner, and acceptances of invitations
given by himself, being abundant among the papers.
    To these materials, through the kindness of his
friends and correspondents,       to all of whom sincere

                          PREFACE.                          vii
thanks are due,     I was     subsequently enabled to add
a large series of his own letters.
   From the first it appeared likely that no narrative
devoted     merely    to    the   personal    events    of Sir
Roderick     Murchison's life would          be  satisfactory.
And    as the work of arranging the voluminous mate
rials proceeded, the desirability of adopting a wider
treatment     became     increasingly    evident.    His life,
closely bound up with the early progress of geology
in this country, was         one  of work and movement.
Duly to follow its stages, the surroundings             among
which it was passed must be constantly                kept in
view, — notably his comrades,          their work, and its
relation to his own.        Accordingly    I deemed    it best,
while keeping       his story prominently before the
reader, to give an outline of so much at least of
these surroundings        as   would probably     show with
adequate     distinctness      what   Murchison was, and
what he did.      With this view     I have   sketched some
of the more salient features in the rise and growth
of the geology of the older formations in Britain,
including, at the same time, notices of Murchison's
predecessors and contemporaries in the same branch
of science.    Obviously, however, even such a general
outline   as was alone admissible         into a work like
the present could not be continued            into the later

viii                   PREFACE.
years when Murchison ceased to be the same pro
minent worker he had previously           been, and when
his labours were taken up and extended by others.
To this historical aspect of the book,           I  believed
that    some    additional   interest    might    be   given
by a selection of portraits of some of the more
conspicuous     men to whom the establishment            and
spread of geology in Britain is due, more especially
with reference to the study of the older rocks.
Some     difficulty   was   necessarily    encountered     in
making the selection, arising in some cases from
 the want of available      materials for the engraver,
 in others from      the  limited number       of portraits
 admissible    compared with that        of the geologists
 deserving such recognition.       Greenough, Fitton, and
 Lonsdale, for example, among the earlier luminaries,
 might have been most appropriately included               in
 the list here given.       To the     friends   who    have
 supplied   the paintings,   drawings,    and photographs
 from which this little gallery of scientific worthies
 has been engraved, my best acknowledgments               are
 gladly given.
     Of Murchison's early contemporaries who outlived
 him, and from      whom     assistance was received       in
 the   preparation    of his    biography,     two of the
 most illustrious have since been removed by death.

                      PREFACE.                          ix
Sir Charles Lyell furnished      a series  of letters on
geological  topics   written   to him by Murchison.
Professor  Phillips,  besides supplying a large       and
most interesting collection of letters, which proved
of great service in the preparation of the biography,
kindly sent  some memoranda      of his own, which will
be found incorporated    in the book.    To Mr. Poulett
Scrope  I am indebted    for some interesting and useful
notes respecting some of the older geologists of this
country.
   My friend  and colleague, Professor A. C. Ptamsay,
has laid me under      much obligation     by the notes
and suggestions sent by him as he read over the
proof-sheets,  and which are incorporated       into the
text or embodied here and there in footnotes.           To
Mr. John Murray, Mr. K. R. Murchison, Mr. Tren-
ham Reeks, and Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S.,
my thanks are likewise owing for a similar revision.

   A MONG the Western Highlands           of Scotland there is no
         wilder tract than that which stretches      between the
Kyles of Skye and the line of the Great Glen.           From the
margin of the western  sea the ground rises steeply into rugged
mountains, which slope away eastward through many miles
of rough moorland into the very heart of the country.         The
bold Atlantic front of these mountains is trenched by deep
and narrow valleys, of which the upper parts rise above the
sea-level into dark and rocky glens, the lower portions sink
ing under the water and forming the characteristic sea-lochs
or fjords of that region.     In the shelter of these hollows,
alike in the glens,   and as an irregular      selvage along the
margins of the lochs, lie strips of arable land with farm
houses and the cots    of the peasantry; but all above        and
around are the wild rough hills, shrouded for great part of
the year in mist, and catching the first dash of the fierce
western rains, which seam their sides     with foaming torrents.
    Even now, with all the appliances of modern travel, these
tracts of Lochalsh and  Kiutail  are little known, except in so

far as they can be seen from the         sea,   or from the few good
roads which have been made through them.              But some five or
six generations back they were to all intents             as remote       from
the civilisation      even   of the Scottish Lowlands      as   if they    had
lain in the heart of Russia,         No roads led across them then.
They could be traversed only by bridle-tracks,                    too     little
trodden to be always easily traced              among      the bogs and
crags     over which they lay.         Notwithstanding           the     noble
inlets which bring the tides of the Atlantic far into these
wilds,     there was then but little navigation, even of the
simplest kind.         Save the boats used      in ferrying the lochs
and in fishing, almost the only vessels ever seen were the
smacks and cutters which from time to time smuggled ashore
brandy and claret for the lairds.
      Over this wild region the chiefs of the clan Mackenzie
had for a long while held sway — a fierce and warlike race,
exemplifying on their territory the curiously mingled merits
and     defects    of the old Highland patriarchal              system.      In
their midst, however,         lay one or two smaller septs, some
times in league with the dominant clan, sometimes                      in open
arms on the side of their surrounding enemies.                One of these
septs went by the name of Mhurachaidh            or Macmhurachaidh,
that     is,   Murdoch or Murdochson, or, as    it   is   now corrupted,
Murchison.           The first   of the family must have been                 a
Murdoch.          Who he was, however, where he came from, and
what he did to distinguish himself from the other abounding
Murdochs of that part of Scotland, are questions                    to   which
no satisfactory answer seems now possible.                Perhaps he was
one of the Mackenzies, or more probably of the Mathiesons,
or clan Malghamna, who possessed these tracts before the
Mackenzies, and          among    whom    Murdoch       was     a   frequent

characteristic, so that his posterity came to be called after
him.
      In  the early part of the sixteenth century we find the
Murchisons         in possession     of land in Kintail.        In   the year
1541,    Evin M'Kynnane Murchison was proprietor of Bun-
chrew when he obtained a remission from James                           v.  for
having taken an active part, together with some of his neigh
bours,     in burning the castle of Eilandonan, the stronghold
of the Mackenzies, at the mouth of Loch Duich.                         It  has
been     conjectured by a friendly            genealogist,   that for such
deeds the sept received           the soubriquet of
                                                          " Chalmaon," or
" brave ;" and that this title led to their
                                                         being confounded
with certain M'Colmans of Argyleshire.2                There must at least
have     been a wonderful         versatility   about the race, for not
many years          after the raid     on the Mackenzies,          when the
Eeformation had already made                 way through the country,
the churches of Kintail, Lochcarron, and Lochalsh were in
peaceable possession         of different members of the family.3
      In the   following century (1634) the Murchisons appear on
the Ross-shire rent-roll        as  holding land in Lochalsh, of which
they had obtained charters             from the Crown.         By this time,
   1 This suggestion has     been  made   to me by Mr. W. F. Skene, who
adds that    " the  small septs are often the remnants of the older popula
tion."
   2 In the
               North-West Highlands      the Murchisons are called in Gaelic
M 'Column,     and have been traced by some genealogists to an origin in
Argyleshire, where a sept of that name occurs. The family traditions,
however, insist on a more northern origin, as stated in the text.
   3 In
         1574, James VI. presented John Murchesoun
                                                          " to the haill com-
moun kirk, baith parsonage and vicarage, of Kintail."        In 1582 the same
King presented Donald Murcheson to the same church, then vacant by
the demission of John Murcheson,        and Master Murdo Murcheson       to the
parsonage    of Lochalah and Lochcarron.   — Register of Great Seal.  For these

too, they seem to have         settled their differences     with the
Mackenzies of Seaforth, for they then held rank as hereditary
castellans   of that same Eilandonan stronghold which about
a hundred years earlier they had assisted to demolish.
    It  is not, however, until the troublous times of 1715 that
any member of the Murchison            sept comes notably forward
in Highland history.        Up till that period the people of these
wilds    remained under the same clan-system              which    had
prevailed from the earliest times.         The word of their chiefs
was their law, and they had but a feeble notion of any
higher rule or greater authority outside the dominions of the
clan.     While this ancient obedience and attachment con
tinued on the part of the vassals, the chiefs themselves         were
more or less influenced by somewhat         similar feelings towards
the old line of the Stuarts.         A new race of sovereigns had
been installed     by Southern and       Saxon hands.      It  was re
garded    by these mountaineers with distrust and fear.          They
had no great      cause to look back      with satisfaction to their
treatment under the sway of the fallen house.               But there
appeared    more   risk than ever of molestation from the new
and alien rulers     ; and so, partly from loyalty to the Stuarts,
and partly from distrust of the Hanoverian            dynasty, there
existed at this time among the Highlanders a wide-spread
disaffection and longing for     a restoration.
    At last     these   feelings  found vent in open         insurrec
tion, and the outbreak of 1715 began.             Among the chiefs
who appeared       in arms came the Earl of Seaforth,             head
of the Mackenzie         clan.    With him marched          a gallant
company of Murchisons,         including two of note, John and
Donald, uncle and nephew, the former bearing a commission
in the Prince's army, and bringing with him all the men he

 his commission having been sent over by the Pretender
 himself in a quaint large ivory " snuff-mull," inscribed with
 the words " JAMES REX.          FORWARD AND SPAKE NOT."
                                                                   1
      Among those who fell in the disastrous battle of Sheriff-
 muir was the great-grandfather of the subject of this bio
 graphy.      Colonel Donald, however,        made good his escape,
 and soon afterwards appeared          in his native district, where,
 amid narrow inlets and bays, rough glens and lonely moors,
he could bid defiance to the conquerors.
     Donald Murchison was certainly one of the most remark
able Highlanders of his day.2          Bred a lawyer at Edinburgh,
he united to the usual warlike virtues of the clansman a
shrewdness and knowledge of the world, which gave him
considerable influence       as the   agent and friend     of the Earl
of Seaforth.        After the battle of Sheriffmuir,          when the
Earl went into exile in France, Donald appears to have
gone      back to the mountains of Kintail.              Doubtless, in
 1719, he took his share      in the rude fortifying of Eilandonan
 Castle,   of which, as we have seen, his family had been here
ditary castellans,      and   saw  with dismay its walls battered
to pieces     by the guns of three English war -vessels.             Nor
was .he    likely to be absent from his chief when the luckless
expedition of Spanish auxiliaries and Highlanders, marching
eastward for the invasion of the country, encamped              in Glen
   1 This box was in the possession of Sir Roderick np to the time of his
death, and is now one of the family heirlooms in the keeping of his
nephew and heir, Mr. K. R. Murchison.      It forms a conspicuous feature
in the picture of " Donald Murchison gathering Seaforth's rents in Kin-
tail," painted for him by Sir Edwin Landseer, and bequeathed by him to
the National Gallery at Edinburgh.

shiel.    Seaforth     escaped   wounded, and Donald          was   not
among the prisoners.
     The Seaforth estates were forfeited, but they lay in            so
remote and inaccessible a region that the Commissioners of
the Forfeited Estates only in 1721 were able to procure               a
factor bold enough to march westward to take possession of
them.     Donald      Murchison,     however,   had been     intrusted
with their keeping by him whom he and all the native popu
lation still regarded     as the  rightful laird.    Hearing of the
approach of the new factor       with a body of the King's troops,
he attacked them as they toiled through one of the savage
glens of the district, and not only stopped their further pro
gress, but compelled the factor to give a bond          of £500 that
he would never again attempt to carry out his duties            in that
quarter.     That he might have additional sanction for his
own proceedings,       Donald even extorted authority from the
unfortunate     official to act    as  deputy-factor for the Com
missioners of Forfeited Estates,        so that he could draw his
rents for the Earl either     as the agent   of the one Government
or of the other,    as might be needful in each      case.
     Again, in the following year, a still larger party of sol
diers made another attempt to gain possession of the rebel
lious country.      But once more Donald proved himself not
unworthy of the colonel's commission and the ivory snuff-
mull.    By a clever piece of strategy he discomfited this
new invasion, and forced        it to retire  to its starting-place at
Inverness.
     For ten years Donald Murchison            administered the Sea
 forth estates.     Even after his successful resistance         to the
 royal troops, such was his boldness that he would go per
sonally to Edinburgh        to see after the proper transmission

of the rents to          the banished and attainted Earl.               General
Wade, in reporting             to George     I.  in 1725, writes that "the
rents [of the Seaforth lands] continue to be collected by one
Donald Murchison, a servant of the late Earl's, who remits
or carries the same to his master into France.                   . . .  The last
year this Murchison marched in                  a public manner to          Edin
 burgh to remit £800            to France, and remained fourteen days
 there unmolested.           I cannot omit       observing to your Majesty
 that this national         tenderness     the subjects of      North Britain
 have one for the other is a great encouragement                       for rebels
  and attainted persons to return home from their banish
             1
  ment."
         Though the " Coarnal," as Donald was called then, and
  as he still lives in old Eoss-shire story, preserved the estates
  for the Seaforth family, risking often his life in the service
  of his master, the Earl, on regaining his position in his
  native country, treated his faithful ally with injustice and
  neglect.       Taking advantage of the lawlessness of the time,
  he seized the charters and lands of the Murchisons.                     Donald,

   trouble, retired to the east side of the island, and died of a
   broken heart, childless and in poverty.2                He was buried by
   the Conon, but the memory of his deeds still lingers among
    the hills which he guarded so long and                so   well.    Nearly a

century and       a   half after he had passed away, a monument
was raised to him by his kinsman,             Sir Roderick Murchison          ;
and now, as the tourist                          Kyles uf
                                  sails through the narrow
Skye, and marks on one hand the mouldering barracks of
the Hanoverian soldiery, on the other the crumbling walls
of the castle of Eilandonan, a granite obelisk on one of the
headlands of Lochalsh         recalls to him the deeds of one             of
the most disinterested men          of that wild time.
        Donald's brother, Murdoch, raised an action at law for
recovery of the charters      ;   but the renewed outbreak of 1745
came on.         He took part in      it,   and died from the effects of
wounds received at Culloden.            Thus the action disappeared,
and so did the ancestral property of the Murchisons.1
        John Murchison, farmer at Auchtertyre, in Lochalsh, Sir
Roderick's great-grandfather, has been already referred to as
one     of those who fell at Sheriffmuir.           Traditions still linger
in the north as to his feats of strength;                one large   stone,
in particular, weighing about half             a   ton, being pointed out
as      having been carried by him for some distance to form
part of    a   wall which he needed to build on his farm.
        Of Alexander, grandfather of Sir Eoderick, little has been
handed down. He continued to rent the farm of Auchtertyre,
    1
      Sir Roderick was never able accurately to trace his relationship to
Colonel Donald.    He seems to have regarded the hero as his great-grand-
uncle, but the connexion was yet more distant.      His grandfather was   a
third cousin of the Colonel, so that his own kinship was of that shadowy
kind in which Highland genealogists delight. Sir Roderick belonged thus
to an offshoot from the main stem of the Murchisons in whose hands the
little paternal property had been.    His grandfather's great-grandfather
hod owned it. — Information from Dr. Corbet,
    Both Boswell and Dr. Johnson, in their narratives of their tour in the
Hebrides, refer with gratitude to the attention shown to them by      aMr.
Murchison, factor for the laird of Macleod, in Glenelg, who seat them     a
bottle of rum, and an apology for not being able to entertain them in his
house.

and had to struggle with but slender means                 ; yet, like his
predecessors who had not fallen in fight, he reached                a good
old age, living    on even   till he was ninety-nine, and saw the
fortunes of the family retrieved by his eldest son, Kenneth,
whom he actually outlived.
      It  was in the year 1751 that this Kenneth came into
the world at Auchtertyre.            He studied Medicine            at  the
Colleges of Glasgow and, Edinburgh,             took the diploma of
the Royal College of Surgeons in London, and while still
 a young      man went out as surgeon             to   India,   where he
remained for seventeen          years.    A   lucrative      appointment
at Luckuow enabled          him to amass       a competent fortune,
 with which, coming         home     again   about the        year   1786,
 he not long afterwards purchased from his maternal uncle,
 Mackenzie of Lentron, the small estate of Tarradale, in the
 eastern part of the county of Eoss.            He appears to have
been     a man   of much force of character,           a thorough      Celt,
generous, yet with enough of worldly wisdom to keep him
from losing his possessions       as his forefathers had done.          He
wrote     his journals in Gaelic, but used the Greek characters,
which he held to express the sound of his native tongue better
 than Roman letters could do.           Having gratified the ambi
 tion, so common in Scotland, to become         a  laird, he kept up old
 Highland ways, and      as  long  as he  lived at Tarradale had         as
 one of his retainers a piper, who also played the harp. Fond
 of antiquities, he devoted himself to those of Tarradale and
 its neighbourhood, and made a collection of urns and other
 objects found in tumuli and elsewhere              on the estate.      He
 was one of the original members of the Highland Society of
 London,     and a warm friend of the scheme of the British
  Fisheries for the employment of the people of the Western

Highlands and Islands. In those days doctors were scarce in
the Highlands, hence Dr. Murchison's house formed                   a  centre
of attraction to the sick and maimed for many miles round.
As he took no       fees, his popularity became more wide-spread
than was wholly pleasant,            so that in the end he set on foot
an agitation which resulted in the erection of the present
Northern Infirmary at Inverness.
      In  the year 1791 he married the daughter of Mackenzie
of Fairburn, lineal representative of the Rory More or Big
Roderick Mackenzie to whom these estates had been granted
by James v.        She — as      well as her brother, of whom more
will    be told   in later pages — was born in the old tower of
Fairburn,     the characteristic        Highland fortalice of the sept,
guarding the entrance of one of the glens which open upon
the lowlands      of the Black Isle.
      The first-fruits of this marriage appeared at Tarradale, on
the 19th of February 1792, when the subject of this memoir
    w the light.      He received the name of Roderick, after his
maternal grandfather, Roderick              Mackenzie      of Fairburn,      a
jolly old laird,      who lived       for more than ninety years, al
though,     as he used      to say    of himself, in regard to whisky,
claret, or other potations, he was " a perfect sandbank."                   A
                                                                        1

Elijah Impey, an intimate friend of his father's.2
       For three years the family continued to reside at Tarra-

 With reference to it Dr. Corbet informs me that he is himself in posses
sion of old Fairburn's silver quaich or drinking-cup, and that it does not
 hold more than an ordinary wine-glass.      But of course the size of the cup
tells us nothing as to how often it was replenished.
    *
      In one of Sir Roderick's journals the following notice occurs bearing
 upon this period of his life : — " Old John Gladstone's wife was the dearest

Highland impressions on the memory of the future geologist,
although he used afterwards to say that he ought to have his
Celtic proclivities fully developed, for he had been nursed
            "          "
by the sonsie              miller's wife of Tarradale, who hushed him
to sleep with Gaelic lullabies, and no doubt, after the fashion
of the country, gave him now and then, when he whimpered,
a taste       of the famous whisky distilled on the adjoining
lands of Ferrintosh.
      These three years of infancy formed the only prolonged
residence which Sir Eoderick                  Murchison      ever made      in the
Highlands.           His later visits        were only for a few weeks at a
time in summer or autumn.                      That early stay at Tarradale
might have been indefinitely prolonged, so                    as to change     the
whole tenor of his life, had his father's health continued good.
A   delicacy, however, brought on probably by his Indian
experiences,        induced       Mr. Murchison         to quit his northern
home for a milder residence in the south of England.
      Among the earliest recollections which his son Eoderick
retained was one dating from the time of this southward
migration.         These were the days of highwaymen, and the
party had journeyed               armed.       The father,     always anxious
that his son and heir should be a manly little fellow, pre
sented one day a pistol at his head, bidding                    him stand fire.
His wife, fortunately, was sitting by                     and   snatched     away
of the Provost of Dingwall, Ross-shire.          When my father married he pro
posed   that   the bride's  great friend   and bridesmaid  should stay with them.
Finding    that  she  was  in very   delicate  health, he attended  to all her ail
ments    for a year or  more, and when      I was  brought into the world, the first
young lady's lap on which I was dandled was that of the mother of the
present Chancellor of the Exchequer.            She has often told me this herself,
and has expressed how much she owed to my father for his             kind medical
attention."

        The change from Tarradale to the south of England did
not avert the malady from which the invalid was suffering.
He died in the year 1796.            Of his closing days the follow
ing notes have been penned by his son            :—" A    recollection of
him, doubtless often since brought to my memory by my dear
mother, is that while my father was in the last stage of the
disorder (liver-complaint        and dropsy) of which he died, my
little brother and self were sent from Bath to the then
sequestered village       of Bathampton, where he took leave of
us.      The opening of the red damask curtains of the lofty
old-fashioned bed, the last kiss of my dying parent, and the
form of the old-fashioned          edifice  to which the    invalid had
been removed, have been stereotyped            in my mind."
      On the death of her husband, Mrs. Murchison                 moved
with her two boys to Edinburgh, where she took the house

placed under the instructions of Bishop Sandford.           Most of
the Jacobites being either Catholics or Episcopalians, she
found herself among friends in the small gathering which
the disestablished Church could muster at that time in the
metropolis of the north.         Two years before     his death her
elder   son. revisited the little chapel near Charlotte Square to
which his mother used to bring him.            The lapse of more
than seventy years had not wiped away the recollection of
these early days, and he could yet recall how, one Sunday,
their fat little cook Peggie, having incautiously ventured
westward to her mistress's       chapel, returned abruptly to the
house,    inveighing   with indignation at the profanity of an
         " for she cou'dna bide to hae the house      o' God turned

     The widow, still young and attractive, was not long in
finding    a second     husband in Colonel      Robert    Macgregor
Murray, one of the younger brothers of the Chief of the
Macgregors.       He, as  well as his brothers, had been on inti
mate terms      with Mr. Murchison in India, so much so that
the    Chief and his brother, Colonel        Alexander,    with Sir
Elijah Impey, were left as guardians to the two boys.
     The marriage of his mother broke up the home-life            of
young Roderick.         Her husband was called to Ireland to
aid   in suppressing rebellion there, and       as  she determined
to accompany him,        it became   necessary   to place the boy,
now in his seventh year, at school.           Accordingly,   in the
year 1799, he was sent to the grammar-school of Durham.
     More    than half a century afterwards he spoke of the
pang    of the parting from his mother, and from Sally, the
Dorsetshire lass, to whose tuition he used to attribute the
English accent which         he  retained  through life.      Before

 leaving Edinburgh          he could already read         the  newspapers
 with emphasis, and recite various pieces of verse.
     But now     a   new and strange life opened out to him.              At
 Durham he was domiciled, with some twenty other boys, in
 the house of one Wharton — a kindly man, who taught them
 French, and who, though himself a strict Catholic,                   never
 attempted to taint any of his pupils with a bias towards
 Popery.
     Six years passed away at Durham.                 They could hardly
 be   called   years     of   study.      The boy,     indeed,   toiled in
 some fashion into the          sixth book of the Iliad, crossed the
 " pons" in Euclid, and picked up             a  little French, besides
 the ordinary rudiments of an English education.                  But the
 somewhat morose and severe manners of the head-master
 were not of       a  kind to make learning pleasant.              Nor in
 the discipline of the school,          stern enough in its way, and
 often aided from a bundle of hazel rods, was there check
 sufficient to control the waywardness of the wilder boys.
                                     " Dick," as
 Among these Eoderick, or                          they called him, was
 always a ringleader.         Breaking bounds was the least of his
 offences.    Many an expedition did he lead against the town
 boys, and when not engaged             in actual offensive warfare,      he
 would     be  found      drilling    his  school-fellows     in military
 exercises.
     Pranks, too, of the dare-devil            kind were       a favourite
pastime.      At   one time he would be seen sitting             on a pro
jecting ornament or corner-spout of the highest tower of the
 Cathedral, to the horror of his comrades, who lay down in
 abject fright upon the "leads."             He filled up more than
the usual     list of boyish escapades with gunpowder and
 on treacherous        ice.    The    broken    ground on       which   the

  romantic old city of Durham           stands lent itself eminently
  to such feats.      There was one exploit which deserves a pass
  ing mention, since it was, perhaps, his earliest attempt to
  explore what lies under ground.          Just beyond    the archway
  leading to the Prebends' Bridge lay the open mouth of a
   drain which had its other end on the banks of the Wear,
   some hundred yards below.          It had been  a boast among    the
   boys to get down to the bottom of the vertical mouth.           But
   " Dick" one day undertook to force his way down the whole
   length of the conduit to its farther opening at the side of
   the river.     Having dropt into his hole he soon found,       as he
    advanced on hands and knees, that to turn was impossible.
    So, scaring many a rat by the way, he crept down, and at
    last, with scratched     skin and torn raiment, and probably
    with what Trinculo styled " an ancient and fish-like smell,"
    he emerged     to the light of day, amid the hurrahs of his
    expectant school-fellows.
          His stepfather  and his mother, during part of his stay at
     Durham, rented Newton House, near Bedale, in the North
     Eiding, whither, in vacation-time, he repaired to exhaust him^
     self in the delights of  a pony and terriers.   There, too, it was
     that the military life distinctly shaped itself in his mind.   His
     maternal uncle, General Mackenzie of Fairburn, seeing his
     active habits, told him that in due time he would         make a
     good soldier.    "From that day," he remarks,        "I  read and
     thought of nothing but military heroes."

                        CHAPTER II.
               FIRST YEARS OF A SOLDIER'S LIFE.
     THE six years' schooling at Durham,            such as    it was,
formed all the connected general education which Murchison
received,  though he tried to supplement         it after  a fashion a
couple of years later at Edinburgh.           It was thought to      be
amply sufficient    as  a groundwork       for the profession of a
soldier ; the more special training        needed for the      military
life could be obtained elsewhere.        Accordingly,     in the year
1805,   being   now thirteen       years   of age, he was taken
to the Military College of Great Marlow.             Late in life he
could recall how his stepfather sang amusing songs to cheer
him on the way ; how, on arriving in London, they " were
quartered at the Spring         Gardens coffeehouse;" and how
                               " in
surprised he was to      see,       the box next to us, gloating
over his beefsteak   and onions, the corpulent John, Duke of
Norfolk."
     At Marlow      his    aptitude    for   study    was   not   more
marked than     it had    been at Durham.         His six books of
Homer and the Latin which had been flogged                   into   him
were no help   in aiding him to solve even simple questions

in geometry and arithmetic.           He was rejected,    or,   in the
                                 " spun," and sent back to "
language of his comrades,                                        mug,"
or study. "       I  could not do," he says, " the commonest
things in geometry,       and was a bad arithmetician     — a foible
which has remained with me."
     When at length he had passed as a Cadet, he continued to
introduce a fair amount of frolic among his not very arduous
duties.     C. 26 — for that was his number     in the third com
pany — became as conspicuous a ringleader among the boister
ous youths at       Marlow as he had already been among the
boys at Durham.         He succeeded, however, at the same time,
in acquiring     some   military habits, and a slender knowledge
of tactics and drawing.        He now, for the first time, had to
learn subjects really interesting         to him, and, as he had
been formerly      in the habit of drilling his school-fellows for
 mere amusement,       it was now a congenial and not very diffi
 cult task to become a good drill-serjeant.        From this time,
 too, dates the development of that singular faculty he had
 of grasping the main features of a district.       His  exercises in
 military drawing at Marlow first drew out this faculty, and
 led to the future rapidity and correctness of his "           eye  for
 a country," to which,       in his scientific career, he owed       so
 much.
     As a reminiscence of        these  Marlow days he writes : —
 " As each cadet cleaned his own shoes and belts, and black
 balled his own cartridge-box, we really knew what a soldier
 ought to do.       French    polish was then unknown,        and the
                                         '

 much elbow-grease to bring out the shine           ; so that   I shall
 never   forget,   when the Duke of Kent (the father of our
 gracious    Queen) reviewed us, how        I admired his highly-

      Those who remember the veteran geologist in his later
days, and recall the     military bearing which marked him up
to the last,   will readily appreciate how strong an impress
these    Marlow days left upon him.       While   a cadet he was
also somewhat     of a dandy.    He preserved memoranda of the
names     of the titled people he met when he paid a visit        ;
how he delighted in the " smart curricle" of one distinguished
                                  " the well-conditioned hunters
acquaintance ; how he rode
or chargers" of another;      how he dined at a fine old mansion
one day, and played at      whist with the young aristocracy of
the place the next.       He had good opportunity for indulging
these tastes during     a  visit which he paid in 1806 to his
uncle, General Mackenzie, who was at that time command
ing a militia force at Hull.     And yet other qualities of his
nature were      also  developing themselves.     His uncle, who
kept a diary, made the following entry on 29th January
 1806 : — This day my dear nephew Roderick left me.
           "                                                   He
is a  charming boy, manly, sensible, generous, warm-hearted     —
in short, possessing    every possible good attribute.    I think
he has also talents to make a figure    in any profession.   That
 which he has chosen is a soldier.       He goes back to Marlow
 College on the 3d of next month."
      The following year, at the age of fifteen, he was gazetted
 Ensign in the 36th regiment, but did no regimental duty for
 some time after his appointment.         He writes of this epoch
                 "                                    I
 in his life : — For the first six months after became an
 officer  I was supposed to be completing my stitdies ! In
 reality I was amusing myself with all sorts of dissipation at
 Bath, where I passed my holidays driving ' tandems' and
 wearing clanking spurs.

      " On
            leaving Marlow    I was removed to    Edinburgh, where
 my mother and relatives lived, and was placed in the house
 of Mr. Alexander Manners, the          respected  Librarian of the
 Faculty of Advocates, where       I  was associated     with five or
 six other youths all older than myself.         Having a recruiting
 party in the city under my orders, and with plenty of money
 to spend and balls to dance at,     it may   be well conceived that
 I did   not gather together much knowledge.           Still I picked
 up a few crumbs, which were destined to produce some fruit
 in after   times.    Unquestionably,     this winter in Edinburgh
 materially influenced my future character.          For example,    I
 took lessons in French, Italian, German, and mathematics.
 I   also attended a debating club, and wrote (such as they
 were) two essays on political subjects, of which of course          I
  was profoundly ignorant.       While the young powdered mili
 tary fop (pig-tails and powder were then in the ascendant)
  affected  to despise all dominies and philosophers,         I  could
  not be one of the table presided over by the bland and
  courteous old Manners        without     picking up many useful
  hints for future guidance."
       Though he may have made some progress with his books
  at Edinburgh, he does not appear to have been quite as sure
  of his success in that way as he was of his mastery over the
  kicking horse in Leatham's riding-school.        At  the same time
  he took     lessons  in thrusting and parrying with the foil
  from an      old French   valet-de-chambre      in the service     of
  the   Comte d'Artois,    afterwards Charles x., who was then
  living in exile at Holyroodhouse.           As the result of these
  various accomplishments he came to have such a good opinion
   of himself that when, at last, in the winter of 1807-8, he
  joined his regiment at the barracks of Cork, great was his

chagrin     to find    the officers very different from the high
bred dandies he had expected them to be.                            They seem
to have been for the most part quiet, well-disciplined                          old
soldiers,   who knew their work and did                  it,   and who, more
over, had seen   a    good deal   of active service on the Continent,
in India, and in South America.                  He was no longer the

important personage he had lately been with the recruiting
party under his orders."          But in   a   little while he discovered,
that what his comrades lacked in outward show they more
than countervailed in the best qualities of soldiers.                   He found
that the regiment had been             a    favourite      with Sir Arthur
Wellesley in India.        His    messmates could         tell many      a    story
of the cool daring of their old Colonel, Robert Burne                     ;   how
he led his men at the storming             of Seringapatam          ;   and how,
when at Buenos Ayres, the Spaniards had brought up eight
guns that completely enfiladed the road by which the                     British
force               he halted his brave fellows and said
         was retiring,
                  "
quietly to them, — Now, my lads,     Ve come to lead you

and then how he plucked           a   flower, and coolly placing              it   in
his button-hole, drew his sword, and in              a   quarter of an hour
had,    with his grenadiers,       spiked every gun and driven the
enemy back into the town.
       Such tales     vividly impressed the imagination                   of the
young Ensign.          His ideal of    a    military hero had hitherto
been his handsome         young uncle, General Mackenzie, in the
full blaze of martial uniform, and              it   was his ambition to
become the General's aide-de-camp.                But he now came into
contact with    a     real tried hero, whom he thenceforth set up
as his model.

          FIRST YEARS OF          A SOLDIER'S          LIFE,      21
     Colonel Burne was an excellent specimen of a type of
officer now probably extinct.      Cool and daring on the field
of battle,  he was a severe disciplinarian.      His piercing dark-
brown eye proved quick to detect a careless pig-tail, or a
failure of pipe-clay either in gloves or breeches.          He had
drilled his men to the most perfect precision after the
method then in vogue, insomuch that his had become what
was called a " crack regiment" at the camp on the Curragh.
But with all this attention to the laborious system of train
ing which prevailed in his time, he knew how to unbend
 after his day's work was past.     At   the mess- table he would
sit habitually from five till ten o'clock, setting an example to
all his officers in the potation of port.     He could not tolerate
a drunken man, and he despised a young fledgling Ensign to
whom illimitable draughts of his own favourite beverage
proved in any way disastrous.        He himself never showed
any indication of being in the least degree affected, save that
" his nose was
                   gradually assuming that purple colour and
bottle-shape which rendered him       so  conspicuous in the sub
sequent Peninsular war."        Such was the brave and jovial
leader whom the young Ensign of the 36th set before him
self for imitation.
     The regiment moved to Fennoy in the spring of 1808;
but shortly thereafter a small army of about eight thousand
men assembled at Cork for foreign service.           Its destination
remained secret, though    it was shrewdly     suspected   to be de
signed for South America       to retrieve there the honour of
the British arms.     The charge of it was given to Sir Arthur
Wellesley,    with General Mackenzie       as  his second in com
mand.      The latter resolved to take with him his nephew
Roderick as an extra aide-de-camp.          Such a post had been

the dream of the young Ensign's life ever since he had en
tered on his    military career, and it seems to have impressed
him more each time he saw his uncle in all the pomp of
command.
     But the projects both of uncle and nephew were rudely
broken.      The   unexpected    successes   of the rising of the
people of Spain        against their   French   invaders   at   once
drew     the attention    of the British Government         to that
country.       The expedition was ordered      to proceed not to
South America, but to Spain.         With this  change of destina
tion came also an alteration in the command.                General
Mackenzie       was not to accompany the force,       and the ex
pectant aide-de-camp had to bear his mortification             as he
best could.
     But it was still his destiny to join the expedition, not on
 the Staff, but carrying the colours of the 36th, for in passing
 through Fermoy to take the command, Sir Arthur Welles-
 ley left orders for that regiment to proceed to Cork within
 twenty-four      hours.   A   hurried   gathering  of goods     and
 chattels, a march of twenty         miles, an inspection     in the
 streets   of Cork by Sir Arthur himself, and then a string
of   boats   filled with the red-coats slipping       down to the
 Cove and       to  the transports — thus    suddenly   the    young
 soldier of but sixteen summers        found himself face to     face

               SIX MONTHS OF THE PENINSULAR WAR.
      BRITISH expeditions had come to hold but a poor reputa
  tion when the present century began.           The despatch   of  a
 new one created      little enthusiasm, or even interest.     Long
 years   of war had made the minds of men familiar with
 campaigns and       battles    and sieges.     And  these   warlike
 operations were now spread over so wide            a  field that  it
 would have been hard to tell to what quarter a fresh expe
 dition would, with most probability,         be sent.    With this
 low   military prestige       there existed also   a wide-spread
 feeling of indifference, sometimes     bordering on contempt, for
the profession    of a soldier.     The rank and file of the army
contained     a large     infusion   of the lowest   orders  of the
community.       Enlistment was in the hands of agents who
received a profit       according    to the numbers     they could
induce to join the service.        A man who had proved himself
unfit for any honest calling         was  yet good   enough for    a
           And thus it became common to regard the " listing
                                                                   "

authorities.    He enlisted for life, and could look forward
to being permitted      to leave the service on a small pension
only when ill-health or age at last made him useless.            As
a  rule, he could neither read nor write.      There was then no
daily newspaper press recounting to every town and village
in the three kingdoms the doings of his regiment, men
tioning    even his    own name     should   he distinguish   him
self  ; no associations for the help of the sick and wounded         ;
no lady-nurses venturing       from dainty homes into the rough
scenes   of war  ;  no frequent post bringing     him letters and
papers   from the fatherland to show him that he was the
object of kindly solicitude to his native country.           When
he was carried       away into service    abroad,  it was not in
a   roomy steam-transport, but in a sloop or brig            drawn
perhaps from the coasting trade.          And yet in spite of all
these wants,   of many of which he was happily unconscious,
in spite, too, of pipe- clay and blackball, of plastering his
queue, and burnishing      his musket, he could be trained into
an excellent soldier, and he went through           his hardships
with that endurance and boldness which more than restored
the reputation of the British army.
     On the 12th     July 1808 the small expeditionary force set
sail from Cork, and met with no mishap until it came to
anchor off the coast of Gallicia.     Owing to some uncertainty
as  to the state of affairs in the Peninsula, the disembarka
tion was delayed for a few days, and the transports moved
southward to the Portuguese coast.       The young ensign of the
36th regiment, cooped up in a small brig, had been in the
surgeon's    hands,   and continued    still an invalid.    But at
the order for landing his       kit was soon packed.      Like the
other officers he took ashore three days' provisions, beside

his greatcoat        and knapsack, while he had to carry on his
shoulders the colours of the regiment.                Of this time he
writes    : —
      "Early     on the 1st  of August, the 36th, forming part of
the first hrigade, disemharked            with the 60th Eifles       and
other regiments under General Fane.                Fortunately   it was
a fine calm hot day,       with little or no surf on the sterile and
iininhabited       shore, with its wide beach and hillocks of blown
sand.       The inhabitants      of Figuiera, on the opposite bank
of the river, stood under their variously-coloured            umbrellas,
and my boat being to the extreme                left, I  could scan the
motley group, in which monks and women predominated.
Just   as   I  was gazing around, and as our boat touched the
sand, the Commodore's barge rapidly passed              with our bright-
eyed    little General.      Perhaps    I  am the only person now
(1854) living, who saw the future Wellington place for the
first time his foot on Lusitania,          followed by his aide-de
camp,       Fitzroy Somerset,      afterwards    Lord Raglan.        He
certainly      was not twenty paces from me, and the cheerful
confident expression of his countenance at that moment
has    ever remained impressed on my mind.                  The  disem
barkation being unopposed,          you would think      I  had nothing
to record.        But the young ensign, with his glazed cocked
hat, square to the     front, his long white gloves, his tight belts,
and well-filled knapsack and haversack, found                it no  easy
matter to obey the orders of the fidgety General Fane, who,
whilst our feet slipped back on the loose                 sand, was en
deavouring to make us move as              if on the Brighton      race

      " MY DEAR UNCLE, — Having been prevented so very long
a time from         writing to you, on account of not knowing to
what part of the Mediterranean                you are ordered,            I am   re
solved at last to send this letter to Sicily, and let                    it run the
hazard of a ship sailing from Lisbon to that island.                        If you
had been in England during the whole of the time in which
we were           acting against the French       in this country, what
pleasure it would have given me to have sent you from the
scenes        of action the last accounts of them               ;   but in such
ignorance was            I of the country   you were in, that in the only
letter which         I   have   had from my mother since             I    left Ire
land, she informed me only of your having proceeded in the
'
    Pomona' frigate to the Mediterranean            ;   that it was probable
you would touch at some of the Spanish ports, whither                             it
was then supposed            Sir Arthur Wellesley's expedition would
proceed       ;   and that in case of meeting with me, you intended
taking me on with you as your aide-de-camp.                          I shall     en
deavour in this letter to give a detailed account of our pro
ceedings, as        I am certain you will be pleased       with     it,   incorrect
as   it   may be in some respects,           and far as    it   must be from
being     a   general one, on account of my humble situation in
the army.
      " Sir Arthur
                   Wellesley, after having proceeded to Corunna
in order to hear of the movements              of the Spaniards, wrote to
Admiral Sir Charles Cotton off the Tagus, and requested him
to co-operate.            The landing of the troops in Mondego Bay

was then determined upon, and, on the 1st of August, the
 36th and 40th infantry, and some rifles, disembarked on the
south side of the river Mondego, under General Fane, exactly
opposite the town of Figuiera.           The troops passed the bar
of the river chiefly in small schooners which trade along the
coast, and also    in Portuguese boats.
      " The
             brigade being formed was then marched in open
columns along the coast, chiefly through very heavy sands,
about two leagues, and encamped near the village of Lavaos,
where Sir Arthur established head-quarters for the night.
As by his orders two shirts and two pair of stockings and a
great-coat were to compose         the whole of the baggage of
officers and soldiers, and that not such a thing as a donkey
or any other animal was procurable, our whole kit, including
three days' provisions, was on our backs, which, with a brace
of pistols and the 36th regimental colours, loaded me abso
lutely to the utmost of my strength.          Even our old Colonel
was compelled to tramp through the sands this day, which
he did     with the greatest alacrity.      In four  days the whole
of the troops and stores were landed without any loss.             As
we were now to wait at Lavaos for the arrival              of General
Spencer's force from Cadiz, we had it in our power to com
municate with the shipping, and        I was   thus enabled to land
my boat-cloak        and a few other necessary        articles, which
have    since  been   of infinite use to me on outlying picquets
(under walls and without tents) and guards, and to buy a
donkey to carry them, which          little animal is with me at
present.    In  the course of three days General Spencer's force
arrived and immediately disembarked.           The army being then
arranged and divided into six brigades, we were placed under
General Ferguson with the 40th and 71st regiments.               The

      appointment of this excellent officer (who,       I think, is your
      particular friend) gave us, the 36th, great satisfaction.
           " Sir Arthur Wellesley's orders, previous to our landing,
      were    most explicitly and clearly written,       particularly in
      explaining to the troops the nature of the service they were
      about to enter upon, and directing the greatest attention to
      be paid to the religion and customs      of the Portuguese.    We
      were    likewise   given to understand by these orders,       that
      through the whole of the war we should             be  en bivouac,
      and no tents allowed for officers or men.       On the 10th the
      whole army directed its march to Leyria.         It was intended
      at first to have marched only three leagues, but upon in
      formation being received that a force had proceeded by the
      sea-coast,    in order to have surprised some of our outposts,
      our march was continued until three o'clock next morning.
      We then halted and took up our stations on a cold, bleak
      moor,     about two leagues from Leyria, having marched up
      wards of twenty English miles.        Next morning we marched
      to   Leyria (where the inhabitants had been maltreated by
ILcison),         and halted on the south side of the city, whence I
      went in to inspect it.       There we were joined by the Portu
      guese army, which        did not exceed in strength 3000 men.
      From what      I could  observe, there were about four squadrons
      of cavalry, good-looking, well-mounted dragoons, being the
      garde    de  police of Lisbon, who had made their escape from
      thence     on hearing of our disembarkation.      The Portuguese
      infantry was in a most wretched state of discipline.       On the
       1 3th the army marched two and a half leagues, and halted
      at Lucero, about a mile and a half on the south side of the
      beautiful     ancient abbey of Batalha, where the Portuguese
      gained that celebrated victory        over the Spaniards which

secured the independence of their country.                      At   this place,
for the first time, we got hold of a few straggling Frenchmen.
Next day, the 14th, we proceeded                to Alcobaca, and halted
near it.    The abbey is most magnificent, and delighted me
more than any public building                I have   seen.       The library
and kitchen of the convent are well worthy of admiration.
Part of the French army had just quitted this place.
    " We had
              proceeded next morning about half-way between
this town and Las Caldas          ;   when, approaching the small town
of Albaferam, the French appeared in sight.                 Their army was
drawn up in close column, and was ready for action.                        They
however     continued     their       retreat, and we           advanced    and
halted near Las Caldas.
    "Sir Arthur        had received intelligence that the French
General Laborde was strongly entrenched in the mountainous
pass at the extremity of the valley in which the old Moorish
fort of Obidos stands, and that General Loison was at no
great distance from our right.             The greatest part of the army
was advanced         from the valley to force               the pass, while
General     Ferguson's brigade (with General                 Bowes's in its
rear) was sent off to the mountains on the left, with the in
tention of cutting off Laborde's retreat.              We were proceed
ing in this direction when the French appeared upon our
flank, in consequence         of which we formed line, and changing
direction   advanced,     as the fog cleared, towards the enemy.
We marched over about two leagues of hilly ground, and
when within about one mile and a half of the pass we un
expectedly        perceived    the whole       of the enemy in direct
march to    it,   and immediately afterwards our riflemen opened
their fire from the top of            a   hill upon   one   of the enemy's
columns, who returned         a   volley and retreated      a   short distance.

30               SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                             [isos.
     " It  feU to the lot of the Eifles, 5th, 9th, and 29th regi
ments, to force the pass, and to the last regiment especially,
who, from the nature of the ground, could           in some places only
ascend up the       hill in single   files.    It was on this account
that the 29th lost       so  many officers      and men, including the
gallant Colonel Lake, who was some paces in front of his
regiment when he fell.         Just  as we    arrived at the foot of the
mountains our artillery was brought into play, which no
doubt annoyed the enemy's             retreating columns, and three
companies     of our regiment were detached in order to support
our light infantry,        with the other light infantry of the
brigade.     The enemy had moved off, however, from the shots
of the rifles, and the distant fire of a few pieces                of our
artillery.    The 40th regiment was then detached from our
brigade to cover the baggage, and           as soon as  the firing ceased
we pursued our march through the pass.               Swiss and French
men were lying dead on all sides.            As soon as we got through,
General Ferguson's brigade, with the others which had not
been much engaged, formed on a very extensive heath, and
were advanced        in front in order to charge the enemy if he
would stand       ; but Monsieur would only permit a few stray
shots   to be sent into his solid columns — he had received
beating enough to satisfy him for one day.1
     " On the 19th the army moved on to Vimieira, and
                                                                   passed
over the very plateau on which we of the 36th were, two
days    afterwards, to have         an    opportunity     of signalizing
ourselves.
     " The
             village of Vimieira is situated in a narrow valley,
amid rising hills.        In  our front, on to the south-east, is         a
wood upon a low eminence          ; and   in the rear, on towards the
              1  This was the engagement of Roliya or Uorirn.

coast,   are very high      hills.    On the summit of these hills,
which lie exactly between Vimieira and the            sea, the greatest
part of the British army was posted.               On a lower    hill on
 the right, and a little in front of the town, was the Light
 Brigade, with the 20th regiment.              This was an excellent
post of observation.       On the     hill on the left   was the    40th
 regiment, which was the left of our brigade, the 71st High
 landers on their right, and the 36th being in the hollow
 exactly in the rear of the village.          Close to our front was
 a small river.      The position was rather more than               two
 leagues   from the    sea.    .  . .  We discovered some squad
 rons and picquets of French             dragoons.     Several officers
 approached us, and one coming particularly near            (I  suppose
 he was sketching),       Captain      Mellish (General Ferguson's
 A.D.C.) offered the long odds to any one that, if permitted,
 he would dismount him.
       "On  the following morning, the 21st, about nine o'clock,
 the drums of the 40th regiment beat to arms.                  This was
 occasioned    by their outlying picquet being attacked by some
  small party of the enemy which was greatly advanced.                In
 ten minutes we were formed.            Our brigade, led by General
  Ferguson, immediately crossed the little river and ascended
  to the hill on which   we were about to fight.        We had hardly
  commenced our uphill move before the advanced                 posts  of
  our centre, in the hollow near Vimieira, on our right, com
  menced a very heavy fire.         We proceeded up the hill and
  formed line under its brow.           A   brigade of artillery was
  brought up with the greatest promptitude, and two guns,
  under Lieutenant Locke, being placed on the rising ground
  on our right, and the others on the left, three companies of
  the 36th were detached to the edge of the          hill on our right,

in order to protect the guns, which were soon annoying the
advancing French           close   columns in the finest style with
shrapnell shells, whilst our rifles and light infantry were
firing in extended files as videttes.
      " After some
                        very hot and close work the centre of our
army, at the village of Vimieira, repulsed the enemy.              There
General Anstruther's          brigade,    with the 50th regiment, re
ceived      the enemy in front of the village.           Colonel Taylor,
who had charged with four troops, the only cavalry we had,
viz., of the 20th Light Dragoons, was killed in a wood, whilst
our heavy artillery, which was placed upon the hillock                   in
front of the village, cut up the enemy most dreadfully.               The
50th charged them with the bayonet              ; the 43d met them       in
a narrow lane when          in open column, and gallantly repulsed
them;        the 52d and 97th were likewise warmly               engaged
and thus the enemy was quite routed in their central or
main attack.1

wing     :  the fire  of the enemy soon became very hot, and even
though the 36th were lying on their breasts under the brow,
our men were getting pretty much hit, whilst the regiment
in our      rear,   the 82d, which      at that time could not fire a
shot,      suffered   more   than we did.       General Spencer, who
commanded          the division, when moving about to regulate the
general movements,           was    hit by a ball in the hand, and        I
saw him wrap his handkerchief round it and heard him say,
'
   It  is only a scratch     !'   Soon after, the light infantry in our
front closed files and fell in          ;  our guns were pulled back,

 over was the fashion without the application of their Colonel's
            '
 cane.        Charge !' was the word, and at once we went over
 the brow with a steady line of glittering      steel, and  with a
hearty hurrah, against six regiments in close column, with
 six pieces of artillery, just in front of the 36th.    But not an
 instant did the enemy stand against this most unexpected
 sally within pistol-shot.      Off they went, and all their guns
 were instantly taken, horses       and all, and then left in our
 rear,  whilst we went on chasing the runaways for a mile and
 a half, as hard as we could go, over the moor       of Lourinhao.
 They rallied, it is true, once or twice, particularly behind
 some     thick prickly-pear hedges and a hut or two on the
 flat table-land    ; but although their brave General Solignac
 was always cantering         to their front and animating them
 against us, they at last fled precipitately, until they reached
a small hamlet, where, however, they did make a tolerable
stand.
      "
         Here   it was that Sir Arthur Wellesley overtook us
 after    a   smart gallop.   He had witnessed from a distance
 our steady and successful charge, and our capture of the
guns, and he now saw how we were thrusting the French
out of this hamlet.         Through the sound of the musketry,
 and in the midst of much confusion,         I heard a shrill voice
 calling out,
                  '
                    Where are the colours of the 36th ?' and      I
 turned round (my brother ensign, poor Peter Bone, having
just    been knocked     down), and looking up in Sir Arthur's
     VOL. L                                               c

                                          '
bright and confident face, said,            Here they are, sir    !'    Then
he shouted,
                 '
                   Very well done, my boys         !  Halt, halt — quite
enough !'
     " The    French     were   now at their last run, in spite of
every effort of Solignac          to rally them.        Several of our
                                                            '
bloody-minded old soldiers said in levelling,                  they would
bring down the              on the white horse ;' and sure enough
the gallant fellow fell, just as the 71st Highlanders,                   who
were on our left, being moved round                en potence,       charged
down the hill, with their wounded piper playing                       on his
bum, and completed the rout of the enemy, taking General
Solignac of course prisoner.1
     " Had we
                   possessed    a squadron or two of dragoons              on
the left wing,     all the remaining force of Solignac's division,
which had been driven two miles to the north, or away from
the main body of Junot (which had retreated to the south),
would have been captured, for they were then a rabble.
But Sir Arthur knew his weakness in cavalry.                        He had
defeated   a very superior force         in crack style   ;   on our    wing
we   had indeed taken the General, and all the guns brought
against us; he also knew           that the enemy        had three        full
regiments of cavalry          in the field, whilst we had none.
Moreover, he was no longer commander,                for old Sir Harry
Burrard,    already on the ground, was his senior, and had
ordered a halt.
     " Think, my dear uncle, with what pleasure              I got    a sheet
of long paper from the adjutant, and wrote my first account
of this glorious victory to my mother on a drum in the field,
  1 This appears to be a mistake.    Solignac was wounded, but the French
General taken prisoner was not he, but Brennier.     See Wellington's      Dt-

off Monsieur Junot. — I remain ever, my dear uncle, your
most affectionate nephew."
      To this letter may be added one or two reminiscences
which he used to tell of these first Peninsular days.                    It was
no marvel      if  a  stripling of sixteen, even though he had been
 a ringleader      in all rough sports and adventures at school
 and military college, should have looked pale for a moment
 on going into actual battle.             His  face caught the eye        of the
 bluff old veteran, Captain Hubbard, who gave him a good
 draught of Hollands gin out of his canteen, and patted him
 on    the   back, saying he would             never feel     so    afterwards.
 " And he was                                                        "
                                                                       the first
                       quite right," added the narrator           ;
 start over, and you are ever afterwards one of a united mass
of brave men."
      No trace of personal emotion was of course allowed to
 escape    in the business-like           letter to his uncle from the
 embryo aide-de-camp.              And yet, brave and bold          as he was,
 he could not help         a  shudder at the first sight of the dead
 and mangled bodies of the Swiss and French                        lying right
 and left    as   his corps     marched through the Pass of Eori9a.
 But a more hideous recollection                   dwelt in his memory
                      " When
 through life.                   halting at a bivouac before we reached
 Vimieira," he wrote, " a Portuguese volunteer on horseback

 brown paper, in which he had carefully                   folded up like a
 sandwich several pairs of Frenchmen's                ears, his occupation
 having been to follow us, and to cut off all these appendages

       The conduct of the 36th regiment, and its gallant colonel,
received high praise in the despatches of Sir Arthur                     Wel-
lesley, to which, in after life, Murchison referred with pride,
as evidence that though his friends had almost all                     known
him only as a civilian and a man of peace, he had yet had
shared     with his comrades in actual and successful fighting.1
       The subsequent events          of this short campaign, with all
their memorable results           in the Peninsula and at           home,   left
but little impress on the young ensign.                 He saw his favourite
general superseded          by Sir Harry Burrard, and then by                Sir
Hew Dalrymple.             He was quite sure that the British forces
could have compelled            Junot to surrender, or at least that
the French         force never could have fought its way back
to Spain.       Like   so many of his fellow-countrymen, he looked
on the so-called Convention of Cintra " as stupid, if not dis
graceful."        In spite of what he has described to his uncle as
       "
his humble situation in the army," he seems to have had
no hesitation in deciding that the brilliant successes in which
he had taken part had been "shamefully                  lost" by subsequent
diplomacy.          And   he no doubt found consolation           in repeating
    1 In the official despatch from the field of Vimieira, Sir Arthur writes
thus : — "   In mentioning Colonel Burne and the 36th regiment upon this
occasion,   I cannot avoid adding that the regular and orderly conduct of
this corps throughout the service, and their gallantry and discipline in
 action, have been conspicuous." — Wellington's Despatches, by Gurwood,
 vol. iv. p. 96.   Again, in a letter written next day to Lord Castlereagh,
he says, "You will see that     I have mentioned Colonel Burne of the 36th
regiment in a very particular manner ; and      I  assure yon that there is no
 thing that will give me so much satisfaction as to learn that something
 has been done for this old and meritorious soldier.      The 36th regiment are
 an example to this army." — Op. cit, p. 100.

merits of the three commanders.
        With the political    side   of the military events he troubled
himself but little.         Of more interest at the moment were
the sights of Lisbon, in which his regiment was now quartered,
and the looks and ways of the inhabitants.                     The music of
the French bands before Junot's forces were embarked and
sent away from the Tagus, the black-eyed beauties        of the
coffee-houses,      and the filth of the luxurious city — these
were the       features     of the sojourn           in Lisbon which most
impressed themselves on his memory.                      Night after night
his room was perfumed by the burning of lavender in                            it,
and he was thereafter left to wage war against domestic
battalions hardly less numerous than those which he had
encountered at Vimieira.              Or   if   he ventured out of doors
after nightfall,     no little dexterity was needed to work his
way safely among the discharges of filth, which, in accordance
with the sanitary arrangements then in vogue, descended
from the windows,            too often     followed,      instead    of being

denunciations       w.ere   poured forth by the newspapers             against

English Government to interfere more actively than ever

in the contest      between     Napoleon and the people of the
Peninsula.      After the French armies had traversed Spain
and crushed the numerous but unconnected and ill-directed
attempts of the patriots to resist the march of the invaders,
the tide of war turned.         A  division   of Xapoleon's armies,
 eighteen thousand    in number, which had penetrated into the
 most southerly province, was surrounded by the insurgents
 and forced    to lay down its arms.        The enthusiasm       of the
 people blazed forth afresh from one end of the country to
 the other.    In  England     the joy was great and loudly ex
 pressed, that at last some check seemed          likely to be placed
 on the career     of conquest of the man whom the country
 hated and feared.       Money, men, stores of every kind, were
 freely promised to the patriots, and         as freely, though with
 sad want of judgment, supplied.
      The British army, whatever might be thought or said
 as   to the    mode    in which      the   feat   had   been    accom
 plished, had     certainly compelled      the   French   to evacuate
 Portugal, and     the Ministry of the         day deemed     it advis
 able that their victorious expedition, now lying at Lisbon
 and watching the embarkation and removal of the French
  regiments,   should put itself in motion, march across               the
 country, enter Spain, and give effectual         aid to the efforts of
  the Spanish patriots.       Orders to this effect reached       Lisbon
  early in October.      Sir John Moore was put at the head of
  the expeditionary     force.   He was told that not a French
  soldier remained in the southern half of Spain, that Castanos
  in the south, and Blake in the north, had collected large
  armies,  with supplies, and how enthusiastically          the people
  were    everywhere    rising   against the invaders.          He was
  directed to enter Gallicia or Leon, and there to receive an

additional force to be despatched           under Sir David Baird
from England.      In Spain his further movements          were to be
regulated in concert with the Spanish generals.
    Through     the long melancholy marchings and counter-
marchings which      began at Lisbon at the end of September,
and ended at Corunna in the middle of January, Murchison
took his place with the 36th.          His regiment formed part of
the force sent round by Talavera under Sir          John Hope. The
troops began to move        as the  rainy season was setting in.   To
the rain succeeded       the snows and frosts of an inclement
winter.    From the Spaniards assistance         neither in men nor
in  means   of transport, nor information of the movements
and strength of the common enemy, could be procured.               To
the last there came from them in abundance                promises of
powerful reinforcements, entreaties to the British commander
to advance, glowing pictures of the vast enthusiasm and re
sources of Spain, and stories of the weakness and hesitation
of the French.      In  the midst    of so much uncertainty it was
natural enough that the progress of the British force should
be but slow, and that this tardiness and apparent hesitation,
combined with the hardships of the weather, should have
caused   some murmuring          in the ranks.     Among the mur-
murers was our Ensign          of the 36th.     His physical frame,
though strong, was sorely tried during these           long marches,
with indifferent food, in the dead of winter.          He could not
then judge what were the real operations of the army.             He
was necessarily ignorant, as other subalterns were, of the
almost incredible      difficulties   of the noble-hearted     Moore.
He could    see   only the toilsome and seemingly staggering
marches and halts and retreats.          It appeared   as if at head
quarters there were no settled plan;          as  if the army were

moved to and fro merely at random.                      So deeply was this
impression of inadequate generalship fixed on his mind, that
even late in life he continued to express himself                as he  might
have done in the march from Lugo, or on the heights of
Cornnna.1
        Of the actual events of the campaign he has preserved
notes, chiefly       of the various stages reached by his division
in its march from Lisbon through Portugal and Spain, with
a few personal reminiscences.             In  a   little pocket note-book,
which went with him through the campaign, there are traces
     1 The following note contains his deliberate judgment as to the general
ship of Sir John Moore.      It was written about the year 1854 : —
                                                I
     " The chief mistakes of Moore can never, think, be set aside, although,
doubtless, he had a most difficult task to play, and was grossly deceived
by the Spanish government. These mistakes were, 1st, sending round all
bis artillery and cavalry, when we entered Spain, by a long march, thus
paralysing his exertions for a fortnight or three weeks ; Zd, making the
hazardous and indecisive advance from Salamanca to Sahagun, which led
him eventually to abandon the only true strategical plan of returning, as
he himself      intended a week before, on the strong ground of Portugal.
Again, the detaching the Light Division to Vigo was an error which pre
 vented his occupying a strong position before Corunna ; and, lastly, his
forced night marches in order to escape from our enemy, who was re
 pelled by us at all points, even after our horrible losses and disasters, and
 with two-thirds only of our army.
     "It  must be recollected that    I only had the knowledge of a young
 subaltern officer, and in resenting the stern general order of our chief, in
 which he reflected on the want of discipline,     I simply express what all the
 poor sufferers felt who knew that the army so condemned was in an ad
 mirable state a month before.       'To whom therefore,' said we, 'is this
 forlorn state due, but to the chief who commands us to do impossibi
 lities — i.e., to march without shoes and provisions, and in dark winter
 nights!'
     " For these reasons, notwithstanding all the praise of his admirers, in
 cluding William Napier, who had been drilled under him, I have never
 been able to regard Moore as a first-rate general. As a general of division,
 as a disciplinarian, and as a noble type of unblemished character and un
 flinching courage, he was without a rival.     Peace be to his ashes .' and let
 glory be ever associated with the name of the hero who in Egypt contri
 buted so much to the success of Abercromby, and who, like his gallant
 Scottish countryman, met his death in the arms of victory."

         WITH SIR JOHN MOORE IN SPAIN.                           41
of some attempts to acquire a few words of Spanish.            Such
phrases   as were   likely to be of service in the march are
carefully noted.      He records how, having now been pro
moted to be Lieutenant, he made his first essay in horse-
dealing, —an unfortunate adventure, by which he secured an
animal whose legs, when seen by daylight,            turned out to
have been    all duly pitched below the knee, and whose most
sprightly   movement consisted in rolling himself           on  the
ground, his feet in the air, and his rider sprawling in the
sand beside him, amid the laughter of the regiment.
     From Abrantes to Castello de Vide he notes the broken
features  of the ground, which rises into heights crowned here
and there with quaint old hill-forts,     and sinks into fold after
fold of cork-forest, with plenteous harbourage for the hairless
black pig, " the best food in Portugal." Now and then during
the halts he and a companion would sally out for the inspec
tion of castle, forest, village, or town,   as might happen.     At
the venerable fortress of Marvao, for example, scattering troops
of black swine, he climbed up to the fortifications of what
seemed    to be a forgotten tenantless hold, when       a challenge
suddenly came from a ragged sentinel in dingy brown, and
with a sorely rusted musket, dangerous          only to the hands
that might venture to fire it.       The strangers   were  reported
        " Governor," and                         whole garrison, a
to the                       they found,  as the
score  of men yet more patched than the sentinel, with hardly
a lock to any one of their guns.
    The 36th regiment was the first of the division which
crossed   the frontier into Spain.      He chronicles in the be
haviour of the natives      a  strong contrast to that of the Por
                                                   "

English !— Long live King George !" he found the people

cold and distrustful      ; and he speaks     of the   disheartening
effect upon     himself and comrades       of the indifference and
reserve    with which the houses on which they were billeted
were opened to them.
     There was much in this march into the heart of Spain to
arrest    the notice of an observant eye — the forms of the
great    table-land,   with its sierras and river-gorges — the
antique towns and mouldering ruins going back even into
Eoman times — the ways and manners of the people.                   Of
these various features no jottings occur       in the journal, save
only such scanty ones       as to show that they were not passed
wholly without notice.         At  the Escurial the force halted for
six days.      Many of the officers contrived during this interval
to  see  Madrid.     Murchison, being somewhat unwell, spent the
time among the jolly brethren of the great gridiron convent.
What seems to have made the most lasting impression on
him were the large flasks of wine hung before the window
of every cell to ripen for private use.          But he retained      a
vivid recollection, too, of the splendours of the art collec
tion, then still untouched by French spoliation, and of the
solemn resting-place of the Kings of Spain.
      It   was   while  waiting   at the Escurial     for tidings    of
the Spanish forces, with which           the  British were     to co
 operate, that General Hope learned how utterly these forces
had been routed and dispersed          by the French, who, under
 Napoleon      in person,    were   now rapidly    approaching     the
 capital.    At   once the route was changed,       and by a   skilful
 move    the   British division under Hope was united to the
 main body of the army led by Sir John Moore.                  In  the
 course of this rapid march there occurred at the old Moorish
 city of    Avila   an incident, of which     Murchison    gives   the

is®.]             THE RETREAT           TO LUGO.                    43
 following account: — " Our poor fellows being well tired
were either asleep or dozing against the walls of the houses,
when they were roused          by a tramping of horses' feet and
loud clashing of metal, sounding just like a cavalry- charge,
which caused a few to run for their arms, piled in the middle
of the dark    street,  whilst many more made       a sauve  qui peut
into the adjacent alleys.         The charge    having cleared the
street, knocking       down many     a  piled musket, our amuse
ment was great to find that one old vicious mule, breaking
 away from the muleteers,        had carried with him      a troop of
his associates, who came full gallop clattering down the
 street, tossing our camp-kettles     and  all their burdens by the
 way.     This was the enemy's cavalry that awoke us !"
      Hard winter weather and a continued retreat began to
 tell upon the discipline       and the numbers of the British
 troops.    On the 6th of January, on reaching Lugo, Sir         John
 Moore issued     a  general order, beginning,    —"    Generals and
 commanding officers       of corps must be as sensible as the
 Commander-in-Chief       of the complete disorganization of the
 army."     Lieutenant Murchison, however,        could  see no  signs
 of any such disintegration in the 36th regiment at that time,
 and  it was only after the terrible night-marches which          suc
 ceeded the halt at Lugo that his division merited        in his eyes
 the severe censure of the Commander-in-Chief.            These   toil
 some    nights, with the constant pressure of the French, and
 of even more resistless foes, bitter frost and snow, told, too,
 upon his own strength.         On one occasion,     after a fruitless
 midnight march against the enemy, who was supposed to be
 advancing to the attack, Murchison, commanding that night
 an outlying picquet, threw himself into a corner of        a farmer's
 yard, and soon fell asleep.       Day had scarcely broken when

the cry of " Picquet, turn out !" roused him from his rest,
but not in time to escape the notice of the vigilant Colonel
Packe, who, however,          allowed him to escape with a severe
reprimand.       But after the halt at Lugo, when having vainly
offered battle to the French, the         British army retreated by a
forced march to Corunna, the young lieutenant fairly broke
down.      The mule, which had hitherto carried himself or his
kit, was lost  ;  his old soldier servant had gone back to seek
among the snow for his wife and child.                Of this sad time he
has preserved     the following recollections       : —
      " Never    shall    I   forget the night which followed            the
abandoning of our position in front of Lugo.                 We marched
through that city at dusk, and then blew up the bridge
which was to check for awhile our foe.                 In  darkness, with
no food, and after sleepless nights, with worn-out shoes, and
thoroughly disgusted with always running off and not fight
ing, this army now fell into utter disorder.              Starved  as  they
were, the men soon became             reckless,   and   all the regiments
got mixed together        ;  in short, the soldiers were desperate, in
spite of the exertions of the few mounted officers.                For my
own part,   I walked     on, usually  in my sleep, with the grumbling
and tumultuous mass,          until awakened by the loss of my boots
 in  one   of the numerous deep cuts across the road, which
 were   like quagmires,       so  that with my bare feet       I had  some
twenty miles still to march.           Many of the soldiers got away
from the road to right and left.           Marching all that dreadful
night my young frame at last gave way, the more so                      as I
was barefoot,      cold,    and starved,   and already the great body
 of troops had got far ahead of me.            In  short,  I was  now one
of  a huge   arrear of stragglers when day broke, and the little
 hamlet was in sight.

                 NEARLY TAKEN PRISONER.                            45
      " Seated on a bank on the side of the road, and
                                                            munching
a raw     turnip which     I had  gathered   from the adjacent field,
and just     as  I was feeling   that I never could regain my regi
ment, and must be taken prisoner, a black -eyed drummer of
the 96th came by from the village, whither the young fellow
had been to cater.       Seeing that    I was exhausted,   and almost
as young as himself, and not yet a hardened old soldier, he
slipped round his canteen,          which he had contrived to      fill
with red wine, and gave me a hearty drink.              He thus saved
me      from being taken prisoner by the French, who were
rapidly advancing, and who, if they had had a regiment of
cavalry in pursuit, might at that moment have taken pri
soners,     or driven into the mountains, a good third of the
British forces.
       " With the draught of wine          I   trudged on again,  and
came      in, at eleven o'clock of the 10th,        into the town of
Betanzos, and rejoined my regiment, which had marched in
with about fifty men only, with the colours, though ere night
it  was made up to        its strength of 600 and odd men.       This
fact alone shows better than a world of other evidence what
 forced night-marches         with a starving and retreating army
must infallibly produce.          At Lugo     the  36th regiment was
 fit to fight anything — in two days it was a rabble.
       " Happily for me I tumbled into a shoemaker's house.
 His    handsome     young wife washed my feet with warm water,
 and furnished me with stockings, while her husband came
 to my further aid with shoes.          But my swollen feet had no
 time to recover.        On the following        day the whole army,
 such as    it  was, passed over the river, blowing up the bridge,
 and taking up its last position.
       " There, remnant     as it was, the army formed a respectable

line — Corunna within two miles of us, and our fleet ready to
back us.      Provisions   and shoes were served out to us, and
with such luxuries the bivouac, even in the month of January,
was well borne.         In truth the army got into comparative
good spirits, and when on the 15th the French           crossed the
last bridge we had blown up, and were defiling at a respect
able distance along our front, we were quite refreshed,          and
ready to repel them.         The picquets indeed of our (Hope's)
division had a sharp encounter on that evening, and when
looking through the Colonel's glass,      I saw  Colonel Mackenzie
of the 5th regiment fall dead from his grey horse, whilst
leading an attack on two of the enemy's guns.
     " On the 1 6th, just after our
                                         frugal repast, and whilst
leaning over one of the walls where we lay, my old Colonel
 after looking some time with his glass, suddenly exclaimed
 to me,   '
            Now, my boy, they 're coming on ;' and when       I took
 a peep to the     hills beyond on the right and south-west,        I
 perceived the glitter of columns coming out of a wood.         And
 scarcely had the Colonel given the word to fall in, when a
 tremendous fire opened from a battery of seventeen to twenty
 pieces, under cover     of which the enemy was rolling down in
 dense columns from the wooded         hills upon our poor fellows,
 who were in     a  hollow with their arms piled, like our own,
 until they were assaulted.
      " For our
                  cavalry was extinct,    as the horses and men, as
 well  as   most of our artillery, were embarked on the 13th and
  14th ;  yet never since Englishmen fought was there a more
 gallant fight than was made by the 4th, 42d, and 50th regi
 ments (Lord W. Bentinck's         brigade),   who rushed on with
 the bayonet,    and, supported by the Guards, held their own
against a terrific superiority, until General Paget was ordered

  to move his brigade towards the enemy's               flank, and com
  pelled them to withdraw — not, however,            before   poor Moore,
  galloping     out from the town, fell, while encouraging the
  troops   ;  and Baird,    who marched his division           out of the
  town, had lost his arm.         My own brigade      had much less to
 do, our front line and picquets being alone engaged.
        " As
               night fell, and after the firing        had ceased, the
 enemy having returned to his own ground, we received the
 order to march into Corunna and embark.                  Our fires were
 left burning to deceive the enemy, and make him believe
 that he must fight us again next morning                if  he hoped     to
 beat us.
        "
          Silently and regularly we moved on on this our last
  short night-march in the dark tranquil night of the            1 6th, and
  passing through the gates reached the quay.              The names of
 our respective transports had previously been explained to
 us, my own being the brig
                                    '
                                       Eeward,' which      I  found to be
 from Sunderland.           I  was on deck as light dawned,             and
 then at once saw the danger of the position of this miserable
 little transport,    as   well as of a dozen or more of the same
 craft.       They had been foolishly          allowed to anchor im
 mediately under the tongue of high land which forms the
 eastern side of the harbour, and on which there were no land
 defences.       Knowing that this ground was only a continua
 tion of the     hilly track  on which my division had marched a
 few hours before, and being certain that the French would
with the peep of day pass over our old bivouac to this pro
montory,       I at  once urged our skipper to get up his anchor
betimes.         But the grog had,       I  suppose,  been     strong that
night.       He exclaimed, ' Why,     I tell you  what, the brave    High
landers are there       ; they have not come away like you folks.'

48               SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
Scarcely had he spoken when a battery of field-pieces opened
their fire and sent some balls through our rigging.           Turning
pale   as   death under the fire of these mere field-pieces, and
seeing that his crew were ready to run below, he applied the
axe to the cable, and     in a few minutes we were drifting away
as we best could.        The wind being from the east, we were
fast approaching the rocks on which the Castle of Antonio
stands,     and on which        at least five transports     similarly
circumstanced        to my own were wrecked, the men being
saved     with difficulty, after losing their arms, colours,      and
baggage.
      " I  have often reflected on the extraordinary       want of all
due arrangement on the part of our Admiral, in command
 of a splendid fleet, who allowed those miserable transports
to anchor in such a position without placing a frigate or two
near them to silence the puny battery and prevent the dis
 may which seized the skippers.
     " Not ' missing stays,' the     '

 the fleet helter-skelter      for the Channel.      The retreat from
 Lugo could not be more confused than this flight of ships.
 On the night after our start         I was awakened by a strange
 noise,   and running     on deck found the ship wearing            off
 under    a  furious storm from amidst white foam and breakers.
 We had just avoided going ashore upon the Dodman — a
 headland of Cornwall      — which that very night       sent three or
 four of our careless transports to the bottom with their crews,
 and filled      with poor soldiers who had escaped from the
 dangers      and privations    of the campaign.       Such were our
 transports of the old war.          We had been saved from this
 disaster solely by the watchfulness of an old grenadier."

     So ended    Murchison's first and last campaign.     After the
lapse  of more than half a century spent in peaceful and utterly
different pursuits, and when men had ceased to        think of him
as having tried in any degree the rough ways of war, he
loved to recall those old Peninsular days.        Many a time did
the  recollection of them furnish him with a telling point in
an  after-dinner     speech, and give to some      of his hearers a
surprise when they learnt that the speaker whom they had
known or heard of, perhaps       from boyhood, only     as a man of
science,   had fought with Wellesley        and Moore    before  the
year  of Waterloo.
     From the end of January 1809 to nearly the end of
 October   in the same year, Murchison         remained with his
regiment     on home service,    continuing   to vary the routine
of garrison life by visits to different parts of the country,
among others to Tarradale, the paternal estate        in Ross-shire.
London, too, lay      so temptingly near to Horsham Barracks,
that he was often to be found      with some of his messmates at
the  Old Slaughter's Coffee-house,      St.  Martin's Lane, then a
favourite military haunt.       On one of these occasions, escorted
by his commanding officer,       Colonel Burne, he was parading
 Bond Street in the stream of fashionable loungers when Sir
Arthur "Wellesley came up.         The hero of Vimieira had for
the   nonce turned his sword into the pen of the                Chief
 Secretary for Ireland, and his   military uniform into a civilian's
garb so unique that        it remained ever after in the young
                              "
lieutenant's memory : — Coat double-breasted, with brass
 buttons,   buff waistcoat, kerseymere shorts, and brown top-
 boots, leaving a good deal of daylight      behind."   Eecognising
 the Colonel, he stopped.        His words not   less than his dress
 made one      of the reminiscences which Murchison liked most

 once more.      One of your younkers — eh    ?  Well, things won't
 do as they    are.  I  shall soon be at it again, and then      I can't
 do  without the 36th."       But though this prophecy came true
 enough, and though doubtless the subaltern went away re
joicing in the prospect of again having a chance of distin
 guishing himself, he was not destined to take any part with
his regiment in the brilliant adventures which ended with
Waterloo.
     Curiously enough, the very advancement which he had all
along contemplated as the height of military bliss became
in the end the ruin of his professional prospects.             He now
attained his ambition, for in the autumn of 1809 he became
aide-de-camp to his uncle.         But the change, though it led
him abroad, brought him no opportunity of advancing him
self in his career.
     General Mackenzie was then in Sicily, and his nephew
had orders      to join him there.      On the 25th of October,
                                                 '           '
George    m.'s jubilee, he set sail.    As the     Salcette     frigate,
in which     he had obtained a berth, slipped round the           North
Foreland      and   down     the  Channel,   the   shores   of     Kent
from headland        to   headland,   and   from tower to tower,
blazed with cannon, while a great fleet fronting the coast-line
answered with one long flame of fire from ship to ship, as             if
to show not merely        loyalty to the old King, but a front of
defiance    to be seen and understood by Napoleon on the
other side of the strait.
     Life abroad wore now a pleasanter aspect than it had done
for him in the Peninsula.         " At Messina," he
                                                       says,     I

soon set up as      my uncle's aide-de-camp in a house of my
own, with two horses, and little to do except make love and

ride in the cool of the evening with my general."             As  one
of his duties he had to copy an official correspondence           be
tween   his nncle and the agents of the Neapolitan          Govern
ment, and thereby had an early opportunity        of learning some
thing of the duplicity and broken         faith   with which the
British in Sicily had to deal.    Another correspondence         also
copied out by him was one with Admiral Collingwood, then
in command        of the Mediterranean     squadron, whose de
spatches     were   pointed   out  to   him    by     his  uncle    as
models for imitation.
    A lull   had come in the warlike operations in Italy.        The
hostile forces, looking at each other across the narrow Strait
of Messina,     contented themselves with a wearisome and
profitless gun-boat bombardment.         Murat came down into
Calabria, and threats were given out that he would invade
Sicily and call on the people to rise against the hated
Bourbon    ; but as no such move was made, the bombardment
went on.
    This uninteresting duel was once enlivened by an inci
dent worthy of an older time.      A  flag of truce came sailing
across   from the French lines, and keen grew the interest on
the Sicilian side to learn what new turn affairs had taken.
Still  greater,  however, was the astonishment of everybody
when the French officer, disembarking with         a package   under
his arm, made known         his mission thus    : —"   Le Eoi mon
maitre ayant appris que son bon ami le Ge'ne'ral Mackenzie
se trouve en face, de'sire renouveler leur amitae', et    lui envoye
quelques livres de bon tabac de Paris !"
     It  turned out that some years before, Mackenzie            had
obtained leave of absence to go from Minorca to visit Rome.
While he was in the imperial city, the French army under

Murat suddenly appeared.       The young British brigadier re
solved not to flee, like most of his fellow-countrymen,         but
to trust to the effects of a bold bearing upon the generous
and susceptible mind of Murat.          On the evening of the
French entry into Rome,     a Princess, with whom Mackenzie
was   acquainted, gave    a grand ball, at which he was an
nounced in full uniform as " The English General."          Taking
no notice of the French officers, who looked at each other
in astonishment,   he saluted the hostess, and had entered     into
conversation with her, when at last Murat, recovering from
his surprise, tapped him on the shoulder, and begged for
some explanation.      Mackenzie   easily satisfied him that he
was what he pretended to be, — a young British officer, " fond
of pictures, pretty women, and amusement        ;   and that as he
was simply amusing himself and learning Italian, he thought
he had better trust to the generosity of a brave       General-in-
Chief than be captured by troops and treated as a spy."
Murat not only granted him leave to stay in Eome, but
gave him a passport to travel where he pleased,        and formed
a friendship which was now renewed        even    in the midst of
actual war.
    As  a  further reminiscence of this friendship, his nephew
writes, — " When the General [Mackenzie]          visited Paris at
the peace of Amiens, he found in Murat a most useful and
kind friend, who presented      him to the First Consul, with
whom he dined.        It was my uncle's habit to eat slowly,
and in short to dine like a gentleman, in conversing with
his  neighbours.     Massena,    who was     next     him,  said, —
'
  Do"pechez-vous,   mon Ge'ne'ral — le diner sera bientot fini et

cancer in his stomach           !),   that before ray worthy uncle had
eaten the second dish, Napoleon                  was     trotting by him, fol
lowed by all his clattering suite, to have coffee in the next
room of the Tuileries."
       Although actual warfare was going on within sight of
Messina, our young aide-de-camp began again to complain
of monotony.        He took pains to acquire some knowledge of
Italian, and, what may surprise those who knew him only
late in life, had lessons in singing.                    Of professional work
there would seem to have been but little for him to do                               ;
hence the arrival of          a     stranger,    who needed to be taken
round the outskirts         of Messina, was no doubt                  a   welcome
excitement.        His journals contain jottings of such short
excursions, parties,        and other gossip.                The only incident
beyond the usual routine relates to an English lady, one of
the beauties of the place, who, however, had the misfortune
to be extremely stout — " One day at the table of the Com-
                            :
mander-in- Chief, the captain of                 a     Turkish frigate being
seated      opposite to   F —   ,     was   so   lost in admiration          of her
that    D — and myself, who              were     sitting on either side of
him, asked him how much he would pay for her, and he
instantly replied, with sparkling                eyes,       Fifty brass cannon,'
                                                         '
— in other words, his frigate's worth."
    General Mackenzie's health now required his return to
England,      and our aide-de-camp was soon                      relegated    once
more     to home    life.     The journey          homeward proved more
circuitous and prolonged, as well as somewhat                       more     event
ful, than the voyage out had been. They had berths on
         " miserable little
board   a                   packet, with some six pop-guns,"
and their route     lay by Malta and Cagliari to Gibraltar.                     Off
the coast     of Sicily they ran        a   narrow chance of being sunk

by an Algerine squadron, the Algerines being then at war
with the Sicilians.   At Cagliari they beheld his Sardinian
Majesty drawn down one of the steep streets of the place in a
rickety coach by four black long-tailed      horses.  Ten days
passed pleasantly away at Gibraltar, enlivened by an excursion
into the hills of Ronda, in the wake of the retreating French,
with the risk of being taken prisoners by them, or of being
shot as Frenchmen     by the guerillas.    At Cadiz   he made
fresh acquaintances,  witnessed a little further warfare in the
attack and defence of Fort Matagorda, and enjoyed for a fort
night the evening stroll on the Alameda.      The packet direct
from Constantinople to England took him finally home.

                       CHAPTER         IV.
                  MILITARY LIFE AT HOME.
     THE military career of Lieutenant       Murchison had now
 come  wholly to depend for its shaping upon that of Lieut.-
General Mackenzie.       As the latter on his return home was
appointed to command in the north of Ireland, his prospects
of future advancement suffered hopeless ruin, and with them
went those of his young aide-de-camp.           Both aspirants for
distinction were doomed      to inaction at home just     as Wel
lington was beginning his brilliant successes in the Penin
sula, and they remained here through those eventful years —
1811 to 1814 — during which       the   British army established
its prestige on the continent of Europe.
     With this forced inaction Murchison       used to connect an
incident illustrative of one phase of the society of England
at the time.    General Mackenzie had been a favourite with the
Prince Eegent, and continued to be so until one fatal night
after his return from Sicily.    The story is thus told by his
nephew    : — " My uncle was in the pit of the Opera when Sir
A, Murray, the gentleman-usher of the Princess          of Wales,
came   down to him from her box and conveyed the flattering

56              SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                              [w11.
message that her Royal Highness wished to see him.                 Hesi
tating for a moment, for he well knew how the Prince hated
her,   he unfortunately       assented,   in the belief that no one
could refuse a royal command.                Of course, the Princess
having    got    one    of the Prince's     clique, and    a handsome
fellow, in hand, made the most of her conquest, not only                by
parading him in front of the box, but also by taking him
home to sup with her.           The late Lord Hertford, who was
the constant gossip of the Prince, went at the usual hour
next     morning,      and whilst H.    R  H.    was   shaving    said, —
'
  Well,    Sir,   strange    things   come      to   pass.     Mac    was
with the Princess in her box last night, and went home
with her to supper.'          The razor fell from the royal hand,
and at once he took a dislike to my uncle, who never saw
him afterwards.          But to soften his fall the Grand Cross of
the Hanoverian         Order was sent to him, the Prince saying,
'                                                               "
  Mac is a handsome fellow, and will look well in it.'
      On his return from Messina, Murchison had again to
betake    himself to dull barrack-duty at Horsham with the
second battalion of the 36th regiment, to which he belonged.
He had not yet discovered any form of mental occupation
which might serve to make even that monotonous sort of
life not unprofitable.        On his own confession,       he gave him
self up to walking feats, lessons        in pugilism, horses, and the
other pursuits with which a young military dandy contrives
to  fill up his     time.   In   the midst of this aimless life he
gladly    obeyed      a summons from his uncle to           join him as
 aide-de-camp in the north of Ireland,             where the General
 had been appointed to the command of a division.
     Everything at first promised well in this new sphere of
 action.   But when he had fairly settled down in his quarters

in the town of Armagh, the aide-de-camp found them                       even
more intolerably dull than Horsham, with                 a vastly greater
distance from anything           like the pleasures of society.           His
companion        at this time, the Comte de Clermont,              a   young
French emigre, holding the rank of captain in our service,
had been        appointed by General          Mackenzie       to be aide-
de-camp      with Murchison.          With every disposition to be
amused, the two young men              found it no easy task to keep
themselves       in good humour in Armagh.              Having no kind
of military duty       to perform, they spent their mornings                in
hare-hunting with slow beagles.              During the day they were
 often to be found at a neighbouring             rectory, drawn partly
 by the whimsicality        of the   jolly  parson,   and partly by the
 charms of his young ladies, among whom each of them con
trived to fall deeply in love.         From the rector's      humour and
Miss B—'s attractions        the change to the      dull lonely evenings
at Armagh was no doubt intolerable.               Now and then         a  tea-
party came off in their honour.            When that form of excite
ment failed they had the chance of            a game    at tric-trac with
the General, who          however     would     dismiss them at nine
o'clock to their lodging over a bootmaker's            shop.1
      In his journal of this period there occur allusions to the
 Cathedral Library, but he appears to have made little use of
it, his chief mental exertions having been given to the dis
 cipline of his stable and the doctoring of his horses.                  Such
 reading as he accomplished             seems   to have consisted of
    1 An amusing glimpse into this Armagh life is furnished by the
 remark of a French cook whom the General had taken over to Ireland
with him, and whose disgust with the want of resources for his art, and
the intolerably pungent peat-smoke, found vent at last in the following
words, duly chronicled by the nephew : — " C'est avec infiniment de regret,
M. le GtSneral, qne je vous quitte : mais en ventfi si je reste ici je perdrai
et ma reputation   et ma vue."

 Shakespeare      and any sensational form of literature which
 came to hand.
      At this time of his life Murchison        was  simply one   of
those    numerous young men who, finding in the routine of
 their military duty occupation for but a small portion of the
day, and having      little inclination for pursuits requiring any
degree    of thought, yet happy in the possession of excellent
health, strong bodies, and good spirits, need to get an outlet
somehow       for their superfluous energy.      Nor does he seem
to have been more fastidious than others in his choice as to
the direction in which that outlet was to be sought— feats
of pedestrianism, hunting, or horsemanship offered a ready
 relief from the tedium of military idleness.
     Now and again he obtained leave to go to England, and
on these      occasions, when not following     the hounds in the
northern counties, he was usually to be seen dressed in the
height of fashion and airing himself on the promenades            of
London.        For he had now managed to pick up expensive
tastes, and indulged       in an extravagance   which brought him
a series   of earnest expostulations both from his guardian and
his uncle.       On his     own confession he spent treble and
quadruple his allowance, and looked forward to his majority
as  an event which would enable him to gratify even more
freely his fondness for display.        He even talked of selling
the patrimony      in Eoss-shire so soon as it came into his pos
session  — a purpose which his guardian contemplated with
horror as a frustration of the design of Dr. Murchison, who
had purchased the property        as an  investment for the family,
and who held that a small freehold estate gives a man a
better position in the country than treble its value in the
bank.      Murchison of Tarradale would have a voice in his
county, Murchison of the funds could have none.

                       COMING OF AGE.                               59
     In  the midst of this purposeless      extravagance   it is plea
 sant to find a glimpse of better things.           On the 27th of
January 1812, Captain Murchison became a Member of the
 Royal Institution, where he attended           the lectures of Sir
 Humphry Davy.          No notice of this part of his London
 doings, however, occurs in his journals.
     At   last the long-wished-for     19th February 1813 arrived,
 and the young laird came of        age.   His guardian had urged
 him to go north,      see  the property with his mature eyes,
 and judge for himself whether he would act wisely in parting
 with it.     He now resolved to follow this advice.         In  those
 days  it was common to make the journey into Scotland on
 horseback, or to post in one's carriage.          Young Tarradale
combined the two kinds of locomotion, for he converted
                               "
his tall hunter " Buckran        into a buggy horse, and with his
          "
groom       started off steadily in his high       green   dog-cart."
After a short stay in Edinburgh he took the old Highland
road, and had reached Blair- Athol by the last day in March.
Next morning a loud thumping at his bedroom door, and
the voice of his Yorkshire groom — " Sir, I canna           get  in to
Buckran     ; the snaw 's blocked oop t' way to steable," brought
before   him in a way not to be forgotten one of the risks of
Highland travelling in the old days.          Half  a century after
wards he was again driving with the writer of these lines
along the same road, and recalled the picture of his escape
how after incredible labours, and with a strong gillie or two at
each wheel, he managed        to reach the little wayside inn of
Dalnacardoch      ; how the stage-coach,     trying to follow them
late in the     day, was capsized     over the bank of the Garry,
and the driver, guard, and passengers, after trudging for some
miles through the snow, arrived with nightfall at his inn             ;

 60             SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                               [ISM.
           •
how next day, leaving Buckran and the groom snowed up at
Dalnacardoch,       and taking only a small supply of raiment
with him, he and the other passengers toiled from breakfast-
time to sunset through that most formidable of the Highland
passes — the      defile    of Dramouchter      ;    how     one   of the
pedestrians,     a sturdy sheep-farmer,      would sometimes         come
 to the help of two young school-girls who were of the party,
lifting one in each arm through the heaviest drifts as if they
had been a couple of sheep        ;  how, after reaching and resting
at Dalwhinnie,      they made their way finally to Inverness             on
a snow-carriage       ;  and how Buckran        and     the dog-cart    did
not turn up for nearly a fortnight after.
     Inverness now became for a short while his headquarters.
                                                     "
There, as he writes, he had " long proses              with the Provost
of the town, who was factor for the Tarradale estate.                   He
                                              "
went over the property, and " tasted              its soil with worthy
Provost Brown of Elgin, who pronounced                it to    "
                                                            be   good and
sharp."      Like other Highland estates of the day, the land
was miserably        farmed.    We can picture the young laird,
mounted on Buckran, and riding among the wretched hovels
of his crofters.        Little about the place itself, save that it
was his own birthplace and his father's              choice, offered any
opposition to the design he had half-formed of selling the
estate.    In his journal the following passage occurs : " When
the whole of the poor little tenants came round me and said
they would willingly pay any rent which their interpreter
                                                  '
into   English,     Eory M'Lennan,        said      so   just a man      as
the Provost would award,'        I   could not find       it in my heart
to  turn them adrift, though        I knew them to be wretchedly
bad farmers, who hitherto had only paid their rents through
illicit distillation of whisky."       Whether      it was prompted by

     ]             TARRADALE RENTS.                                61
mere good-nature or by         youthful    impatience, this    hasty
letting of the estate in the old way to poor crofters proved
in  the end to be as bad a piece     of policy as the young laird's
uncle, General Mackenzie, declared         it  to be when he heard
what had been done.       In  a few years the rents got more and
more into arrears, until the estate was gladly sold off.
     Near to Tarradale lay the lands of Ferrintosh, the property
of Forbes of Culloden, to whom and his heirs, in considera
tion of services rendered and losses sustained at the time of
the Revolution,    had been granted the perpetual           right of
making and selling whisky at Ferrintosh, duty free.              The
temptation offered by such     a traffic was too great to be resisted
by the tenantry of the other estates in the neighbourhood,
who readily found a sale      in Ferrintosh for the whisky they
had privately distilled  in their cabins or in lonely hollows of
the moors.    As a consequence       of such extensive evasions of
the    Customs,  it became      at last necessary    to abolish the
privileges granted to Ferrintosh, the sum of £21,500 being
voted by Parliament in 1784 by way of compensation.              But
no  Act of Parliament could readily           change   habits which
entered so largely into the life of the peasantry of that far
Ross-shire region.     And   so the   young laird of Tarradale had
to wink at the distillation, and pocket his rents, or at least
such proportion of them as he could secure.
     Two Parliamentary      elections occurred while he was at
Inverness, one of them for his own county of Ross-shire,
in which he took part on the side of the Tory candidate.          He
notes that at one   of the election dinners he had the old chief
of Glengarry opposite to him.           I
                                      " saw," he writes, " that he
several times fixed me with his fierce grey eyes and bushy
eyebrows, and when the dinner was a little advanced, he put

  62             SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
 his hand across the table, and leaning over said loudly to
       '                    sir, to the land of your fathers
 me,     Ye 're welcome,                                      ; may
 you never desert nor forget it,' giving me a Highland grip
  I can  never forget."
      We may believe that a relative of Donald Murchison
 would not fail to receive a hearty welcome.           Most of hia
 time, indeed,     during this visit to his native district, seems
 to have been passed in the enjoyment of the hospitalities
 of his friends and acquaintances — fishing, shooting, and
 hunting, and abundant festivity.
      While amid such desultory employments and amusements
 time had been creeping onward with Murchison in Ireland,
 in London or       elsewhere    in England, and now in Scotland,
 events     of world-wide importance had been shaping them
 selves   in the Peninsula.         Step by step   Wellington had
 driven the      French   armies out of that part       of Europe   ;
 Napoleon's prestige      had fallen, and at last came his abdi
 cation and retreat to Elba.          Our young military aspirant
 says  of himself that he was " for ever bewailing his fate at
 not being at his real work in the Peninsula."            The cam
 paign, however, had ended without his ever having had a
 call into active service, and now on the peace of 1814 he
 saw the final      blow to all his hopes of military fame.      As
 his  uncle     threw   up   his   Staff appointment,   he  himself
 became      a captain   of the 36th on half-pay, his battalion
having been promptly reduced.            London became again his
headquarters.
      Of this part of his life the following notice occurs in his
journal   : — " In  1814  I was   in London, living gaily at Long's
hotel with a set of young dandies, dining now and then with
Alexander      Woodford of the Guards, at St. James's Palace,

    .]                  LONDON          IN   1814.                    63
when the        announcement        of the    arrival   of the foreign
Sovereigns (Eussia and Prussia) set all the metropolis in a
ferment.      I galloped   out with many others to Shooter's        Hill
to see the Emperor Alexander              in his little droschke, with
his bearded Euss on the box, and certes, though there was
no state reception, he was heartily            cheered,   escorted  by a
joyous cavalcade of well-mounted English gentlemen.
       "It  being announced that the Regent would visit the
 Opera accompanied by his imperial and royal guests, every
cranny was bespoke, and          I   got a good central post in the
pit  ;  for in those days there were no stalls (and no shopboys
 and tradesmen ever went to the          pit then).    The reception of
their Majesties was of course most enthusiastic.             They were
 really welcomed as our liberators from Gallic tyranny.
      " Suddenly there arose       a  sort of semi-applause, followed
by murmurs, with some disturbance.              It  was the Princess of
Wales, who had just entered a box directly facing that of
the Regent, and, as      if she  came to defy     him and try her own
strength, she came forward in her hat and feathers to show
 herself.     A  few cries were got up for her, amidst loud mur
muring at this unseemly attempt to disturb unanimity                  on
such an occasion.
      " Then it was that the Regent, on whose countenance              I
had my eye fixed, rose, and taking the Emperor and                 King
 on his right and left hands, advanced gracefully to the front
 of the royal box, the three personages bowing three times to
the audience. The appeal was electric           :  the roar of applause
lasted for minutes, and the Princess was so discomfited that
she     no more showed in the front of her box during the

      In    the crowd of English travellers who eagerly availed
themselves of the reopening of the Continent,                Murchison
found his way to Paris in the beginning of November 1814.
He remained there for some weeks, which he employed with
the most laudable assiduity in trying to make himself as
French as he could.          He dined and spent much of his time
in a pension where no English was spoken, took lessons in
dancing from one of the leading teachers,                frequented the
theatres,      passed   many an hour over the pictures           in the
Louvre (for he was now beginning to aspire to be a connois
seur in art), was presented at Court, and in company with
his old friend and fellow-aide-de-camp              De Clermont, who
had returned to Paris with the Eestoration, saw everybody
and everything which had any interest for " a young man
about town."          There occur among his memoranda notices of
the actors and the acting at some of the theatres.               I
                                                                " could

of the French rhythm at the Theatre Francois, where              I went,

as he was, by Madlle. de Rancour and by Georges.                  It was
gratifying, however, to        see how he first broke the sing-song
by his imitation of Kemble and the English style by ejacu
lations and stops in the middle of some of the long lines of
Racine.
       " The best actor of
                               high comedy     I  ever saw was Fleury.
 Having been taught before the Revolution, he was every inch
 a gentleman,      and his countrymen of good taste said despond-

 ingly of him,        C'est le dernier des Francois qui sait porter
 I'e'pe'e.'   When     I saw  how vulgarly most of the other actors
 of the revolutionary breed dressed and acted, carrying their
 swords like butchers' knives,       I felt the truth  of the aphorism."

     His mother was then living at Tours, and Murchison paid
her a   visit there.    His chief companion there        seems to have
been Francis      Hare (elder brother of Augustus and Julius),
whose versatility and dash captivated him, and with whom he
made excursions.         Among other places, they visited together
Poitiers, where Hare introduced him to Walter Savage Landor,
then resident at that place.
                                    " Landor lived at the summit of
a large central tower, which overlooked the whole city, and
there we found the impetuous but warm-hearted philosopher
ensconced     in  a  library filled with all the most curious old
French works, Rabelais being his special favourite.              He and
Hare held a disputation           on Louis the Eleventh         and his
doings, as we looked down upon the remnants of the palace
of that craftiest of    all the French kings."
    In   such pursuits the last weeks of 1814 and the first two
months of the following year passed away, until at the begin
ning of March he found himself again in Paris on his home
ward journey.         The morning after his arrival,          his Swiss

arrived, hopes were up, — the garrison at Grenoble had re-

 sisted, and Napoleon's cause was lost        ;  then   a camp     was to
 be formed at     Melun, and the Due de Berri was to command
 it ; the Marechal Ney having sworn fidelity            to   Louis xvni.
 This last, which was true, seemed the best chance, for Ney
 was beloved by the soldiers.          Then followed    a   review of all
 the royal guards      and regiments      in Paris, 10,000 or 12,000
 men,   in the Carrousel in front of the balcony of the Tuileries,-
 in which the fat old Louis waddled out in his velvet boots to
 be saluted by the loyal troops.
      "I   attended    on that occasion,     and never saw such           a
 farce.    The   soldiers of the bine surrounding         the National
 Guards were all cracking jokes with each other            ;  and though
they still wore the white cockade, they were evidently all
 dying to mount the tricolor."
      He went to    see  his friend at Court, the young Comte de
 Clermont, and found him fully aware of the fact that the
 army would not stand by the King, and that resistance was
therefore    hopeless.    Evidently Paris was no longer a desir
able domicile for an      English officer.    De Clermont advised
him to leave at once.         The English visitors were already in
rapid flight thronging the usual road to Calais, and hiring
every available conveyance          that would take them to the
coast.     Captain Murchison rightly conjectured that by mak
ing a detour by way of Bo"thune and St. Omer, he would
have     some   chance    of securing post-horses,        and    reaching
Calais.     Not without      some    risk, however, could English
travellers make their way along the roads of France at that
time.     Coming out of Be'thune         he met the head of an         in
fantry regiment, which, from the narrowness of the roadway,
had to pass the carriage in single file.            " '

were, and     all in the greatest excitement, they had raised the
wheels, and were actually about to trundle us over into the
ditch of the fortress, and were unharnessing the horses, just
as   the adjutant rode up and applied           a  thick cane to their
shoulders, and rescued       us.   We afterwards met with others
of these soldiers in detached         parties, and in complete dis
order, but we kept close shut up in our machine.               At Arras

      The war-clouds having once more spread              over Europe,
there seemed now again some hope of obtaining active                mili
tary service, and gaining coveted promotion.              So the half-
pay captain of infantry determined at once to enter one of
the cavalry regiments which         were   to take part in the im
pending Belgian campaign.            In doing    so, however, he acted
without     the advice and indeed against the wishes of his
uncle, General Mackenzie,          who, vexed at this want of con
fidence, wrote to his mother that he considered the entering
into the cavalry as a " measure full of the most stupid folly."
Notwithstanding this protest, the exchange was made.               Mur-
chison joined      the  Enniskillen Dragoons, and seems now to
have looked forward         with tolerable confidence      to a chance
of distinguishing       himself.     But even though he had the
promise    of employment from the Colonel, who was his per
 sonal friend, he was once more fated to disappointment, and
 the  predictions of his uncle proved too true.         Six troops only
 were   ordered    out, and every one of the service       captains in
 sisting on going    ; he had no alternative but to equip himself
 with uniform and horses, and repair to the depot at Ipswich.

68           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                         [1s1s.
    Events   crowded   rapidly  upon each      other during the
hundred days, — Ligny, Quatre Bras, and, lastly, Waterloo.
Then fell Murchison's    hopes   of an active military career.
The war was at an end.      Europe had now been       so worn out
with fighting that no new campaign was likely to take
shape for many a long year to come      ; and, in the meanwhile,
he had no brighter prospect than the ennui of half-pay.
     He was now, however, nearing the event which, in the
end, proved the turning-point       of his career.    His mother,
like other English residents in France, had deemed it pru
dent to quit that country after Napoleon's return, and had
settled for a little at Kyde, in the Isle of Wight.       Thither
her son went to visit her, and there, through the introduc
tion of Miss Maria Porter, he made the acquaintance of
General and Mrs. Hugonin of Nursted House, Hampshire,
and their daughter Charlotte.     This young lady was, to use
his own words, " attractive,    piquante, clever, highly edu
cated, and about three years    my senior."     He first met her
early in the summer of 1815, and,           on the 29th of the
following August, in the romantic little church of Buriton,
in Hampshire, they were married.
     Want of success in the military life had disposed Cap
tain Murchison to look on that career with less enthusiastic
feelings than those of earlier years.      He had even gone so
far   as to think of retiring   from the army      ; and now this
half-formed intention received    a  stimulus from two sources.
 His wife, herself the daughter of a soldier, had experienced
some of the discomforts of a soldier's life, and discerning      in
her husband qualities of a higher kind than would be likely
to be called out by the routine of barrack-duty,         seconded
his   own inclinations.    But perhaps the more immediate

cause     of his final determination was an order to join his
regiment at Komford           barracks.     To take his bride there,
that she might share the dulness with which his experience
at Horsham and Armagh had made him only too familiar, was
a most distasteful prospect       ;  so at last he made up his mind
and sent in his resignation.            His commanding        officer re
monstrated with him, but in vain.             He stuck to his purpose.
 After eight years' service he finally retired from the army
 and gave up      all those visions of military glory which filled
 his whole soul in the old Marlow days.
       It is evident that, up to this period of his life, Murchison
 had not in any way given promise of future distinction.              He
 would have been noted         as   merely one of the gentlemanly,
 intelligent,    but by no means         brilliant young officers,     so
plentiful in the British army.             To one who judged him
merely by externals,         he would     undoubtedly     have    seemed
 little else than   a military fop, and he used in later years to
 confess     that such an estimate       would have been tolerably
true.      The circumstances which were to call out his special
qualities of excellence had not yet arisen.              Full of health
and bodily       activity, he had from the beginning looked on
the    military profession rather      as an    outlet for that part of
his nature than as a career requiring              any special mental
training.      In  those days, indeed, professional study was not
much in fashion in the army.              After quitting Marlow he
does not appear         to have given himself in any degree            to
acquiring further knowledge of the principles of the art of
war.      In his journals there      can be found no trace       of pro
fessional study, nor indeed of solid reading of any kind.
His leisure, which must often have hung heavily on his
hands, was spent,        as we have seen,     in active field-sports, in

70           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
feats of bodily exercise,   or in gratifying that love of display
which led him into culpable extravagance       ;  so that when he
quitted the army, there was little to look back upon with
unmingled satisfaction in that introductory part of his career.
He had entered the service with high hopes of distinction,
but by a series of unfortunate circumstances,      and through no
fault of his own, he had been grievously disappointed.          The
war had now come to an end, and with it went his visions
of rising to distinction in a campaign.      He had not qualified
himself for distinction    in any other way, and we can well
imagine how he should have turned aside at last almost
 with repugnance from a career which           at the beginning
seemed to promise all that he most desired.
     Hitherto he had lived at his own free will.         From this
time he came under the influence of a thoughtful, cultivated,
and affectionate    woman.      Quietly   and imperceptibly    that
influence grew, leading him with true womanly tact into a
sphere   of exertion where his uncommon powers might find
full scope.   To his wife he owed his fame,     as he  never failed
gratefully to record, but years had to pass before her guidance
had accomplished what she had set before her        as  her aim.
     The wedding over, Murchison         took his bride north to
show her the Scottish Highlands,         and to visit his friends
and relatives there.     Of   course he did not    fail to lead her
over the paternal acres of Tarradale, and show her some of
the scenes where his ancestors had distinguished themselves.
Among     other houses    they visited that of an old lady,         a
grand-aunt    of his, who had intended leaving her estate to
him or his brother Kenneth,        but unfortunately for him, as
she confided to his young        wife, " he had too much of the
Baillies about him," his grandmother having been          a Baillie  ;

 IBIS.]     PROPOSES TO ENTER THE CHURCH.                                 71
 and so the estate, which would          have been     a  welcome addi
 tion to the badly paid rents of Tarradale, passed into other
 hands.        Late  in October, and in a storm of snow,              they
 migrated southwards again.
     Having given up one fixed employment the retired cap
 tain of dragoons began to look about for another.                 It will
 hardly be believed by those who only knew him in his later
 years that he now seriously thought of becoming a clergy
 man.       In   this proposal,  as in his choice of a military pro
 fession,     it seems to have been mainly his love of bodily
 activity and open-air exercise which          swayed him.        He says
 of himself, — " I     saw that my wife had been brought up to
 look after the poor, was a good botanist, enjoyed              a garden
and     liked tranquillity   ;  and as parsons   then enjoyed      a little
hunting, shooting, and fishing without being railed at,I thought
that      I  might slide into that sort of comfortable domestic
life."      Among the letters which        he preserved     there  occurs
one from a friend whom he had asked to make inquiries for
him, and who went into the question in the most earnest
and business-like        manner.       This correspondent urges the
necessity of getting a Greek             Lexicon,    and   suggests     the
name       of a clergyman who might be of service in helping the
aspirant for holy orders to read the Greek Testament.                    So
earnest is he about the Lexicon          and other heavy tomes, that
he insists upon Murchison's having them conveyed separately
if  he could find no room for them in the carriage with
which he proposed to make a journey to Switzerland.1
   1 The gravity with which the question was viewed may be gathered
from one or two sentences taken from this letter : — " In consequence of
the peace we may expect an irruption of officers into the Church, which
may produce an additional strictness of regulation.     I am not aware in
what time a degree     may be taken   at Cambridge ;  any Cambridge    man

    Fortunately for himself' and his possible parishioners                  this
notion soon died away.            But while still undecided about enter
ing the Church he resolved in the meantime to                 see a  little   of
the world      with his wife.        The winter was accordingly passed
at Nursted         House, in diligent preparation for a long and
leisurely tour on the Continent.                He had already attained
considerable proficiency in French.               As the tour was to be
extended into Italy, he now set diligently to work to acquire
further knowledge of Italian, and to read a quantity of litera
ture treating of the scenery and history of Italy.                 Probably
 this was the most industrious winter he had yet spent                    ;  for
he had now a definite incentive to work, besides the example
and co-operation of his wife.             A day now and then with the

    In a note-book of 1815 there occurs a most formidable list of books which
 it seems Murchison had      jotteddown with the intention of using them in his
 proposed clerical education.      They are in Greek, Latin, French, Italian,
 and English, and with his characteristic methodical habits he has classi
 fied them under various heads, as " Religion," " Eloquence," " History,"
 "  Belles-Lettres,"  etc. etc.

                        ITALY AND ART.
   WITH the proposal of a country parson's lot still undecided,
and indeed   with no settled plans for the future, Mr. and Mrs.
Murchison had determined in the meantime to spend a year
or two abroad.     This resolution had been, in some measure,
forced upon them by the state of their finances.       The Tarra-
dale rents, never very   well paid, even at the best, had almost
ceased to  yield any income, and times were       so bad  that the
tenantry petitioned for alleviation.     His revenue from other
sources   was not great, certainly not enough       to enable  the
young laird and his wife to live comfortably in England.
It was sufficient, however, to permit them to enjoy comfort,
and even    elegance, in Italy.   So that,   until some decision
had been come to regarding the fate        of the Highland pro
perty,  a  sojourn on the Continent      was  deemed    absolutely
necessary.
    This enforced    exile, however,  proved in the      end  emi
nently advantageous    in other than   a  pecuniary sense.    Mrs.
Murchison had shrewdly discerned her husband's true nature
and the way    in which it should be developed.      She saw that

with his tastes and habits he would be far less likely to
break off from a useless kind of life at home than         if  placed,
amidst a totally      new set of pursuits      and   acquaintances
abroad.      And thus the continental sojourn was planned
and the      notes  of travel were prepared that the foreign
scenery and associations      should act  as powerfully  as  possible
on his mind.       It was a sagacious     experiment, and it suc
ceeded.     In this chapter we have to trace how it     was carried
out.    Its fruits will appear in later pages.
   On Good Friday 1816 the young pair sailed from Dover,
and   taking with them their own carriage,          posted    by easy
stages    from Calais to Paris.       About a year had elapsed
since the hurried flight from that capital noticed in the
preceding chapter,       and   now the masons were found to be
busy on scaffolds      removing the letter     N  from the public
buildings.       On that previous visit Murchison         had made
himself tolerably familiar with the contents of the Louvre,
then enriched with         the spoils of Europe    ;  and    his first
object now was to      see   how the galleries looked after having
been made       to yield back their treasures to the rightful
owners.       He was " astonished to observe how rapidly the
vacant places had been filled up, and not unfrequently by
good   old Italian pictures, which had also been stolen, but
which not having been exposed           in the Great Gallery were
not known to exist in France."
     During    a most   systematic tour of the sights of Paris he
attended a meeting of the Academy (which many years later
was to enrol him among its foreign members), and saw Cuvier
for the first time, who declaimed upon the influence of the
sciences on the common         occupations of man, and upon the
leading share which France had taken in promoting                  this

influence — a share         which    would    have    been    yet greater
had     it   not    been  thwarted     by the perfide politiyue           of
England.
     From Paris they journeyed in the same leisurely way
by Dijon to Geneva.           Though Murchison had as yet shown
no special interest in science,           he now began to make the
acquaintance        of scientific men in the places he visited, and
paid some         attention to their museums.          At    Geneva,    for
example, he met among others Pictet the naturalist, and De
Candolle the botanist.           He found too that " the same rigid
 solemnity was observed          there on the streets     on Sunday as
 in Edinburgh — all demure and starch."                "I  induced," he

 was going to afternoon         service  in his black silk stockings
 and    a gold chain, came up to us, and holding out his watch,

     The summer was spent at Vevay, where he took                  a little
 villa.    His wife's    ancestors   had come     into   England     from
 that part of the Pays de Vaud about a hundred years before.
 She found some distant relations there who made the sojourn
 at  Vevay a memorably pleasant one.                 Many excursions
 were made       to surrounding    parts of Switzerland, the ladies
 usually driving or riding, while Murchison himself delighted
 in keeping pace with them on foot.              Leaving    his wife in
 charge    of her Swiss cousins,        he undertook     some    feats   of
 pedestrianism of which he used to boast in his old            age.     On
 one   occasion he      walked 452      miles in fourteen days,         on

76             SIR RODERICK MURCHISOtf                               [ww-i7.
the last day of which excursion he accomplished 57 miles.
In  another excursion to Mont Blanc he walked 120 miles in
three days.        Such rapid marching is suggestive              rather of
exultation in bodily activity than of intelligent            appreciation
of scenery. Yet his singular power of rapidly seizing the main
features of a landscape        enabled him to carry away some vivid
impressions of what he saw, and even to note some of the
details.   In his    itinerary journal, he speaks of the Grindel-
wald glacier     as
                        "
                     a river of ice," and among his notes there
occurs a detailed narrative         of the processes in use at one of
the Swiss salt-mines.
     An interesting       episode   of their life at Vevay may be
noticed here.       A   terrific thunderstorm broke one night         (1 3th
June) over the lake in front of them, and, roused from sleep,
they   sat watching        from the window a scene never to be
forgotten.      Some months afterwards they read at Rome the
now well-known lines in the then newly published Third
Canto of Childe Harold          : —
       " And this is in the night ! — Most glorious is the night,
         Thou wert not sent for slumber ! let me be
         A sharer in thy fierce and far delight, —
         A  portion of the tempest and of thee   !
         How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,
         And the big rain comes dancing to the earth !
         And now again 'tis black, — and now, the glee
         Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth
       As if it did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth."
The passage recalled their experience at Vevay, and brought
to their recollection that they had met Byron              walking from
Vevay to Clarens on the day before the thunderstorm which,
he has immortalized.
     The winter of 1816-17 was passed at Genoa, studying
Italian, and kindling      a  passion for art and art-galleries, which

is?.]          ROME AND THE GALLERIES.                                77
a  few months later was to burst into        a most portentous blaze
at Rome.      Murchison found opportunity too of practising his
favourite exercise     — walking,   in which, as his notes record,
he   outstripped two young officers since known           as  intrepid
travellers — Irby and Mangles.            In  one of his excursions
marine shells were noted upon some of the hill-tops, and he
infers that these high grounds were once under the          sea.
      By the 21st of March, ere Holy Week began, the two
travellers had reached Rome.          Owing to the cessation of the
war and the reopening of the Continent, the city happened
 to be  at this time crowded with strangers.
     Established,     however,  in a private lodging in the Via
 Condotti, Murchison      avoided gaiety, and became now         a con
firmed dilettante.      Day by day, accompanied and incited by
his wife, he visited gallery after gallery,       and  church      after
church, making elaborate         notes   on the pictures and other
works of art.       He seems to have left little in Rome unseen,
and his jottings, written at a time when the profuse modern
                                "       " Hand-books "
literature of " Guide-books       and                    had not yet
made its appearance,       show   a  creditable degree of zeal and
intelligence.       The general style and tenor of those art-notes
and criticisms may be judged of from the following specimen
 of his journal   :—

in tempera, and one beautiful bluish landscape of Lucatelli,
marine, with great depth                :   this is in his best style.         The
Bella Cenci needs no description.                     Guido is more expressive
here     than      in his fine exuberant Madonna                    above    stairs.
There are two little Claudes, and                 a   Titian, etc. There are a
good many pictures of the inferior and later Eoman artists ;
some of these are pleasing.                 Gaetano Lapis (1776), a scholar
of Conca      ;    same    light colouring, but no confidence in him
self.     His best picture here appeared to me a Lazarus with
Christ (doubtful).              The frescos of Stefano Pozzi in first room
are bright and pretty           (Turk smoking). The column of Bellona
(twisted) of       rosso   antico, with Pallas on the top, very beautiful.
A     Dead Christ by Franc0 Trevisani                     (d.   1746. Sc. Rom.),
not Angelo          Trevisani         (Venet. Sc. same epoch).              In this
Christ       the    foreshortening          is   remarkable,       the   colouring
Guidesco.          He was       a   universal imitator."
        Of the acquaintances whom Murchison made at Kome
the most notable was the sculptor Canova,                         with whom he
had frequent intercourse at the house of Cavaliere Tambroni,
then     a   sort of chief of art.           From his journal and        a   pencil
note written        late in life the following            reminiscences of the
sculptor are given          :—
        " When asked what he                  thought     the most wonderful
structure in Britain (for he had recently visited England),
he at once replied,
                            '
                                Waterloo Bridge.'        Of the antiquities in
the British Museum he gave unquestionable precedence                             to
the     Ilissus of the Parthenon, preferring              it    on account   of the
inimitable schiena to the Theseus.
        "He   narrated       to me how           he overcame        Buonaparte's
obstinacy,         who at first insisted           that the great         sculptor
should represent him in marble in the garb of the con

 and top-boots    —hunting-boots        '
                                          a 1'Anglais.'   Canova stood
 firm in refusing, and when he said to the future Napoleon,
 '
   Then your Excellency must find other artists, and               I  can
 recommend both         a  tailor and a bootmaker in the Corso,' the
 Corsican at once saw a man of taste and genius must have
 his own way, and Napoleon came out in classical toga, etc.
      " Canova was a
                           very active man, and when debarred of
 his exercise by too much work in the studio, he was in the
 habit of jumping backwards and forwards over his modest
 bed, and, proud of his agility, he did it before me.
      "
        This eminent sculptor passes an hour or two every
 evening at Madame Tambroni's              ; at nine o'clock he invari
ably retires.      Had     a  long conversation with him the other
night.     He observed to me, that when in London nothing
offended     his eye more than the smoky brick houses               with
clear painted windows, and was surprised they were not all
white- washed.       He spoke of the absolute necessity of our
having a museum superior to that of Somerset House.                  The
education of English women delighted him, and he the more
regretted the state of his own compatriotes.            He asked why
all the English began their Italian with Dante and Boccaccio.
Metastasio seems to be his favourite author.                The style of
the one    in literature is similar to that of the other in sculp
ture — both chaste, classical, graceful,       and full of pathos.    He
said   of Metastasio's critics, ' Quei che lo criticano, lo leggono     ;
e  poi piangono.'
     " In Canova's       studio no one appears more conspicuously
than the distorted Giaccomino.            Ask him where he has been,
and he answers,
                      '
                         We have been modelling above stairs, il
cavaliere    ed io.'      Giaccomino was a poor, good-humoured

countryman, whom Canova employed            as a  sort of lower ser
vant in the workshop.          He sometimes   hands the morsels        of
clay to his master whilst he is forming the cast, and from,
hence Giaccomino concludes that at least          half the merit       is
his   own.      He freely canvasses     every new attitude,          and
                  '
Canova says,        E  mio maestro  Giaccomino,' and always asks
for his opinion upon any new work.             In  these   little traits
the playful bonhomie          of the great sculptor is pleasingly
exhibited.
     " To
             judge of Canova's simplicity,      examine his house.
You will find every article neat and appropriate         ;  no luxury,
but the utmost cleanliness and regularity       — doubly delightful
in  so  filthy a country.    Two of his bedrooms are ornamented
with his own paintings.          During the French invasion he
occupied himself for eighteen        months with the brush and
palette.      The compositions are in general just what you
might look       for from the graceful mind of the artist — a
sleeping Venus intruded upon by a peeping Satyr, Venus
with Cupids,        etc.  The colouring is Titianesco, and very
wonderful.       These pictures have already the mellowed tone
of the colouring of the old masters       ;  and a head      of an old
carter (a portrait from life) is painted expressly to deceive
as an antique.
     ." Madame       T. related to me, that when Canova first
imagined his group of the Graces,       he happened to be        in the
country visiting the Cavaliere T.         Here there were no fine
models, but females must be found.          Accordingly,      two large
and fat female       domestics  of Madame T. were paraded, who,
with herself, formed the graceful trio.       Their attitudes must
have been most diverting to Canova whilst he drilled and
practised them.       Canova is now nearly sixty years of       age, yet

constitution and physical powers are such that he can jump
over his bedstead                   d pie pari, and can extend a prodigious
weight with his ami."
        Three months specially given up to fine art soon passed
away in Rome.                      The journal in which the record of that
time was            so    elaborately chronicled              is,   however,     more a dry
inventory of what the writer saw than of what he thought
and felt.1           Now and then he varied his researches by an
excursion into the country, but an unfortunate                                    event cut
short these              occupations.          His wife caught a malaria fever,
and became so                ill   that he despaired of her life.                Rallying at
last,     she was            able     to be moved from Rome at the end of
June to seek             a   change of air and the sea-breeze at Naples.
        Full of details though the journal                             is   regarding the
stay      at     Naples, little occurs                  of any general interest, or
which throws any fresh light upon Murchison's                                     own char
acter         and development.                    He visited, of course,              all the
usual places of resort in that neighbourhood.                                    The nearer
excursions were made with his wife, but in company with                                     a
 military friend he accomplished                         a   series of boating expedi
 tions to Paestum, Capri, Ischia, and Procida, seeing                                 a   good
 deal both of scenery and                      of Italian life outside of the ordi
 nary beaten              track of tourists.               He was lucky enough to
 come         in for an eruption                  of Vesuvius,        and ascended         the

 Penonal        Recollections       (p. 122), she thus alludes to the       incident: — "Our

mountain when a current of lava was streaming down its
side.    To get the better view he made the ascent by night,
and there being no moon,         had an impressive view of the
huge lurid crater, with its rocket-like showers of red-hot
stones, and scrambled over the hardened but        still hot surface
of lava to  see  where the molten mass came out in a glowing
stream from the      side of the cone.      His notes of this visit
are simply those of an       intelligent and interested spectator ;
they betray not the slightest geological predilection.
      In Naples, as in Eome, his favourite occupation was to
visit the art-galleries and altar-pieces in the churches,        and
to write out detailed descriptions of the pictures and statues
in his journal.        Even the sight of the miracle of the
liquefying    of the blood of St. Januarius could hardly inter
rupt the art-fever    ; for though the saint gratified the curio
sity of the two travellers and the prayers of the orthodox by
thawing the blood in three minutes instead of keeping them
waiting for hours, the enthusiastic but irreverent dilettante
writes in his diary, " We slipped away from the altar to
admire,    not the works of the saint, but the sublime repre
sentations of them by Domenichino."
      Early in October 1817 Murchison           returned with his
wife to Rome, and wintered there.           Art again    became   his
absorbing pursuit.       Every gallery was once more visited,
fresh notes were duly entered in his journals.       His criticisms,
after a few months of experience,        are spiced  with the dog
matism and the pet phrases of a confirmed connoisseur of
many years' standing.
     Having taken his fill of art and the galleries, Murchison
next set to work with equal industry upon the antiquities
of Eome.      A  good part of the winter    of 1817-18 was spent

in sedulously tracing the lines of the several walls, and the
position and remains of temples and public buildings.                        He
entered with his characteristic zeal into the disputed locali
ties of the Forum, and not content with reading such of the
lucubrations on this subject as he could reach, he wrote in
his journal voluminous comments of his own upon previous
 writers, and gave the observations he himself had made,
 with the conclusions to which they had led him.                        He re
 vived his long disused and never very familiar                         Horace,
 Virgil, and Juvenal, with                  whose   allusions   to Home and
 Roman         sites    he interspersed         his notes.      The following

on his mind that he should         wish to raise up broken entab
latures of colossal size, and mutilated columns, in order that
he might be called a man of taste           ?   If,  therefore,   none    of
these    re-erections   took place in the dark           ages,  which      I
think any reasonable man           will allow,    we    can  have     little
difficulty in proving that such attempts have not been made
since the revival of letters     in the fifteenth century.         Private
and    public history are both silent on this point, whilst on a
number of trivial little subjects, such as that Lorenzo                   di

     About the middle of March (1818) Mr. and Mrs. Mur-
chison quitted Rome for a leisurely         journey   homewards.
At Florence they lingered for three weeks, chiefly among
the galleries and museums.       Again his note-books teem with
descriptions and criticisms of the pictures, his later studies
at Rome having given him greater confidence          than ever     in
his judgments        on art. Michael Angelo receives a special
measure      of his critical wrath.   More   interesting   is it to
mark     that   among    his notes  of Florence some space is
given to an account of the Museum            of Natural History,
particularly that portion in which the successive         stages    in
the growth of animals were illustrated.        From Florence the
journey    led by short stages, and with many a halt, to
Bologna, Modena, Parma, and Turin, thence          by Mont Cenis
into Switzerland, and then by way of Lyons to Paris, and
so home.
     Eather    more than two years     had thus glided away on
 the Continent     ;  two memorable years    in Murchison's      life.
 They taught him, in a way which would have been little
 likely to occur to him at home, the superiority of such pur
 suits as  called for the exercise of thought and taste over the
 more frivolous employments of barrack-life.        It is true that
 his wife was always at his side to share in his pleasures and
 incite him to further perseverance     in the new line of occu
 pation.     But her influence was little needed after the first
 decided    tendency had been given to his inclinations.           He
 soon became      a far more enthusiastic  lover of art than she,
 and must no doubt have often tried her bodily strength to
 the utmost in his hunt through churches and galleries for
  Guidos   and   Raphaels, Caraccis and Domenichinos,         in all
  the stages and styles of each painter.      For the time, he was

    ]            INFLUENCE FROM ART.                              87
absorbed in art and Eoman          antiquities.   It  was  the first
taste he had yet had of the pleasures of continuous intel
lectual employment, and he threw himself into it with all
the eagerness and enthusiasm of his nature.
    He had a natural weakness         for display, which      in his
military days,   as  we have seen, took shape        in fashionable
clothes, horses,    and   the other extravagances      by which    a
young man in the army contrives to get rid of his money.
In Italy  no such temptation came in his way.          For the time
he was left to the influence of his wife and his own better
nature, with the result of receiving a deeper and better im
press on his character from these two years abroad than from
his eight years in uniform.        Unconsciously he was sowing
seeds which would     in after years bear fruit of  a very different
kind.    Through art he first realized the advantage of a dis
tinctly intellectual   life over one of mere desultory gaiety.
It  was not art which was to furnish          his future stimulus,
and,  as  we shall find, it did not even suffice to keep him
from relapsing into some of his old ways when the tempta
tion came back again.        But his art-studies in Italy formed
the starting-point    of a new life for him, and led the way
to all the work and honours that were to come.

                          CHAPTER VI.
                    FIVE YEARS OF FOX-HUNTING.
     WHEN Murchison and his wife found themselves             in Eng
land again, two questions pressed upon them for immediate
solution   : Where were they to take up house     ?  and,  What were
they to do    ?   In  spite of Mrs. Murchison's      fortune, money
was not so     plentiful with them  as they wished.        The Tarra-
dale tenants, owing to more stringent         prohibition of illicit
distillation, found many excuses for evading the payment of
their rents,    so  that although the young couple          could live
 comfortably enough in Italy, there seemed some difficulty           in
 the way of their setting up. house at home in the style
to which they had all along been used.              The rent of the
property was at this time a little more than £500, but pro
 bably not more than about the half of that sum could be
 collected.      The   long-threatened   sale  was     therefore  now
 finally resolved upon, and in August           1818,    for £27,000,
 Baillie of Dochfour became the purchaser.               Immediately
 after his return from abroad       Murchison     went north alone
 to make the concluding arrangements,         and from that time
 ceased to be any longer a      Highland laird.

MM.]              BECOMES A FOX-HUNTER.                           89
       Having thus got rid of the troublesome tenants in the
north,     he had next to find a home somewhere         for his wife
and. himself.       Mrs. Murchison's grandfather, a veteran of the
Inlanders wars, had passed the last twenty years of his long
life    in an old mansion at Barnard Castle, in the county of
 Durham.         This house, now tenantless, was chosen, and there
 Murchison      set up his first manage  in England.
       The change from the pursuits and sights of Eome and
 Naples to the dulness of a little country town in the north
  of  England could not but prove a sore trial to the lately de
  veloped tastes of the retired Captain.    The old General, whose
  house they now occupied, had been a favourite in the district,
  and for his sake at first, and afterwards for their own, the
  new-comers had a hospitable reception from the county- folk
  of  the neighbourhood.      But receiving calls and paying them
  was hardly occupation enough         for any    reasonably active
  creature.     Art- studies  were  no longer possible;    his wife's
  gathering of plants and minerals had not yet sufficed to show
  him what a scientific pursuit really was      ; there seemed but
  one path of escape from insufferable ennui, and Murchison
  chose it.     He took heart and soul to field-sports, and became
   one   of the greatest fox-hunters in the north of England.
       For five years this desultory life lasted.    It seemed as   if
   the influence of the foreign tour had vanished, and left no
   sign.    At some  of the houses of the neighbourhood — Rokeby,
   for instance —guests distinguished for culture and literary or
   scientific eminence     used from time to time to be gathered,
   and   in these gatherings Murchison and his wife gladly took
   part.   They only just missed Sir Walter Scott.      They formed
   an   intimacy   with Sir Humphry Davy, and made the ac
   quaintance of other notabilities.     These were pleasant inter

ludes, and helped to vary a little the dulness of Barnard
Castle and the monotony of hunting.           But field-sports con
tinued to be the main business of life, since they furnished
the readiest outlet for that exuberant bodily activity which
had all along formed one of Murchison's          special character
istics.
     As  a diversion from these more ordinary and engrossing
pursuits, he on one occasion of a contested         election for the
county of Durham         took an active part on the Tory side,
scouring the country far and wide on horseback for voters,
 bringing them up to the poll     ;  but in the end beating an in
 glorious retreat with the unpopular candidate, amid showers
 of cabbages, rotten eggs, and other electioneering missiles.
 A  further variety was found in an occasional excursion to
 Scotland, or in visits to sporting friends in the north of
 England.
      It was not  without concern that Mrs. Murchison marked
this relapse into that purposeless kind of life from which her
 husband seemed for a time in a fair way of being weaned.
 She had some knowledge of botany, and had induced him in
 the course of their walks and excursions to assist her in form
 ing a herbarium.     But she could not make him a botanist.
 While residing in the north of England she took to the study
 of mineralogy, and made some progress            in collecting and
 distinguishing   some of the more common minerals found           in
 that part of the country.    Her husband looked on and helped
 her where he could    ;  but neither was mineralogy the kind of
 pursuit to enlist his sympathies, and call out his special
 powers.     "The noble science of fox-hunting,"         he says   of
  himself, " was then my dominant          passion, and as     I had
  acquired a little reputation      in the north  as a hard rider,  I

 resolved to play the great game, increase my stud, and settle
for   a year or two at Melton Mowbray, in Leicestershire."
      Instead of calming down, therefore,          the  hunting fever
broke      out with renewed virulence.        The migration south
 wards     duly took place, to the great mortification of his wife,
who had reason to dread the effects of the change both upon
his character and       his purse.    He rented a good house at
Melton Mowbray, kept eight hunters, a horse for his wife,
and a hack, and subscribed £50 a year to a pack of hounds.
"
  These and other expenses were," he says, " more than enough
for my means.        Thus   I was led to speculate by investing in
foreign funds, and obtain an income of £2000 per annum,
which, with occasional drafts upon my 'floating               capital,'
kept us going."
      He paid a visit to the north of Scotland in 1822, and
his arrival in Edinburgh        happened to coincide with that of
George      iv., whose   entrance  he witnessed from the        Calton
Hill, noting especially the beaming          face and white hair      of
Walter Scott      as  he marched jauntily along in front of the
royal carriage.
     Back at Melton, he recommenced          the earnest business of
the   winter by resuming his place at the hunt, and indulging
in further gaieties.1       The following reminiscences of this
time were written late in life : — " On Sundays, after six days'
hard work, we were         necessarily very sleepy,      and on one
occasion when the sermon was preached             for the Missionary
Society, and the parson went on to describe the life of the
savages to be Christianized      — hunting all   the week, and    lying
   1 By way of compromise, apparently, and in compliance with his wife's
more literary tastes, he kept his elaborate daily hunting journal this
winter (1822-3) in French.

92            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                           [ISSB.
exhausted and sleepy in their houses,                 — all the ladies'         eyes
were turned upon their drowsy mates."
     " On one occasion         I   gave a dinner, and invited Scotch
men only, viz., Elcho,             Graham (now Duke of Montrose),
Grant, Melville, etc. ; and          as   I could   find no blacksmith             to
singe the head,    I     performed myself in my own stable-yard,
to the great amusement of the groom and helpers."
     "  I
        was the only person who regularly smoked at the
covert- side, or when they went away, and the fox was lost.
On one of the latter occasions, and when Graham was cast
ing and re- casting his hounds, and was unable to hit off the
                               sulkily, 'Tis no use trying to do any
                                        '
scent, he hollowed out
thing when that                    pipe spoils the scent!'            So strong
was the feeling then against smoking as                   a bad and   ungentle-
manlike habit, that when Fernley painted a picture which
we, the subscribers to the pack, presented                  to Graham,      I   was
at first represented     on my brown horse                Commodore,    turning
my head round, with a cigar in my mouth.                       The cigar was
afterwards,   however, painted out.            The picture is at Norton
Conyers, in Yorkshire."
     Save gossip of this kind, with            full notes of his almost
daily hunts, and references to the companions with whom he
rode,   smoked, and dined, the visits which he and his wife
occasionally paid, and the people whom they met on such
occasions, no record       of these five hunting              years   has   been
preserved.1     There seems, indeed, to have been little else to
chronicle.    During the times of hard frost, when the usual

               journals gives a detailed narrative of every hunt from 3d
November 1821 to April 11, 1822, during which period he was 110 times
with the hounds. In his usual methodical sty he has constructed a table
                                                    li-
with columns, in which   is   entered the work done by each of the twelve
hunters which he used.

im]           THE FOX-HUNTING FEVER.                             93
out-of-door occupations were interrupted, he would take once
more to books.     On one of these occasions he seems to have
revived for a while his antiquarian tendencies by reading and
making extracts from Blunt's Vestiges of Ancient Manners
 and Customs   in Italy and Sicily.       But the books were ex
changed for the saddle when the weather suited again.
     The letters written during these fox-hunting years to his
brother Kenneth, then in the East Indies, abound with grave
moral sentences    on the duty of submission to our lot, and
the   necessity for economy and care when our means             are
small   !  Yet they teem with tender affection, and show their
writer to have had an earnest       love for his brother, with the
fullest interest in all that concerned him.         The solicitude
with which he appears       to have watched over a little niece
confided to his care and that of his wife, and the almost
fatherly delight with which he recounts all her ways and
her progress,   betoken great tenderness of heart, with much
considerate  feeling in the way of showing his kindness.
    His wife had from     the first  truly perceived that at bot
tom there lay in Murchison something more than the char
acter  of a mere Nimrod.     It was needful that his overflowing
animal spirits and bodily activity should find adequate outlet,
but she fully believed that when these parts of his nature
had   in some measure spent themselves,        the higher part of
his character would come to the surface.         If  he really had
any more intellectual tendencies       than were required for fox
hunting, he must needs in the end get tired of such unremit
ting application to that pursuit, and then those tendencies
would be sure to claim a hearing from him.              And so it
came to pass.

Murchison was sojourning for health's sake at the baths of
Marienbad,      in Bohemia, and penned there              the following
recollections of the events           which brought his fox-hunting
life to  a close  : —
     "
        As time rolled on           I got blasd and tired of all fox
hunting life.       In   the summer following      the hunting season
of 1822-3, when revisiting my old friend Morritt of Eokeby,
I fell  in with Sir Humphry Davy, and experienced much
gratification in bis lively illustrations of great physical truths.
As we shot partridges together in the morning,               I perceived
that a man might pursue philosophy without                   abandoning
field-sports;    and Davy,       seeing that  I had already made ob
servations on the Alps and Apennines,            independently of my
antiquarian rambles, encouraged me to come to London and
set to at science by attending lectures on chemistry, etc.              As
my wife naturally backed up this advice, and Sir Humphry
said he would soon get me into the Eoyal Society,                  I  was
fairly and easily booked.
     " Before   I took     the  step   of making myself a Cockney         I
sold my horses.        The two best were put up at auction in
the ensuing autumn, after dinner, at the Old Club at Melton,
and were brought into the room after a            jolly dinner, Maxse
acting   as auctioneer.       In  fact I threw them away,     and Maker

quiz on me for taking              so much of that    alkali after our
potations."
     The decision to sell his hunters and renounce the ex
pensive life at Melton was probably               dictated more by a
prudent     regard    to ways and means         than by any special
charms yet visible in the prospect of a life of scientific exer
tion.   At all   events we find, that when the       Melton establish

  ment was   broken up he did not immediately set up another,
  but went   to reside   for a time with his father-in-law.        The
  winter of 1823-4 was passed chiefly at Nursted House, and
 seems to   have slipt away without        much indication     that he
 had   resolved to change his main pursuits.            Were not the
 Hambledon hounds at hand, with old Parson Richards at
 their head, and Wyndham's           drove  pack careering     in close
 column up the steep faces of the downs          ?  Did not Up Park
 offer attractions  in its pheasant covers such      as few other pre
 serves  in England      could show     ?   Need we wonder, then,
that the necessity for a new horse became only too apparent            !
It  was but a low-priced hack-hunter         this time, yet a service
able animal,     which     carried its rider to probably      as  many
meets as took place that winter           within access of Nursted.
And not that winter only, but the summer following, went
past   without apparently any further action in the way of
carrying out the projected scientific programme.              We find
the retired sportsman sojourning for a long time          in the south
of Scotland during that summer,           visiting friends, shooting,
and   in short living   as  much after the old fashion    as if he had
never seen     Davy at Rokeby, and no visions of chemistry
lectures had ever floated before him.
      But the momentous epoch of his life was now fast ap
proaching.     This summer of 1824 saw the last of his rambles
wherein the rocks around him made no direct and urgent
appeal to him.       Henceforth    he was to have       an occupation
even more     absorbing than any which had yet held him in
thrall, and into this new employment he was to carry all
the energy which had hitherto marked his doings                in other
pursuits.

                         CHAPTER VII.
                    RISE OF GEOLOGY IN BRITAIN.
     AT last Murchison      had found   a calling wherein his love
of out-of-door life, and his inclination towards an intellec
tual employment of some sort, could find fitting scope.        From
this time forward it was to be his good fortune to have one
engrossing     occupation, which,     while furnishing     abundant
exercise and amusement,         should   ere long   enable   him to
make his name a kind of household word among geologists
in every part of the world.
    How it came about that      a man with no previous scientific
training   should have been able to gain such a reputation,
and gain     it  so  rapidly,  deserves   our consideration.     We
might conjecture either that the science could have been no
very recondite matter,      or that the man must have been pos
sessed of very extraordinary        powers.    Neither  supposition
would be quite just.      Such was the state of geological science
at the time, that a great work could be done by a man with
a quick    eye, a good judgment,      a clear notion   of what had
already been accomplished,       and a stout pair of legs.
     It is of importance that the reader should see how this

   HUTTONIAN AND WERNERIAN WARFARE.                                97
came to be the case,      in order that he may adequately realize
what Murchison's life-work actually was.            I would ask him,
therefore,    to accompany me       in a necessarily brief survey of
the    condition    of geology in this country during the first
quarter    of this century, with a glance at some of the
more    salient characteristics of the leading geologists     among
whom the retired captain and fox-hunter was now to take
his place.      "We  shall in this way be enabled to follow more
definitely the kind of work which lay open to his hand, and
to note what incentives and obstacles surrounded him on his
entry upon this new career.
      Looking back to the beginning of this century, we            see
 the geologists of    Britain divided into two hostile camps, who
 waged    against each other a keen and even an embittered
warfare.      On the one hand were the followers of Hutton
 of Edinburgh, called from him Huttonians,            sometimes   also
 Vulcanists or Plutonists       ;  on the other,    the disciples    of
 Werner of Freiberg, in Saxony, who went by the name of
                                                                        "
 Wernerians,      or Neptunists.     The strife lasted almost up to
 Murchison's      time, though    it had in its last    years  waxed
 faint and fitful.    But many of the combatants who had been
 in the thick of the fight were still alive when he assumed
 the title  of geologist,   and the current of geological thought
 at that time had been largely influenced by the contest.
     The Huttonians, who adhered to the principles laid down
  by their great founder, maintained, as their           fundamental
  doctrine, that the past history        of our planet is to be ex
  plained by what we can learn of the economy of nature at
  the present time.        Unlike the cosmogonists,     they did not
  trouble themselves with what was the first condition of the
  earth, nor   try to trace every subsequent phase of its history.

 They held that the geological record does not go back to the
 beginning, and that therefore any attempt to trace      that be
 ginning from geological evidence was vain.       Most strongly,
 too, did they protest against the introduction of causes   which
 could not be shown to be a part of the present economy.
 They never wearied of insisting, that to the every- day work
 ings of Air, Earth, and Sea must be our appeal for an expla
 nation of the older revolutions of the globe.   The fall of rain,
 the flow of rivers, the dash of waves, the slowly-crumbling
 decay of mountain, valley, and shore, were one by one sum
 moned    as  witnesses to bear testimony to the manner         in
 which   the  most stupendous geological changes are slowly
 and silently brought about.     The waste of the land, which
 they traced everywhere, was found to give birth to soil —
 renovation of the surface thus springing Phcenix-like out      of
 its decay.   In  the descent of water from the clouds to the
 mountains, and from the mountains to the       sea,  they recog-
'nised the power by which valleys are carved out of the
 land, and by which also the materials worn from the land
 are carried out to the sea,   there  to be gathered into    solid
 stone — the framework of new continents.       In   the rocks  of
 the hills and valleys they recognised abundantly the traces
 of old sea- bottoms.   They stoutly maintained that these old
 sea-bottoms   had been raised up into dry land from time to
 time by the powerful action of the same internal         heat to
 which volcanoes owe their birth, and they pointed to the
 way in which granite and other crystalline rocks occur as
 convincing evidence    of the extent to which the solid earth
 had been altered and upheaved by the action       of these sub
 terranean fires.

embracing so wide a view of the whole field of inorganic
nature, should be imperfect      ; that the full meaning of parts of
it should not even have been suspected by its founder          ; that
some    of its details should have been built upon erroneous ob
servations or deductions, may be readily believed.         The most
obvious imperfection about the theory was, that it took no
account of the fossil remains of plants and animals.        Hence it
ignored the long succession of life upon the earth, which those
remains have since made known, as well as the evidence
thereby obtainable       as to  the nature and order of physical
changes,     such as alternations of land and    sea, revolutions of
climate, and such-like.        But though the discovery of these
profoundly significant truths opened up a world of research
of which neither Hutton nor his friends had ever dreamed,
it did   not overturn what he had done.          He had laid down
principles     which, in so far     as they went, were true, and
which the experience of successive generations           has  amply
illustrated and confirmed.         He had traced a bold outline
which has been gradually filled in, but his master lines are
traceable still.     The whole of modern geology bears witness
to the influence of the Huttonian school.
     It  was while views     of this broad and suggestive     nature
were making way in this country, that others of a very differ
ent stamp came over from Germany.             Werner at that time
was teaching mineralogy at Freiberg, but he aspired to con
nect his science with a wide subject, and from the study of
minerals to rise to the origin of the globe itself.          He had
not travelled.     He had seen only a small corner of Europe,
and having satisfied himself of the order and history of the
rocks in that limited district, he proceeded to account for
the formation of the various rocks of the rest of -the qlobe

       on the model of his own little kingdom.           Instead of starting
       from what can be seen and known             as to nature's    operations
       at the present time, Werner, like other cosmogonists,              con
       ceived himself bound to begin at the beginning.                He sup
       posed that the earth had been originally            covered    with the
       ocean,   in which the materials of the minerals were dissolved.
       Out of this ocean he conceived that the various rocks were
       precipitated in the same order in which he found those                of
       Saxony to lie   ;   hence, on the retirement of the ocean, certain
       universal formations spread over all the globe, and assumed
       at the surface various irregular shapes as they consolidated.
             Werner was     a good   mineralogist, and, as he classed rocks
       by their mineral        characters,     there was a certain neatness
       and precision about his system,          and a facility of applying   it
       in other countries, such        as no   previous cosmological theory
       could boast.        Moreover,   as    men were mineralogists before
       geology came into existence, and as the general mineralogical
       bias   still prevailed, the doctrines of Werner, so largely based
       on mineralogical considerations, had a great advantage                in
       the readiness       with which they might be expected             to be
       adopted.     But, besides this, although his views about uni
       versal formations and the aqueous origin of all rocks — even
       of basalt — were quite erroneous, he had grasped part of a
       great truth in his chronological grouping of strata.                  He
       had likewise noticed, as indeed had been already to some
       extent recognised by observers both in France and Germany,
       that the remains of plants            and animals imbedded in the
       strata became        fewer in number, and more          unlike living
       forms, the older the rocks            in which they occur.         Even,

bably have made        a way for themselves        in Europe.      But his
ardour kindled a like spirit in those who came to listen to
him.      They returned      to their own homes          eager to apply,
even in the most distant corners of the globe, the system
which had been made so clear to them at Freiberg.                      They
had at heart not only the cause of truth, but the fame of an
eloquent teacher and friend, so that their course, at least in
this country, became       a kind of propagandism.
      It  is hardly possible now to realize how fierce and per
sonal was the Huttonian and Wernerian war.                  Hutton him
self had lived and died in Edinburgh.             The crags and ravines
of that romantic town had inspired him with some of his
views, and, after he had gone, these features               remained as
memorials of his teaching, to friends who loved and followers
who revered him.          Edinburgh     was naturally      therefore the
home of the Huttonian theory.          It so   happened, however, that
in the year 1804 the Professorship of Natural History was
given to Robert Jameson, — a student from Freiberg, full of
the true Wernerian ardour.         He was not long in office before
he began to gather round him a band of disciples               ; and thus
Edinburgh became a chief focus of the geological              war.1

armour.      Such was the illustrious Playfair — a man to whom
geologists     owe a debt      of gratitude which has perhaps never
yet been adequately paid.                 Button had passed away, his
work unfinished, and the style of his writings so obscure as
to set a barrier to the general diffusion which their genius
merited.       Playfair, who was his warm personal friend, de
termined to prevent the risk of such doctrines as those                          of
Hutton sinking into neglect, and to that end composed,
and,   in the spring of 1802, published his Illustrations of the
Huttonian Theory.
      This great work may be taken                  as  the text-book of the
Huttonian school.            It   contains not only the views taught
by Hutton himself, but the expansion and application                             of
them by Playfair.             Gifted with an eloquence                which, for
dignity, precision, and elegance, reminds us of some of the
best old French models, and which has certainly never since
been equalled in the geological literature of this country,
 Playfair not only gained for the doctrines of his master a
publicity and measure of acceptance                    which they might not
otherwise have attained, but he raised geology out of the
region of mere wild speculation, and placed it in                    a^   honour
 able position among the inductive sciences.                     The  JOG!  rise of
 geology in this country into the dignity of a                        u \ence,    is
 traceable mainly to the influence of the Illustrations                     of  the
 Huttonian Theory.1

 warm   and   graceful  tribute  to his  influence,  with  a   frank recognition of
 the obligations  of geologists  to his labours  in  their service, was  then given

cognised.      The very principles of geology were still matter
of discussion.       These would      doubtless have      been   sooner
settled but for the baneful influence of "Wernerianism,             and
the check given by that system to the development of the
views of Hutton and Playfair.           Still it must in fairness    be
acknowledged, that Wernerianism           introduced a more precise
mineralogy and petrography than had ever been known be
fore, and that though this was at the best but a poor sub
stitute   for the earlier growth of sound geology,           it was an
advantage,     the  loss   of which, when it died out with that
system, has in one not unimportant branch crippled British
 geology ever since.
     In  the midst of this ferment of conflicting theories, a few
 men interested in inquiries       as  to the nature and origin of
minerals     and rocks, drew together in London            in the year
 1807, and formed themselves into the Geological Society.
 A  further reference    to this important event      will  be made   in
the next Chapter, when we come to the time when Murchison
joined the Society.       In  the meantime we may note         that the
aim of the founders was to gather facts         as to the  composition
 and structure    of the earth without reference to questions of
theory.     With this view they met at short intervals          to read
 papers   on the rocks or minerals of particular species, or of
 special districts, and every few years gathered the more im
portant of these papers into a large quarto volume of Trans
actions.     During the early days of its existence the Society
devoted    itself with praiseworthy diligence to questions of
mineralogy, or of the geological structure of different loca
lities.   The members hardly ever meddled with the remains
of the plants and animals imbedded in the rocks.            That these
remains had a deep meaning, that they were to furnish the

key which would make         it  easy to group the rocks of    Eng
land in their order of formation, and that they contained the
records of a marvellous march of life upon the earth, had        not
yet dawned upon the minds of any of these early pioneers.
    While the acknowledged leaders of the infant science of
geology were on the one hand wrangling as to the principles
to be adopted,     and, on the other hand, busying themselves
with the collection and discussion of details of no great
moment,     a  man had been quietly and unobserved at work
for long years among the rocks of England,          and had learned
their secret as none else had done.           Born in Oxfordshire,
William Smith had been used in childhood to collect and
wonder over the fossils       so  abundant round his birthplace.
In   later years, trained to the profession of civil engineer
and land-surveyor, he had recognised his early playthings          in
far distant parts of the country.       Step by step he was led to
perceive,  in a far more precise and accurate way than had
been thought of by Werner          or any previous observer, that
each group of strata had its own characteristic fossils.          By
this test he could recognise     a series of rocks all the way from
the coasts of Dorset to those of Yorkshire.            He surprised
some    of his friends who had made           collections  of fossils
by telling them from what special set of rocks each series
of shells had been obtained.           He constructed, and    as  far
back    as 1799 began     to publish, geological maps of various
parts of England, on which the different groups of rocks
which he had made up were delineated with singular accu
racy.     At agricultural   meetings,    and to any inquirer     who
 wished to    see them,  he exhibited these maps, showing more
 particularly   their value in questions of farming and water-
 supply.     He had tried to find patrons, with whose help he

map, and of the other works which he issued in succession,
his ideas had spread widely through the country.                Hence
when these marvellous productions were published, they met
with immediate acceptance.        They completely revolutionized
the geology of the day, and called forth from his contem
poraries the most unqualified praise,        and the well-merited
title of the Father of English Geology.        It   was now possible
to arrange the rocks of the country       in definite chronological
order, to compare those of one district      with those of another,
to trace the connexion of the varying character of the strata
underneath with the change of soils and the rise of springs.
But, above all, William       Smith's discoveries led the way to
all that has since been done iu tracing back the history of
Life into the dim past.        He was not himself       a   naturalist,
but he laid that sure foundation on which our knowledge is
built of the grand succession         of living beings upon the
surface of our planet.
    From the prodigious impetus given by these revelations
Geology made a new start in England,                and branched out
especially in two directions, which have continued up to the
present time to be the paths chiefly followed by geologists          in
this country.   In the first   place, what is called Stratigraphical
geology, that   is,   the accurate grouping of the rocks according
to their order of formation, took its rise from the work             of
William Smith.         Before his day no means existed of making
any such subdivision beyond the vague general distinctions
implied in such terms as Primary, Transition, and Secondary.

 106           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
In  the second place, from the attention now given to fossils
as a key to the discrimination    of rocks, the science of Palaeon
tology, or the study of ancient forms of life, first took root
in England.      It is true that the researches of Cuvier among
the extinct mammals of the Paris basin, and his clear and
eloquent writings, as well as the labours of Brongniart, had
drawn the eyes of the world to the interest attaching to
fossil remains.     These discoveries undoubtedly laid the foun
dations of Palaeontology.       They were     not made,     however,
until after Smith's views, unpublished          indeed,   but freely
communicated, had began to spread            in this country, and
until consequently the minds of geologists            were   in some
degree prepared for them by learning          that  a  new meaning
and value had begun to be discernible        in the remains of the
plants and animals imbedded in the rocks.
     At  the same time that this new development        of geological
inquiry took place, certain other changes           came    about  in
England.      Foremost among these was the decay of Minera
logy and Petrography, or Mineralogical geology.          Men found
such   a great  untrodden field opening out before them, that
they forsook the old and well-beaten paths of mineralogy.
Neglecting the study of minerals, they left off also that of
the mineralogical      composition of rocks.       For somewhere
about half a century these branches of geology remained
scarcely cultivated at all in this country, and only within
the last few years have     some   of our geologists wakened up
to the fact, that in this department of their science            they
have been far outstripped by their brethren         of the hammer
in Germany and in France.
     So strongly did the tide now set in towards stratigraphical
 and palaeontological   pursuits, that another not less important

          SIR JAMES HALL AND HIS WORK.                                 107
branch    of geological research, which had been begun with
much promise, fell into neglect — the application of physical
experiment     to the elucidation of geological problems.              The
merit of having started this line of investigation belongs to
the Huttonian school.          Among       Button's friends and ad
mirers was Sir James Hall of Dunglass — a man of singular
shrewdness, with a strong bent towards putting                  things to
the test of experiment, and an inventive faculty of no com
mon order.       He had urged Hutton to apply this test to
some of hiarviews which had been most keenly controverted.
That philosopher, however, had a deep conviction that as
we could never hope to imitate the scale of nature's opera
tions, so we might run a great risk of having false impres
sions given to our minds by such experiments.                   He seems
to have had a kind of contempt for those who "judge of the
great operations of the mineral kingdom from having kindled
                                                                   1
a fire and looked into the bottom of a little crucible."
     Hall, though, from deference to his master, he generously
refrained from putting        his ideas into practice during the
lifetime of the latter, felt sure that some parts of the Hut
tonian Theory could be proved or disproved by simple ex
periments.2     After Hutton     's death a series    of trials, memor
able as the   birth of Experimental Geology, proved the truth
of his surmise,     adding, at the same time, to the stability
of Hutton's views and the fame of the Scottish School of
Geology.     During the first quarter of this century he pub
lished at intervals a series of admirable papers in the Trans
actions of the Eoyal Society of Edinburgh on such questions
as the igneous    origin of basalt-rocks, the formation of marble

    and crystalline limestone, the contortion of the earth's crust,
    etc.     But the vitality of the geological school in that capital
    was gone.        No one followed up the path opened by Hall,
    and men were too busy elsewhere              in making out the order
    of the rocks and the succession of the fossils to have time
    or inclination for theoretical questions.
           Another change of import in the history of the time
/   succeeding the         publications    of William      Smith,        was     the
    gradual decline and extinction           of Wernerianism.            Even at
    its stronghold        in Edinburgh it had been waning.                     Two
    months       after the    founding     of the Geological           Society    of
    London,      Jameson      had started     the    Wernerian         Society    in
    Edinburgh — a Society which continued for many years,                         in
    spite of its name, to do much excellent                work in various
    departments of natural history.             Its founder had           come to
    be regarded      as   the avowed leader of the Wernerians of this
    country.      He had one great advantage           over his opponents.
    Accurate      mineralogical     knowledge       enabled him to discri
    minate rocks with a precision to which they could make no
    pretension, and        although this      was   an accomplishment             of
    little real moment in the theoretical questions chiefly in
    dispute, he did not fail to make the most of                 it,   nor they to
    betray their consciousness        of their inferiority in that respect.
    In     the end, however,     Jameson     and his band of co-believers
    in Werner came to be gradually isolated on the rocks of
    Edinburgh       with an ever-rising flood of the dominant geology
    around them.          There they stood, battling        as    well    as   they
    might with the inevitable, until at last Jameson frankly
    acknowledged, at one of the evening discussions of the Royal
    Society, that Wernerianism           was doomed and deserved to die.1

      It  had been one of the characteristics of Werner's system
to ignore, or at least to neglect, volcanoes and volcanic action.
There were no volcanoes              in that little kingdom which he
had taken as the model of the globe.                The neglect was par
donable perhaps in his          case,  but when his votaries, in travel
ling over the world met face to face with only too manifest
proofs of the vitality of the internal heat of the earth, they
had recourse to every possible explanation               — the combustion
of subterranean beds of coal, or indeed any supposition that
would depreciate the importance of volcanoes                  as parts of the
general economy of the world.                   They almost seemed to
 regard volcanoes with dislike as anomalous interferences with
 the normal constitution         of things.      They denied the igneous
 origin of such rocks         as basalt,  even though their opponents
 proved that rocks of precisely similar character had often
 been seen flowing       in a melted state down the sides of volcanoes.
 Excellent service had been done in exposing the absurdity of
 these notions by Desmarest,              Montlosier,     Faujas   St. Fond,
 and other geologists         on the Continent,       and   in this country
 by Macculloch, Boue', and others, but by none more signally
 than by Mr. Poulett Scrope in his admirable memoirs on the
 volcanic      districts   of Naples and Central France, and his
  work on Volcanoes.1           Though the British Islands abound in
  Robert   Chriatison,  and by Professor   Balfour,   who were present at the
  Royal Society of Edinburgh when it took      place.  It has not been possible
  to recover the date of the meeting.
     1 Mr.
            Scrope, to whose cordial friendship it is a pleasure to record my
  obligations, has furnished me with the following reminiscence of this early
  geological controversy : — I well recollect, on a discussion arising at the
                              "
  Geological Society meeting, after the reading of a paper of mine on the
  Auvergne volcanoes, Greenough's arguing that the cinder-cones might be
  volcanic, but that the plateaux of basalt that adjoined them were cer
  tainly precipitations from the archaic ocean of Werner.         In my reply
  I got the laugh in my favour by putting to him whether, if he found

110            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
old volcanic rocks of many ages, even the stimulus                      of the
success of these observers            was not enough to divert           a few
able observers     from the general drift of English geology
into    the   channels already indicated.            Another      generation
had to arise before     the volcanic history of Britain began to
attract serious notice.
       But of the changes which followed the rise and rapid
development of stratigraphical            geology and paleeontology             in
England, perhaps the most regrettable was the neglect                           of
what is now termed          Physiographical      Geology — that          is,   the
study of the origin of the present external features                    of the
land.      Button and Playfair were full of this subject.                They
refused to admit of hypothetical           revolutions, but steadfastly
insisted on explaining the changes of the past by the same
kinds of action which may still be seen at work.                        Never
theless,   though they directed attention             so     forcibly   to the
every-day changes of the earth's surface, their teaching did
not displace the more sensational hypotheses of catastrophe
and convulsion.        It   was reserved       for   a   foreign scientific
Society to recall the thoughts of men to the revolutions
which the land had undergone within the time of human
chronicles, and for the illustrious          Von Hoff to gather the
historical evidence    of these revolutions1         —   a   task which has
since been so    worthily followed up and extended by Lyell.

             ORIGIN OF VALLEYS AND HILLS.                             Ill
       While dwelling on ordinary and familiar agents of change,
 the Scottish philosophers found in these the explanation of
 the origin of much of the scenery of the land.         They delighted
 to trace the origin of valleys, the sculpturing         of mountains,
 and the gradual evolution of the various features of a land
 scape.     They attributed these irregularities of surface to the
action of rain and streams upon masses of land upheaved above
 the  sea ; — an  idea which was deemed too bold even by many
 of their boldest followers, such     as   Hall, and which fell into
 comparative oblivion.         It was   noticed in text-books and
 treatises only to be dismissed as extravagant.         In its place the
 notion prevailed that to subterranean action we must mainly
 attribute the present inequalities of the land — a notion which
has been prevalent       until within the last few years, when the
rising generation of geologists has begun to recognise the true
meaning and place of the Huttonian doctrine.              We shall find
that Sir Roderick Murchison up to the close of his life battled
for the supremacy of the underground forces in the modelling
of the surface of the land.        And yet he had read the lucid
observations and arguments         of Mr. Poulett      Scrope,   written
so far back as 1822, to prove how valleys in central France
had been cut out by running          water   ;
                                               — nay,  as we shall see,
one of his earliest geological tours abroad           was to this very
region, where he became           convinced of the truth         of Mr.
Scrope's views, though the conversion proved to be only a
transient one.
     In fine,  the first quarter of the present century was a time
of marvellous vigour in the history of geology.          It was during
This work was begun as a prize-essay written in response to an invitation

published in 1822.

112           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
that time that the science took shape and dignity.             Amid
the conflict of opposing schools         progress   had been steady
and rapid.     Every year broadened        the base on which      the
infant science was being built up.           The rocks of England
and Wales were arranged in their order of           age, the outlines
traced by Smith having been more and more filled in.             Ex
cellent service had been done by the admirable handbook             of
Conybeare and Phillips, while Boue, Jameson, Macculloch,
and others,    had made known         the rocks of large tracts     of
Scotland.     But a vast deal remained to be accomplished.
The field was still in      a sense   newly discovered, it stretched
over a wide area, and lay open to any one who with active
feet, good eyes, and shrewd head          chose   to enter it.   And
the enthusiasm of those who were already at work within
its borders   sufficed   not only to inspirit their own labours,
but to attract and stimulate other fellow-workers from the
 outer world.
     From the foregoing rapid survey of the progress of geology
during the first quarter of this century we can see the pro
bable line of inquiry which any young Englishman               would
then be likely to take who entered upon the pursuit of the
 science without being gradually led up to it by previous and
 special studies.    In  the first place, he would almost certainly
 be a Huttonian,    though doubtless holding some of Button's
 views with a difference.       He would hardly be likely to show
 much sympathy with the fading dogmas of the Wernerians.
      In the   second    place, he would     probably depart widely
 from one aspect of the original Huttonian school in avoiding
 theoretical questions,      and sticking, possibly with even too
 great pertinacity,    to the observation and        accumulation   of
 facts.

      OPENING OF HIS GEOLOGICAL                      CAREER.         113
      In  the  third place, he would most likely have no taste
 for experimental research as elucidating geological questions,
and might        set little store by the contributions        made    by
physicists to the solution of problems in his science.
      In  the fourth place, he would almost certainly be igno
rant    of mineralogy, and whenever his work lay among
 crystalline rocks it would be sure to bear witness to this
ignorance.
     In  the fifth place, devoting himself      to what lies beneath
the surface as the true end and aim         of geology, he would be
 apt to    neglect the study of the external features            of the
 land.    And this neglect might lead him in the end to form
 most erroneous views as to the origin of these features.
      Lastly, his main geological idea would           probably be to
make out the order       of succession among the rocks of his own
country, to collect       their fossils, unravel their complicated
structure,    and gather materials for comparing them with the
rocks of other countries.         In a word, he would     in all likeli
hood    drift with the prevailing current of geological inquiry
at the time, and become a stratigraphical geologist.
     There    was no reason        in Murchison's   case    why these
influences of the day should not mould the whole character
of his scientific life.     We shall trace in the records of later
years   how thoroughly        they did so.     As he started, so he
continued up to the end, manifesting throughout             his career
the  permanent sway of the circumstances under which he
broke   ground    as a geologist.
     At first the novelty   and fascination  of the pursuit engaged
his  attention.      Many   a  time on his walking      and hunting
expeditions     he had noticed marine shells far inland.            He
now    found out that such shells         formed,   as  it were, the

alphabet of a new language,         and  that by their means      he
might decipher for himself the history of the rocks with
whose external forms he was       so familiar.  He threw himself
into  the   study with all his usual       ardour,   and   ere  long
became    as   enthusiastic with his hammer over down and
shore as he had been      with his pencil and note-book among
the galleries of   Italy, or with his hunting-whip or his gun
across the moors of Durham.
     Of  the men     on whom the progress      of geology mainly
depended      at the time when       Murchison    joined   them to
become their life-long associate and friend, something should
be said here.     Some of the band of enthusiasts by whom the
Geological Society of London was originated still lived, and
took an active share in the Society's work.           Among    them
were Greenough, the true founder and first president of the
Society — amiable,     yet   shy,  and somewhat       hesitating  in
manner,    full of all kinds of miscellaneous knowledge, obsti
nately sceptical of new opinions, a kind of staunch geolo
gical Tory, and playing      the part of objector-general at the
evening discussions ; and Babington, a kindly, bland, and
courteous    veteran, who, well versed   in the mineralogy of his
time, had gathered at his house the few like-minded friends
from whom the Geological Society sprang, who introduced the
practice of discussing the papers read at the meetings,          and
who even when nearly fourscore years of age found a con
genial occupation in the Society's museum.             Other names
which    had long been associated       with the progress     of the
Society still had an honoured place on its list.         Such were
those of Wollaston    — admirable    mineralogist, sternly upright
in his search for truth, quiet, reserved, serious, looking like a
 Greek  sage, and    deservedly regarded   as a  general arbiter   in
the scientific world of London, yet, to those who were privi-

its members most excellent service.

contemporaries.      Such were      Whewell,    Herschel, C. Stokes,
Babbage, Webster, Lonsdale,         Sir Philip Egerton, the Earl of
Enniskillen (then Viscount Cole), and others, most of whom
have passed away.          Some of these men became intimate
personal friends of the subject of this biography, and their
names    will  therefore    appear  frequently    in the subsequent
chapters.

                       CHAPTER         VIIL
            FIRST YEABS OF SCIENTIFIC LIFE AT HOME.
     WE return to Murchison's career.           He had now fairly
resolved to cast   in his lot with the men of science.     Bringing
his wife with him from Nursted, he came up to London, and
rented   the house No.     1 Montague Place, Montague Square.
There, settling down to a much more serious employment
than any he had yet undertaken, he entered          upon his new
life full of ardour and hope.
     " If in the last
                        years of my fox-hunting,"      he says, " I
began to   sniff up a little scientific knowledge, and showed a
willingness to turn my former rambles among the Alps and
Apennines to some profit,      it was only   in the winter of 1824
that  I  buckled resolutely to the study of chemistry and the
cognate subjects by attending Brando's early morning lectures
at the Royal    Institution.   This I  did by the advice of Sir H.
Davy as a necessary       preliminary.     From this moment, all
horses except a pair for my wife's carriage being dismissed,
I  got quite into another and to me an entirely new phase
of society.    My note-books chiefly       refer, however,   to the
geological lectures, and before the spring came          I  became

118              SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
acquainted, through books and lectures, with the chief phe
nomena of British geology.              Though     chemistry never had
strong attractions for me,        I kept regular notes      of the lectures
on its various branches,         and, at the end of my course,           knew
as much about that science             as  was necessary       for a field-
               1
geologist."
      In  later years he used to recall with no little pleasure an
incident in that course of lectures.            One day Dr. Brande did
not lecture, and his place was taken by his assistant — a
pale thin lad, who began with some timidity,                 but gathering
courage      as he went on, soon proved himself to be an ad
mirable lecturer, and received from his delighted audience a
hearty round of applause.            It was Michael Faraday.*
      From the Royal Institution lectures the transition                    was
easy to the papers          and debates to be heard         in those little
rooms    in Bedford Street, Covent Garden, where the Geological
Society then held its meetings.              We have in the preceding
chapter noticed the place which the creation of this Society
fills in the history of geological science in this country.
 Some further        details of a more personal kind may here be
 given, partly because the men who started the Society were
 in great measure still living and active members of it when
 Murchison       joined them,      partly because        Murchison's       own
 scientific career was closely bound up with the subsequent
 history of the Society, and partly because the work done by
    1 These notes, which still exist, show a vast deal of
                                                              diligence, and a
 very fair amount of knowledge.          They   seem  to  have  been carefully
 written out from day to day, and with equal fulness, whether the subject
 of the lectures was the composition of beef or tbe properties of oxygen.
    s In telling this story to the writer only a few months before his death,
 Murchison said it was Faraday's first lecture.       A comparison of dates,
 however, shows that his memory had been at fault, for Faraday had
 already gained a reputation      as experimenter   and original    investigator
 before this time.

  iso-.J             THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY.                                   119
 the Society, and its influence upon the progress                          of the
 science,     have been so great that they claim grateful recog
 nition, and deserve adequate              record in any work which pro
 fesses to sketch, even          in outline, the growth of a portion of
 British geology.
       At the beginning of this century original                    research     in
 natural science          was promoted        in London by two Societies,
 the Eoyal and the Linnean.                  Next in order of time came
 the Geological          Society, which        took its origin,      as   already
 mentioned,         in    1807,    and     under    the   following       circum
 stances    i1 —
       " Count de Bournon had written an elaborate
                                                                    monograph
 on carbonate of lime, and, in order to raise funds for its pub
 lication,     Dr. Babington        invited     to his   house    a number       of
 gentlemen         distinguished       for   their   zeal   in mineralogical
knowledge, when a subscription-list                   was opened,        and   the
necessary sum was collected.                 Other meetings of the same
gentlemen took place for friendly                  intercourse, and it was
then proposed           to form a Geological          Society.     On Novem
ber    13,  1807, a meeting was held at the Freemasons' Tavern,
Great Queen Street, at which resolutions were passed formally
constituting        the Society.        Only eleven gentlemen were pre
sent, and their names             deserve to be recorded.           They were

                                                          Society written by one
of its Fellows, Mr. W. S. Mitchell, just previous to its recent change of
quarters to Burlington House, and published in The Hour of November
5th, 1873.      It is the only narrative which has been published of the early
struggles of the Society.      Compiled from the minute-books of the Society,
it  presents a reliable account of events which must always have an interest
for English geologists.

120           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
Knight,   J. Laird, M.D.,  J. Parkinson,   Eichard Phillips.    Two
other supporters of the scheme, W. H. Pepys and             William
Phillips, were unavoidably       prevented from attending         the
meeting, but their names were added to the list.          The   thir
teen names were read out, and these gentlemen            constituted
themselves    the first members   of the Geological Society, with
the resolution,  —'   That there be forthwith instituted a Geo
logical Society for the purpose of making geologists acquainted
with each other, of stimulating their zeal, of inducing them
to adopt one nomenclature, of facilitating the communication
of new facts, and of ascertaining what is known in their
science, and what remains to be discovered.'
     " The customs of the new association were such that            it
would    now be called a Club rather than a Society.             The
members were to meet on the first        Friday of every month at
five o'clock, at the Freemasons'    Tavern, for a fifteen shilling
dinner.     Business was to commence         at seven o'clock,   and
the chairman was to leave the chair at nine."
     After drawing up rules and other initial formalities, in
cluding the election of a Patron (Right Honourable Charles
F. Greville, F.R.S.) and a President (G. B. Greenough, M.P.,
 F.R.S.), the members, in accordance with one of their laws,
set themselves    to work  in " contributing to the advancement
of geological science, more particularly        as  connected   with
the mineral history of the earth."       Their numbers increased,
 and among their early adherents       they could count even the
President of the Royal Society, who requested admission into
their ranks.    Specimens of minerals were presented to them
with such liberality that within a year the idea took definite
shape of securing some permanent place           for the collections
and meetings of the Society.        Accordingly, in 1809, rooms

    HISTORY OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY.                        121
were obtained at No. 4 Garden Court, Temple, and there the
infant Society was enabled first to erect its household gods.
But this step, so indicative of independence and activity,
soon led to serious troubles.
     " The
            Society reckoned among its members many who
were Fellows of the Eoyal Society, and so long       as it aimed
at nothing more than dining once a month and discussing
geological subjects, there was nothing to which the Fellows
of the Royal Society could raise any objection.      But  as soon
as a separate habitation was proposed,  with a separate collec
tion of specimens, it was at once objected that the dignity of
the Royal Society would be impaired.       At  the meeting on
March    3 (1809), Sir Joseph Banks sent in his resignation,
and soon after a proposal was made by the Patron, the Right
Hoa Charles Greville,      to make the Geological     Society an
assistant association to the Royal Society.   The drift of the
plan was, that the Geological Society should consist of two
classes of members — (1.) those who were Fellows of the
Royal Society, and (2.) those who were not.     That all papers
should be sent to the Royal Society for them to select what
they liked for publication, and that the Geological Society
should be at liberty to publish the rejected     papers   if they
wished.     A  special meeting to consider this proposal was
held at the Freemasons'      Tavern  on March    10,   when this
 resolution was passed   : — That any proposition tending to
                             '
render this Society dependent      upon or subservient to any
other Society does not correspond with the conception this
meeting entertains of the original principles upon which the
 Geological Society was founded.'     The proposal was decided
 to be inadmissible, and it was pointed out that it was never
 intended to impose any obligations on members of the Geo

logical Society inconsistent with their allegiance to the Royal
Society.      Mr. Greville sent in his resignation as Patron, but
the firmness shown by a few of the promoters of the Society
secured for     it freedom and independence of action,"
     This vigorous action no doubt helped to strengthen the
Society both in numbers and in influence.             Even so early as
 1810 the first habitation at the Temple was found too small,
and the chattels of the Society were          in that year transferred
to No.   3   Lincoln's   Inn Fields.    Further evidence of vigour
was shown        by the fact that the papers read at the meetings
began     in 1811 to be published in quarto volumes of the
massive orthodox size, and with wealth of margin and illus
trations.      After six years of great        activity,   the   need  for
 further    space    again became     urgent.      Another     migration
 took place, the rooms selected being at No. 20 Bedford Street,
 Covent Garden.          For twelve years, that is from 1816 to
 1828, the Society continued         to hold    its meetings in that
 building.      It  was  while there that    "in    1825 a Charter      of
 Incorporation       was applied for and obtained from George IV.,
 the date    of affixing the royal seal being April          23,  'in the
 sixth year of our reign.'       The five members named in the
 charter were, — W. Buckland,         Arthur Aikin, John Bostock,
 G. Bellas Greenough, and Henry Warburton.                 Dr. Buckland
 was by the charter appointed first President."
      The Geological Society of London " was, in its early days,"
 to quote the words of one of its former most distinguished
               "
 members,         composed of robust, joyous, and independent
 spirits, who toiled well in the field, and did battle and cuffed
 opinions with much spirit and great good           will ;  for they had
 one great object before      them — the promotion of true know
 ledge  — and not one of them was deeply committed to any

  system     of opinions."     The same writer boasts of " the joyous
  meetings,      and of the generous,        unselfish, and truth-loving
 spirit that glowed throughout the whole body." l
      It   was into this pleasant gathering of enthusiasts that
  Murchison found his way in the winter of 1824-25.                           "  I
 entered the Society," he says, " Professor Buckland of Oxford
 being President, and on the 7th of January took my seat,
 and had my hand shaken by that remarkable man, who was
 then giving such an impulse to our new science, and was of
 course      my idol.     One of the honorary secretaries,                then a
 young lawyer, was Charles Lyell, who then read his first
 paper,      on the marl-lake       at Kinnordy, in Forfarshire,             the
 property of his father.
      "
        Among my scientific friends          I was of course        most proud
 to reckon Dr. Wollaston,          who then and in subsequent years
invariably took pains to make me understand the true
method of searching after new facts, and often corrected my
slips and mistakes.
      "  I  also owed     great obligation to       Mr. Thomas Webster.
His acquaintance with minerals             and ores, as    well as with fossil
animal remains, and his well-composed descriptions, were
strikingly illustrated by his great powers               as an   artist.    Born
in the Shetland Isles, and           there receiving a good education,
Webster had never seen in that region a tree higher than                        a
bush, so that in coming southwards,              as he     told me, he never
could forget the astonishment and admiration he felt, when
on reaching the valley of Berriedale, on the borders of Suther
land, he for the first time saw true forest-trees.             Before these he
kneeled down,        as true  a worshipper as Linnaeus when he first
beheld in England the yellow blossom of our common furze.

     "
        Sedgwick, Whewell,          Peacock, Babbage,        Herschel, and
all the eminent Cantabs of the time, came flocking in con
tinually to our scientific assemblies.             From his buoyant and
cheerful nature,         as   well as  from his flow of soul and elo
quence, Sedgwick at once won my heart,                    and a year only
was destined to elapse before we became                    coadjutors    in  a
survey of the Highlands,           and afterwards of various parts of
the Continent."
     To show further the contrast between                his employments
in London and his amusements during previous winters in
the country, it may be well to note that he not merely made
a good many acquaintances             among     scientific people, but be
came a personal friend of not a few men who then or after
wards stood in the foremost              ranks of literature.        He met
Thomas        Moore,       Hallam,   Copley     (Lord    Lyndhurst),     Lord
Dudley, and others, who used to frequent the                soire'es of Miss

round her the intellect and taste of London society.1

don life a very different thing to him from what                 it had been
in the old days when he used to escape to town from the
monotony of a country barrack.                   With his characteristic
ardour, he had not completed his first winter's studies before
he longed to be off into the field to observe for himself.

  lessor Buckland,    who having taken a fancy to me as one of
 his apt scholars, invited me to visit him at Corpus Christi
  College, Oxford, and attend one or two of his lectures.         This
 was my true launch.        Travelling down with him in the Ox
 ford coach,   I learned a world     of things before we reached the
 Isis, and, amongst      others,   his lecture on Crustacea,     given
 whilst he pulled to pieces on his knees a cold crab bought at
 a fishmonger's shop at Maidenhead, where he usually lunched
 as the coach stopped.
       " On                              Inn to Buckland's domicile,
            repairing from the Star
 I never can    forget the scene which awaited me.         Having, by
 direction   of the janitor,     climbed up a narrow staircase,       I
 entered a long corridor-like       room (now all destroyed), which
 was filled with rocks, shells, and bones in dire confusion,
 and, in a sort of sanctum at the end, was my friend in his
 black gown looking like a necromancer,          sitting on the one
 only rickety chair not covered with some fossils, and clean
 ing out a fossil bone from the matrix."
      The few days at Oxford were memorably pleasant.           Buck-
land's wit and enthusiasm glowed through all his scientific
sayings and doings, and he had a rare power of description
by which he could make even a dry enough subject fascinat
ingly interesting.       Murchison heard one or two brilliant
lectures from him, but what was of still more importance, he
accompanied the merry Professor and his students,            mounted
on Oxford hacks, to Shotover          Hill, and for the first time  in
his life had a landscape        geologically dissected    before him.
From that eminence his eye was taught to recognise                 the
broader features of the succession of the oolitic rocks of Eng
land up to the far range of the Chalk Hills         ; and this not  in
a dull, text-book fashion, for Buckland, in luminous language,

brought the several elements of the landscape into connexion
with each other and with a few fundamental principles which
have determined the sculpturing of the earth's surface.        His
audience    came  to  see merely a rich vale in the midst        of
fertile England, but before they quitted the ground the land
scape had been made to yield up to them clear notions       of the
origin of springs and the principles of drainage.
     This was the very kind of instruction needed to fan the
growing flame of Murchison's zeal for science.       He returned
to town burning      with desire to put his knowledge to some
use by trying to imitate, no matter how feebly, the admirable
way in which the Oxford Professor had applied the lessons
of the lecture-room to the elucidation of the history of      hills
and valleys.     While shooting and rambling,       as he  had so
often done, at the house of his father-in-law, he had already
noted many geological facts in the district around Petersfield
without paying much heed to them, or seeking in any way
for their explanation;    but from what he had learnt from
Mr. Webster and Dr. Fitton     as to the Isle of Wight, he could
see that   in that island he should most likely find materials
for understanding the geology of Petersfield.     Accordingly he
determined that this should be his first essay in independent
field-work.                                   I
               Of this time he writes : " was totus in illis,
and making every preparation for a thorough survey of all
the South coast — a project which was gladly backed up by
my wife, who now saw that         I was   fairly bitten with my
new hobby.     Conybeare and Phillips' Geology   of England and
 Wales had then become my scientific bible, and       I saw that a
fine field was opening for any zealous       and active searcher
after truth in completing many gaps which they had left to
be filled up."

1825.]  HIS FIRST INDEPENDENT FIELD-WORK.                        127
       The summer of 1825 brought Murchison          and his wife
back once more to Nursted House, but the Hambledon fox
hounds had now lost their charms         for him.   With the same
zeal he had thrown himself into another kind of hunting, in
which, instead of old Parson Eichards          and his friends, he
had for companion his own wife.            Many a deep lane and
rocky dingle did they explore together for fossils.       Dr. Fitton
came down to      visit them and joined in the pursuit, tracing
out by degrees the        well-marked    succession  of cretaceous
 strata shown in that district.
       Seeing in this way the problems which he had to work
 out in the Petersfield district, Murchison started        with his
 wife in the middle of August on a tour of nine weeks along
 the South coast, from the Isle of Wight into Devon and
Cornwall.      Taking   a light carriage and a pair of horses, he
 made the journey     in short stages, lingering for days at some
 of the more interesting or important geological localities.
 Driving, boating, walking,      or scrambling, the enthusiastic
 pair signalized their first geological tour by       a  formidable
 amount of bodily toil.       Mrs. Murchison     specially devoted
 herself to the collection of fossils, and to sketching the more
 striking geological features of the coast-line, while her hus
 band would push on to make some long and laborious detour.
 In this    way, while she remained quietly working        at Lyme
 Regis, he struck westward for a fortnight into Devon and
 Cornwall, to make his first acquaintance with the rocks to
 which in after years Sedgwick and he were to give the name
 by which they are now recognised all over the world.
       It was in the course of this tour that he met with a man
  whom he has the merit of having brought into notice, and
  who certainly amply requited him by the services         rendered

in later years.     William Lonsdale had served in the Penin
sular war, and retired on half-pay to Bath.                 With the most
simple and abstemious         habits his slender income sufficed not
only for his wants, but for the purchase of any book or fossil
he coveted, and so he spent his time            in studying the organic
remains,   and specially      the fossil corals, to be found in his
neighbourhood. Murchison met him accidentally in some
            "
quarries, — a tall, grave man, with a huge hammer on his
shoulder," — and found him so full of information that he
stayed some days at Bath under Lonsdale's guidance.
     With the enlargement of view which                   so instructive   a
ramble had given him, Murchison prepared and read to the
Geological Society, on 16th December 1825, his first scientific
paper,  — " A Geological Sketch of the North-western extre
mity of Sussex, and the adjoining parts of Hants and Surrey."1
This little essay bore manifest evidence of being the result
of careful observation of the order of succession of the rocks
in the field, followed by as ample examination of their
fossils as he could secure from those best qualified to give an
opinion upon them.          In  these respects     it was typical of all
his later work
     Having shown by this first publication his capacity                  as
an observer and describer,         and being further recommended
by the leisure which his position of independence enabled
him to command,        he was soon after elected one            of the two
honorary secretaries of the Geological Society.               "
                                                                Lyell being
then a law-student, with chambers in the Temple, could only
devote a portion     of his time to our science, and was glad to
make way    as secretary     to one who, like myself, had nothing
else to do than    think and dream of geology, and work hard
to get on in my new vocation."

      In   the spring of 1826 he was elected into the Eoyal
Society    — an    honour more easily won then than now, and
for which, as the President, his old friend Sir Humphry
Davy told him, he was indebted not to the amount or value
of his scientific work, but to the         fact, that he was an inde
pendent gentleman having a taste for science, with plenty of
time and enough of money to gratify it.             His acquaintance
with     the scientific men of London daily increased,         Davy and
 Wollaston being specially attentive in their encouragement.
 Of    his intercourse with the latter he writes           "
                                                       :     Wollaston's
 little dinners of four or five        persons   were most agreeable,
 and you were sure to come away with much fresh know
 ledge.     A   good dish   of fish, a capital joint and some game,
 followed     by    his invariable    large pudding,     filled in with
 apples, apricots, or green-gages,        all served on plain white
 porcelain by two tidy, handsome            women, was the        bill of
 fare.
       " This was perhaps about the happiest period of my life.
  I had    shaken off the vanities of the fashionable world to
  a good extent — was less anxious to know titled folks and
 leading sportsmen — was free of all the cares and expenses of
  a stable full of horses — and had taken to a career in which
  excitement in the field carried with it occupation, amuse
  ment, and possibly reputation."
       But if distinction was to be won in this new kind of
  activity, it could only be by hard toil in the field.           He had
  never had any of the special training which would have fitted
  him for working out geological problems indoors, such            as  the
  discrimination     of fossils, or the characters and alterations of
  minerals and rocks      ; hence, although stress of weather, not to
  speak of the pleasures of society, brought him to London and

 kept him there during the winter and spring, he soon saw
 that to insure progress in his adopted pursuit he must spend
 as  much   as  possible of every summer and autumn in original
 field-exploration.      He had begun well in this way by the tour
 along the South coast.         Now that another summer had come
 round he prepared to resume           his hammer in the field.         As
 before,   a definite    task was given to him.           Buckland     and
 others   advised him to go north and settle the geological age
 of the Brora coal-field, in Sutherlandshire.           Some geologists
 maintained that the rocks of that district were merely a part
 of the ordinary coal, or carboniferous system             ;  others held
them to be greatly younger, to be indeed of the same general
 age  with the lower oolitic strata of Yorkshire.                 A  good
 observer might        readily   settle this question.         Murchison
 resolved to try.
     Again he prepared himself by reading and study of fossils
to understand the evidence he was to collect and interpret                ;
and in order to do       full justice to  the Scottish tract, he     went
first to the Yorkshire coast and made himself master of the
succession     and leading characters       of the rocks so admirably
displayed along that picturesque line of cliffs.             The summer
had hardly begun before           he and     his wife broke up their
camp    in London and were on the move northward.
     At York      he made the acquaintance of two men with
whom he was destined in after life to have much close inter
course    and co-operation, —the Eev. William Vernon (after
wards Vernon Harcourt) and Mr.             John Phillips.      The latter
friend has kindly contributed           the   following   reminiscences
of this interview    : — " In   a bright afternoon     of early summer,
while engaged in museum arrangements,                a man    of cheerful
and distinguished        aspect was presented       to me by the Pre

 1826.]

sideut     of the Yorkshire Philosophical          Society,   Mr. W.
Vernon (Harcourt),         as  Mr. Murchison,    a friend   of Buck-
land, desirous of consulting        our collections.    The museum
was tolerably well supplied with oolitic fossils, and espe
cially those of the coralline oolite and calcareous            grit of
Yorkshire.        Some     of these   were amusing       enough.      A
diligent collector at Malton,         who   supplied    the   museum
with      specimens,     sometimes    brought    what     were   called
'
  beetles,'   made by painting      and varnishing     parts of shells
and crustaceans.         After examining the 'fossils' with care,
Murchison would see these 'curiosities.'             As it happe:
they were laid contemptuously at the base of vertical cases,
and were rather difficult        to get out — 'Never mind,' said
                     '
the old soldier,       we   will lie down and reconnoitre on the
floor.'     I  knew then that geology had gained a resolute
disciple, possibly     a  master-workman."
       Murchison's own record of the meeting is as follows          : —
"
   Phillips, then a youth, was engaged in arranging a small
museum at York.            He recommended       me strongly to his
uncle, William Smith, who was then living at Scarborough,
and had little intercourse with the Geological Society, for
he thought that Greenough and others, in taking from him
the main materials of his original Geological Map of Eng
land, had done him an injustice.         The unpretending country
land-surveyor, who had really the highest merit of them all,
had been somewhat snubbed by such men              as Dr. Macculloch
and others, who, having a superior acquaintance with the
chemical composition of rocks and minerals, did not appre
ciate the broad views       of Smith.
       " From the moment       I had  my first walk with William
 Smith (then about sixty years old),        I felt  that he was just

132            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                           [was.
the man after my own heart           ; and he, on his part, seeing
that  I had, as he said,
                             '
                               an eye for a country,' took to me
and gave me most valuable            lessons.   Thus he made me
thoroughly     acquainted with all the strata north and south
of Scarborough.      He afterwards accompanied me in          a  boat
all along the coast, stopping and sleeping at Robin Hood's
Bay.    Not only did      I then  learn the exact position of the
beds of poor coal which crop out         in that tract of the eastern
moorlands, but collecting with him the characteristic fossils
from the calcareous grit down to the lias,         I saw how clearly
strata must alone be identified by their fossils, inasmuch as
here, instead     of oolitic limestones like those of the south
 we had sandstones, grits, and shales, which,         though closely
resembling the beds of the old coal, were precise equivalents
 of the oolitic series of the south.          Smith walked stoutly
 with me all under the cliffs, from Robin Hood's Bay to
 Whitby, making me well note the characteristic fossils of
 each formation."    /
     Though the main object of this summer tour was to
 work out the geological problem which had been assigned
 to him   in Sutherlandshire,      he sketched a most circuitous
 route, partly for the sake of showing Mrs. Murchison some
 thing more of the Highlands than she had yet seen, and
 partly with the view of putting to use his new acquirements
 in geology  ;  so that after reaching Edinburgh,      and having its
 geology expounded to him by Jameson, instead of striking
 north at once, he turned westwards to the island of Arran,
 and spent many weeks among the "Western islands, from the
 Firth of Clyde to    the north   of Skye.    The hills of his native
 country had now acquired an interest for him which they
 never possessed, even in the days when they drew him off

  in eager pursuit of grouse and black-cock.           At  every halt
  his first anxiety was to know what the rocks of the place
  might     be, and how far he could identify        their geological
  position.      In Arran    he filled his note-book   with observa
  tions and queries about granite, red sandstone,          limestone,
  and other puzzling matters,         on which his previous     expe
  rience in field-work      in the south of England and in York
  shire could throw no light, and for the elucidation of which
  he wisely resolved to secure at some future time the guidance
  and co-operation of an older geologist than himself.         It was
  in the fulfilment of this resolution that Sedgwick and he
  first became fellow-workers in the field.
       Sailing packets, small boats, and post-horses combined
 to make a tour among the Inner Hebrides and West High
 lands    in those days a leisurely affair.    A geologist had many
 opportunities of using his hammer by the way, and Murchison
 seems always to have had his          in his hand or in his pocket,
 and to have jotted down in detail what he saw.        The itinerary
 of his journey shows that he scoured the hills and glens of
 Mull,    peeped into every nook and cranny of Staffa, mounted
to the top of Ben Nevis and recognised its curious crest of
porphyry,      went up to the Parallel Roads of Glen Eoy,          as
cended the Great Glen,            and then turning west through
Glengarry       to Glenshiel,    found himself in Skye.      In  that
wildest and weirdest of the Western Islands he and his wife
did excellent work in collecting fossils, and thereby obtain
ing materials for making more detailed comparison between
the secondary       rocks of the West of Scotland and those of
England than had been attempted by Dr. Macculloch.               The
actual fossil-hunting       was mainly done by Mrs. Murchison,
after whom one        of the shells (Ammonites Murchisonice) was

named by Sowerby, while her husband climbed the cliffs
and trudged over the moors and crags to make out the order
of succession among the secondary strata.
     But the tour was not merely geological.           Many a halt
and detour were made to get a good view of some fine
scenery,    or to make yet another sketch.      Friends and High
land cousins,    too, were  plentifully scattered along the route,
so that the travellers had ample experience           of the hearty
hospitality of those regions.      An occasional shot at   grouse or
deer varied the monotony       of the hammering    ; but even when
stalking, Murchison could not keep his eyes from the rocks.
Amid the jottings of his sport he had facts to chronicle about
the gneiss or porphyry or sandstone through which the sport
had led him.      This characteristic, traceable even at this early
period of his life, remained prominent up to the last autumn
 of his life in which he was able to wield a gun or a hammer.
      The summer had in great part passed before he reached
 that part of the eastern coast of Sutherlandshire        where the
 scene    of his special task lay   ; but that task proved to be
 eminently easy.      From Dunrobin, where he was hospitably
 entertained, he could follow northwards and southwards a
 regular succession     of strata, and recognised in them the
 equivalents of parts of the oolitic series of Yorkshire.         The
 Brora coal, therefore,    instead of forming part of the true
 carboniferous system, was simply a local peculiarity in the
 oolitic series.   As in Skye, he     made   a collection of fossils
 which offered a means of satisfactory comparison with the
  oolitic rocks of England.
       The rapidity with which this piece of work could be
 done    left time for a prolongation      of the tour northwards
 through Caithness, even up into the Orkney Islands, but at

length the tourists had to prepare for a southward migration
again.       Beaching Inverness, they turned eastward to Aber
deen, and thence,       with Bout's Essai in hand, down the eastern
coast,     by Peterhead, Bullers of Buchan, Arbroath, and St.
Andrews.        While in Fife they received tidings of the serious
illness of the old General at Nursted.            Abruptly closing this
protracted ramble, they took their places in the mail-coach,
and travelled without            intermission into Hants.     The imme
diate result of this summer's work was seen in the prepara
tion of a paper for the Geological Society.1
      As    before,   the winter was passed in London, and this
became henceforth Murchison's              practice.  The summer and
autumn usually found him in the country for fresh observa
tions, with visits to old friends and a renewal of field-sports              ;
but when winter began to set in, unless when abroad, he
made      his way back to town to renew the socialities of life,
in which he delighted, and to elaborate his geological work
for publication.
      Among the incidents of London life in the winter of
 1826-27, he has preserved some notes of a hazardous de
scent into the Thames Tunnel, then in course of construc
tion.      The river had burst        in upon the works, and the two
Brunels were organizing means for expelling the intruder.
Considerable discussion went on in scientific circles as to
the mode of procedure, or whether              it was worth proceeding
at all.      Dr. Buckland          organized a party to go down and

Smith were, for the first time, applied in detail to the oolitic rocks of
Scotland, and which gave the first connected account of these rocks, with
lists of characteristic fossils.

inspect, including Charles Bonaparte (afterwards Prince of
Canino) and Murchison.
     "
       The first operation we underwent             (one which    I never
repeated)    was to go down      in a diving-bell upon the cavity
by which the Thames had broken in.             Buckland and Feather-
stonehaugh,    having been the first to volunteer, came up with
such red faces and such staring eyes, that               I  confess I felt
no great inclination to follow their example, particularly as
Charles Bonaparte was most anxious to avoid the dilemma,
excusing himself by saying that his family was very short-
necked and subject to apoplexy, etc.            ;  but  it would not do
to show the white feather        ;   I   got in, and induced him to
follow me.      The effect was,    as  I  expected,    most oppressive,
and then on the bottom what did we                see  but dirty gravel
and mud, from which         I brought up a fragment of one of
.Hunt's   blacking-bottles.     We soon pulled the string, and
were delighted to breathe the fresh air.
     " The first
                  folly was, however, quite overpowered            by the
next.    We went down the shaft on the south bank, and got,
with young Brunei, into a punt, which he was to steer into
the tunnel   till we reached  the repairing-shield.         About eleven
feet   of water were still in the tunnel, leaving just space
 enough above our heads for Brunei to stand up and claw
 the ceiling and sides to impel us.          As we were proceeding
 he called out,   '
                    Now, gentlemen,       if by  accident there should
 be a rush   of water,  I shall turn the punt over and prevent
 you being jammed against the roof, and we shall then all be
 carried out and up the shaft         !'    On this C. Bonaparte re
 marked,   '
             But  I cannot swim     !'   and, just as he had said the
 words, Brunei, swinging carelessly from right to left, fell
 overboard,   and out went of course the candles,             with which

 qui pent, fat C. B., then the very image of Napoleon at St.
 Helena, was about to roll out after him, when             I held  him
 fast, and, by the glimmering          light from the entrance,       we
 found young Brunei, who swam like a fish, coming up on
 the other side of the punt, and soon got him on board.             We
 of course called out for an immediate retreat, for really there
 could not be a more foolhardy and ridiculous            risk of our
lives, inasmuch      as  it was just the moment of trial          as   to
 whether the Thames would make a further inroad or not."
      As the spring months wore away, short visits             to    the
 country could be resumed,        as, for example, down to Oxford,
to  join in   one of the galloping excursions     of the merry Pro
fessor    of Geology, or to Lewes to make the acquaintance of
 Dr. Mantell, then in full medical practice, but who had
found time to distinguish himself as a zealous palaeontologist
and collector.      In  the course     of these short and desultory
excursions, Murchison supplemented his former work in the
Petersfield district, and made himself master of the         full  suc
cession of the cretaceous     formations.
       But a much more         lengthy     and ambitious    tour had
already been planned.         In   the previous    year,  during     the
rambles in Arran and elsewhere in the north, he had met
with many puzzling facts.            Particularly had he been dis
comfited by the problems presented by the red sandstones of
the     west coast.   And as we have already noted,           he   had
determined to return to the attack, bringing             with him a
geologist of ampler knowledge and specially experienced in
the     complicated structure of the older rocks.         Of all his
geological friends none had won his respect          and admiration
so  entirely as Sedgwick.        Admirable     as an observer,    clear

 and brilliant as an expositor, the Woodwardian               Professor
 was one of the kindliest,        wittiest, merriest of companions.
 While Murchison's         pursuit of science     was now and con
 tinued through life to be a serious earnest          task, Sedgwick's
 enthusiasm and earnestness, on the other hand, were quite
 as   great,   his knowledge      far greater,   but he threw       over
 his scientific work the charm of his             own    bright   genial
 nature.      Brimful of humour and bristling with apposite
  anecdote,    his scientific talk was greatly more entertaining
 than the ordinary conversation of most good talkers, for he
  could so place a dry scientific fact     as to photograph    it on the
 memory while at the same time he linked it with something
  droll or fanciful or tender, so that it seemed ever after to
  wear a kind of human significance.          No keener eye than his
  ever ranged over the rocks of England, and yet          while noting
  each feature   of their structure or scenery he delighted to cany
  through his geological work an endless            thread of fun and
  wit.    No wonder therefore that Murchison, who, though not
  himself gifted with humour, had a keen relish for it as              it
  came from others, should have made choice            of such a com
  panion.
*      But Sedgwick had already distinguished himself in the
  difficult labour of unravelling       the structure  of some of the
  older rocks of this country.        And it was in the older rocks
  that the problems lay which had baffled           Murchison     during
  his first geological raid into Scotland.         In  every way the
  society of the Cambridge Professor would be an advantage
  to him  ;  it would give him at once a skilful instructor, a
  generous    fellow-labourer,   and    a buoyant companion.         His
  proposal that Sedgwick should return with him to Scotland
  was accepted, and the two friends, destined to achieve many

an arduous and hard-won success in after years in the field
together, started on their first conjoint geological tour early
in July   1827.
      The main ohject of this journey was to ascertain           if
possible the true relations of the red sandstones         of Scot
land — a subject in regard to which Murchison himself had
observed many difficult      or apparently contradictory facts in
the previous year, and which the maps and writings of Mac-
culloch had not fully explained.      The route chosen agreed on
the whole with that previously followed by Murchison          and
his wife — Arran, Mull, Skye, thence through the north of
Sutherlandshire    to the east coast     of Caithness, and then
southwards      by Elgin, Aberdeen,     Forfarshire,   Edinburgh,
Dumfriesshire,    Carlisle, and Newcastle, to York.
      Throughout by much the greater part of the country to
be traversed in the Highland tracts comparatively little had
been done by geologists beyond the maps and memoirs of
Macculloch,    and hence there was little in the way of pub
lished description to be read before starting.       From a loose
slip of paper found among Murchison's             repositories,  it
appears that in the absence        of geological memoranda he
had taken to the acquisition of words and phrases in Gaelic,
 and had written down such as he judged would             be most
 useful.   The reader may think this list rather an ominous
 one when he is     told that it begins with the question in
 Gaelic, "Where is the public-house?" and ends off with
           clay —hot water."

       From this long and well-worked journey Murchison
 profited greatly.   Under Sedgwick's guidance he saw clearly
 enough now the meaning of things which had puzzled him
 not a little before.     For example, even at that early time,

 Sedgwick had distinguished that peculiar structure in rocks
to which the name of " cleavage" is now given, and taught
his companion to recognise         it.1  Fractures and foldings, with
 other hroad features      of geological structure in a region            of
 old dislocated and altered rocks, were likewise unravelled.
       But with Sedgwick in the party the tour could not pos
 sibly he all work and no play.               They threw themselves
heartily into the ways of the Highlanders, and made friends
 all along the route, —ate haggises and drank whisky at one
house, danced       in rough coats and hobnailed boots in an
 other, brightened     with talk and tale the drawing-room of a
third.      Much of the journey was performed on foot over
wild moor and mountain, or in a crazy boat through the
winding fjords.        Some     of the expeditions too were under
taken in such storms of wind and rain as are seldom, seen
anywhere in Britain out of that north-western region.              Hence
they returned to the south country, not without adventures to
boast of, — how, for example, they were nearly lost in boating
from Greinord to Ullapool, and saved, so Sedgwick said, by
his vigorous help in bailing the leaky boat with his hat,                —
or how, Sedgwick wearing a plaid which he had bought from
a shepherd,     they were taken by a bustling            landlady for a
couple of drovers,      and got but scant courtesy, — or how, to
prevent a like mistake at Forfar, Murchison insisted on

       Among the slate-quarries of Rallachulish they met with examples of
cleavage which Sedgwick pointed out on the spot to K. von Oeynhausen
and II. von Dechen, then rambling through Scotland and gathering ma
terials for the papers on various parts of Highland geology, which they
afterwards   published in Karsten's Archiv.    He failed to convince them
that there was any essential difference between the original stratification
of the rocks and the lines of cleavage, even though the argument lasted
long, in one of the deluges of rain so characteristic of that weeping
climate.                      -                    .                       -

shown into the tap -room        !  from which, however, the retired
captain of dragoons discharged such a characteristically mili
tary volley of denunciation as speedily brought both landlord
and landlady with profuse         apologies     and a loud command           of
" wax-lights for    the gentlemen."         Among       these      incidents of
travel  one   curious coincidence made an impression upon
Murchison's    Highland susceptibilities.              His     mother, as we
have seen, was a Mackenzie of Fairburn, born in the ances-
            Red Sandstone Mountains on the West Coast of Sutherland.

the effect that the lands should pass out of the hands of the
Mackenzies, and that " the sow should litter in the lady's
chamber."     The old tower had now become a ruin, and the
                                                     " The Professor and
two travellers turned aside to see it.

stone stair-case,    when we were almost knocked over by a
rush of two or three pigs that had been nestling up-stairs
in the very room in which my mother was born."

142            SIR RODERICK MURCHISOK                             [1w.
      After seeing most of the red sandstone tracts of Scot
land the two travellers       re-entered England         by  Carlisle,
crossed    to Newcastle,   and revisited     some    of the sporting
scenes   of earlier years.   One of the friends they saw was
Murchison's      former fox-hunting      chief,   Lord Darlington,
                     "
who, he      writes,   laughed at my new hobby which had
converted me into ' an earth-stopper ! —a simile worthy

of a veteran Nimrod who hunted every day of the week
except Sunday.
      With the winter    came back the usual routine       of London
life.   The Secretaryship of the Geological Society demanded
a good deal of time and labour, and the President,        Dr. Fitton,
kept a sharp eye on his subordinates,      so much so, indeed, that
an actual rupture took place between him and Murchison,
which was only healed after much correspondence,               and by
the intervention of friends, who endeavoured to convince the
President that he was too exacting, and the Secretary that
he was too insubordinate.      Murchison kept all the letters he
received on the subject, and inscribed on the outside           of the
packet, —
            " 1827.   Some months' waste       of time — Fittoniana,
or disputes with my warm-hearted but peppery friend Dr.
Fitton."
      But besides looking after the lucubrations of other writers
aspiring to geological fame, he had plenty of work this winter
in extending for the Society his notes of the Scottish tour
 with Sedgwick.      The latter was full of work at Cambridge          ;
                                                    "
 suffering, too, from weak eyes, and given to water-drinking
 and dephlogisticating,"  — apt, therefore, to delay what he could
push aside for a time, and needing,          as he said himself, an
 occasional nudge on the elbow.         His pen was required for

the conjoint memoir as much as his hammer had been for
the   work in the field ;  but who could expect much continuous
literary labour from a man who could speak of himself thus              ?
—" Behold me now !" he says, in a letter to Murchison (28th
            "
October), in a new character, strutting about and looking
dignified, with a cap, gown, cassock,          and a huge pair of
bands — the terror of all academical evil-doers — in short, a
perfect moral scavenger.        My time    has been much taken up
with the petty details of my office, and in showing the lions
to divers papas and mammas,           who, at this time of the year,
come    up to the University with the rising hopes of their
families.    This week    I have   to make a Latin speech to the
Senate,   not one word of which is yet written.             I mean    to
write a new syllabus of my lectures, which commence                   in
 about a week    ; in short, my hands are as full as they well
can be.    I will,  however, do the best    I can   for ova joint-stock
work."
      The two friends had resolved to make their work in the
Highlands the subject of two Memoirs for the Geological
Society — one on Arran, and one on the Conglomerates of the
northern and eastern counties.         The former of these was at
last read to the Society in January 1828, but the second was
kept back by Sedgwick's delay.          In  a later letter he refers
to a hint from Dr. Fitton to make haste, lest Murchison
should forestall him, and generously speaks             of their joint
share   in the field-work       thus : —"  You worked harder in
many respects      than   I did  myself, and    till we reached the
east coast, and indeed there also,         you were my geological
guide."    Weeks slip away, and still no help comes from the
Woodwardian       Professor, who writes to his friend, — "        I fear

you     will think     me a sorry coadjutor, for        all the work is left
to yourself.         This is not as it ought to be, but          I am at pre
sent almost a lame soldier."                Still time   passes, and brings
April round without             the completion of Sedgwick's contribu
tion.      On the 7th of that month he says, — " You call upon
      '
me      for my own reputation and your peace of mind to make
ready.'       I promise,     if  God spare my health and preserve me
of sane mind, to have all in good state before the reading                     ;
but to expect that our documents should exactly tally, so
that we have only to stitch them together,                is to expect im
possibilities.        One is making a key, and the other a lock,
which never can fit           till the wards are     well rasped and filed.
To rasp and file         will  be part of my office, as     well as to fit on
a head and tail."            At    last, on the 16th May, the conjoint
paper1 was         fairly launched before the Geological Society.
      Murchison had left London for the Continent before that
date.      His fellow-labourer, however, sent him an account of
the reception of their first conjoint work. " Our paper,"
                          " increased to

        Among the excellent details in the paper on Arran (OeoL Trans., 2d
series,   vol. ii.), the authors erred in identifying the various rocks with
supposed English equivalents.          The structure of the island is too com
plex to he worked out offhand in a week or two, and some of its problems
are even yet not understood.
    The paper on the Old Red Sandstone of the North of Scotland likewise
showed great observing skill ; but the same risk of error, from compara
tively hurried examination of a few traverses, was shown in it. The
authors     massed all the red sandstones of the west and east coast— an
error    which they committed, though knowing what Macculloch had
written on the subject, and which Murchison many years later discarded.
 One special merit of the paper was the important announcement (con
firming that made in the Brora paper), of the abundant fossil fishes found
in many parts of Caithness, and the plates and descriptions given of some
of the forms, which in later years were to become so well known through
the writings of Hugh Miller.

                        CHAPTER IX.
          FIRST GEOLOGICAL RAIDS INTO THE CONTINENT.
    THE three years which      had now passed away since     his
geological hammer was first buckled on had been to        Mur -
chison a time of hard work.       Even in mere physical exer
tion his labour had been great, and would be inadequately
represented   by the statement that he had trudged on foot for
many hundreds of miles over rough shores and still more
rugged mountains.       His enthusiasm had  been so thoroughly
awakened that there was now no risk of desertion from the
scientific ranks.    He had learnt a vast deal in that short
interval,   and  learnt  it too where alone   it can be truly
mastered  — in the field.    Of the many avenues of research
which the     infant science of Geology was opening, he had
already chosen that along which he was to rise to eminence.
Whether     in the south of England, among late secondary
and tertiary rocks, or in the north and west of Scotland,
among some of the oldest palaeozoic masses, his leading aim
had been to unravel the true order of arrangement        of the
rocks, and show their relation to each other and to those     of
other and better known regions.       In  this pursuit  he  felt

that he could distinguish himself, and he had done             so.   With
leisure at command and a wide field for exertion, spurred
too by    a real love for the work       as well as by a strong desire
to be prominent, his first three years of geological labour at
home had been a marked success.                 From a mere beginner
he had speedily become one of the prominent men at the
Geological      Society, and one of the most ardent and pro
mising of the rising geologists of his day.
      So thoroughly had geology          dispossessed, at least for the
 time, all other occupations, that his note-books for these years
 contain memoranda          of hardly     anything   else.   Elaborately
 does he detail every section which            he saw   ;  minutely does
 he describe     every step     and stage of each of his journeys.
 The main scientific results have long been given to the
 world, and there remains,           besides   the mere dry itinerary,
 but the scantiest residuum of personal matters to show in
 what other ways his            thoughts and time were            engaged.
 Among his papers occur notes of invitation            —a    dinner with
 Davy, a    soire'e  at Fitton's, —or    memoranda of meetings         and
 consultations      with    friends   of the     Royal or      Geological
 Society,    and    jottings   enough     to show that      his scientific
 pursuits    had in no way slackened his general activity and
 energy, or lessened       his pleasure      in the convivialities       of
 society.
      But having successfully essayed his strength among the
 rocks of his own country,        it was not to    be supposed     that he
 would long refrain from making a dash at those of the Con
 tinent, where it was thought that a good deal might be
  done in applying the principles of classification which had
 been   so successfully       used among the Secondary rocks             of
 England.       Accordingly     in the winter of 1827-8 he began to

 turn his thoughts towards a foray of that kind.        The result
 was   that, once abroad,     he found so much of novelty and
 interest there  as  to bring him back again and again.      Hence
 for the next three years the scene of his labours extended
 from the Straits of Dover         through central and southern
 France to the shores of the Adriatic on the one hand, and
 through Ehineland,      Bavaria, and Austria into Hungary on
 the other.
     The first of these continental excursions was planned to
include the centre and south of France, the north of Italy,
 and   parts of Switzerland.       As usual, copious notes were
 made    from the various authors who had treated of the
geology of these tracts.         I

We were off in April, and on the 26th of that month were
at work     in the field with Constant Prevost, following his
subdivisions of the Paris basin.         The theoretical views    of
Prevost made a deep impression on Lyell, who,           as far as I
can judge, imbibed some of his best ideas         of the operation
[sic] of land and     fresh water alternations with marine de
posits from the persevering and ingenious Frenchman."
     At Paris they met       also Cuvier,  Brongniart,   Deshayes,
FJie de Beaumont, Desmarest, Dufre'noy, and other scientific
men of mark, and made further notes for the summer's work.
By the beginning of June they found themselves among the
wonderful extinct volcanic cones of Auvergne.          This singu
larly interesting region had been admirably described shortly
before,   both with pen and pencil, by Mr. Poulett Scrope,

to the study of the volcanic rocks of that district, which he
had described with great spirit and accuracy.                     Amid the
troubles of the time he had lost all his property, " except a
portion of mountain which was too ungrateful a soil to find
another purchaser."        Eetiring to this retreat in his old         age he
had built himself a cottage in an extinct crater.                  " The tra

three tourists.      Their coming had been anticipated by the
old Count, from whom on reaching Clermont they found

lously fresh cones and craters and lava-rivers fills the mind
with astonishment.           He wanders perhaps up       a narrow and
picturesque valley feathered with birch and broom down the
sides, and gaily green        with meadow and orchard along the
bottom.       Suddenly he comes upon the rough black lava,
usurping     the channel of the stream, and still bare               and
bristling,   as if it  had only yesterday stiffened into rest.      And
then climbing         further   by the edge of the lava-torrent, he
comes at last     in sight of the marvel of the region —the chain
of Puys — cones of volcanic materials still so perfect that he is
tempted to watch        if steam or smoke cannot    still be seen rising
from their tops.         But when, crossing the lava stream, he
mounts the steep sides of one of these old volcanoes, he finds         it
cold and silent.        There beneath him lies the crater — a deep
hole sunk into the summit of the hill, no longer breathing
out volcanic heat and fumes,             but carpeted     even   to the
bottom with turf, and fragrant with many a wild-flower.
And from these depths, whence in old times came the snort
ing and bellowing of the volcano,           there  rises   now on the
breeze    only the tinkle of the cattle-bells or the hum of the
bee.
     These are the youngest of the volcanoes of Central France,
but    all round them lie fragments           of older and yet older
eruptions, pointing to a long protracted volcanic period            — so
long, indeed, that the rivers of the district had been able to
cut out in the older lavas deep and wide valleys, down which
some    of the later lavas flowed.       Beyond measure instructive,
therefore,   is such a country to the geologist,        inasmuch    as it
places before      him admirable illustrations of the action both
of subterranean and external forces.
     Amid such scenes         as these, our travellers spent some six

 isw.]    IN SOUTHERN FRANCE AND ITALY.                                     151
 weeks,    riding, climbing, driving, and filling note-book and
sketch-book with memoranda                 of rocks and scenery.          These
 rambles bore fruit during the succeeding winter in papers
 which were read before the Geological Society.1
      Turning eastward, the travellers journeyed leisurely down
 the valley of the Rhone, looking at rocks and antiquities by
 the way, until they reached Montpelier,                  and thence passed
 on by Nismes to Aix, in Provence.8                    After quitting Toulon,
an incident occurred to mar the good spirits and hinder the
work of the party.            Murchison       caught a malaria fever, and
became rapidly delirious.              He soon recovered, however, and,
 except a temporary loss of strength, suffered no evil effects,
escaping more fortunately than his wife had done, for the
symptoms of the fever she was seized with at Home used to
return upon her at intervals all through life.                 To recruit him
a   halt of nearly three weeks was made at Nice, where the
invalid soon regained his former activity, scouring the dis
trict all round the town under the guidance of Risso the
conchologist, who led him over the fossiliferous deposits.
      While recruiting his health at Nice, Murchison sent an
account of the tour to the Woodwardian                        Professor, from
which a few sentences may be quoted.                      In Central France
" we left various                     undone, consoling ourselves that
                          things
such a case was to be worked out by Sedgwick next year.
And     here let me, by way            of parenthesis, invoke the philo
sophical spirit of inquiry which prevails at Cambridge, and
urge you, who are really almost our only mathematical

 journey across to      Aix en Provence was most interesting,
  and that place offered so much that we halted a week, our
  work being now reduced to four or five hours in the morn

   and devote himself wholly to geology, turned off southwards

to pursue his inquiries among the tertiary rocks, while the
other two travellers struck eastwards to Venice, and thence
into the Alps.      At  Bassano,    Murchison     collected materials
for a paper on the tertiary           and secondary     rocks of the
Tyrolese Alps, which was read to the Geological Society in
the following     spring.     Ascending by Botzen, he examined
the now well-known          earth-pillars — tall pyramids of stony
 clay, each with a stone or big boulder on its summit, and
 conjectured their materials to have been accumulated by
 "
    powerful torrents coincident with the elevation of the
 chain."    At  that time the former extension of the glaciers
 of the Alps had not yet been realized by geologists.         Hence
 not at Botzen only, but up the valley of the Inn, and in
 other parts of the mountains traversed in this tour, Murchison,
 following the prevalent notions of the time, looked upon all
                 "
 the masses of drift," with travelled blocks, as the results of
 powerful deluges     or  cMbdcles, which swept down the valleys
 or over the hills.
       Having recently supplied the Geological Society with
                             " a dish of
 what Sedgwick called                     fossil fish" from the old
 red sandstone of Caithness, he took the opportunity of turn
  ing aside to collect another meal of the same materials from
  the bituminous schists of Seefeld      — a little mountain village
  of the Tyrol, where some of the rocks were so impregnated
  with animal matter,       from the abundance of fish remains
  imbedded in them,        that for generations the villagers had
  been  in the habit of roasting fragments of the stone, out of
  which they obtained oil for their lamps and cart-wheels.
  This little episode was turned to account in the following
   winter, and bore fruit in a paper upon these dark schists
  and their fish, read to the Geological Society.

 154                 SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                     [isss.
         A   leisurely journey, with many halts by the way to
 allow of the use of hammer and sketch-book, brought the
 travellers through the picturesque tract between the valley
 of the Inn and the Lake of Constance, and thence once more
 into Switzerland.              But this time it was not fine scenery, nor
 even        a field for feats of pedestrianism, which formed the
 chief attractions of the country.               At    every resting-place         an
 attempt was made to ascertain the nature and sequence of
 the rocks, and as much time and labour were now given to
 hunt up an old quarry               as    in former days would have been
gladly given to find out               a   half-hidden specimen of an old
 master.        Beaching Stein, Murcblson              set at once about ex
ploring the quarries of Oeningen, famous for having formerly
yielded the skeleton which Scheuchzer gravely described                             as
" Homo diluvii             testis ;" but which more recent         science        has
shown to be not human, but salamandrine.       " To my joy                           I
learnt," he writes, " that in the last two years the quarries
had been re- opened, and that a very remarkable new quad
ruped had been recently exhumed.                      This splendid fossil had
fallen into the hands of a doctor and a silversmith of the
little town, and was in the house of the former, where                       I in
spected       it,   and counted twenty-three vertebrae.          On the whole
     was     like       dog, fox, or wolf.       resolved at once to acquire
it, it

however, essential that           I   should have      a   drawing, and there
fore my wife stole out with her pattens across the muddy
street       early next morning, before the doctor was up, and
induced the servant girl to let her in to sketch the beast.
The moment Cuvier saw the drawing he said                        it   was    in all
probability          a   fox.    Of course an old fox-hunter like me

 could not resist the bonne            bouche  of finding the first fossil
 fox, and,      writing back from Paris,        I  acquired the animal,
 which     I gave   to the British Museum,1 and which Owen has
 since turned into the             '

                                                                     s
 related to the civet-cat than any other living animal"
       Journeying by Basle, Strasbourg, the Vosges mountains,
 and thence through France,            with many a stop and detour to
 visit geological sections           or the contents of museums,         the
 travellers did not reach England until the end of October.
 They had thus been six months abroad.                  During that time
 Murchison        seems to have done his best not to let a single
 day pass      without adding to his stock of geological know
 ledge.     With an enthusiasm which must                have made      him
a    somewhat troublesome companion, he spared                  no bodily
 fatigue in pursuit           of his inquiries,    throwing    himself    as
heartily      into questions regarding the order            of succession
among the rocks          of each town or valley he visited,       as  if the
place     had been his home.            The work of these six months
was reduced to form           in two memoirs, which he himself pre
pared in the succeeding              winter for the Geological Society,
and     in three conjoint papers          written in concert with Mr.
Lyell.       But the results are to be measured            not so much
by these published records of them              as by their influence in
finally clenching his geological bent, and fixing him in that
stratigraphical groove in which he had made his first essay
in the south of England, and in which, with but short and
not altogether successful deviations, he was to pursue his
geological career to the end.

The preparation of the five memoirs just referred to, as well
as the    business     of the     Secretaryship    of   the Geological
                                                                     " M.

helped me to describe the fossil fish of Seefeld, and             I   was
gathering     knowledge       from Stokes,      Broderip,    Wollaston,
Buckland,      Greenough,       Lindley,   Curtis    the entomologist,
Konig, Webster, and Mantell."              He found time, however,
to do a little field-work now and then, for in visiting friends
in the country he came no longer simply                as a  sportsman.
Some    of the notes of invitation of these years occur among
his papers, and show that his new zeal for stones furnished
many a point for a quiet joke at his expense, where the
writers, while referring half deprecatingly to the use which
they could wish to       see  him make of his gun, are at pains to
assure him that he need not want opportunities              of wielding
his hammer.
      With spring and       the prospect of fresh     work in the field
plans were vigorously sketched for a new campaign.                 Again
an attack on the structure of the Alps was decided upon,
but this time it was not to be single-handed.                  Professor
Sedgwick had agreed to share in the toil and glory of the
warfare, having      determined to quit for a time his books at
 Cambridge and his vacation rambles at home, and trust him
self with his hypochondria to the rough fare of unfrequented
routes   abroad.      It was again Murchison's task to collect           all
the information obtainable from papers or friends as to the
geology of the tracts to be visited.

     Among his note-books there is one with detailed notes of a series of
lectures on the structure of birds, which he attended during the spring of
 1829.

      In June    the two travellers set out together,        and travel
ling rapidly by Bonn, the volcanic tract of the Laacher See,
Coblenz, and Cassel,           halted at Gottingen        to   geologize.
There they chanced          by a curious coincidence to stumble
upon their two Prussian friends, von Oeynhausen and von
Dechen, with whom they had held the fierce argumentation
in a deluge of rain at Glencoe.              I
                                           " was
                                                    just about to sally
                                             "

popped his nose into the room where S. and self were dress
ing.      In   an instant   we were      in each other's arms, and       I
can assure you that he kissed me on each cheek at least a
score    of times.    And the Professor did not come off with a
short allowance.         Think of our good luck        !   He with his
nmIvelle mariee,      mother-in-law,       and Dechen    with his sposa
are here.      The vivacious little Prussian discovered me by
the  name upon my hammer, as it hung out of the old stone-
bag    in the carriage-yard."       Again, he records that at Got
           " Our hero
tingen                  (Sedgwick specially rejoiced in him) was
old Professor Blumenbach, then eighty-six years of age, on
whom we called.         He told us loads of amusing anecdotes.
Among       his numerous skulls he showed me one of a High
lander sent to him by Sir George Mackenzie, and he denied
that my countrymen had higher cheek-bones                    than other
people.      We afterwards attended his lecture of the day on

works      I had ever seen.      As  I had   presented him       in the morn
ing with some of my fossil insects from Aix, he launched out
                                                                            '
in illustration of these flies and bugs which had lived                       vor
Menschen,' and then carried his pupils off to the British
Museum and our gigantic Scarabaeus in granite.                        Drinking
tea   with him in the evening, Blumenbach equally astonished
us by his extensive reading and wonderful memory,                      whether
he adverted to metaphysics and Bishop Berkeley, to Scottish
history and scenery           and  Walter Scott, or the vitrified forts
and Sir George Mackenzie."1
      Turning northward the two travellers made their way
 through the Harz Mountains and thence by way of Halle to
 Berlin.        At that early time     the older palaeozoic rocks were
 all classed together under the uncouth title of " grauwacke,"
 and among Murchison's            notes reference is made to the "            in
 terminable grauwacke," which               deprived      so much         of the
journey       of geological interest.         Strange that before many
 years passed away it was among               such rocks that he earned
 his chief title to scientific fame, and that they offered attrac
 tion enough to lead him hundreds of miles from home, and
 to keep him busy over mountain and valley for months
 together     !   This very region of the Harz,            as we     shall find,
 furnished, only ten years later, abundant interest and plenty
 of hard work for the two fellow-labourers among these same
 grauwacke masses.            In the meanwhile, however, these rocks
 seem to have          had somewhat of a depressing                effect   upon
 MurcMson's spirits,         so that the wit and sparkle of the Pro
 fessor were never more welcome.
      The halt at Halle brought them in contact with a real

 living specimen of         a staunch Wernerian       in the person of
Professor Germar, who expounded the geology of the country
after the system of his master,            no doubt to the      infinite
 delectation       of the Cambridge Professor, who must have
 looked     upon the old theorist       as  an interesting relic    of a
 species of geologist that was gradually            becoming extinct.
 But they succeeded in picking up a few scraps of informa
 tion regarding some of the regions            included in their pro
 gramme of travel, and their visit to Berlin was similarly
 successful.
      Southward the journey lay by Dresden through Bohemia
 to Vienna and the confines        of Hungary, and thence by the
 caves   of Adelsberg to Trieste, "a hot hole, although it has some
 luxuries in it — good ice and water-melons that would make
 any man     ill except  Sedgwick."     From that point, which was
the    limit of their journey,      the   travellers bent their steps
homeward again through the Carinthian Alps, the Tyrol, and
the   Salzkammergut, striking        westward into Switzerland by
the Lake of Constance,        and  descending     the Rhine  to Stras
bourg, whence they found their way across France,              so as to
reach England        once more   in the end of October.
     Some    of the pleasantest days of this tour were those in
which the travellers enjoyed the society of that remarkable
man, the Archduke          John, among his mountain retreats in
Carinthia.       " Our chief object in coming to Gastein," Mur-
chison writes, " was to wait upon the most scientific Prince
in Europe, the Archduke John, and he received us with cor
diality and frankness.         We dined at the rural tdble-d'hdte,
at   which    the    landlord presided, carved,      and  could boast
with pride that his ancestors had kept the inn for 350 years.
At this   board, besides the Archduke, we had imperial          minis

ters and generals, Prussian nobles, as              well as professors and
geologists.        After dinner we set out to ascend, in a char a
bane,    with the Archduke and his chamberlain, to the upper
cascades at Naasfeld.            We passed the village of Bockstein,
where the gold ore is washed, and thence viewed the snowy
range of the Ankogel, to the summit of which                       the Arch
 duke had ascended, viz., 10,000 feet high, and seven hours'
good     walk above the highest chalet.             We reached the upper
 fall at sunset, and were then in the region of summer-
 chalets,   and surrounded by snowy peaks and glaciers, the
 boundary between Carinthia and the Salzburg region.
       "The      Archduke       was    a  capital    cicerone,   and talked
 familiarly with every one we met.                    One of these was a
 rough Carinthian          packman, whose broad lingo amused us,
  and reminded me of Goldsmith's line —
                 ' Or onward where the rude Carinthian boor ;'
  though    I   do not   think that Oliver, for the sake of rhyme,
  had any right to add —
                 '
                   Against the  houseless stranger shuts his door.'
  Nor would the Archduke allow that they were                    a  bad set of
  fellows, though very inferior to his Styrians and Tyrolese.
                                                 with the Prince — i.e. with
                                               '
  All   the miners were

                                hail-fellow
  perfectly good manners, but with no mauvaise honte.
        " On our homeward
                                   trip on foot we had a petit souper of
   fresh trout, which the Archduke had ordered for us in the
   village of Bockstein, and in approaching the cabaret several
   peasant    girls ran out with their little nosegays, and to kiss
   his hand    ;   whilst he of course put the flowers into his broad-
   brimmed Styrian hat.            As we walked down the valley in a
   fine starlight night we had much enlivening chat, and we
    soon   perceived how honest           a  liberal the Prince      was.    He

im] THE ARCHDUKE JOHN IN CARINTHIA.                                   161
laughed at all the old stiffness and prejudice of the Austrian
court, to the dress of which his Styrian jacket, black leather
shorts, and long green worsted stockings presented             a marked
contrast.     He is a first-rate chamois-hunter, and kills about
forty   bucks    annually.    .  .   . He talked      with delight of
everything in his dear Styria, — the clean inns, honest inn
keepers, and pretty waiting-maids.            He specially abused all
men-waiters, who had found their way to Gratz, and whom
he stigmatized as 'des hommes             de deux maitres'      —i.e.  as
               '
waiters and agens de la haute police.'
     "
       Next morning we were at the door of the Archduke by
appointment at      7.   It was opened       by a bluff Styrian jager,
who beckoned us into the curate's small sitting-room, then
the only residence of his Imperial Highness, whom we found
on his knees, his hob-nailed boots taken off, and busily at
work laying out on the floor the Austrian trigonometrical
map of the surrounding          Alps for our inspection.        Showing
us all the passes, he gave us many good instructions."
     The scientific fruits of this expedition           have long been
before the world.      They were given to the Geological Society
in four   successive   papers during the        succeeding   winter and
spring.     Such rapid work        among    the broken and contorted
rocks of a complicated geological region could not but con
tain many errors.      Yet it must remain        as a  striking example
 of keen and quick observation, and of often happy, though
 not always accurate, generalization.          In  addition to their re
 searches on the structure of the       Austrian Alps, the travellers
 were struck     by two classes of facts which could not but
 arrest the notice of men whose geological types had hitherto
 been mainly English.        In    the first place,   they found thick
 beds of good black coal, masses of millstone,                oolite, and

other hard rocks, to be not older than some of the soft
tertiary sands and clays at home.          Well might Murchison
          "
write — Away went all our old notions of mineral terms
applied to geological formations as any indications of their
age."    In   the next place, they were again and again arrested,
and as  it were appalled, by the formidable ravines and chasms
which bear witness to the enormous yearly waste of the Alps.
At   one part    of the course of the Fella they noticed that a
single night of heavy rain had buried the roadway under           a
vast pile of rubbish swept down from the mountain- sides.
"
  As there are countless such torrents rushing down into the
Tagliameuto and its tributaries, which is one of the six chief
rivers that flow into the Adriatic between Trieste and Venice,
we can      well imagine how that sea must          be encroached
upon, and at what a rate the sides and gorges of the      Alps are
wearing away."
     In another     respect  the  tour had not been without its
fruits.    It  brought   the two English geologists    into direct
personal relation with the geologists of Germany, from whom
they received much kind attention and assistance.       A  ground
work was thus laid for much pleasant and friendly inter
course   in later years.     In  passing through France too they
formed or renewed acquaintance with several brethren of the
hammer in that country, notably           with M. FJie de Beau
mont, whom they met at Boulogne, and from whom, then             in
the early enthusiasm of his pentagonal theory, they received
details regarding the order in which he supposed the moun
tains   of the globe had been elevated — details, however,
which     their   own   work    among    the  Alps would    hardly
support.
     The winter months of 1829-30          were  spent in London,

182930.]    THE EASTERN ALPS REVISITED.                         163
where     the duties of the Secretaryship       of the Geological
Society, the preparation of his memoks on the recent Con
tinental     tour,  and  the   ordinary    but   increasing   social
exigencies of his position, kept Murchison's          hands fuller
than ever of work, though he still found now and then an
opportunity of escaping to the country to visit a friend and
have a few days' shooting.       Indeed,    it would   seem from a
letter addressed to him in March that the old fox-hunting
 Adam was not yet wholly cast out of him.
      Nevertheless when summer had brought back sunshine
 and flowers to the Alpine valleys, he determined to revisit
 them.
      On the appearance of the abstracts of their papers on the
 Austrian and Bavarian        Alps in the Proceedings of the
  Geological Society, the views which Sedgwick and Murchi-
  son had put forth     were  combated    in British and     foreign
 journals, notably by Dr.    Ami   Boue".   Before the publication
 of their completed memoirs,       the two fellow-labourers     saw
  clearly that to meet the objections which had been urged, it
  would be necessary for one or both of them to revisit a few
  of their sections, and to examine some of the new localities
  which had been cited as adverse to their views.         Murchison
  gladly undertook this congenial task.       Accordingly, early in
  June   he started  with his wife, primarily for the purpose of
  clearing up these difficulties, but also to   see a little more of
  German scenery and society      as well  as  German geology and
  geologists.
      The tour lasted until the beginning of October, and em
  braced, besides the old ground, some parts of Europe which
  he had not yet seen since he had taken to scientific pursuits.
   Crossing to Ostend, and proceeding by Antwerp to Brussels

 and    Namur,     where he " was       enraptured     with   Omalius
 d'Halloy ;" Lie'ge, where young Dumont, just beginning his
 career, lent the traveller his services      ; Cologne and Bonn —
 Murchison sped up the Rhine without any halt for geological
 exploration.     At that time    he  still " despised the old slaty
 rocks," though before another year was over he was to begin
 the forging of that chain which kept him to them for the
 rest of his life.
                      " I was  then keen on one scent only, viz.,
greensands,     chalk, and tertiary," and it was to study these
rocks yet more fully that he had again set out for the eastern
Alps.
     Instead, however, of striking at once into the mountains,
the travellers made a detour         through Bavaria,      passing by
Aschaffenburg, Bamberg, Bayreuth, and Eatisbon, to Vienna.
Every museum on the way was examined, and notes were
made    of its contents in  so  far as they might throw light upon
the secondary rocks of the Alps and surrounding regions.
Every local geologist too seems to have been ferreted out
and pressed      into service.    At   Bamberg, by good chance, a
name of more than local celebrity           caught Murchison's      eye
in the visitors' book at the inn.           "  I instantly rushed to
the museum," he writes, " where I introduced myself to the
great geologist to whom Humboldt            and all Germany bowed
— Leopold     von Buch.     We had at once        a  most interesting
colloquy on dolomitization and many of the recent discoveries.
The little vivacious man was then quite en              tete with his
monograph of Ammonites.            Though turned of sixty, he had
only of late begun to study organic remains, and at once he
was endeavouring to generalize and group these animals by
their sutures.      I perceived at once how with all his great
qualities, he was irascible    if any contemporary criticised him,

and      he   was then in a particular         rage  about Buckland's
having omitted to state that the bear-caverns of Muggendorf
and Gailenreuth were          in pure dolomite    ! He had just under
gone      a severe    penance,    owing to his obstinacy        in never
taking      a guide.     He was lost in a forest on a stormy night,
and passed the hours of darkness under a tree, with no protec
tion but an umbrella which he then always carried.                 As he
got old, however, he threw even that aside, and braved wet
and cold      in a plain black suit, and without any change of
garments."1
      At Vienna,     besides museums,      picture-galleries, and geolo
gists, Murchison       saw a good deal of " distinguished society,"
for which to the end he had a special fondness.              He renewed
his acquaintance with the Archduke John, dined with Lord
Cowley, ambassador at the Austrian Court, and had an oppor
tunity of holding converse with Metternich.                 He has pre
served      a record of part of the conversation at the ambas
sador's table.        The talk had drifted into geology, and a lady
present    — the   same who had been the heroine         in the incident
at dinner     in Messina (ante,     p. 53)
                                           — asked across the table a
question about science and the Mosaic record.
                                                            " I naturally
had some difficulty         in getting out of the dilemma, when
Metternich, taking up the cudgels, gave them to my surprise
a capital lecture, and quite to the purpose.              On going into
the drawing-room after dinner, and on sitting down on the
sofa to converse       with the great diplomatist who had over
thrown Napoleon,         I soon learnt how and where he obtained
   1  It  was  not  until further  experience of Continental geology and
geologists that Murchison conceived that great respect for Leopold von
Buch which he used often to express in his later years, adding at the
same time a cordial recognition of what he conceived to be his own obli
gations to the influence of the German geologist.

he) when       I  tell you that      I   love science more than politics.
In my early youth           I  took honours in scientific studies, and
intended to give up my life to such pursuits, and become a
Docteur-es-Arts           et Sciences.       But the French Revolution
startled all the old Austrian families, and my father insisted
on  it that    as   I  had   a name to     sustain,   I must, for the good    of
my country and the honour of my family, betake myself to
public life.       So   I  was sent    as   an  attache"   to the embassy at
Paris.     There, in the intervals            of business, and when not
occupied in the study               of the      doings and         character of
Napoleon,       I   was always an attendant at Cuvier's lectures.
The words of that great master have never been forgotten,
and hence my repetition of them, when                    I  supported you at
table, and        showed       to   my     diplomatic      friends    the great
usefulness of your science, for that is the only mode                    of ap
proaching them.'
     " In his conversation he                        that he had read and
                                           showed
thought      much        on this    subject, and particularly on the
 application of geology to the development of the mineral
 wealth of Austria.             He endeavoured          to make me believe
 that he was all in favour of a scientific meeting in Vienna
 next year,       following      those     of Hamburg,        etc., which    had
 already taken place.              He expressed his ardent hope that
 the people would become more scientific, and hoped that                         I
 would publish some work upon their country, and stir them
 up  a little.
     " When        I   told the Archduke           John afterwards of this
 conversation of Metternich's,              he said    it was all fudge, and
 merely intended to blind me !"

capital, Murchison betook himself to the serious work which
had been the main object of the journey.                        He had written
to Sedgwick        that in order to prove their points he would,
if  possible,
                " riddle
                             these Alps in all directions"           —a   resolu
tion which he now proceeded                 to put       in practice.    Accom
panied by Professor Paul Partsch, an active geologist of
Vienna,     he   made       several   minor        excursions in the neigh
bourhood, and then,            striking through the Leitha               Gebirge
as   far as Gratz, turned           back        westwards into the Alps.1
The wonderful           little tertiary basins enclosed               among   the
older rocks of Carinthia,            and      sometimes        furnishing   thick
masses     of lignite, first detained him.                  But the real hard
work lay among the mountains of the Salzkammergut                             and
Styria, the object being to clear up the relations of the
supposed tertiary strata of Gosau and the structure of the
secondary rocks of that part of Austria.                        In  the state of
the science at the time, it was no wonder that Murchison,
though making out some new points in the structure of the

puzzling      assemblage       of fossils at Gosau.               Several weeks
of very hard work were spent in those regions,                         with the
result of confirming some main parts of the conjoint survey
of the previous year, and of allowing the need to modify
others.      From Ischl, in the midst of the rambling, he wrote
to Sedgwick : — " 0, what would                   I   give that our sketch of

hope have not been begun.              After a great deal of hard work
I have   relieved my mind from a world of anxiety, and am
now resting and thankful, and taking a vapour salt bath or
two, enjoying right worshipful              high Vienna society, who
are  all stewing themselves            in salt here.      I   am     at same
time working      out the details of the upper beds (upper grits
and marlstones of the Alpen-kalk), which by a (-.harming
accident   I have got      within half a mile here."
    About three weeks later the same correspondent received
a further detailed narrative of geological exploits               in a letter
dated from Sonthofen, and beginning thus : — Here             "         I   am,
sticking to my scent like a true fox-hound.                  Since    I wrote
to you from Ischl        I  have done some marvellous good work.
I made    out a fine range of the Gosau beds near that place.
...   At Hallein      I   found V.     Lill all  anxiety to    see me.    .  .  .
The moment       I   twigged certain secondary black fossils like
lias (in his den near the river), and ascertained                    that the
section was not above a six hours' excursion, the post-wagen
was ordered, and off we travelled.             ... I soon     made a most
clear and instructive         section,  with lias shells and sufficient
fossils to make out the          case.   . . . How    I did pant and fag
on the north side of Untersberg, for which                 I  had glorious
hot weather.       I  made four parallel         transverse    sections.        I
think   I  have the whole thing now most clear                  :  it is cer
tainly a capital key."
    "I    set out    with a heavy heart to cross 120 miles of
Btivarian pebbles,        and exactly 100 back to Augsburg,                   in
order that    I, Eod. I. M., should heal my pricking              conscience

more than     I  ever encountered         in my geological career.    My
throw off occasioned           a    hearty malediction      upon Herreii
Sedgwick      and Murchison,          who as they drove up to Sont-
hofen last year passed through a certain archway                  leading
into that valley, with a rock close to them which they never
hammered.        This    I found     to be true genuine old greensand.
. .  . But when     I   came to go along the south flanks of the
 Grinten, and ascend to the iron mines, all my precognosced
friends seemed to he sent topsy-turvy.                  What inversions
and contortions      !  .  . .  I   left no gorge nor any mountain
peak unexamined where             I  thought examination necessary."
      Quitting at last these puzzling rocks on the flanks of
the Alps, he turned            homeward by Munich, Nuremberg,
 Gotha, and      Gottingen.          At Nuremberg       he notes   in his
          " a
journal        change of scene        : fossils and rocks were forgotten
for a day or two."         Curiously enough, however, in the next
sentence    he writes — " A picture of Luther reminded me of
Buckland in his jolliest moments,                while the pensive and
reflective Melanchthon          is well represented in England by
 Henry Warburton."           In Gotha he " passed an evening with
the most remarkable man of the place,                  Von Hoff, whose
works on physical geography and geology proved afterwards
of such good service to Lyell."
      On the 1st October Mr. and Mrs.                 Murchison   set sail
from Rotterdam for London.                  And thus ended one of the
pleasantest of the continental rambles which they had yet
undertaken.        They had accomplished the definite object
which had given point and aim to the journey,                    and  had
besides    seen    much      new country         and   made   many new
acquaintances.         The tour was, moreover,          the last of this
early foreign series.         The next nine years were to be em

ployed at home in laying the foundations of that Silurian
system by which          the name of Murchison           will   be chiefly
remembered        in the history of geology.
     Before we turn to that point of the narrative, the work
of the winter of 1830-31 remains to be very briefly noticed.
During the preceding three years Murchison had filled many
note-books with innumerable memoranda                  of sections, fossil
collections, excerpts from published descriptions and verbal
information, all bearing upon the geology of the secondary
rocks of Germany.            The long      and elaborate       memoir     of
Sedgwick and himself on the eastern Alps, still in the press,
would, when published, contain all the main points of their
work    ; but many details remained which it seemed desirable
to   publish, especially in       so   far as  they might bear upon
English geology.          To carry out this idea, and verify           some
parts of the larger memoir, he went to Paris to compare                    a
collection of fossils from Germany, and partly,                 as he con
fessed,   " to frequent the society of scientific friends."           With
Alexander von Humboldt, who happened                  to be there at the
time, he made acquaintance, and got from him much infor
mation regarding some of the geological aspects of the great
geographer's       travels.
     How the foreign materials were produced at the Geo
 logical Society may be partly gathered             from the subjoined
 letter to his friend Sir    Philip Egerton (28th January 1831):—
     " I am     quite vexed that     I  should fire off all my Alpine
 crackers without       your hearing the report of one.            I  finish

                        THE INVASION OF GRADWACKE.
       FOR five years the          Secretary of the Geological Society
had worked energetically for the Society's behoof, catering
for papers, arranging the reading and publication                   of them,
and     preparing, either alone or          in conjunction          with the
Woodwardian          Professor of Cambridge or Mr. Lyell, some
able memoirs on structural geology.              He had earned a claim
to the        Society's gratitude, which       was acknowledged          this
winter (February           1831) by     his election to the dignity of
President.        The chair had been previously filled by Sedg-
wick, who, on quitting concluded his address with these
                                  it,
words — Mine has been indeed but an interrupted ser
         ":
vice  ;   but I   resign   it   to one of whose powers you have had
long experience,         who can give them to you undivided, and
whose hands are          in no respect less ready than my own."
      The office   is   held for two years.      How     it   was   filled by
Murchison        will   be told   in the next chapter.    We have now
arrived at the great turning-point of his scientific life, and
must look at       it    with some care, that its bearings may be
clearly seen not only on his own career, but on the history
of geology.
      Up to this time, his work in the field had lain almost

wholly      among   Secondary rocks, whether     in this country or
abroad, insomuch that,      as we have seen, the  rocks of older date
seemed to him to wear a dry, forbidding            aspect, no matter,
where they might present themselves.           But before the close)
of the first   session of his Presidency at the Geological Society/
he had determined to look these old rocks steadily in the
 face, and see     what after all might be their meaning and
 history.     Every year brought fresh and often apparently con
 tradictory facts to light about them.     They evidently deserved
 to be studied, and would probably reward any adventurous
 spirit who chose resolutely to grapple with their problems.
 Murchison, at the instigation of Buckland and other friends,
 made up his mind to try.
       The labours which have now to be traced as they went
 on year by year, have a far wider interest than merely their
 relation to the life and work of the man by whom they
 were conducted.       They unquestionably established      a notable
 epoch    in the progress of geology.     They added a new chap
 ter to geological history.     They have been of infinite service
 in helping the interpretation of what are called the palaeo
 zoic rocks in every quarter of the world.          To gain an ade
 quate notion     of what they were and how they came to
 acquire the importance now justly ascribed to them, we may
  cast our eyes first   of all, and very rapidly, over the know
 ledge, or rather the ignorance,     which existed in this part of
 geology before the date of Murchison's       researches.
       Over the centre and south of England the great series

 undergone     comparatively little disturbance from those sub
 terranean movements which have         in other regions heaved up
 these same rocks into some of the loftiest         mountain-chains

  upon the surface of the globe.       They lie one upon the other
  with almost the regularity        of the shelves in    a  library.
  Their story, therefore, when once the key to decipher it had
\ been given, was not difficult to read.    The genius of  William
  Smith had supplied that key, and thus the investigation           of
  the Secondary rocks had made such enormous strides during
  the previous    fifteen or twenty years, that it seemed       as   if
  little more could be done in that branch of geology, save to
  elaborate   details.   Starting  from the types of the undis
  turbed formations of England,        men  endeavoured by their
  means to reduce into order the complicated structure       of such
  regions  as the  Alps.    Among those who successfully essayed
  such a task, Murchison had taken an honourable place
       But down below these Secondary rocks, and underneath
  the Carboniferous and Old Ked Sandstone deposits, the suc
  cession of which had been made out by        William Smith, there
  lay others,  so  hardened, squeezed, and broken     as  seemingly
  to defy all attempts to classify them by the same minute and
  detailed method.      Such rocks stretched over most of Wales, of
  Devon and Cornwall, of the Lake Country, and of the uplands
  of the south of Scotland.       They covered   wide spaces on the
  Continent, as for instance in Scandinavia, Ehineland,           and
  Bohemia.     It was  known that they must be enormously thick.
  From year to year an increasing number of the remains of
   corals, crinoids,   shells, and other organisms was reported
  from them.      Evidently, therefore, they did not all date from
   a time anterior to the introduction    of life upon the earth.
       Many were the names given to this vast and hetero
  geneous series    of rocks.   That proposed by Werner had met
   with the widest acceptance, viz., Transition — a name which
   implied  the theory that these rocks had been formed at           a

But though often used                      as   if it   signified a particular division

name might be legitimately given to                               it,   without reference to
respective age, or under the mistaken impression that all

        Under such vaguely applied names, rocks of vastly differ
  ent ages and characters            were incongruously grouped together.
  Hence they presented so many contradictions and difficulties
\ that geologists       on the whole avoided them as much as possible.
 jMurchison only reflected the common dislike of them when
  he hurried         through the Rhine provinces to get away from
  what he called the

  text-books          were sorely puzzled           how to marshal the few-
  discordant facts which were already known on the subject.
  Fanciful theory and mere trim mineralogical                            distinctions
  often supplied the place of geological knowledge.1
     1  No better illustration     could be obtained of the state of this part of
  geological science at the time than the fact that the Principles of Geo
  logy of Lyell, while devoting about 300 pages to the Tertiary deposits,
  dismissed all fossiliferous rocks older than those above the coal-measures
  in twelve lines. — (Principles, vol. iii., published in the spring of       1833,  and
  dedicated to Murchison.)          The account there given of these rocks does
  not pretend to be more than a reference, but it may be quoted here aa a
  curious commentary on the state of ignorance which prevailed at the time
  regarding the Pateozoic rocks : —

            Carboniferous Group, comprising the coal measures, the mountain lime
  stone, the old red sandstone,    the transition limestone, the coarse slates and slaty
  sandstones     called graywacke by some writers, and other associated rocks.
      " The mountain and transition limestones of the English geologists
  contain many of the same species of shells in common, and we shall there
  fore refer them for the present to the same great period ; and consequently
  the coal, which alternates in some districts with mountain limestone, and
  the old red sandstone, which intervenes between the mountain and tran
  sition    limestones, will be considered as belonging to the same period.
  The coal-bearing       strata are characterized by several hundred species of
  plants, which serve very distinctly to mark the vegetation of part of this
  era.     Some of the rocks, termed graywacke in Germany, are connected by
  their fossils with the mountain limestone."

        When we consider the extremely perplexing character
of the geology of many of the districts where these old
rocks       occur,    we     cannot wonder         that   they   should     have
continued to be a stumbling-block                    in the progress      of the
 science.        The    key furnished         by  William Smith for the
 secondary rocks might not have been found for many years
 later,    if   these    strata had lain less regularly            in England
 than they do.           To men who came fresh from such undis
 turbed deposits          to the contorted, fractured, and hardened
 older rocks,       it must     have seemed      well-nigh a hopeless task
 to reduce the apparent chaos to order.                  Professor Sedgwick,
  Henry De la Beche, all the fossiliferous rocks under the old red sandstone
 are thrown into the     " Grauwacke Group," which is described as " a large
 stratified mass of arenaceous and slaty rocks, intermingled with patches
 of limestone, which are often continuous for considerable distances. The
  arenaceous and slate-beds, considered generally, bear evident marks of
  mechanical origin, but that of the included limestones may be more ques
 tionable."      The fossiliferons character of the group is insisted on, and 126
  genera   and  547  species of fossils are enumerated from the grauwacke rocks
  of this and foreign countries. When, however, we look into these fossil
  lists, we find that a large number of species belong to rocks which are
  now placed on the horizon of the old red sandstone or Devonian system,
  and that others have been inserted which should have been placed on the
  still higher horizon of the carboniferous limestone. The confusion of the
  lists is only a faithful reflex of the utter confusion in which the strati
  graphy of the rocks themselves still lay.
      Even as late as the year 1832, after Sedgwick had published his views
   as to the structure of the transition    rocks of the Cumberland district, and
   after Murchison had made known the distinct order of succession in the
   upper portions of these rocks around the Welsh border, the able and well-
   informed Conybeare could report to the British Association but a meagre
   statement of the scanty knowledge then obtained on this part of British

indeed, nine years before the time at which we are arrived,
viz., as   far back     as    1822, had begun to grapple                   with the
rocks of his       Cumbrian         mountains, and,          in spite of their
broken      and contorted          character,      was slowly           unravelling
their structure.        But no amount of labour or skill in that
region could possibly connect the history of the Transition
rocks with that of the younger strata by which they are
covered;      for  a   great gap          occurs    there in the geological
record, which      is thus rendered as imperfect as a historical
narrative would be         if   several important chapters were torn
out of   it  and destroyed.          A    similar hiatus had been so fre
quently      observed elsewhere that the notion had become

a totally different and distinct order of things, and that they

Transition series, and to connect those of one country with

mineralogical characters of the strata.             But these characters,
as is now     well known, afford no sufficient test of geological
age and       position, the grauwackes and shales               of one age
being often in that respect undistinguishable from those of
another.         Besides, even       when used in reference          to one
continuous        series of rocks, though often most convenient
and useful, they are liable to constant and rapid changes.
They could not, therefore, be safely relied upon for a sound
and generally applicable             classification, such     as  had been
established by means of fossil evidence among the overlying
formations.
      And yet the transition rocks were far from being desti
tute of fossils.1         These were to be had sometimes in great
abundance.          They seemed to be in the main of peculiar
species,     not found in the overlying strata.             Hence it was
evident that before          any use could be made           of the fossils
in the way of grouping the rocks into divisions,                   the very
                                                                               /
order of succession among these rocks had first to be settled.
                                                                             i
But no one who had hitherto addressed himself to this task
had been able to establish as a basis                 for palaeontological
work any broad and serviceable divisions among the old
grauwacke, or to connect           it satisfactorily with   the formations
    1 Their fossiliferous character had been noted by Werner.     In England
 fossils had been found by William Smith and Mr. Phillips in the upper-
moat Transition rocks of Westmoreland.         These specimens were shown to
 Sedgwick in 1822, and slightly described by him in his paper on Craven
 in 1827. The fossiliferous character of some parts of the Transition
 series of Shropshire and Wales was likewise well known, though no one
 seems to have set about determining what the fossils were, and how far
 they agreed with or differed from those of the overlying formations.
 " Practically," to quote from some notes obligingly furnished by Pro
 fessor Phillips, " before the summer of 1831 the whole field of the ancient
 rocks and fossils of Wales was unexplored ; but then arose two men —
par nobile, of all men fitted for the purpose — Sedgwick and Murchison —
 and simultaneously set to work to cultivate what had been left a desert."

which succeeded it in time.            So broken indeed and altered
was     it that if any one had proposed to apply to this puzzling
old transition or grauwacke series the same tests by which
the secondary        and tertiary deposits      had been brought into
such clear and intelligible order, he would have raised a
smile among his geological friends.                  Murchison     knew of
course        no more about these ancient formations than his
neighbours, but he now             resolved with his           characteristic
energy and enthusiasm to see what he could make                    of them.
        At the              of the Geological Society he
                 end of the session
started from Bryanston Square with his " wife and maid,
two good grey nags and              a little carriage,     saddles     being
strapped behind         for     occasional equestrian      use."       Some
preliminary        skirmishing    took place among the secondary
and tertiary rocks by the way, for he could not resist the
sight of a quarry or pit, being resolved to miss nothing on
the road.         The route lay by Oxford, where his old friend
and      preceptor Buckland        received    him, and led him over
some         of the ground where he had formerly received his
earliest lessons in field geology.            But it was not merely to
renew -old acquaintance that a halt was made                      at Oxford.
"   I   took notes    from Dr. Buckland," he writes, " of all that
he knew of the slaty            rocks, or grauwacke       as    it was then
called, which succeeded          to the Old Eed Sandstone, and the
relations of which        I was    determined       to begin to unravel         ;
and      I    recollect that he then told me that he thought                  I
would find a good illustration of the succession                  or passage
on the banks       of the Wye east of Builth."
        This laudable custom of collecting all available infor
mation, published or unpublished,               regarding any piece of
geology,       before himself    attacking    it,   has already been     fre

 quently   apparent in the preceding         narrative.     It   came
 forward prominently enough      at the commencement of this
new and momentous enterprise.             He had already made
notes  in London, while Dr. Buckland furnished him with
new and valuable suggestions.         Quitting Oxford, he jour
neyed westward to visit the Eev. W. D. Conybeare, a name
honourable in the history of geology         as that of one of the
joint   authors   of the   Geology     of England       and    Wales.
From this kind and experienced friend he notes that he
obtained " some    good  advice." Other local observers, who,
though not aspiring to be called geologists, had been in the
habit of looking    at the rocks and fossils of their neigh
bourhood, gave him invaluable         assistance.    Among       these
helpers may be mentioned Dr. Dugard of Shrewsbury, Mr.
Anstice   of Madely, Dr. Lloyd of Ludlow,           Mr. Davies of
Llandovery, and above all the Eev. T. T. Lewis of Aymestry.
From the first these friends enlisted readily in his service,
and some of them continued their unremitting toil and kind
ness for years.    To Mr. Lewis especially he was indebted
for much of his knowledge of the rocks and fossils of the
upper Silurian series, for that gentleman had made out the
arrangement of the rocks in his district, and recognised their
characteristic fossils before Murchison       had begun to study
the subject.
     On first taking the field this year Murchison        had spent
some time    in a desultory series of visits to country friends
and rambles after Secondary strata         His companion during
a portion  of the time was Mr. Phillips, who has given the
following notes of the journey   : — " In the cool spring-time of
1831 we met by appointment          at Staneford, and explored
together the district of Collyweston       and Ketton.        It   was

  a pleasant       walk along the high grounds overlooking the
  Willand     ;   cigars contending with endless discussions on the
  rocks around us, and on their relationships to Alpine lime
  stones which had begun          to be recognised.    We made care
  ful measures of the slaty and sandy beds full of shells which
  here overlie the ironstone and the lias, and intended to give
  a  joint memoir as to their position and numerous fossil con
  tents.     Collyweston has been again and again visited by me,
  but not       I  think by Murchison, who in that year had his
  attention drawn to a larger field of work, and began to dream
  of Siluria,"
        The dream was soon to become a reality.        For, crossing at
  last to Swansea, Murchison struck northwards into the hills
  beyond the coal-field, and there began to invade the Tran
  sition rocks of South Wales.             These hills consist of the
  Carboniferous        Limestone rising out from under the Coal
  measures       and resting upon thick masses of Old Eed Sand
   stone,    so that     when    one  crosses   the high  ground    and
   descends into the lower regions towards the north, one comes
   upon lower and lower strata cropping up from beneath the
   Old Eed Sandstone, and spreading for many a league over
   the undulating        country to right and left and in front.      It
   was near the town of Llandeilo           that Murchison first broke
   into these older rocks with the purpose of making them dis
   close their true place and order in the geological series.

 to these     ridges,    and to my inexpressible                  joy found them
 replete with transition             fossils, afterwards identified                 with
 those   at Ludlow.           Here then was             a   key, and      if   I   could

far more successful than he had dreamed it could                           be, for,  by
a happy accident,         he had stumbled upon some                      of the few
natural sections where the order of the upper parts of the
transition rocks in Britain can                   be readily perceived, and
where their strata can be traced passing up into the over
lying formations.           No one could better appreciate the value
of this " find" than the fortunate geologist himself.                             " For *K

and conformably from beneath the lowest member of the                 uld

beds were characterized by peculiar fossils.^          I had, therefore,
quite enough      on hand to enable me to appear at the              first
meeting of the British Association, which           I had promised      to
join at York in October, with a good broad announcement
of a new step in British geology."       V
      His  notes, however, show that he did not rush at once
from the grauwacke to the         York    assembly,      but journeyed
so   leisurely   as to pay many visits        to old north-country
friends, and to    fill up long  pages of   jottings by the way on
the geology of the region between           the   hills of Wales and
the sea-coast of Durham.       At last, the same " pair of greys"
which had carried the two travellers from London all through
the Welsh border,       and the midland and northern counties,
deposited Mr. and Mrs. Murchison at the hospitable gates                of
 Bishopthorpe, where they remained as guests of the Arch
 bishop during the first meeting of the British Association.
 Of that memorable meeting,         so important       an event   in the
 history of science in this country, Murchison has preserved
 the following recollections   : —

 influence by union, and to make their voice tell in all those
 public affairs in which science ought to tell, came about in
this wise   : — Assemblies of ' Naturforscher' had         been for two

FIRST MEETING OF BRITISH ASSOCIATION.                             185
years or more in existence in Germany, having begun in
 Hamburg.        Thereon Sir D. Brewster wrote an article in
 the Edinburgh Philosophical JoIvmal suggesting that such a
 meeting should be tried in Britain.         On this the Rev. Wil
 liam Vernon (afterwards Vernon Harcourt), the third son of
 the Archbishop of York, and a Prebendary of York, not only
 made the real beginning by proposing that we should meet
 at York, but by engaging his father to act as a Patron, and
 by inducing Earl Fitzwilliam to be the President, he gave at
 once a locus standi and respectability to the project.           But
 he did much more       ; for he elaborated a constitution of that
 which he considered might become a Parliament of Science,
 such  as  Bacon had imagined, and was thus our lawgiver.
     " The project thus elaborated        having been transmitted
 to me in London in the spring of 1831, when          I was President
 of the Geological Society,       I  at once eagerly supported it.
 Nay, more,     I wrote and lithographed an appeal to all my
 scientific friends, particularly    the geologists,  urging them to
 join this new Association.       But notwithstanding my energy,
 the scheme was for the most part pooh-poohed, and, among my
 own associates,    I only  induced Mr. Greenough, Dr. Daubeny,
 Sir Philip Egerton, and Mr. Yates, to follow suit. John Phillips
 of York, the nephew of William Smith, and the Curator of
 the  York Museum, had very much to               do in the origin of
 this concern, for he co-operated warmly with William Vernon,
 and, when we got together at York, was the secretary and
factotum.      He had previously corresponded with me in Lon
 don, and stimulated me      with a ready-made prospectus.      I may
 say that   it was the cheerful and engaging manners of young
 Phillips that went far in cementing us          ; and even then he
 gave signs     of the eminence to which he afterwards arose

in the numerous years in which he was the most efficient
assistant-general-secretary of the body, until when, as the
distinguished Header of Geology in the University of Oxford,
he presided over the          British Association at Birmingham.
      " When, however, we were congregated from all parts, the
feebleness       of the body scientific was too apparent.             From
London we had no strong men of other branches of science,
and      I was but a young President           of the geologists    ;  from
Cambridge no one, but apologies from Whewell, Sedgwick,1
and others       ;  from Oxford we had Daubeny only, with apo
logies from Buckland and others.                On the other hand, we
had the Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, Dr. Lloyd, Dr.
Dalton,       from Manchester, and Sir David              Brewster from
Edinburgh.            Thus there was just a nucleus which,          if well
managed, might           roll on to be a large ball.     And admirably
was it conducted by "William Vernon, for, after opening the
meeting in an earnest, solemn manner, the good Lord                   Fitz-
william handed over the whole control to Harcourt                        and
left us.
       " On
               my own part     I had   plenty of matter wherewith to
keep my geological section alive,             as, besides   those   I have
mentioned, we had a tower of strength in old William Smith,
the Father         of English Geology, and then resident at Scar
borough;        James Forbes, Tom Allan the mineralogist, and
    1 " Sedgwick indeed sent his apology through me, in a letter from Llan-
 fy Kin.   It was his debut among the North Welsh rocks. ' Cracking the
rocks of Carnarvonshire for three weeks, and getting fond of the sport,'
he writes, ' I should be a traitor to quit my post now that    I am keeping
watch among the mountains.           It would be very delightful to mingle
among the philosophers and commence deipnosophist, but it would be
very bad philosophy in the long-run.         You may tell Mr. W. Vernon
that keeping away is a great act of self-denial on my part, and that I am
in fact doing their work by staying away.' "

Harry Witham of Lartington (now an author on fossil flora),
and others, including William Hutton of Newcastle-on-Tyne,
                                  '
then strong upon his                  whin-sill.'    After all, however,              we
were but a meagre squad to represent                     British science, and           I
never felt humbler in my life than when Harcourt, in his
opening address, referred to me as representing London !
   " Indeed, William
                       Conybeare, afterwards Dean of Llan-
daff, had quizzed us unmercifully,                  as   well     as    W. Broderip
and Stokes, and other men of science.                    The first of these had
said, that       if   a central part of England were chosen for the
meeting, and the science of London and the south were to be
weighed against the science of the North, the meeting ought
to be held in the Zoological Gardens of the Regent's Park                               !
It    required, therefore, no little pluck to fight up against all
this opposition, and all          I can    claim credit for       is,   that
                                                                           I      was   a
hearty supporter of the scheme — codte que codte.1
   " This first
                gathering was in short much like what takes
place    at small Continental              meetings   — we had no regular
sections, but worked on harmoniously                     with our small force
in   cumulo.          The excellent Archbishop            was of great social
use, and gave         a   dignity to the proceedings,        whilst Lord Mor-
peth,    then the young member for Yorkshire, incited us by
speeches as to our future.                 It   was then and there resolved
that we were ever to be Provincials.                  Old Dalton insisted on

     As an illustration of the kind of taunta amid which the British Asso
ciation was born, the following sentence may be quoted from          letter       a
written by  J.  G. Lockhart, editor of the Quarterly Review, to Murchison
just before the meeting — " presume you are going to the colt-show at

this — saying that we should lose all the object of diffusing
knowledge if we ever met in the Metropolis.
      " With all our efforts, however, we
                                                might never have suc
ceeded had not my            dear friend    Dr. Daubeny boldly sug
gested    (and he had no        authority whatever) that we should
hold our second meeting in the University of Oxford                ! !      It
was that second meeting which consolidated us, and enabled
us to take up a proper position.              Then  it was that, seeing
the  thing was going     to succeed, the men of science of the metro
polis and those of the universities joined us."
      A  letter written by Murchison from York, towards the
close   of the meeting, to Dr. Whewell, gives a glimpse of the
enthusiasm with which some of the fellow-labourers               worked
for the Association       : —

the meeting at York has given rise to,            I was very desirous
of weighing the men who were eventually to carry us through.
I was    really very mainly induced to join          it in  consequence
of your letter to "William Vernon, and            I was quite decided
in   so  doing when       I   saw the calibre    of the   men he        had
assembled,      and the promises of support from those                 who
could not attend.      .   . . Brewster really astonished every one
with the brilliancy of his new lights, old Dalton, 'atomic
Dalton,'     reading     his    own   memoirs, and       replying    with
straightforward      pertinacity to every objection in the highly
instructive    conversations which         followed   each paper.     .   .   .
I  had no memoir ready myself, and did not intend to rob the
Geological     Society of anything intended           for them, but          I

Lancashire, who had made some years ago a very important
observation on the existence of shells of existing species in
the gravels     and marls of Lancashire at 300 feet above the
sea,   and at distances of fifteen and twenty miles from the
sea,   was present.     I took   the opportunity of turning lecturer,
and having visited those parts this summer,                    I    brought out
my little druggist with all the            e'clat   he merited.         This is
another practical exemplification of the good arising from such
a reunion.     The Archbishop had all the party on one of the
days, and    it would have gratified the liberality of Cambridge
to have seen old Quaker Dalton on his Grace's right hand.
Pray act cordially with us, and if Adam [Sedgwick], my great
master, and yourself        will only     go along       with us, the third
meeting    will unquestionably        be at Cambridge.               Eely on   it,
the thing must progress, all the good men and true here
present are resolved to make         it   do so."
       Fresh from the field, Murchison had not had time to pre
pare any important paper to inaugurate the                  birth of the new
Association.     But besides bringing forward the finder of the
Lancashire     shells, he took the opportunity of showing the
general nature and tendency of his recent work, by hanging
up the maps which he had used that summer in his tour, and
                           " the Transition
on which he had coloured                    Eocks, the Old
Eed Sandstone, and Carboniferous Limestone," etc., an ex -
hibition of interest to geologists, since           it   was the first which
gave promise that the uncertainty               of the true relations of
the Transition        rocks to the later formations was now at
length to be dispelled.
       At. the close of the meeting the " pair of greys," which
had done such good service already, were again in requisition

to transport        the    travellers       to the east coast.              There, at
Scarborough and its neighbourhood, Murchison                               once more
availed himself of the ever ready co-operation of the illustrious
" Father of English
                      Geology," and renewed his acquaintance
with the rocks of that interesting coast line.                            In   a letter
written     at that time to Mr. Phillips, he reports the first
germ      of a proposal which in its completed form did honour
to the men who                made   it,    and to the Government which
carried    it   into execution.        It   was one of the earliest of          a   long
series of kind-hearted           acts to meritorious but often poor men
of science — acts which,          if   they had not Murchison                  for their
originator, never failed to find in him an active and influential
supporter.       We can picture him among these Yorkshire cliffs,
with the kindly old man, who, though he had done more for
geology than any man then living,                          was      spending the re
mainder of his days in humble quiet at Scarborough.                                 And
those who knew Murchison                     will    recognise       how well fitted
this sight was to touch him                    into active and considerate
benevolence.
      "
      I    have had       a   nice field-day with your uncle at Hack-
ness.      What     is    your opinion, your real opinion,                 as to   what
/or my friends could             really do for him          (i.e.    for his benefit )  ?
It would never do to            bring him to town without something
sure      and good        was   offered.        If    we    could persuade           the
Government          to give him        a    little salary to be geological
colourer of the Ordnance Maps published — do you think                               I
ought to suggest this           ?    I      ask this       as    a   preliminary    :   it
would certainly be of national importance to have these well
done, and lodged           in the Tower and Geological Society."
      This proposal, as we shall               see,   was not        a   mere matter
of form or of transient good-will.                     But before any further

action could be taken, the writer of                  it had        to find his way
back to London,            This he did in the usual circuitous way
which a geologist chooses, travelling through Lincolnshire
and Norfolk in search               of geological sections.                 While at
Norwich he received from his friend Whewell a pressing
invitation to visit Cambridge on the homeward journey, and
as part         of the attraction, was told that " You will find
Sedgwick          full to the teeth with Welsh porphyry and grau-
wacke, and shall hear the legend of his fight with some of
the old spirits of the mountains, who made                       a great resistance
to the process of being geologized— an operation for which
there is no name        I believe in any of the dialects                of the Gaelic   ;
but you know best."            It    was a curious coincidence that the
two         brother   geologists     should     each     independently           have
broken ground in Wales                 in the same year.1                   Sedgwick
unfortunately          had begun the attack in a region of great
complication, Murchison, on the other hand, had been lucky
enough to begin in one of comparatively easy comprehension.
This accidental difference            indirectly led the way to that sad
estrangement          which remains to be told in future chapters.
      This had been in many ways a busy and important year
  1 The following extract from a letter of Sedgwick's to Murchison, 20th
October 1831, gives us an interesting glimpse into the state of the work
when the eager Woodwardian       Professor began it in North Wales : —
" The weather became so bad that            I
                                       was driven out of Carnarvonshire
before      I
        had quite finished my work ; but, God willing, I hope to be in
North Wales next year before the expiration of the first week in May,
and with five months before me, I shall perhaps be able to see my way
through the greater part of the Principality.                I
                                                If live to finish the sur

       shall have terminated my seventh or  eighth summer devoted exclu
sively to the details of the old crusty rocks of the primary system. What
a horrible fraction of a geological life sacrificed to the most toilsome and

ming up what      I saw and what   I realized in the summer of
1831, or   in about four months of travelling,   I may say that
it was the most fruitful year of my life, for in it    I laid  the
foundation of my Silurian System.        I was then   thirty-nine
years   old, and few could excel me in bodily and mental
activity.    'Omnia vincit labor' was my motto then, and         I
have always stuck to    it since."

   WHEN once more back at his post in London, it was one
of Murchison's first cares to prosecute           further the scheme
for doing honour to William Smith.               How his plan pros
pered is best told     in his own words, as written at the time to
                    "
Mr. Phillips : — You know all my heart's desire for our
good   old father in geology.           I  propounded the same (as
expressed     to you) to the Council of the Geological Society
at our first meeting in November, and           I only  waited for the
gathering of the men of office to sound Lord Morpeth on the
feasibility of my plan, and,       if  approved    of by him, then to
throw in a strong memorial to the Government.                Judge of
my delight       then, when     I  found that Lord Morpeth had
anticipated     my wishes, and had already written to Lord
Lansdowne, arguing Smith's merits, and asking for a small
pension.      This application    I was     asked to second, which   I
have    done     by   letter   a few      days  ago   to  Lord  Lans
downe    ; but in doing this      I  have deviated so far from the
original    request,    as to   point     out to Lord    L. that Mr.
 Smith was still capable of doing the State good service.            I

 went into an exposi of the whole thing, and proposed the
 creation of a new appointment, with some such title as
 '
     Geological       Colourer      of       the    Ordnance       Maps
                                                                            '

 meeting all the objections                  and criticisms of the Humists
 which might be directed against sinecure places or pensions,
 but which could not hold good with respect to an office so
 connected         with the development               of the mineral wealth of
 the country as that which               I   have suggested.           "We       shall      see
 what the Lords will do, and in the meantime we had better
 say nothing of        it to Smith."
       They had not          a   long time to wait, for the Government
 granted the venerable              geologist        a pension      of £100          a year
 without         stipulating     that he should colour any Ordnance
 maps.1
       His       position   as    President         of the     Geological Society
required          Murchison's      presence         in London        during winter,
even       if   his enthusiasm for the science and devotion to the
Society had not been amply enough to insure his attendance.
He might well be proud of the choice which the Society had
made.           Thirty years later a friend of his referred to him at
                                                                        "                   fill
one    of the anniversaries of the Society                 as a man         born to
chairs."          During that busy interval he certainly merited
the description.            But in 1831 he sat for the first time                          as a
leader among his scientific brethren, in the chair which had
been held by such men as Greenough,                        Macculloch, Buckland,
and Sedgwick.
      It   was always a great object                 with Murchison,            as   Presi
dent, to get what he called " a good meeting,"                          that         is,   one

out a brisk discussion.                    In his letters to friends in the
country at this time the doings at the Society usually figure
largely.            For instance, writing to Dr. Whewell on the 17th
November he says                 :   — " We    had a capital meeting last night.
1st,      A    memoir           on the     gigantic       Plesio         of Scarborough.
2d,      Old Montlosier               on Vesuvius,       which          drew out a long
and lucid explanation                     from Necker             de     Saussure;    Lyell,
Buckland,             Fitton, Greenough, De la Beche,                          and others
being orators.              Buckland filled up all the parts wanting in
the Plesio, and perfected a monster for those who in a
snowy November night were disposed to nightmare."
         Certainly in those days the meetings of the Geological
Society must have been among the most enjoyable gather
ings in London.                      There was a freshness               about the young
 science, and men               still fought about broad principles, intelli
 gible and interesting to most listeners.                          The inevitable days
 of subdivision             and detail had not yet come.                          "Why not

 to      one       of his Council.             "Dine with us1 at the Crown
 and       Anchor,         and        attend     our    meeting,          where    we shall
 have         the rare union             of old Adam               of Cam, Buckland,
 Conybeare,             etc."        Bare union        indeed!           The only paper
 read at the meeting was by Sedgwick — one                                of those lumin
 ous efforts           which         by a few broad lines served to convey,
 even to non-scientific hearers, a                     vivid notion of the geology
 of a wide region, or of a great geological formation.                                  Em
 balmed in the Society's printed publications, the paper,                                 as
 we read           it now,      bears    about    as   much resemblance              to what
 it must have been to those who heard                             it,   as the dried leaves
 in   a   herbarium do to the plant which tossed its blossoms                             in

the mountain wind.        The words are there, but the fire and
humour with which they rang through that dingy room in
Somerset House have passed away.
     In several of the learned Societies,     and among them the
                                                          "         "
Geological, there had sprung up what were called clubs ;
these were gatherings      of the more prominent members to
dine and talk, and thereafter to adjourn           to the   evening
meeting    of the Society.    Besides promoting good-fellowship
among     the members,     they gave     opportunities   for  much
pleasant scientific gossip, and, what was one of their most
important functions, they kept up       a strong nucleus for the
Society's   ordinary meetings,    to which, after a comfortable
dinner, the club adjourned in a body.           Murchison, at this
time, and to the end of his life, took a leading share in the
business, gustatory and other, of the Geological Club, which
was founded     in 1824.   In  one of his letters he urges a friend
to allow himself to be proposed       for this club, " which we
endeavour    to keep select, where you    will always   meet some
of the choicest spirits, and where you really always pick up
much geology in a quiet way."
     To preside at such meetings must have been one of the
pleasantest    duties a scientific man of that day could per
form.    But over and above his ordinary work for the Society,
the position of President brought with it an accession             of
other   multifarious     duties and engagements.          Professor
                        "
Phillips recalls how men of science who visited London in
1831 were     sure to be courteously met by the President          of
the Geological Society,      then residing in Bryanston      Place,
profuse in hospitality and full of hearty zeal and kindly
sympathy for his brethren         of the hammer,      of whatever
country, which never left him."

1803-31.]     BATTLE IN THE ROYAL SOCIETY.                         197
     But besides these pleasant ways of using his influence,
there sometimes         arose   others where he was called on to
take part in less amicable intercourse.            Thus, one of the
most notable incidents        in the scientific doings in London in
this year was a keen          battle over the Chair of the Royal
Society — a battle into which           Murchison    seems    to  have
thrown       himself with all the ardour of his military youth.
He gives the following account of it : — " On the retirement
of Mr. Davies Gilbert from the chair,         a certain clique in the
Society got up the notion that the Duke of Sussex would be
the best person we could fix upon.          As soon   as the  plot got
wind, the indignation of all the real men of science knew no
bounds,      and they resolved to start Herschel      as an  opponent
to the    Eoyal Duke.       We subscribed our names to a public
protest    ;  about  eighty or ninety names were appended,          in
cluding those of nearly all the notable and working            men in
science.       It was resolved to beat us, and the greatest influ
ence was used politically, royally, and socially to bring up
voters for the so-called royal cause.           I became    an active
canvasser for Herschel.
    " At that time the Royal Society            was  very differently
composed from what         it now is. Any wealthy or well-known
person,      any M.P. or bank director, or East Indian nabob
who wished to have F.E.S. added to his name, was sure to
obtain admittance,        by canvassing and by being elected at
any ordinary meeting.          The consequence was that over all
that class of our body the Royal and Government influence
of the day was overpowering, and even Lord Holland, though
the   gout was on him, was carried up into our meeting
room, where he had never been before, to vote for his royal
friend   !

198                   SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                       [is»-3i.
      "   I   stood    at the top of the stairs                   at Somerset        House,
doing my best to catch                 a vote as   any friend ascended.                 We
were      beaten by 119 to 111.                  Many persons who had seen
our public declaration had felt                  so sure we         should be victors
that they did not come up from the country.                                      But so it
      " The
            election over, the good Duke found himself in a
dilemma.            He wisely saw that he could not govern the
Society        if   he could not make            up a better Council than he
came      in with in 1830.             He therefore resolved to choose his
advisers from among those who had most stoutly opposed
him, and who in fact mainly represented                            the science of the
body.         Overtures were made to myself, and                      I     deemed     it to
be my duty to accept office under a Prince                               who could act
so   liberally and kindly towards his opponents."
      The ground on which this latter step was justified                               may
best be gathered from the following letter                          :—

          MY    DBAS WHEWELL, — Oh for a quiet life                         !     I thought
like a simpleton that reform and cholera were enough to glut
one       with horrors, and my poor and only consolation was
that      I   might absorb myself in science, and                      so       fossilize my
mind and frame              as    to allow       all those shafts to pass by
innocuous.            Our campaign geological opened well with an
excellent memoir by Dr. Christie.                     .   .   .   The point of irrita
tion is nothing in our own good Society, but consists                                in the
formation of a new Council for the Royal, on which they
have placed my name as                    well   as   your own.             I will    begin
with the end, which              is,   that after much conflicting reasoning
with myself         I   have agreed to be on the Council, and                      I   need
not add, that my determination was mainly influenced by

finding we were to have a strong battery, in which             I  could
never disgrace      myself in performing the part of a simple
bombardier.    . .  .  You know    as  well as all my friends with
what zeal   I opposed     His Highness's election, but       I am not
of that school who would cherish a rancorous and perpetual
hostility.  ... I     have got over     all my other scruples, and
intend to go along with things        as they are, and not to fight
against the stream and old time by joining B. and his cold
and comfortless       crew.    In taking this    step  I  feel   that  I
shall be liable to the kind innuendos of some of my ultra
friends, but my most intimate friend Lyell, who is the only
man    in my confidence      on the point, completely approves        of
my conduct."
     " In this                                           " the
               way," to return to the narrative,                 second
Council of the Duke of Sussex's administration was formed.
With his    bonhomie, his ready access at        all times when in
health, and his earnest desire to do what was best in the
interests of science, we who had been his opponents became
his best friends in the sequel.       There was also this advantage
in having him for our chief, that all scientific rivalry was at
an end.
     " As an active member of the Athenaeum Club
                                                             (of which
I  was one of the original 300),      I had a finger in most things
which were stirring among          men of letters, art, and science.
It  was for these men that the club was set up, Davy, Croker,
and Eeginald       Heber being its real founders and earliest
trustees.    I must    say that  it was then a truly sociable and
agreeable society.      Little home dinners of twelve or fourteen
were frequent, Heber or         Davy often presiding, particularly
the former."
     The Presidency of the Geological Society was employed

by Murchison         in a very characteristic way, wherein he con
tinued to distinguish himself up to the end of his life.                He
made     it the ground for gathering at his house, in a more
public     and official form than one could do in a private
capacity, assemblies       in which scientific men mingled freely
with representatives       from that non-scientific society of rank
and fashion to which           he    had always been          so  strongly
attached.       To these gatherings        Mrs.   Murchison      lent her
cordial help, giving        them a charm which added             much to
their popularity.        We shall   see  in the records of later years
how marked this social habit became, and what an import
ant bearing      it had upon the position of      science   in the society
of his day.
     One of the tasks of the President during his two years'
tenure of office, is to prepare an address for the Anniversary
of the Society in February.              It  had    been   customary to
devote that address         to a general survey of the progress of
geology at home and abroad during the previous year — a
labour which in the infancy of the science was not very
arduous, and had proved to be           in the highest degree useful.
Murchison        had now to undertake this task, perilous though
it might be for one who only eight short years before was
known merely for a keen sportsman,             as   ignorant of science
and   as  indifferent to its attractions    as any other of the north-
country squires.         Nevertheless he accepted          the duty and
discharged      it well.    His address, indeed,       lacks the vigour,
originality, and eloquence of his predecessor Sedgwick.1                He
contents himself with a sober outline of the work which had
been done by the Society, and other labourers             in this country
   1 Yet it had the advantage of revision       by Sedgwick, one     or two
effective touches being due to his pen.

and abroad.       But he shows in every page the enthusiasm
•with which he now pursued geology, and gives us pleasant
glimpses of the zeal and good-fellowship which marked the
first generation of the       members      of the Geological Society.
                                                 "
His   concluding sentence runs thus : — Permit me to offer
you my heart-felt wishes for the continuance of your tri
umphant career, and to assure you that                I consider myself
truly ennobled in having       been placed, for a time, at the head
of  a brotherhood       united for purposes         so  great,   and knit
                                                               1
together by such lofty and enduring sympathies."
     As illustrative of     the progress      of Geology in Britain at
the time, it may be mentioned that in this address the Pre
sident   had an opportunity        of noticing Sedgwick's labours
(already referred to) among the rocks of Cumberland and
Westmoreland, Trimmer's discovery of marine shells on Moel
Tryfane in Wales, the appearance of lindley and Button's
Fossil Flora, of the second volume of Lyell's Principles
of   Geology,   and of Macculloch's           System    of  Geology,  the
establishment      of the    British Association,        and the great
increase in number and vigour of local scientific Societies.
To the thoughtful student of the history of science there is
something eminently suggestive            in this conjunction of the
works of Lyell and Macculloch.              The pages of the former
writer glowed with all the fervour of the newer school of
geology, which sprang out of the teachings of                Hutton and
William Smith.         The rocks were no longer treated           as mere
mineral masses, but       as documents       from which the detailed
history of the earth and its inhabitants was to be compiled.
 The remains     of plants and animals now took the place of
importance which mineral species had formerly held, in so
                     1 Proc. GeoL Soc., vol. L p. 386.

much that they gradually monopolized to themselves the
term " fossil," which, in earlier days, had been given indiscri
minately to every mineral substance taken out of the earth.
Appeals    were  made    on every hand to    living nature as a
guide to the changes of past time.          Zoology and botany
became as essential to the geologists     of this younger    creed,
as mineralogy and chemistry had been to their predecessors.
And thus in a few years, from being a mere subordinate
branch of mineralogical inquiry, accused, and not altogether
unjustly,   of indulging   more  in crude speculation than in
sober observation and induction, geology had sprung into a
foremost place among the great divisions of natural science.
This rapid change could receive no fitter acknowledgment
than in the words of Herschel, who said that in the mag
nitude    and sublimity of the      objects of which     it treats,
geology ranks next to astronomy, and that at length         it was
brought effectually within the list of the inductive sciences.
     In the  midst of this glow of fresh thought and of vigorous
 and   ever broadening research,     Macculloch's   System made
 its appearance like the sullen protest of the last high-priest
 of a supplanted religion.      Few had earned a better claim
 than this author to the respect of English geologists for hard,
 shrewd, original work, carried on among        some  of the least
 accessible tracts of the British islands, and described at times
 with a vigour of pen which not many of his brethren of the
 hammer could equal.       He might well have been content to
 rest his reputation upon that early work.        Owing perhaps
 in large measure to bad health, acting upon a temperament
  naturally sensitive, he seemed to regard      Scotland and the
  older rocks generally  as a kind of geological preserve of his
  own, over which, though he had for many years retired from

field-work, he could not brook that any one should -wield a
hammer without some licence from himself.                         Murchison and
Sedgwick had laid themselves                      open to his wrath by their
unauthorized raid into his territory.                       He made no sign at
the time       ;    but a few years afterwards, viz., in 1831, he threw
this System at the heads of his rivals, and in the face of the
geological world.                 The book may be looked upon           as   almost
the last expiring effort of the old mineralogical school of
geology       in Britain.           In perusing   it,   the reader might suppose
himself to be in the midst of the literature of the end of the
previous century.                  Fossil remains are ignored, together with
all the new lines of inquiry which they had opened, and the
rocks are described                 according to their mineral characters,
precisely          as   if   William Smith had never lived.              And yet
the author assures the world that he had kept his manu
script beside             him for ten years, " in the hope that some
better man would                    stand forward        to represent geological
science as         it   is:   but he grieves to say that, during that long
period, geology has scarcely received                   a   valuable addition, and
not      a   single fundamental one."              As President of the Geo
logical Society,             it   was Murchison's duty to repel this state
ment, and to point with just pride to the Transactions of the
Society       as   a    monument of what had been done during those
ten eventful            years.1

    He does not specially refer to Macculloch's treatment of his own
work and that of Sedgwick. Bat no one can read the System without
encountering passages which evidently refer, in by no means      compli  a
mentary tone, to the two fellow-labourers among the Scottish Red Sand

importance of the Society, and the unabating interest of the
science      which   it   cultivates.          In     performing this       function
Murchison       seems to have been so                  well satisfied       with the
success      of his first public geological dinner that he took
some trouble to get            it   reported      in the London papers, and

     " The remainder of the summer was entirely devoted to                    '
researches amidst my new loves, the ' Transition Rocks,' not
only by revisiting the old ground to complete my sections,
but by greatly extending my survey.             I had now determined
to set to and map out the region.            But, alas    !  the Ordnance
maps of a large portion of the country             I had determined to
examine were only in the course               of construction, or not
begun.        But  I  got hold of every scrap         I  could from the
Map Office, then directed by Colby, or from my friend
Major Robe at the Tower, and so            I  set to work      in the terra
incognita to which        I  afterwards (1835) applied the name of
Siluria."
       If it be true,  as Bacon asserted, that
                                                   "
                                                     writing maketh an
exact man," it is no less true that mapping makes an exact
geologist.      Without this kind of training, it is not easy to
grasp accurately the details of geological structure,                    and
hence the literature of the science is sadly overloaded with
papers and books which, had their authors enjoyed this pre
liminary discipline, would either not have been written, or
would at least have been more worthy of perusal.                    Murchi-
son wisely resolved not to trust merely to eye and memory,
but to record what he saw          as  accurately    as he      could upon
maps.       And there can be no doubt that by           so   doing he gave
his work a precision and harmony which it could never have
otherwise possessed,          and that, even      though       still falling
into some errors,         he   was  enabled    to   get     a firmer    hold
of the structure of the country which he had resolved to
master      than he could have        obtained in any other way.
For, to make his maps            complete,   he was driven          to look
into all manner of out-of-the-way nooks and corners, with
which, but for that necessity,          he might have           been   little

likely to make acquaintance.       It often happens that in such
half-hidden places — the course of a mountain torrent, the
bottom of     a tree-shaded ravine, the gully cut by the frosts
and rains of centuries from the face of a lonely hillside —
lies the key to the geological structure of the neighbourhood,
In   pursuit of his quest, therefore, the geologist is driven to
double back to and fro over tracts never trodden perhaps by
the ordinary tourist, but is many     a time amply recompensed
 by the unexpected insight which this circuitous journeying
 gives him into the less obtrusive beauties of the landscape.
      Though Murchison had already learnt something of the
 devious nature of a field-geologist's path through a country,
 he had never before tried anything       on BO   detailed and ex
 tensive a scale.      At one time he might        have   been    seen
 measuring sections in Shropshire;        soon thereafter, led on
 by the     rocks, he   had   got   away west into        Pembroke.
 Thence, following up his game, he tracked           it through    the
 wilds   of Montgomery      and Radnor, or south to the bills
 overlooking the great Welsh coal-field, and back again into
 the English borders.      For weeks and months together this
 work went on.         Much of the ground proved difficult to
 unravel, and cost its explorer many a restless        night, for he
 had now got his head so     full of grauwacke, transition rocks,
 and Old Red Sandstone, that he seems to have been able to
 think or dream of nothing else.         From his notes, however,
  we may conjecture that though his days were          given to hard
  work out of doors, the evenings were often pleasantly spent
  under the hospitable roof of the country gentlemen of the
  region, some of them old friends, who       still enjoyed a quiet

     From the mass of letters which he allowed to accumulate
from month to month, some idea can be gathered                 of the
multifarious    and distracting   calls which were daily made
upon his time and attention during the years of his Pre
sidency.     The undisturbed early hours before breakfast are
given up to the elaboration of his notes.         The morning post
brings    perhaps,  among   other epistles,    a    wail from some
country geologist,    because he has heard no tidings           of an
elaborate memoir which he had sent up to the President,
 in the confident belief that it would at once exercise the
 collective  wisdom of    the   Society.     In    the forenoon he
has to attend a meeting     of committee for securing Abbots-

after giving up an hour or two to him, he finally takes to
Somerset House         and consigns to the courtesy of the re
spected Curator, Lonsdale.         In  the evening, unless, as often
happened, he had engaged himself to dine out, or to hold                a
geological reception at home, he could attend to his corre
spondence,      or, if that had been      already accomplished, he
might snatch a few hours to prepare an account of his
labours in the field for the Society, his wife at his side pre
paring his drawings and otherwise aiding in the work.
       And yet, despite these numerous avocations, time and
opportunity were both found for a flight now and then from
the bustle of London to the field-sports and friendly inter
course of a country house.         Witness the following account of

my return from Cheltenham, and we paid               a visit of a week
to Lord Milton, in Northamptonshire,            and  I must    say that I
 never enjoyed a winter week more.             He gave me a mount
 on    a capital thoroughbred, son of Cervantes, but the day was
 unlucky.      It  was a woodland fox found       in the Bedford pur
 lieus, which took us right into the heart of old           's preserves,
 where the Earl and his Christmas friends were dropping the
 long-tails.    You must excuse me if I say that the ex-Minister
 in his threadbare tartan, patch over his eyes, hat twisted up

Greenough is to be my successor."
     The continuous writing to which he refers was required
for the preparation of the presidential address at the forth
coming anniversary in February.          In looking back over the
pages    of that forgotten document, we meet with notices of
several landmarks in geology, showing in what an eventful
period of the history of his favourite science the life of the
writer had been cast.         Among   the names of those     whose
recent deaths he had to chronicle, and whose deeds it was
his duty to record, were Sir James          Hall and Cuvier — the
one standing at the head        of physical geology, and linking
that generation with the early glories of the Huttonian
school   ; the other acknowledged to be the great master of
that newer school of palaeontology          which had so greatly
altered the aspect and the aims     of geological inquiry.  Among
the topics of then recent discussion, he alludes to the erratic
boulders      (" foundlings,"  as the Swiss    have called them),
which, strewn over the plains of Europe, were beginning to
attract attention    as evidence  of some flood from the North —
the first beginning       of the deciphering of that wonderful
chronicle which has laid before us at last the story of the
Ice Age in Europe.          Among    the announcements of new
work he gives a sketch of his own labours among the old
rocks of the West, and alludes to those        of Sedgwick.     But
his most important item on this head was the reference            to
the foundation of the Geological Survey, that great national
undertaking, over which, some two-and-twenty            years later,
he was himself destined to preside,        and in charge of which
he spent almost the last sixteen years of his life.           Very
modest was its earliest equipment.         Mr. Henry de la Beche

had been appointed, in connexion with the Ordnance Survey,
" to affix
             geological colours to the maps of Devonshire, and
portions of Somerset,       Dorset, and Cornwall."          To the tact
of that sagacious man the Survey owed its existence, and to
his energy and skill it is indebted for its present importance,
 and the great work which        it   has so far accomplished.
      Writing late in life, and looking back upon this early
 part of his scientific career in London, Murchison penned
 the following reminiscences        : — " During all   these years, viz.,
  1826-38,  1  inhabited No.    3  Bryanston Place, and, though           I
 had but a small establishment,          I saw very   agreeable society,
for, independent of my scientific friends,            I was   visited by
 men in public life, as well as by the lovers of science, letters,
 and the arts.      With Hallam        I was  in constant intercourse,
 and also with Lockhart, and with both of these very different
 men    I kept  up an intimacy to their death.          When Lockhart
 came to London every one was afraid            of the author of Peter's
 Letters to his   Kinsfolk, the more so       as the Whigs were rabid
 against him    ; but with intimacy his reserve wore off, and             I
 declare   that, amongst my friends,          I never   knew one who
 was more lively, amusing, and confiding in dual converse,
nor one whose loss      I more    sincerely mourned.        If  he was a
good hater he was assuredly a warm friend.
      " Shortly after Bulwer came to London             I asked   him to
 dine, but did not tell him whom he was to meet.                 He had
just issued his Paul Clifford, and, meeting for the first time
at my table, Lockhart, who had cut             it up unmercifully, the
young author took huff (for he was then a proud young
dandy), and thought        I had    done so to annoy him.          It  re
quired all Chautrey's        good-humour        to keep the party to
 gether.

bring this remarkable woman and Wollaston together, and

perfect idea of his versatile powers.                 He was the bosom

others.       These parties were really intellectual           ; but now that
I live in a big      house   in Belgrave Square my grand dinners
are   dull horrors — and it is only when           I can    manage to have
a small one that        I enjoy  seeing company.
      " I meddled little in
                                  public matters or politics, though
my feeling was Conservative, and               I  was one of those who
was,     I  confess,   alarmed at the great sweep                about to be
effected     by the Eeform        Bill.   So   I   attended       the debates
both in Lords and Commons, and was present at the whole
of the last day's debate in the latter, and which did not close
till  five A.M.
      " To resume my recollections of my earliest scientific
friends in London         :   I  must specially dwell on the great
botanist Eobert Brown, who was chiefly to be met with at the
Sunday breakfasts of Charles Stokes in Gray's Inn, and who
    1 It is said
                 (Timbs's Lives of the Humourislt, vol. ii. p. 276) that Sydney
Smith and Theodore Hook met at table only twice : first at the house of
Lady Stepney, where " they were both delightful and mutually delighted;"
aud secondly, soon after, on the occasion mentioned in the text, where they
met in a somewhat larger party, but where poor Hook's failing became
only too visible.

 214            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
provoked       my impatient       temper because lie never would
pronounce upon the genus — scarcely even upon the class —
of a fossil plant.       Profound in his acquaintance with       living
plants, he knew too well the fine limits and subtle distinc
tions to be observed       ; these being generally obliterated,     and
the fructification     being rarely visible, he paused and looked
again and again, and came to no conclusion.                Lindley, on
the other hand, being of a less cautious temperament, often
dashed    off an opinion,        and therefore gratified geologists.
Kobert    Brown, though a quiet sedate man, was             full of dry
humour, and told many a good story to his intimate friends,
among whom         I was  delighted to be reckoned    till  the day   of
his death.       I   was one of the mourners at his burial at
Kensal Green, when this illustrious man had but a few old
friends to pay the last honours.           How different was it but
the   day before      yesterday, when the popular novelist          was
interred in the same place         ! Doubtless,  so good a    master  of
English,    so  smart a satirist, so warm-hearted a friend, and
so attractive a writer       as Thackeray, merited    all the eulogy
which has been poured out on his character by all the press.
But if a man of science dies, however eminent he be, a
passing commendation is all he obtains, and            it is doubtful
 whether the compilers of such works as the Annual Register
 will  ever  think it right to allude to the death of the first
 botanist of our era.        Nor can a different verdict be expected
 from the masses or the fashionable world.          Every one knows
 Cornhill and Punch, Pendennis or Vanity Fair, or some one
 of Thackeray's good novels, and so that author obtained a
 good share     of the public applause which the nation accorded
 to "Walter Scott, whilst the Princeps Botanicorum of Europe
  dies unknown by       English scribes.

      "Among my intimates and correspondents of the first
years of my geological career     I must    not omit to mention
 George William Featherstonhaugh.        He has played a bustling
and useful part through life, has published on a vast variety
of subjects, and was a most lively, agreeable companion.       He
was the first to introduce our modern ideas of geology into
the United States, which he did with great energy in the
year 1831.     Afterwards   he induced General Jackson, then
                                    '
the President,    to appoint him State Geologist,' in which
capacity he made two extensive tours, illustrating them with
long sections.  . . . In the French revolution      of 1848, when
Louis Philippe fled from Paris and was hid in a cottage with
Queen Ame"lie on the south bank of the Seine opposite to

                    THE SILURIAN     SYSTEM.
    DURING     the tenure of his Presidency of the Geological
Society Murchison had greatly raised his scientific        position
in the country, both in regard to power of original geological
work, and to that practical turn      of mind and suavity          of
manner which fit a man to play a prominent             and useful
part among his fellow-men.      He hardly as yet realized the
real importance of the field-work which he had been carry
ing on among the Transition       rocks.    Very slowly     as   the
years passed away did he come to         see  how full of signi
ficance    were the sections which he had brought to light
along the Welsh borders.
     A  few weeks after resigning the Chair of the Society he
gave the first detailed account    of what he had been doing
                                          the " transition rocks

which has since become            so familiar to geologists.1
      Released from work in town, Murchison sped back to his
rocks on the Welsh frontier, and passed the summer of 1833
in constant travel and work among them, " rummaging the
country,"     as he said,    in search of fossils and evidences of the
                                                                                     /

became       a partner    in the tramp, and while he made more                      /
distant forays, employed her pencil on some of the sketches
which afterwards appeared to such good purpose in the

the appearance at the inn of that " famous talker, Richard
 Sharp," who, in taking leave of the enthusiastic geologist,
 remarked to him, " Well, my good fellow,                I feel  assured that
 you    will end in becoming Lord Grauwacke."
      While increasing his knowledge of the rocks, Murchison
 managed       also to augment his           acquaintance with the             in
 habitants      of the country.          Not always, however, to the
 advantage       of his scientific pursuits, for,        as he used       to say
 later in life, "Good living in an aristocratical mansion is
 hostile to geological research.           I must honestly       declare     that

in general   I have    done      twice   as  much work when quartered
in an inn."        It  was in such a mansion, however, that a
project took its rise during this autumn, which came in                        the
end to make one of the landmarks                    of his life, and at the
same time an epoch          in the literature of geology.              His friend
Mr.   Frankland Lewis              had suggested         that he should not
be content    with the limited circle of readers which perused
          View of the Breidden Hills near Welsh Pool, from Powis Castle.

should appeal to a wider public, and elaborate into a separate
volume his researches            among     the old rocks of the English
and Welsh border-land.               This idea found a warm supporter
in Lord Clive, at Powis Castle, where Murchison                           agreed
to undertake       the task          Before     the middle       of November
Lord Clive announced to him a list of eighty subscribers to
the proposed work.

       " I have truly   done much work this summer," he writes
  to Mr. Phillips,   "
                       having been seventeen weeks hammering,
  with only one day of intermission.            But you gallop when
  you suppose     I am   ready for the press.        Absorbed in your
  own great undertaking,1 you have not had time to think of
  the magnitude of mine.         Imprimis, My inquiries range over
  seven counties, and they dive into the arcana           of formations
  of which no precursor has written           one  line !    Hence each
  succeeding year in which        I propagate    the principles    of our   ,
  craft, and enlist raw recruits in provinces where the sound
  of the word geology was never heard before,                 I  find on
 revisiting   my fields of battle that my aides-de-camp have
 collected facts, and facts alter preconceived notions."
      And so the work went on from the Vale of Severn to
 St. David's.    The proposed big book could not possibly make
 its appearance     until after far more complete and detailed
 examination.       Meanwhile     each summer's      labours were duly
 communicated in abstract to the Geological Society.                From
 his friends there, such as Greenough, Lonsdale, and Phillips,
 came letters    of encouragement which brought the enthusi
 astic geologist back to London           with renewed energy for
 work.      The campaign of the autumn of 1833 ended by
*the despatch of five boxes full of specimens             from the old
 " grauwacke " of the west to the
                                         apartments of the Geologi
 cal Society.      Lonsdale, ever catering for the wants of the
 Society, looked forward with his quiet glee to ever so many
 evenings of amusement and instruction to be had out of these
 boxes    and the notes by which they were to be illustrated.
 We can picture him in his little den at Somerset                  House
 surrounded with books, papers, and specimens,              rubbing his

    and North Wales,                  and the President        of the Geological
    Society hacking            at him all along the Welsh border, hia
    doom was evidently sealed.
            "Perhaps no one better than Lonsdale comprehended
    the true meaning of the work which Murchison undertook.
    Certainly no one gave more effectual assistance in the often
    delicate task of clearing up in the calmness of the closet the
    difficulties which frequently misled the eager enthusiast in
.   the field.          Murchison was never slow in acknowledging his
    great obligation to his patient and right-judging                   friend."1
            Mr. Lonsdale's anticipations were fully realized during
    that session of 1833-4.              From the note-books of the previous
    summer Murchison furnished four separate papers on differ
    ent parts         of the geology of the districts among which he had
    been at work.             One of these contained the first published
    table of the Transition rocks of England and Wales, in which
    they were parcelled out into distinct formations, each char
    acterized by a peculiar assemblage of organic remains.                       The
    arrangement showed a considerable elaboration and                               im

were to be concentrated.                    By the month of August all the

preparation.     But much still required to be done in the field
in tracing out the geological changes in the long strip of
country through which the Transition rocks extended.         Hence
as soon as he could get away from         town Murchison buckled
on his hammer again, and betook himself to a re-examina
tion of his old ground in Shropshire and adjoining counties.
Up till this time Sedgwick and he had been labouring
independently      among   the old grauwacke rocks, as      if  each
had got hold of a very distinct problem which could be, and
indeed needed to be, separately solved.        The domains which
they had seized were          conterminous, and tacitly a sort of
'bateable    land had been allowed to stretch between          them.
It was    in the summer of this year (1834) that they met to
arrange,    if possible, an amicable adjustment of boundaries.
 Sedgwick crossed over into his friend's territories to make
with him a conjoint tour, which was thus described at the
time in two letters from Murchison to Dr. Whewell, dated
 18th   July: —
     " ' The first of men   '

 as firm as    I ever knew them)       toward Denbighshire.       We
 not only put up our horses together, but have actually made
 our formations embrace each other in a manner so true, and
 therefore so affectionate,      that the evidence thereof would
 even melt the heart,     if it  did not convince the severe judg
 ment, of some Cantab, mathematicos of my acquaintance."
      "Having dovetailed our respective upper and lower

not a little proud of having such a pupil                  ;  and   although I

of the Salopian lasses or not is in his own breast                 ;  but  I  can
assure you that a whole houseful of them are deeply smitten
with him.        When we parted at Ludlow it was found that he
had left that beautiful brown coat of his in the very house

    1 From this letter it will be seen that Murchison at least was fully con
vinced of the dovetailing of his groups of rock with the older slaty masses
on which Sedgwick had been at work more to the north and west. Aa
we shall find, he published this conviction without note or protest from
his friend, who indeed publicly accepted and declared the same belief (see
postea,   p. 230).   Many years afterwards, however, when bitterness had
arisen between these two comrades, and when perhaps the recollection of

      The British Association           held its meeting this year             in
Edinburgh.           Thither the two fellow-labourers              made    their
way, the one to resign the Presidency which he had held so
successfully at Cambridge, the other to show his Grauwacke
and    Old Red Sandstone maps, and to take                   a share     in the
task of still further           consolidating     and strengthening           the
infant Association.
      In    a letter written to    Sir Philip Egerton on his way south
again      to the    Welsh and Shropshire rocks, Murchison thus

what actually took place at the time with which we are dealing had be
come in aome measure indistinct,         Sedgwick penned and published an
account of this first conjoint tour in Wales, differing considerably from
that given in the letter quoted in the text.      He says, — " There were early
difficulties, both physical and palieontological, in distinguishing the Lower
Silurian from the Upper Cambrian groups, and in fixing their true geo
graphical limits, and it was partly in the hopes of settling such points of
doubt that in 1834 I went, during six weeks, under my friend's personal
guidance, to examine the order of succession as established by himself in
the typical Silurian country.      Beginning therefore at Llandeilo, and end
ing the first part of our joint work at Welsh Pool, we examined many of
hU best sections. Occasionally, while he was working out minute details,
1 spent some days in collecting fossils.    ...   I believed his sections, so far
as  I saw them,     to be true to nature ; and  I never suspected (nor had he
then suspected) any discordancy or break of continuity amongst his typical
rocks from the Upper Ludlow down to the Llandeilo groups.              I adopted
                  I
all his groups, may say, with implicit faith, never dreaming of a chance,
(during a rapid visit) of correcting those elaborate sections on which he had
bestowed so much successful labour. . . . We never examined or discussed
together the Silurian base-line in the country south of Welsh Pool ; and what
ever be the merit or demerit of the base-line afterwards published in the map
of the ' Silurian system,' belongs exclusively to my friend. [Seepostea, p. 307.]

As to this base-line, neither gave nor had I an opportunity of giving any
opinion, either good or bad. . . . North of Welsh Pool we reached a country
(east of the Berwyns) with which       I was previously acquainted. . . . My
friend now made use of and interpreted some of my field sections of 1832.
...    I  guided my friend (as he in his Silurian country had guided me) over
the Berwyn chain to the Bala limestone, along the high road from Rhaiadr
to Bala.      We made    no mistake  in the section. .  . . My  friend then de-

without vanity, that we geologicals were all the fashion, and
engrossed        by far the greater share of attention.           Agassiz has
pronounced that not one of the fossils of the Burdiehouse
limestone are reptiles, but all belong to fishes.                 You will be
amused to read old Buckie's lecture, given two nights before
Agassiz made his decision against the reptiles, for in it the
reptiles made a grand figure.               My   fishes  in the Old Eed are
baptized Cephalaspis, from their horse-shoe heads.                       ... I
was a day at Lord Melville's,              after which Sedgwick and self
moved on together to Sir               John Hall's at Dunglass          to look
at St. Abb's Head and the Siccar Point, both famous by the
writings of Hutton, Playfair,             and Hall.     Whilst at Dunglass
clared that the Bala limestone waa no part of hia Silurian system."          The
Professor points out the error in classifying the Bala rocks as underlying
ail the Silurian groups, their true place being the equivalent of that of the
Caradoc rocks in the lower Silurian series.       He asserts that for this error,
hardly avoidable at the time it was made, Murchison was alone responsible.
It  is difficult to see on what evidence this charge rests. One fact at least
is certain, that if Murchison      started the error, Sedgwick adopted it and
believed it for years, although, according to hia own showing, the means
existed in his own territory of putting the matter to rights at once.        "A
single traverse from Glyn Ceiriog to the northern end of the Berwyn
chain would      have settled this question on evidence not short of a physical
demonstration.       But we did not make this traverse." — British Palaeozoic
Fossils, Introduction,     pp. xliii-xlv (1855).   But evidence may be found
in Sedgwick's own letters to show that he thought and wrote under
at least the impression that his own Welsh rocks were older than those of
Mnrchison.        Thus even so far back as February 1833 he wrote to his
friend in reference to a proposed dovetailing of their work : — " The upper
system of deposits, with its subdivisions, is as plain as daylight, and
entirely under your set."       It would be easy to multiply quotations from
contemporary geological literature to show that this was the general im
pression among geologists as to the views of the two pioneers in Wales.
As an illustrative example, reference may be made to the first edition of
Lyell's Element* of Geology, published in 1838, before the appearance of
Murchison's Silurian System.         See p. 464, where Sedgwick is given as
the authority for calling Cambrian a vast thickness of stratified rocks,
"below the Silurian strata in the region of the Cumberland lakes, in X.
Wales, Cornwall, and other parts of Britain."         This subject will come up
again in later chapters of this biography.

I fell in with my old friend Lord Elcho, who has set up a
very crack pack of fox-hounds, and he so tempted me                            with
the offer of   a  mount on his best nag, that               I could    not refuse    ;
and   I am   still suffering from the stiffness incident to this
frolic, not having been accustomed to screw to my seat                           for
the last ten years.          Sedgwick and myself explored the head
land together, and in the boat we had with us our host,                          Sir
John Hall, and Archibald Alison,                     a clever young          Scotch

     Murchison's journals of this period of his life read very
much like the field notes of an active geologist.                          Personal
detail is wholly wanting, and the gist of the scientific work
has long been given to the world.                     From the letters which
he has preserved,          we can      see   what a voluminous correspon-

wards introduced into Siluria (4th edit., p. 149), and is reproduced here.

dence he must have kept up            with friends who lived among
his grauwacke rocks, and from whom he derived continual
assistance     in the shape of notes on the geology, and of fossils.
He acknowledged, in his published writings, the value of this
co-operation, and gave the names of his principal coadjutors.
Even the very children of some of his friends were enlisted
in his    service, and delighted to get away into the quarries to
hunt for fossils for him       ;  and at a time when these fossils
had never been systematically             collected and described,     it
may easily be imagined that this juvenile                help proved in
many cases eminently serviceable.
       It was now plain, after     all these campaigns, that though
many details might be added afterwards, the grand order of
succession      of the grauwacke had only been made more clear
by every new examination.              It  had been subdivided      into
four well-marked         formations, each as defined by mineral
characters and fossils as any members of the secondary
series.     To continue     to apply     the terms "grauwacke" or
" transition"      to these   distinct    fossiliferous   formations, as
well as to all the old crumpled unfossiliferous rocks, would
evidently lead to endless confusion.           They required a special
name.       The story of their nomenclature is thus told by
Murchison himself :— " At this time               I proposed the term
'
  Silurian,'    and  it came about in this way.          My friend, the
eminent French geologist,        filie de Beaumont, seeing what a
clear classification      I had made out by order of superposi
tion and characteristic fossils in each descending formation,
earnestly urged me to adopt a name for the whole of the
natural groups.        Seeing that the region in which the best
types of     it occurred was really the country of the Silures
of the old British King Caractacus,               I  adopted  that name

    [Silurian].             I had seen that       all geological names founded on
    mineral or fossiliferous characters had failed to satisfy, and
    that fanciful Greek names were still worse.                           Hence it seemed
    to me that a well-sounding                     geographical term, taken from
    the very region wherein the classification had been elabo
    rated, and where every one might go and see the truthfulness
    of   it,   was the best."1
          The      first publication            of this new name took place              in
    July       1835     in the pages of the London and Edinburgh Philo
    sophical Magazine.               In   a     brief article the author gives his
    reasons        for the proposed term, with some improvements of
    his previous tabular              statement,          and   a   woodcut section to
    show the way in which the rocks are related to each other
•   in their several subdivisions.                   As the parent of all subse
    quent Silurian sections, the diagram possesses                          a   peculiar in
    terest     :   a   facsimile of   it   is   inserted on the opposite page.*
          Before         leaving town           for the    usual         summer work in
    Siluria he headed            a   deputation to Government to represent
    the urgent need of            a   good map of the northern                  half of the
    island —       a    subject which had occupied the attention of the
    British Association at Edinburgh.   Writing in later years

    his formations,    well shown in a letter of ten large pages which he
                            is
    addressed to Dr. Whewell on 20th November 1834, " as the great Geolo
    gical Nomenclator," entreating his assistance in improving his tabular list
    of the grauwacke rocks.
         This section shows in kind of rough general way the order in which
                                      a
    the successive divisions follow each other.    It    inaccurate, however,

    measures down to the base of the Llandeilo rocks, and places the latter
    rocks in a violent unconformability upon those of older date.  It was the
    general belief, as already remarked, that the
                                                      "  Silurian" formations
    described by Murchison belonged to a younger series of deposits than
    the rocks of North Wales investigated by Sedgwick.

of the Exchequer, received us blandly, and with his Irish
blarney joked me off by saying that        I had    hunted very well
in Leicestershire with the Melton map, and made several
good    shifts.   He avowed, however,        that until Ireland got
her map we should or could not get ours.               And so it has
proved."
     In   its cycle of changes   the British Association      held its
meeting this year (1835) in Dublin.           We have here no fur
ther concern with this assembly than that            it was attended
by Murchison       and Sedgwick, and that they conjointly gave
there an account of what they had each been                  doing   to
" poor old Grauwacke."        The chief feature of interest about
this  communication       is the light   it   casts  upon the views
which the two friends entertained of the connexion of their
respective areas of work.         And this becomes        a matter   of
some     importance    in relation to the subsequent unhappy
estrangement.       Sedgwick now gave the name of Cambrian
to the rocks among which          he had hammered so much            in
Cumberland        and Wales.     There cannot be the slightest
doubt that at this time, together with Murchison and geolo
gists generally, he regarded        his Cambrian      masses as older
than    the Silurian rocks.        His   colleague    stated  that   in
South Wales he had traced many passages from the bottom
of the Silurian system down into the slaty rocks now called
Upper Cambrian.          He himself made no opposition to this
view  ;   on the contrary, after showing that the lowest Silurian
group was connected with his highest series in the chain of
the Berwyns, he proceeded          "to explain the      mode of con
necting      Mr. Murchison's     researches    with his own."        It
turned out in the end that this notion was erroneous, and
that the upper half of Sedgwick's Cambrian rocks was simply

 a prolongation of the lower half of Murchison's                Silurian.
 But it was an error in which at this time both of the geo
 logists must be regarded as participating.
      The following    memoranda from journal and letters give
 us some notion of the doings of the autumn of this year : —
 "       A frolic in the north of Ireland with Sir P. Egerton,
 Lord Cole, Sedgwick, my wife, and others, when                  I  made
 some good geological notes.         In  clambering along the steep
slope [near Giant's Causeway], Sedgwick lost his head, and we
 much feared that he would fall into the           sea.   Griffith alone
 crossed the Devil's      Bridge, Sedgwick, Cole, Colonel Mont
gomery, and self, having turned back and gone up the                  hill
 and round.     My wife    boated   all the way and made sketches,
and joined us at the comfortable inn of Bush Mills, where
 we had a very jolly party."         Thereafter "    I  returned to my
old hunting grounds of the Silurian region."
      "A
           pleasant visit at Hagly, but        I took care to stick to
the tail of the Dudley field, which         I finished   off (ordering a
new gun of Westly Richards in a parenthesis).                  In Tort-
worth   I laboured hard      for four or five days, and having com
pleted my map,     I then took my departure for Pembrokeshire,
sending Madam on to the neighbourhood of Bath to visit
some old friends     till  I  became    a free man.      I spent   a day
with Conybeare on my road.            I  then set to work in Pem
broke most vigorously, and after three weeks of incessant
labour, every day's work proving to me how much                I   had to
do,   I left off, perfectly satisfied with having completed             a
very handsome       tail-piece    for my Silurians, who are now
regularly launched in three bays in Pembrokeshire.                  What
an absurd name does this Grauwacke now appear to be                   !—

        This self-imposed seclusion would have been serious had
   it been carried out, for the big book did not make its ap
   pearance      for three years afterwards.           The volume grew far
   beyond the dimensions originally proposed.                 In   its prepara
   tion, too, questions were continually occurring which made
   a re-examination       of the ground either desirable or necessary.
   Hence, although the winters were spent in tolerably close
   application to the desk, the summer months commonly saw
   the pen willingly exchanged for the hammer.
        As season after season stole past without bringing his
   work to light, some even of his geological friends began to

   Phillips in the spring of 1836 : —

   into their senses) that physical geography is of some im
   portance even to senators."
          In such busy but uneventful        routine the three years
   1836-1839 passed away, the chief feature in each of them
   being the autumn meeting of the British Association,              at
   which, whether called from the desk or the hill-side,         Mur-
   chison did not fail to make his appearance.
/        "In  the year 1836,"     he writes,  "I  had a good deal of
   anxiety on account of my dear mother, whose health had
  been failing, and to whom         I had gone at Cheltenham    in the
   spring.     This was a cholera year, and my wife having gone
  down to       see her mother at Nursted House,      I went  in June
  into Devonshire with Sedgwick to try to understand the
  complicated geology of that county."         •
         This tour in the south-west of England proved to be
  the beginning        of a series of explorations carried on for
  three years        conjointly by the two geologists,     which re
  sulted in the establishment of the Devonian system in geo
  logy.      For the sake of clearness it will be best to trace
  out that story by itself in the next chapter.         In  the mean
  time we may merely note in passing when and where the
  explorations were carried on, until we reach the culmination
  of the Silurian work in the publication of " the big book."
  It will      then be    easy   and may be useful      to turn back
  for details, and follow        out the history of the Devonian

question,    which      thus   to   some   extent  overlapped    the
 Silurian.
      An excellent start    was made during this first excursion
into Devonshire, and, as we shall afterwards find, materials
were gathered     for a bold announcement to the meeting of
the Association at Bristol.         "At that meeting," to resume
                   "
our quotations, the fun of one of the evenings was a lecture
of Buckland's.     In that part of his   discourse which treated   of
 Ichnolites, or fossil foot-prints, the Doctor exhibited himself
as a cock    or a hen on the edge of a muddy pond, making
impressions by lifting one leg after the other.       Many of the
grave people thought our science was altered to buffoonery
by an Oxford Don.
      " After the
                     meeting my mother became rapidly worse,
and died at the age of sixty-five,         my sister Jeanette   and
myself being present in her last sufferings.        I buried her in
the same grave with my father, at the little church of Bath-
hampton, near Bath.         In  the same churchyard    my mother's
brother, my old general, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, has since
been interred.     No man ever had a more affectionate mother
than myself, her only defect being over-indulgence           of her
children."
     At   the end of the Bristol meeting the Woodwardian
Professor went down into Devon and Cornwall to do some
further hard work among the rocks there.           He was at that
time intent on getting a clue to the history of the joints by
which rocks are      so  abundantly traversed.     But Murchison,
having     manuscripts     and proof-sheets     on hand, did    not
accompany him, though once again the unwearying explorer
of Siluria found cause to go over part of his old sections to
verify them, driving from town to town in a butcheT'i          r"*"*

which he had hired for the purpose.                  His friend Phillips met
him by appointment at Brecon, to examine with him the
curious little tract of Corn y Vaen, and the Professor has
made the following memoranda of the journey : —" Welsh
ponies were in requisition, and we reached the hill, hoping
to escape the jealous company of the Welsh farmer, who
looked upon the men of the hammer                    as some       kind of miners
secretly prowling            for gold or coal.           Murchison had paid
many visits, and had tried                to explain          to the inquisitive
agriculturist         why the barren grey rocks prominent above
        '                    '
the       Old Eed Sea had so much interest in his eyes.                          On
this occasion         I  also had to encounter
                                                        '

mountain,'         because       my clinometer was in great                use    in

and other strange              phrases, made our friend very angry, so
that, unlike Welshmen in general, he offered us no kind of
welcome or refreshment, but appeared to rejoice in our going
away as a relief from some positive evil."
       Back in London again among his books and papers,                      Mur
chison writes on November 21st                to Sir Philip Egerton : —

known he never could get up again.                              I know not how            it is

       Sedgwick had promised to share in the preparation of a

to week the completion of his task.                              Chafing at this delay

were correlated with the Keuper and Bunter formations of
 Germany.         The paper was referred by the Council of the
 Society to Sedgwick, and here is his opinion of it as given
to Murchison himself        : —
       "I    have   reported favourably      on your paper on the
 Keuper, and said that it ought to be printed.           But was ever
 such   a blotched, patched, botched, scratched, blurred, bothered
 thing sent to an arbitrator      ! with a prospectus, too, of certain
 plates affixed like a tin case to its tail,     I suppose to make    it
 go.     It  made me mutter bad words through my teeth many
 times over before      I got  to the end of it.    Perhaps   I did not
 swear outright     ;  but you have no right to tempt me."
      This description of the author's style of caligraphy is not
 more graphic than true.           His manuscript as it went to the
 printers was usually so scored, and crossed, and rewritten, as
 to be      sometimes    with difficulty    legible even by himself.
 When the proof came back it soon grew under his pen
 nearly as bad      as the   original manuscript, and many a time
 had to be set up afresh.         His publisher said of him that     he
 " wrote in
                type."
       It   was in the elaboration of chapter after chapter of
 such exasperating manuscript that         a good  part of the summer
 of 1837 passed away.          The affairs of the British Association
 entailed indeed a large amount of correspondence            and other
 duties upon a General Secretary.             The meeting this year
 at Liverpool      drew Murchison       as usual out of his den       at
 Bryanstone Place, and gave him a week of hard work and
 incessant festivity.         For by degrees the rigidly scientific
 aspect      of the Association     had come to be more veiled by
  the abundant hospitality and good            cheer  with which the
  members were welcomed.            Each town to which they came

     Liverpool received them on this occasion           with the most
lavish expenditure.          As General Secretary, Murchison had
more than enough to do, but he found time to                   send    the
following notes to his wife : —
    " The                                              Turtle daily at

they go back to country            quarters  ?    We dine with the
 Mayor to-morrow, whose           lady has a grand       soire'e   in the
evening, and thus begin our frolics."
     "You     are a reasonable     woman, and know what a week
 I  have   had   !   nothing have    I  done   but dream, work, and
think for the Association.          All  has   gone off admirably,       in
 spite of wind and weather.           The conversazione and lighter
 parties for the evening have been much               preferred to the
 dull affairs of former meetings, and the splendid fete given
 in the Botanical Gardens to 2600 persons, all of whom were
 fed, and for which        fortunately the day of Friday was fine,
 contributed no little to the complete success of the thing.
 Last night we had our finale, and all our thanks."
     The rest of 1837, and nearly the whole of the next year
                                                    "

 and the seeing of it through the press, with the drawing
 and engraving of the map and numerous illustrations with
 which    it  was     enriched.    Not, however,    without      an occa
 sional malediction over the toil and trouble of the whole
 enterprise.
                "  I  get on slowly and sulkily as respects my own

" Never will      I undertake another big book of such multi
farious parts    !   But  I  must now swim through the whole,
or sink under the weight of my own details.                I would   give
any competent man £100 to launch my ship, but                  I  cannot
trust to others."
     The long delay had not been without             its advantages    in
the greater scope and accuracy which it permitted, especially
as regarded     the   second   half of the work, or that which
treated of organic remains.           It  -had    enabled the author
 during a series     of years to gather the fruits of all the
criticism, the hints, and the information           which    the discus
sions    of his communications          to the     Geological    Society
evoked.     It  allowed a steady growth of his geological ex
perience before he should commit himself to the responsi
bilities of an independent publication, appealing to a wide
circle of readers.       Nor had it in any way retarded his
reputation   ; for, as we have seen, the more salient features
of his continuous       labours in this field, since that lucky
journey in 1831 to the banks of the Wye, had been given
year after year       to the    Geological      Society,   and through
the publications      of the Society,     as  well as of the British
Association,    had become        generally     known     to geologists
all over the world.          But the full account of these, and
notably of the wonderful          series   of fossils which he had
brought out of the old Transition rocks, had been impatiently
expected    for several    years.    At   last,  towards the end       of
 1838,  it made its appearance,     — a ponderous quarto volume
of 800 pages, with an atlas of plates of fossils and sections,\           ,
and   a large coloured geological map.

opened up a new chapter,                     or rather a whole series                  of chap

confusion.             Murchison had succeeded in making out the
order of their upper and most fossiliferous portions, and now in
his pages and plates the subdivisions of these ancient forma
tions stood          as   definitely grouped and arranged                      as the     orderly
undisturbed             Secondary deposits                  of central England.                 He
had traced out also the sites of some of the submarine vol
canoes of those early ages, and the great thickness to which

the volcanic detritus had accumulated over the sea-bottom.1
To give completeness            to his account of the        Silurian region,
he had likewise           undertaken detailed examinations              of the
overlying          rocks, including the coal-fields and the various
formations up into the Oolitic series.               The results of all this
work were now included in his volume.                        Eich, therefore,
in original         research,   and amply illustrated,         the book       well
deserved  the encomium of the President of the Geological
Society (Dr. Whewell), who spoke of    in his address, " as
                                                    it,
an admirable example of the sober and useful splendour
which        may grace      a    geological monograph."2             No more
remarkable proof of the value of steady industry had for
many     year been given than was furnished by the gradual
         a
elaboration of this work    " If the
                                     young student of geology,"
so said    writer at the time, " wishes to find an example of

the effect of diligence and perseverance, as insuring ultimate
success, he cannot do better than to follow the history of the

Sedgwick.4

     But for the assistance of friends and fellow-labourers, the Silurian
System would have been a very different work from what         is.  Sedg

wick revised some portions of it, especially the Introduction, which he
induced the author        in great part to re-write.      Agassiz, Sowerby,    and
particularly Lonsdale, named and described the greater part of the fossils,
while other friends, whose names are cited in the book, lent a helping
band.   But besides these coadjutors in tbe preparation of the volume,
the author had been zealously assisted, as we have seen, by active and

 242              SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                               [ISB.
      During all these busy years, when the author of the
 Silurian System was elaborating his work, and giving from
 time to time narratives of his progress             in the publications
 of the Geological Society, the fame of his labours had spread
 into every quarter of the globe where geology was culti
 vated.      His term " Silurian " had been adopted and applied
 to the rocks of different countries where similar groups of
 fossils were found.        Thus filie de Beaumont and Dufrcnoy
 in France,     Ecue*  and De Verneuil in Turkey, Forchhammer
in Scandinavia, Featherstonehaugh and Eogers in America,
referred to them in the pages of his work.        But the confession of his
general obligatious conveys inadequate ideas of the untiring zeal and
quite incalculable service of some of these friends.  The R«v. T. T. Lewis,
of Aymestry, deserves especially to be had in remembrance, for, without
his generous and effective aid, both in the field and in long and admirable
expository letters, so full a harvest of results could not have been reaped
by Murchison, but must have been shared by other and later labourers.
(See Edin. Review, loc. oit.)
   In the MS. memoranda already referred to as kindly supplied by Pro
fessor Phillips, he says, " Murchison found in Mr. Lewis a man equal to
himself in field-work, and already master of all the local geology.   I  had
seen  Mr. Lewis's collection in 1836, and often heard his praise from the
Silurian Chief ; but by some forgetfulness the record in the great work,
to the foundations of which the Vicar of Aymestry had contributed per
haps more than any other man, was less full and emphatic than might
have been expected."
   On the publication of the Silurian System, its author showed an anxiety
to have the work favourably reviewed, hardly worthy of his position.
He wrote, for example, an urgent appeal to Sedgwick to pen a criticism
for the columns of the Times, and afterwards another entreaty for an
exhaustive article in one of the quarterlies on the whole subject of the
older fossiliferous rocks, the grounds of the request being variously based
on the need of trying to regain some of the large amount of money which
had been expended upon the publication, on the desirability of showing
how necessary a knowledge of geological structure is for the development
of our mineral resources, on the good to geology which might be done by
making the ordinary reading public familiar with some of the more recent
researches,   etc.  Sedgwick in a very candid and friendly way assured
him that the book needed no artificial aid, and should be allowed to make
way on its own merits.      Fitton wrote the review in the Edinburgh, and
drew attention to the important co-operation of Mr. Lewis.

1838.]      SPREAD OF SILURIAN DOMAIN,                         243
had accepted       his  classification,  and recognised   Silurian
fossils in widely distant regions.      Hence the book, welcome
and long-expected as        it undoubtedly   was, lost perhaps a
little of the novelty which it might otherwise have possessed.
     We have now traced Murchison's career up to the com
pletion of the great work of his life.        His subsequent geo-   .
logical labours chiefly sprang out of these seven years' toil
              " Transition " rocks. He went
among the                                        abroad to extend
the area of his Silurian formations, and he succeeded            in
achieving    its further   increase   at home.     His domain of
" Siluria" became, in his eyes, a kind of personal property,
over which he watched with solicitude.         Or, it might rather
perhaps be compared          to a vast   business which   he   had
established,   of every original detail of which he was com
plete master, and which he laboured to extend into other
countries, while he kept up through life a close correspond
 ence  with those by whom the foreign extensions were so
 abundantly and successfully carried out.        How all this was
done remains to be told in the succeeding       chapters.

                     THE DEVONIAN SYSTEM.
      WE have now to trace how it came about that another
chapter was       added   to early geological history.         With the
view of following intelligibly how far this addition was due
to Murchison's labours, we may profitably take here a brief
retrospect of the previous progress of discovery and opinion
regarding the rocks from which the new chapter was com
piled.
      It was one of the merits of the Wernerian geognosts to
point out some of the more salient subdivisions in which, by
 means    mainly of mineral characters, the rocks of the earth's
 crust may be chronologically            grouped.      They recognised
 that their " Transition
                              "
                                  series  was    often covered    by red
 sandstones     and conglomerates,       and that a younger group     of
 similar sandstones      was found to rest upon magnesian lime-
•etone   or coal.1   It was  in England that this distinction came
 to be most       clearly perceived,     because    the extensive coal
 fields of this country were found to separate the two series
  of sandstones.       Hence the terms Old Eed Sandstone and
  New Eed Sandstone acquired an important economic signi

 himself agrees with a part at least of what is now called Permian.

ficance   apart from their geological meaning,                  inasmuch as
the one lay below the coal, while the other lay above it.
      The Old Eed Sandstone during the first quarter of this
century had been recognised over a large part of Britain.
 It  was known       to occur in broken bands from the Bristol
 Channel     up northwards         through      the border       counties   of
England     and Wales.          It had been recognised            coming out
from    under     the    Carboniferous        Limestone       in    the Lake
country.      It  had been followed for great distances through
the Lowlands         of Scotland, and along the flanks of the
Highlands.
     But though the existence of these red sandstones                     and
conglomerates        had    been     extensively       proved, little     had
been gathered       regarding their thickness, their subdivisions,
their fossil contents,       and the general geological history             of
which they are the records.                   In    Scotland     much   good
observation had been made by Jameson,                    Boue",  Macculloch,
Imrie, and othera           In   England a threefold subdivision            of
the series was proposed          by Buckland and Conybeare.1              But
these rocks were       still regarded as only a subordinate, and by
no means important, group, being by some geologists placed
in the Transition series, and by others with the Carboniferous
deposits.
     A  great advance       was made by the conjoined labours              of
Sedgwick and Murchison among the Old Red Sandstones and
Conglomerates of the north of Scotland.                   They showed the
great thickness and importance of the series, its range even up
to the most northern parts of our islands, and the great abun

therefore with much previous acquaintance with this geologi
cal group, that Murchison, in 1831, had begun to trace out
its development in South Wales               and the adjacent parts          of
England.        The vast depth and the variety of strata            which it
exhibited in that region, taken in connexion with its                 extent
in Scotland, had so impressed him with the importance                        of
the Old Eed           Sandstone,     that    when he        published     the
Silurian System, he proposed, for the first time, to raise                   it
to the dignity of a distinct geological System.*                He pointed
out its well-marked          lithological   characters     and its peculiar
fossil treasures as grounds for clear separation.                    By his
successful search, aided by that of Dr. Lloyd of Ludlow,                  and
other observers,        the fact was made known               that the    Old
Eed Sandstone of England,                 previously      supposed     to be
singularly     barren of organic remains, did really contain a
number of peculiar          fishes,   and among        them some      of the
very same species which had been found in the Old Red
Sandstone of Scotland.             By this evidence he was entitled
more    confidently       than ever     to group these rocks of the
United Kingdom in one great series, and when he found
that in South "Wales they attained a thickness of nine or
ten thousand feet, he very justly insisted on their claim to
an independent place in the geological record.
     These views, however, met with little acceptance on the
Continent.         It  was    objected that with some trifling ex
ceptions,    as  for instance in Belgium and perhaps in Eussia,
the so-called Old Red Sandstone of the English geologists
did not exist on the mainland of Europe, and therefore that
it bad no claim whatever to rank as a system,                  but could be

regarded at the best         as a   remarkable but only      local and
abnormal       development of the upper Transition            or lower
Carboniferous strata.         There certainly seemed a good deal of
force in these        objections, and still more in the assertions
which were confidently made, that the lowest rocks of the
Carboniferous series were found on the Continent passing
down into the Grauwacke, and that there was likewise a
blending of their respective fossils.         If these assertions were
 well founded, they proved the absence of any intermediate
system on the Continent, and rendered the claims of any
local     British    series   to  rank    as  a   system   more    than
doubtful.
      Such, in brief, was the state of this branch of geology at
 the time    of the publication of the Silurian System.          While
 the researches     out of which that work sprang were still in
 progress, and the book itself advancing through the press,
 its author, as already mentioned, was led to begin another
 series of observations,     which led eventually to an important
 change    in English, and indeed of European geology, and to the
 willing recognition of that " Old Eed System for which

 contention had in vain been held before.
       It was   in the year 1836 that the observations now to be
 followed began to be made.             They were the conjoint task
 of the two long- tried friends Sedgwick and Murchison.              Up
 to that time these         geologists   had been at work contem
poraneously       but    independently     among     the  older   rocks,
 and though Dr. Whewell, from the chair of the Geological
 Society,    spoke     of their labours as " on all accounts          to
 be considered as a      joint undertaking," still in actual fact the
 two    pioneers had       started   from    wholly different points,
 and had,      as   we   have seen, toiled      to cut out each      his

 own pathway through that vague and unknown region
                    "
of " Transition        rocks, which certainly seemed wide enough
to   give them ample room for exploration                    without much
risk of trenching upon each other's ground.                        Sedgwick
had grappled with the physical                  structure     of the rocks,
and,   amidst      enormous difficulties,         had   achieved success.
Murchison,      on the other hand, had found a series of strata
where the physical structure was comparatively simple, aud
which yielded such abundant store of fossils              as to be    capable
of subdivision        by their      means.      But now, in the south
west of England,         the   two friends were to combine their
methods,     and to work       out a difficult region by help both
of physical structure and of organic remains.
     There was no such ambitious plan before them, however,
when they began their work.               They had one definite point
to settle, viz., the age of the Culm-measures                of Devonshire.
But in putting that matter beyond dispute, they were gra
dually led into further and wider explorations, not in Devon
and Cornwall        merely, but over        a  considerable area of the
Continent.       It   was    by means      of these labours that the
" Devonian                    of rocks was established.            How the
                 System"
work    first   took    shape     is best    told in Murchison's         own
words : —
     " The
              origin of this joint survey [of Devonshire]               came
about in this way.           In    the preceding winter,1        Mr. (after
wards Sir Henry) De la Beche had sent up specimens                          of
small fossil plants from the culm rocks of North Devon,
which he described         as   belonging to the Grauwacke forma
tion.    At   the evening meeting of the Geological Society                  I
opposed     this view, on the ground that my Silurian rocks,

Moreover,       I thought I recognised a          complete similarity be
tween these common specimens                 of North Devon and those
which      I had explored in the opposite coast of Pembroke,
and which        I  knew were superposed           to the Millstone      Grit
and Mountain          Limestone.       I  therefore urged Sedgwick to
    1 It is perhaps hardly worth while reverting, even in a foot-note, to a
personal matter which threatened to bring about a rupture of friendly
relations between geologists all of whom have made their mark in the
scientific history of their time, and who are now gone to their rest. And
yet the expressions in the text seem to require further explanation, more
especially as some of the survivors of that time may still be under the
belief that De la Beche was hardly used in this affair.        It was asserted
by some of his friends that Murchison and Sedgwick had obtained posses
sion of an early unpublished copy of his Ordnance Geological Survey map
of Devonshire ; that they had, unknown to him, gone down into his terri
tory and examined his sections with the map in their hands ; that they
had thereafter hurried up to the Bristol meeting to make an attack upon
him and expose his mistakes ; and that afterwards, although their full
conjoint paper had not been read to the Geological Society, they procured
a statement and recognition of their views in the anniversary address of
the President.     The real facts were these : — When  De la Beche announced
the discovery of plants of Carboniferous species in the " Greywacke " of
Devonshire, Murchison (as stated above) opposed this alleged discovery,
because it ran directly counter to all the evidence he had obtained in his
own Silurian domains as to the disappearance of Carboniferous forms of
life from the older rocks, and, as he wrote to De la Beche, " I could not
bring out my long-projected work with such a geological contradiction in
my face."     De la Beche invited him to examine the ground for himself,
and gave him directions what to see, and where to see it. The map was
purchased in 1835 in the ordinary way from a bookseller's shop, where it
was sold also to other members of the Society. But it was not used on the
ground until the summer of 1836.          Possibly, in the meantime, De la
Beche    had  begun to suspect    the accuracy of these early impressions of
the map. When Sedgwick and Murchison came to the ground, they found
the facts to be as stated above.   The supposed " Greywacke
                                                               " turned out to
be merely a somewhat abnormal condition of the Coal-measures, and, in
stead of occupying an anticlinal area, so as to dip under the other rocks,
actually lay in a great trough above them.       So far De la Beche was un
doubtedly wrong, and his opponents were undoubtedly right, as was after
wards shown by the alteration of the Survey map in accordance with the
newer views.      The charges of unfairness appear to have been whispered
about by De hi Beche's friends in London,       while he himself was busy in

join me in      a campaign to settle the question.1          He agreed    to
do so.       So off we went      ;  and first we looked through          the
rocks      of North Somerset,        Ilfracombe,      Morte   Bay,   Baggy-
Point, and Bamstaple.              As we went on, a good, steady,
southerly dip continued until we reached                 the edge of the
famous Culm tract, into and under which the older strata
pitched at a rapid inclination.              I there saw   that the game
was won, and, drawing a section, in which               I  reversed De    la
Beche's       hypothetical    diagrams,     I  called out to Sedgwick
from the rock on which          I was    sitting, — Here
                                                    '
                                                             it is !  Look
at my section of the North Devon coal-field —the youngest
 instead of the oldest rocks of the county —our job is done                1'
 Still   he was a    little incredulous until we advanced            south
 wards (for     I had    sketched this from the north side of the
 the field in the south-western counties.    They were indignantly denied at
the time by Murchison, in a letter to De la Beche himself (6th January
 1837), and in one to Sedgwick (2d February 1837).        That De la Beche
 was vexed to find some of the work of the Survey to be wrong was
 natural enough, and that Murchison may have shown, as appears from
 hia narrative above, a little elation in pointing out his friend's error,
 was also to be expected. Indeed, it would seem that be allowed himself to
 write to Sedgwick in such a way about the alleged discovery of a Grau-
 wacke flora in Devonshire as to call down remonstrance from his com
 rade.    Even as far back as January 1835, that is only a month after De
 la Becbe's announcement, we find him acknowledging Sedgwick's com
 plaint thus : — "You were quite right in reproving me if you thought that
 I used any acrimony in speaking of De la Beche's discovery, but I had
 long before obviated the possibility of such being the case on one side or
 the other by a friendly interchange of opinions with De la Beche him
 self."   But a perusal of the correspondence and of the published papers
 and abstracts has convinced the writer of these lines that no unfairness
 can be justly attributed either to Murchison or Sedgwick in the matter.
 It may be added, that though right as to the relative position they
 assigned to the Culm-measures, these authors were much deceived in their
 identification of the underlying rocks with the Silurian and Cambrian
 systems, as will be shown in the sequel.
    1 In a letter of 8th
                           February 1836, Sedgwick proposes to Murchison
 and plans the tour in Devon and Cornwall.       It may have been previously
 suggested by Murchison.

bay), and then when he saw the actual order he entirely
assented, saying what         a  crow we should have over De la
Beche.     The truth     I  can      only surmise to be, that De la
Beche, who was certainly              a very able geologist,  had never
really looked carefully at the consecutive sections in nature,
but seeing the Culm strata in a state of great contortion in
a low tract, he had presumed that they passed under the
higher country in the north.             I also  believe that he was so
much occupied in writing that remarkably skilful and in
genious work (the best he ever wrote), Theoretical Researches
in  Geology, that   in doing so, and carrying out his first map
of Devon and Cornwall, he really worked very little in the
field."
     " At the Bristol meeting of the British Association, the
chief business of Sedgwick and self was to establish the
point regarding the great change we proposed               in the struc
ture of Devonshire     ;   and though Greenough, Buckland, and
the old hands made some resistance, and did not like to                see

the ancient    Shillats     and      Gossans,'   believed to be the most
ancient rocks in Britain,       so   modernized,    it was evident that
truth would prevail."
    After the meeting, while Murchison,             as we have    already
noted, returned to his literary         toil in London, his friend and
coadjutor went again into the Devonshire country, and spent
many weeks in hard work there,               so that a broad base was
thereby laid for the conjoint              paper which     it had    been
arranged to read before the Geological Society.
    But the conclusions arrived at by Sedgwick                and   Mur

meeting with general acceptance at first.              Some    idea    of  the
opposition, or at least of Murchison's           estimate    of it,  may be
formed from the following sentences            in  a letter to  Phillips, of
4th    January 1836       : — " The  paper by old Weaver          was read
last night, and the fight is        over.     He has sided completely
with S. and self.         Austen,   a remarkably clever young geolo
gist, is also    with us     ; Major Harding from the first        with us.
 The case therefore stands thus          : For the old constitution —
•Greenough, De la Beche, and Parson             Williams.       On  our side
 are the two geologists         of Great Britain who have given the
longest attention           to the old fossiliferous strata, and       their
 opinions are supported by every man who has gone into                   the
 tract to judge for himself.
      " All the support expected from France has
                                                              gone against
the ancients      ; for Buckland (himself       as   unwilling a witness
 as  Weaver) comes back from France persuaded that
                                                                    Fjie de
 Beaumont's "Grauwacke coal-fields" are nothing but ordinary
 Carboniferous deposits reposing on Silurian rocks.
      " We are effecting a great reform at the Geological, to
 save Lonsdale's       life, and enable him to do his quantum             of
 duty.     We split the duties — Lonsdale, assistant secretary
 and editor    ;  a curator to be found.        K. I. M. chairman of a
 committee to find said curator."
       The " fight" alluded to in this letter, however, was merely
 a preliminary        skirmish     on the reading of        a   memoir   by
 another member of the Society, and though                     valuable   as
 giving some notion of the relative strength of the parties,
 by no means ended the warfare.               Murchison counted much
 at the top of the Devon rocks, and belonged to the Carboniferous system.
 On what particular horizon in that system they should be placed doee
 not appear to be satisfactorily settled yet.

could only       be got into such measure      of health and spirits    as
to      come   up to town for the purpose,          would     easily and
 triumphantly rout the enemy.               Thus on the 30th January
 the following appeal left London :—
       " MY DEAR SEDGWICK, — I worked all
                                                     day yesterday to
  make the sections, and to have them correspond with our
  long Bristolian      coupe.   I  was  in great hopes to have your
  despatches before        now  ;  but  I  wait patiently   like a lamb
  for the sacrifice      ;
                           — and   sacrificed  I most assuredly shall
  be without your aid.          However,     I will drink  the best part
   of a bottle of sherry to screw me up to face Buckland,
   Greenough, Yates, and the Ordnance forces               which are to
   be brought      against us.     In anticipation of    the memoir,     I
   must take this chance of a vale from you before the fight."
        Upwards of six years had elapsed since these two fellow-
   labourers with the hammer had been leagued             together with
   the pen.      The brief notice of their discovery made to the
   British Association was meant to be merely a prelude to the
   much fuller memoir designed            for the learned audience      at
    Somerset House.        Former experience,    however, showed that
    the Woodwardian Professor could not be got to move              faster
    than his wonted pace.         After many delays and promises, a
    date was   fixed for the reading of this memoir.           Murchison
    duly appeared, but found neither Sedgwick nor the paper.
    The letters which came up week after week from Cambridge
    had brought the most touching lamentations over the exact
     ing claims of lectures,    examinations, audits, and other      Uni
     versity business,   and hardly one of them ever failed to carry
     a bulletin of the progress      of the influenza, gout, dyspepsia,

 anathematized with whimsical                fervour.    Murchison's chagrin
 was expressed next day as follows                : —

    "   MY DEAR     SEDGWICK,    — The      part of Hamlet being omitted,
 the play was not performed,             and all the scenic arrangements
 which       I  had laboured at were             thrown     away, though the
room looked           splendid.     The morning's            arrivals    certainly
 surprised me.         Ten o'clock brought me your double letter                      ;
 eleven o'clock by the same mail the maps, and a                       little note
to Lyell, but in vain          I   looked through the parcel               for the
 document to be read.            I    read and re-read your letter, and
 still   I   could not understand it.             One thing       I  clearly per
 ceived, and       with great regret, that you were seriously out of
 sorts, and       had been suffering       ;  so after     waiting till two,        I
journeyed         down to the Society, still thinking that a third
package        with the paper might be sent to Somerset House, —
not    so, however.       These things going on            ;  the whole room
decorated        for the fight   ;  Buckland arrived, Fitton present,
and a large          meeting expected,         — what      was to be        done   ?
Fitton and Lonsdale           .  .  .   counselled me to give up the
thing, which        I resolved to    do, to the very great annoyance of
the President         [Buckland], and of all the others who                  came
to hear.       ....
       "   I  am mortified that the memoir                did    not come     ;  of
course       I  blame myself        somewhat for having               thrown in
doubts on some points, because                 I  see  that   ill   as you have
been, and without the power on my part of talking                        the  case
over, we mutually         misapprehended each other.                 But  enough
of what is past.         The thing now to consider is when to                have

which Greenough and myself agreed about the absurd term
potfoilitic, backed by old Paddy [Fitton],                             so the spots were
damned.           We had a supper at Cole's, —Buckland, Homer,
Stokes, the Viscount,                   Sir Phil, and my friend Eosthorn of
Wolfsberg, a great friend of the Archduke John's, present.

           you really imagine that     was to dramatize the I

written to by Greenough or some of the dark school                                         ?    or
was the paper unfit to be sent                   ?   or was it omitted by acci
dent and mistake               ?        The President stated               the last   as       the
cause, and         I   said not a word about                it,   for with Lonsdale's
help in construing your letter, we were unable to understand
it.   I     think that the delay occasioned by my doubts and
your influenza and state of the stomach are the true causes                                      ;
but    if   you had sent           it   in ever so unfinished          a   state, the heads
would have been read, and an abstract made, which would
have served            all purposes."
         Summer had made some progress                          before     the paper was
at last actually read to the Society.                             It    was the first           of
a     series of memoirs upon the rocks                  of Devon and Cornwall,
and their equivalents elsewhere.
       The settlement of the geological                age      of the Culm-measures
of Devonshire, though by no means an unimportant question
in British geology, was of small moment compared with the
further          researches        to which     it   led.         In   working     out the
position of these rocks, the two fellow-labourers                                 found         it
necessary to get           a   base-line for their Carboniferous forma

tions.    lu   other tracts of this country they would have met
with ordinary Old Eed Sandstone.                 But in Devonshire and
Cornwall they encountered a series of rocks which had
undergone      so   much alteration that their true position             was
difficult to define.       They were usually classed           by the old
and uncouth          term Grauwacke.            In   some    respects   they
resembled      the old slaty masses        of Wales, and at first the two
geologists    who had come to them fresh               from these Welsh
deposits made them out to be actually in the same geolo
gical position      as   the middle and upper parts of Professor
Sedgwick's Cambrian series of North Wales.1                   A   good deal
of limestone, with an abundance of fossil remains, distin
guished these Devonshire strata.                But owing to the way in
which the rocks had been squeezed                and broken, their order
of succession was not easily ascertained.
      Various observers, especially Mr. Hennah, Mr. (Godwin)
Austen,      Mr.     Williams,    and      Major Harding,         had made
collections     of the fossils,         which    certainly   differed con
siderably from those of the Silurian rocks, and quite justified
Murchison in deciding not to claim these strata              as   part of his
Silurian domain. Mr. Lonsdale, toward the end of 1837, after
an examination of various collections of South Devon fossils,
came to the conclusion that the rocks from which they were
obtained must be intermediate between the Silurian and the
Carboniferous series, that       is,   on the same general parallel as the
Old Eed Sandstone of other districts.2                He was led to this
inference purely on palaeontological              grounds, because      some
of the fossils belonged to Silurian species, while others had

    " HONOURED SIR, —
                           My friend Dr. Malcolmson of Madras
has written     me from Paris, that he        has   had an interview
with M. Agassiz, and that that gentleman has expressed                 a
wish to   see one of the fossils of a small collection which    I have
been forming for the last few years.          The Doctor also men
tions to me in another letter that he had had the pleasure of
meeting    with you in London about the middle of last spring,
and that you were at that time engaged           in researches which
some    of my specimens        might perhaps serve to illustrate.
From   a  further remark,    I infer that you too are desirous        of
examining some of them.             I  herewith send a few of the
more portable to Agassiz, requesting him            (should he be no
former of collections himself, which            Dr. Malcolmson     tells
me he is not) to send them to you, who deserve              so well of
the geologists of the north, when he has looked over them.
Lest, however, some accident should detain them on the Con
tinent,  I  deem  it proper that you should have an opportunity
of examining them in the passing,              and   I  have therefore
requested     Mr. James Malcolmson, the Doctor's brother, to
 forward     them to your address,        with which     I myself   am
 unacquainted.      .   .  .   [Here follow some descriptions of
 the fossils.]
     " There is one question in connexion with these fossils
 to which    I would  fain receive    an answer,     and which  I have
 put to Agassiz, but which you, sir, could favour me by
 answering much sooner than          I can expect to hear from him.

Is   the formation in which they occur a fresh-water one, or
otherwise    ?   I have  some intention at present of drawing up
a popular account of the geology of this part of the country
for a widely-circulated       periodical   to which       I   occasionally
contribute, and the fact in question,         if an  ascertaiuable one,
is essential to my      purpose.   Your letter, were you to favour
me with a very few lines on the subject, would find me in
Cromarty.       It would afford me pleasure to forward for your
inspection     such of my specimens        as  might prove of use to
you in your present researches.          I am    desirous to make my
little collection as complete       as possible, and         in  no  place,
perhaps, could it be of      so much interest      as  in the middle of
the district     whose oryctology      it illustrates.       Some   of my
specimens,      however, are in duplicate, and          I   need   not say
 how welcome you        will  be to one out      of each of the pairs,
 and to the use of all the others.        Please favour me by seal
 ing my letter to Agassiz ere you make up the box.                     I do
 not know that     I have   addressed    that gentleman as        I ought,
 but he must just .excuse the ignorance of a foreigner and a
 provincial in the way the far-famed author of Salmonia did

 may be quoted      : —

     "  I am delighted      with your clear and terse style of de

the Old Eed Sandstone of Scotland was formed in a lake or
in the     sea.1   I have,   however, strong reasons for believing
that   it is   a marine deposit, for     in England we find marine
shells in     it to  a considerable height      above the uppermost

creased knowledge, and          with the conviction that        I should
learn so much from you, but          I fear it is hopeless."
     Besides abundant work and correspondence in regard to
Devonian geology,        Murchison took a leading part in one of
the most prominent of the scientific doings of London in
this year (1838).        Sir John Herschel, after an absence of
four years and a half at the Cape, had returned to England
with a rich harvest of astronomical observations.                 It  was
   1 This question, mainly from the labours of Mr. Godwin-Austen, Pro
fessor T. Rupert Jones, and Professor Ramsay, can now be more definitely
answered, in a sense opposite to the view which Murchison favoured in
this letter.

 determined by his scientific and other friends to give him a
 public dinner, and to present him on that occasion with an
 inscribed vase.   Murchison acted       as   honorary secretary, and
to judge from the mass of correspondence                which remains
among his papers, his post must have left him for many
weeks with hardly an hour of leisure.                One of Herschel's
 notes to him concludes       "  with repeated thanks to you for
all the very great trouble which this affair has caused you."
The gathering proved eminently successful — a result in no
small measure due to the good management of the secretary,
and especially to his facility for grasping even the most
insignificant details, and planning the execution of them.
     Before we resume the Devonian story, reference must be
made to the death    of Mrs. Hugonin in the beginning of the
year 1838, and to a remarkable letter which that event evoked
from her son-in-law.      This letter is addressed to his " dear
friend" Sedgwick.     It was    never sent, however, but remained
in its writer's repositories until his death.           During the in
terval he appears to have read the letter at least twice — in
 1857, and again in 1869 — as is shown by his own hand
writing on the back.     It  would seem, therefore, to have been
regarded   as a  record worth preserving, of the state of the
writer's mind at the time regarding a momentous subject,
on which, even up to the end of life, he was not given to
speak.    The letter is marked outside           in handwriting of      a
late date, "My   Creed in 1838."

     " MY  DEAR   SEDGWICK,     — I have not for the last many

so heavily has the incubus pressed                 upon me.       Here, how
ever,     ... I am free to occupy an hour, and I give                  it  to you
as the man of my heart.              1st,  Talking of this last-mentioned
member of our frame in a physical sense,                  I must    crave sume
of that sympathy from you which                   I have    often felt for you
when you have described to me your own sensations                           in   its
region.          The   scene    here  has    altogether been       trying and
harassing for my wife and self — several times up and down
from town, and, on the last occasion of my visit,                    I returned
only to Eccleston Street to hurry off Mrs. M. at a moment's
notice, as       I feared   she would be too late to close her mother's
eyes.         This, however, was happily not the              case.     The old
lady made a wonderful rally, her mind became quite com
posed, and she took the sacrament                with her daughter in full
confidence         of a change to a     better world.        These are agree
able reflections.          To-morrow      I attend   her body to the grave.
The     will gives to my        dear wife a most ample income for her
life.   .   .  .
      "   I   do not mean        to relax    one   jot in my search after
natural knowledge            ; nay, being now a free agent for the first
time these twenty years,            I  shall,  I hope, be enabled         to em
ploy all my leisure hours more effectively in pursuing my
favourite study.
      " But this is not
                               enough.     I have   one deep-seated        source
of personal unhappiness in my thoughts of the future.                           To
go we know not where, may be viewed calmly and resignedly
by many philosophers, trusting                as they do to the wise dis
pensations of Providence, yet unable to believe in the                       great
Atonement           for the sins of man.          Alas  I  I am    (for   I need
Scarcely confess          it again to you, for you know me)               one of

and feel what they ought to believe, yet cannot overcome the
force of habit and a long-continued apathetic indifference to
the    vital point.        Doubtless   I perceive  much to admire, nay,
nothing to cavil at, in the precepts of Christ, though              I can
not bring my mind to acquiesce                in His divinity.   Still. less
can    I confide     in and give my common sense to adopt all the
historical details of the Old Testament.                You will refer me
to Paley, while                 , professing to be a Christian, will refer
me to Fellowes.             I do   not require a stimulus to induce me
to adopt natural religion, for             I have  it strongly implanted
in  me    ;  and   if geology has done me no other good, it has, at
all events, strongly fortified me in this sense.
     " But here        I halt.      Most unwillingly it is true, for few
people have a higher respect for sincere believers than myself,
and no one would more stoutly fight for the Church,                    as a
great and essential moral engine,             than myself.   When, how
ever,    I  see   men of powerful minds and great integrity, who
are strict believers          in Christ,  I am  roused to a perception of
the chance there is that the defect is in my own capacity
and heart.          I   hope    the former only.      Your example has
made more impression upon me than                  all that was ever said
or written      ;  for nothing has more alienated me from Chris
tian belief than the constant exposure (which history and
our own experience affirm) of hypocrisy, cant, and all the
worst passions veiled under the garb of religion.              You might
well say to me,          '
                           Look at home ;' for if there ever existed a
thoroughly pious, yet unobtrusive Christian,               that person is
my excellent wife.             Seeing the tranquillity with which she
views her passage from this world, and knowing how the
best    Christian principles are ever her guides, albeit without
a tincture      of fanaticism or exclusive sanctity,         I cannot but

 the dying wishes        of my own beloved mother,          I may   become
 a true believer.      Alas   !   I am  a short way yet upon the road.

      " Having written,         I  looked at my confessions and was
 about to destroy them, but this would have been giving way
 to my own pride       :  so you must bear with me."
      During the winter of 1838-39 Sedgwick and Murchison
 were busy      trying to get at the meaning of the Devonian
 rocks.    Lonsdale's      suggestion     as  to the position      of these
 strata was now engaging             their attention, and they sought
 anxiously for light from further fossil evidence.                 Many     a
 box of specimens          from Devonshire        was turned       out and
 scrutinized with Sowerby and Lonsdale.                It   was not, how
 ever,  until the spring of 1839 that they quite discarded their
 previously published views of the age of the older rocks of
 the south-west of England and adopted               those     of Lonsdale.
 Even in March, Sedgwick could still write to his friend,—
 " The Devon                                              I
                   fossils are a great puzzle ; but am as firm as
 ever— no Old Red in Devon."
                                        1
       The two geologists once more             became     fellow- workers
 with the pen.       And the consequence was, of course, a return
 to the former kind of correspondence             — vehement       objurga
 tions by the Professor on his real or imaginary                  ailments,
 with whimsical accounts of his condition, shrewd criticisms
on his friend's writing, and earnest advice           as  to courtesy and
moderation towards opponents.                The opposition to the re
    1 Mr. De la Heche's Geological Report on Cornwall and Devon appeared
in 1839, full of excellent observations, but not admitting the Culm rocks
to be true Coal-measures, and retaining his old term Grauwacke for the
older rocks of that region, -which were soon to be named Devonian.

 form which they wished to effect in the nomenclature of the
 older rocks of Devon and Cornwall had not wholly subsided,
for there came now and then a protest or denial from the
other side, though the main point for which they had origi
nally contended — the true overlying position of the Culm-
measures — was now so tacitly admitted as to be claimed as
part of the common stock of knowledge, without reference to
their relation to it as discoverers.          The Ordnance Geological
Survey Eeport upon the district had just appeared, and irri
tated them by the way in which it seemed to them to over
look the important work which they had done in that part
of the country.         They had written and published rather a
sharp retort upon De la Beche,1 and the atmosphere                    at thd
Geological Society was in that state when a storm such as
had never been experienced at Somerset House might at
any moment have burst forth.                  A  paper on the Devon
Geology by the Eev. D. Williams, one of the opponents, was
announced for reading on the 10th of April.                       A    fierce
battle was looked for, and the combatants and would-be on
lookers came from far and near to be present.                    Sedgwick
could not attend.          The good fight was therefore left to be
fought by his military ally, who, next day, still full of the
excitement, sent him the following despatch on this subject                : —

Stratified Rocks of Devon and Cornwall," which had appeared a few days
before in the   April number of the Philosophical Magazine. The latter
part  of this paper is a rather angry and personal defence of the originality
of their work in these two counties, drawn forth by the statements in
De la Beche's Geological Report on the same district.

remarkably well.        Parson Williams, who was present,            had
prepared an Ordnance map of Devon and Cornwall coloured
on his own mineralogical plan.       . . .  Immediately       after the
memoir was read, De la Beche, who came up per mail for
the nonce, rose, and holding      in his hand our memoir, com
menced an exculpation of himself from the charge we bring
against him in our conclusion                He spoke calmly, and
without going into the memoir of the evening.                 I imme
diately replied by first assuring the Chair that             I had no
hesitation in expressing my regret that a word or two had
been made use      of in the hurry of composition which both of
us were sorry for.     ....   Disavowing    the least personality,      I
immediately     got D.    with me, and having thus cleared the
course,    I opened    the  discussion on Williams' paper, and
went    '
          the whole hog,' as well as       I   could,   touching      the
Devonian     case.    De la Beche then replied, but did not
attempt to shake one of our positions, did not place a veto
on one of my assertions, and least of all, on that which laid
claim to the originality of the Culm-trough.             He bothered
about   a  point or two near Chudleigh,     as  difficulties, and end
ing by saying it was immaterial to him what the things
were called.
     " Lyell then
                    spoke, and very adroitly put the case        as one
most   agreeable    to him, now     that he perceived that Mr.
D. not only acknowledged that the view which we took
at Bristol was original, but also that he (D.) was by no
means indisposed to adopt our new views, which get                rid of
all the anomalies and difficulties (about plants and fossils).

paper in question to his parental revision before it was pub
lished.     He acknowledged, however, that the explanation
had quite rectified the case, and then he went on to expa
tiate on the value of our doings, giving us superlative praise,
and bringing out Lonsdale in the foreground.
       "
         Greenough made his oration             as I  expected, was very
ingeniously      sophistical, tried to throw all into chaos, saw
nothing new in our views, adhered               to his old belief — Grey-
wacke for ever          !— and sustained old Williams by casting
fossil evidence overboard.

 done, Buckland summed up at half-past eleven, and though
he evidently        wished to shield De la Beche,           he ended     by
approving highly of

      A    fortnight later the two Knights of Cambria and Siluria
were ready with their own conjoint paper on their change of
view regarding the geological position of the rocks in Devon
and Cornwall — a change                which     had afforded         one   of the
most effective shafts to their opponents                 in the contest.
      In    this memoir the term Devonian was proposed                         as a
substitute         for  Old Eed Sandstone,           to include the           rocks
lying between            the   Silurian     and    Carboniferous         systems.1

it not merely to the limestone of South Devon, to which                          he

originally restricted            it,   but to all the old slaty rocks of both
Devon and Cornwall,                    and even expressed        an   anticipation
that      it   might be found capable              of application on the Con

Cambrian had become.                    And yet we must admit that, though
exceedingly ingenious,                 it   was based rather on what seemed
probable than what had been proved to be the                      case.      Had the
authors simply declared                  that their Devonian rocks occupied
a    place      somewhere        between the base of the Coal-measures,
or upper part of the Mountain-Limestone                        and the       Silurian
system, their position would have been unassailable.                           Their
identification, however, of the Devonian slates, limestones,
and sandstones,             as   the true equivalents         of the       Old Eed
Sandstone of other regions,                    left out of sight the fact that
a   great thickness          of Lower Carboniferous rocks was on this
view unrepresented in the south-western counties, and hence
that      a    portion at least of their Devonian series might really
be Carboniferous.                Many years afterwards,          as   will    be told
in   a     later chapter,        this now obvious objection was started
.and argued           with great vigour and cogency by the late Mr.
Jukes.
          So greatly have the rocks in Devon and Cornwall been
disturbed since their formation, that even now, though they

270           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                               [is«.
have been examined over and over again by geologists with
out number, considerable dispute is still held over their
true structure.      In   their memoir to the Geological Society,
Sedgwick and Murchison indicated that what they had made
out among      these    cleaved   and    fractured    rocks might    not
improbably      explain     some   parts of      Continental    geology,
and   there   was likewise     the probability     of new light being
obtained from the foreign          rocks to clear up the obscu
rities still remaining at home.          They had even stated their
intention of personally seeking         information on these points.
Murchison      began    to think of putting        this   proposal into
practice, and talked at one time of Scandinavia, at another
of Belgium, or of the south of Ireland, and again of the
Eifel and "Westphalia,        as the proper ground to begin upon.
 He urged his colleague to make the tour            a  conjoint one, and
pressed upon him the needfulness             of trying to break loose
from the ties which seemed to bind him too closely to Cam
bridge or the Chapter of Norwich.             Thus, early in the spring
 he wrote,     I
             " was
                       glad to see your handwriting, albeit you
 wrote in a state of exhaustion.             Allow me,     as  your true
 friend, to urge you to make more than an ordinary effort
 without    delay to shake       off   the   Norvichian trammels to
                   •
 such an extent    as  will  enable you to do that something more
 in field-geology without        which your labours are incom
 plete and your general views cannot be established.                 You
 say you are    junior in the Chapter, but surely you can con
 trive to get off for one year a month earlier than usual          ....
 Pray, therefore, make your arrangements              so that you WILL

      Three weeks later his feelings were expressed to the same
 correspondent as follows : —

so oppressed with the feeling that                           I   ought to be at work)
that somewhere              I   will       go   in the middle of May.                  I   may,
however, defer my Scandinavian tour                              if   I   can meet     with no
playfellow         ;    for in those cold and dreary wilds                        a    solitary
tour is out of the question.                            Belgium, the Ardennes, the
Eifel, Taunus, and Harz may                         be a substitute, and most                   of
this     I can     work away in until you join me, for                       I gather from
your letter that some portion of this country is your aim.                                      I
must      be     at Birmingham,             but    I     shall make it a stepping-
stone to Ireland, where                I   shall remain till the rains drive me
out.      Thus we may unite at points of essential interest."
         On the 7th April, having meanwhile changed his plans
again and again, he wrote once more to Sedgwick about the
foreign tour, thus              :   — " Your      letter reached             me    at Christ
 Church before we left the Bucklands                              yesterday,      where we
passed      three pleasant days                              I   stuck like wax to B.
 to get knowledge from him about Normandy and Brittany,
 and ended by carrying off his maps and two or three sheets
 of memoranda.            ....        You call me a weathercock, and                       so   I
 am, but,      I    hope, for the only object about which                          I   occupy
 myself in the world.                 My plan is now definitively                  arranged.
 On the 1st             May or a few days after,                      start for Antwerp
 and Liege — floor that tract                    in a week with Dumont                     and
 D'Omalius and Buckland's section                        ;   traverse by Spa and make
 a round           to Treves, perhaps taking                      a peep      at the west
 side of the           Eifel and back to Paris — ten days there before
 any     of the savans have left                  it,   fill myself with knowledge
 and buy         all maps, etc.        ;    down straight to Caen, and there
 meet Adam              Sedgwick in first week of                     June at     latest, and

tively arranged        plan, it was in the course of a week or two
completely changed.          The final arrangement settled that the
two old friends and fellow-labourers should once more wield
their hammers together on the banks of the Rhine.               The chief
point to be ascertained was whether or not there existed on
the Continent a series of rocks having a peculiar assemblage
 of fossils, and passing upwards into the base of the Carboni
ferous    and downwards        into the top of the Silurian rocks.
 If  such a series could be found          it would amply justify       the
 Devonian nomenclature.                          ....
      Murchison      started  first.   Taking Paris on his way, he
 there attended     a  meeting of the French Geological Society,
 of which he had now become a member, and had a fight
 with some of his scientific friends over the claims of the
 so-called Devonian rocks to the dignity of being styled a

 as elsewhere,     and, notwithstanding        objections and protests,
 both at home and abroad, succeeded in establishing               it in  the
 general geological literature of his time.
       The halt at Paris was brief.         Before the end of May the
 work had been begun in the heart of Ehineland.                       From
 Treves, Murchison wrote to his wife : —          " '

 I  said to myself whilst         I walked up yesterday under the
 fine beech-trees       from the little frontier station, and found
                                                        '                   '

 and all its lies,    emeutes,  and bombast.      Thank God       I am now
 in  a country       I  like (people and landscape,          with geology
 of all sorts in the fore and background).             I  blessed the first
glimpse of the vine-tending nymphs, with their Swiss-like
 broad-topped white caps, and            the men with their round
 slouch-hats,     honest     German    faces,   and great       jack-boots.
 Thenceforward          all was changed       for the better — capital
macadamized          roads     everywhere,    postilions     with horns;
 the Prussian arms and eagle marking discipline, order, and
 comfort everywhere.
      "  I leave to-morrow morning        in a little carriage which      I
 hire   (I shall buy    one at  Frankfort, where they are excellent)

to do another year."
      From Frankfort on 2d         June  he informs Mrs. Murchison,
"I   have bought a       Vienna carriage, and a very nice one, which
 I hope    will please the Professor.     Finding by his letter of this
day that he does not leave London          till  the 12th,    I had almost
^resolved running         away to the Fichtelgebirge         to  see Count
Miinster and his collections, and to make a section of that
chain, where       I   believe there is much Devonian         ; but second
thoughts have convinced me that it is better to do one thing
well than two things badly.             So I stick    to the right bank

      Meschede on the         Ruhr, June 1839. — "Having finished
      '
my        Abendessen,' consisting of     a fresh    trout, some asparagus,
and eggs,      I am    now smoking my pipe in a very neat clean
room overshadowed             with trees in this little town of the
Lower Rhine, which doubtless you never heard of before.
This morning         I came   hither by Alpe and Bolstein.               I   have
now gone clean across the region, and have looked into the
zoological and mineralogical contents of each zone of rocks,
as    well    as   their geological relations.      What    I   have to say
will surprise you.          I do not    believe there is    a   Silurian bed
among them, and          I am     more than disposed to     think that the
whole is Devonian, except,             perhaps,     the westward flanks.
There are no Eifel fossils here.             The limestones are undis-
tinguishable from those of Plymouth and North Devon, and
the organic remains are all of the same classes which                        occur
in those rocks — Q&niatites, large Spirifers, etc.              To a person
bothering and losing himself in details, the geometry of the
country is puzzling,        as   the same zones are repeated several
times,       both on the north-west         and    south-east side of the
axis.      To-morrow      I march    upon Arnsberg, and thence into
the Diisseldorf coal-field.         If my   conjectures are right,       I shall
find there Devonian passing conformably under                      it,   and   I
shall then retraverse            to Cologne and Bonn, and prove the
case again by other sections.           So that, when Sedgwick               joins
me,  Iflatter myself that part of the campaign (and which                     I
always thought would be the key to the whole thing) will

cal hits, as some of them may fail."
       The caution in the last sentence of this extract was not
unneeded.         For the writer had evidently determined to do
as clever a piece        of geological strategy as he could before
his equal in command should join, and he was naturally
desirous to make his sections             bear out the interpretation
which they first suggested to him.            But he had already gone
wrong in some of his notes, and further errors and correc
tions were in store for him.
       After about a fortnight of such marching and counter
marching in search of a good base-line of operations for
further     conjoint     movements,     he   was joined by the          Pro
fessor.       We resume the extracts from the letters to Mrs.
Murchison.

 transactions, involving a good         deal of Murchison's      future
 comfort, were going on in London.             Mrs. Murchison,     with
 the    full sanction of her husband, was negotiating for the
 sale    of their house, now in Eccleston          Street, and for the
 purchase       of the well-known Belgrave Square mansion, in
 which he spent the last thirty-two years of his life, and which
 in his occupancy of it formed one of the hospitable scientific
 centres     of London.     This purchase is alluded to in the next
 letter of the series.
      Ems, Coblenz, 27th     July. — "The furnishing of our grande
 maison may be done so leisurely as not to fatigue you, and
 I trust    we shall be there for the rest of our lives.         At all
 events, you      will have a good airy palace to live in, even should
 I  prefer this tramping life, which      I am    destined to lead for
 the few years of bodily activity which remain for me, should
 I survive      to middle age.

and on foot, disdaining all the smoking steamers.                 Here we
are for the day,      in this most picturesque watering-place — by
far the prettiest of all the Ehenish baths, and doubly inter
esting to me, because here the first true Silurian rocks which
I have    seen    in any part of Germany on the further bank of
the Ehine are in great force — fine scarps and lots of fossils."

      Deutz, Slst Jvly. — We have made our last round in the
Westphalian region and the right bank of the Ehine, and we
are now on our way into the               Eifel, in which, after certain
zigzags,    we    shall reach Treves.          I  have   little worthy to
communicate except on geological subjects,                   and on these
little new.     In  fact, I am quite tired     of this bank of the Ehine,
 and am most anxious to break ground on the opposite.                   The
 only thing which annoys me in my work is, that although
 we have got excellent descending sections                  from the coal-
 measures to the bottom          of the Devonian or Old Bed system,
 into which     all  the greywacke       of the right bank of the Ehine
 falls, still not a trace can         I  obtain of Ludlow, though the
 Wenlock appears on points, and thus we want the connexion
 which exists in England.              It  is this which we are to find
 in the Eifel and the Ardennes.             ...  I am  swollen out like    a
 German, with hands          as brown as tanned leather."
      As  one    of the General Secretaries         of the British Asso
 ciation, Murchison        required to be present at the meeting,
 which this year had been fixed for Birmingham.                       Very
 unwillingly he quitted the field-work on the Continent and
 hurried    to London.          Before joining his colleague in          the
  Secretariate,    Professor Phillips, he found time to send him
  a brief report of his doings with Sedgwick.
      London, \8th August. — "         I  arrived last night from    Lie'ge,
  in thirty hours, having left Sedgwick on the Meuse, in full

cry with D'Omalius and Dumont.            I am happy to     tell you
that    the   Devonian     system   now rests   on a basis      quite
unmoveable, and that the coal-field of Devon        will after this
promulgation       of our new data, never more be contested.
Even the sturdy Williams will be swept away          !   It was the
observance     of the leading facts of the case during my first
month's work, which led me to form a decided           opinion that
Sedgwick and myself ought to give up one whole summer to
the establishment of our views, by devoting ourselves entirely
to the Ehenish Provinces and Germany          ;  and no sooner did
he see the outlines of the case than we resolved to abandon
Brittany, at all events     till the autumn, and to stick more to
the classic regions of our science, in which as yet the alphabet
of the oldest strata remained to be pointed out.             To the
Ehenish Provinces we have added the Harz and the Fichtel-
gebirge,    and  I  return, after having travelled the better part
of 3000 miles, and satisfied with the results."
     Next day, full of his new work, he could not refrain from
introducing it thus in a note to his friend Whewell : — To
                                                                "
tell you of all the wonderful exploits of the Cambrian and
Silurian knights, and how many a dreary rock of grauwacke
they tapped     before   one  of their followers could be found,
must remain for another day.             Grand,   however, is     the
Devonian field on the Ehine, the Harz, and the Fichtelge-
birge.     So you see we have been moving."
      The geological doings at the Birmingham meeting of the
British     Association    proved    somewhat tame.       No great
paper made its appearance.           Perhaps the most important
communication in Section C was Murchison's            own account
of what Sedgwick and he had done on the Ehine and in
Westphalia.      But that account was necessarily incomplete,

 and    even    inaccurate, seeing that the work had not been
 brought to a close, and the later rambles of the autumn led
 the two explorers in some respects              to modify their earlier
 conclusions.       The   attention of geologists          had now      been
 seriously awakened to this settlement of the true age and

 were    in the field, and there could now be no doubt that
 the problems would not be thrown aside until their solu
tion had been found.
     A     shade    of sadness hung over the gathering of the
geologists     at Birmingham.         The day before they met,         Wil
liam Smith died.           He had lived to          see  his work bearing
abundant fruit in every corner of the globe, and now, full of
years    and honours, he left the harvest to be gathered                   by
younger generations.

          destroy the coal-boring                 mania in rocks of Silurian age.
      They have a poor little coal-field here which lies low in the

      poking at great expense, and with the money of unfortunate
      shareholders,               into my Stygian abysses.                 The 'actions' or
      shares            fell 50 per cent, by my speech, and, notwithstanding
      that          I   told unpleasant         truths,     I   was warmly applauded.1
      I should            have been off to-day, but              I    was so pressed    on     all
      sides         to remain that the departure was postponed                         till   to

      As for the              chaise seat, he had carried away the key, but on
      breaking            it   open     we found his        best      coat, some maps         and

short, and though up        daily at five (by candle-light)       we are
soon benighted.      Yet, with all, since     I   wrote we have done
a great deal.    From Coblenz we journeyed by the river to
Limburg on the Lahn, and thence passed over the Wester-
                                                ,
wald, a high basaltic region, to Dillenberg, where we had a
famous excursion on foot, headed by a        little broad-shouldered
clever Prussian bergmeister, who, booted and spurred, led the
way (pipe in mouth and hammer in hand), followed by                    S.,
De Verneuil, and myself and an English miner.                   We got
many     additional    fossils          At Limburg De Verneuil
took leave of us to run through the Eifel quickly to Paris.
He is an excellent companion, and of a charming temper,
never making a difficulty, and a thoroughly              gentlemanlike
Frenchman     ; 0    how     different  from a sulky       Bull !   Take
this for an example      :— His travelling   equipage,     consisting of
a little leather bag (the size of a shooting bag) was left be
hind at one of our stations.          This was forgotten before we
reached our next post,           where,  caressing a great      German

little eau   de vie  cured the wound, and on we travelled, he
as merry as ever, and ready again to play        with the next dog
at the next inn.        Arrived at Dillenberg, where the inn is
kept by an old Frenchman with three or four daughters, De
Verneuil was soon at the old piano, delighting the girls with
new versions of all the last Parisian airs (he plays very well),
and in ten minutes the gayest Mademoiselle was in full zest
at a duet with him — one of Strauss's last waltzes.         Without
a shirt, without a razor, without shoes, nothing daunted, he
was up at daybreak, and ready before              us for the field,
equipped in one of the old innkeeper's pairs of trousers and
 a pair   of thick shoes.    Eeaching home, his thin boots and
 pantaloons were ready.        A  village barber shaved him, and
 being invited    to dine out with the young English miner
 and his sisters, De Verneuil completely beat Sedgwick and
 myself in his toilet, notwithstanding        our trunks   and bags.
 I  was   quite sorry to lose him, and        I believe he equally
 regretted to quit us.       He has been of great use, from his
 intimate knowledge of species, and       I think  we have been    of
 use to him   in geology."     /
       The work      was now prolonged into the Eifel, where
 further   mingled interest and difficulty      met the travellers.
 The autumn had been making rapid strides towards winter,
 as dark mornings and       early nights reminded them.        There
 were problems      in that strange region of ancient slates and
 modern volcanoes      which they could then find no means of
 solving.     Nevertheless     they    considered   that they    had
 achieved enough for one season.             And   so  quitting  the
 grauwacke rocks of the Eifel and the marvellous volcanic
 cones which    overlie them, they dropt down the Moselle by
 small boat, hammering here and there by the way, and send

the last time — our third visit to some spots.             We may
occupy three, but perhaps only two, days in this work, and
then we may sail for England from Rotterdam on the 15th
or 16th, and reach London on the 17th."
      Soon after their return to England Murchison sent a long
account     of their autumn campaign to their common friend
Phillips.       From that letter it is evident     enough that     the
writer     did not feel   over- confident   in some parts of their
recent Continental       work, and indeed, that in certain main
parts his colleague and he were not yet in agreement.             But
they had still a great series of specimens           to be critically
 examined and compared        with those from Devon and Corn
 wall.     Much of the winter and early spring was given            to
 this task, with the effective and indeed indispensable assist
 ance    of such friends as Lonsdale, Sowerby, and Phillips.
As the boxes were one by one examined, alternate light and
 darkness passed over the minds of the examiners.            At   one
moment the field-work          which    seemed    to  have been     so
decisively settled by the two geologists began to look doubt
 ful, then it grew more than doubtful, then it seemed all
right again, and finally it had in part to be discarded        as the
true reading of the fossils came bit by bit intelligibly       out of
the examination.        Sedgwick remained at Cambridge,       but he

     The result of these laborious deliberations was at last
a complete accord on         all the main features of the question,
and the consequent          elaboration of another great paper for
the   Geological Society.1          We get a characteristic picture
of Murchison       in the following        account of these prepara

Austen's list,   as  (if to be depended on) it adds one or two good
clenching fossils to a list already too strong to admit of any
doubt as to the           identity   of the uppermost           Grauwacke

Sedgwick and myself.2           I  have arrived at this conclusion for
many months, and only waited the coming to town of my
colleague    to open the campaign.             Now that he has been
here, and that we are        all agreed, the course is clear, and we
shall soon give a grand memoir to show that the uppermost
Grauwacke       of both banks of the           Rhine,    as    well as the
three members of Dumont's             Terrain anihraxifere (supposed
by him to be Silurian), as well as the major part of the Harz
and of the Fichtelgebirge, are true Devonian, passing up into
Carboniferous       strata,   and reposing on Silurian.          ... I    am

a system, and on my prophecy            of what it would turn out in
fossils.   I too,   however, have made my         little mistakes, and      I
will thank you to allow           me to amend       some     words in my
   1 On the Classification and Distribution of the Older Rocks of North
Germany, etc., read 13th and 27th May 1840, and published in vol. vi. of
the second series of the Society's Transactions.
   J This was one of the points on which perfect unanimity was not reached
until after the two fellow-travellers returned to this country, Sedgwick
having a suspicion that the rocks of Rhineland and Westphalia, which
Murchison was inclined to rank as Devonian, were really Upper Silurian.
The grounds of this suspicion, and the difficulty of forming a satisfactory
conclusion, are well stated in the paper last quoted (op. fit., p. 226).

communication       at Birmingham.1            Again,   in returning by
 Boulogne    I  gave   a field lecture,       and,  supposing that De
Verneuil,   Dumont, and others were right in Silurianizing
these tracts,  I chimed      in with the error without looking for
fossils.
      " I am going to    Paris in ten days to read a memoir on
the Boulonnais, all the fossils of which have been sent to
 me, and they clearly Devonianize it.             ...   We propose our
triple subdivision of Devonian, Silurian,             and Cambrian for
 Europe.     Buckland     has given currency to our views          in his
 speech, and Greenough has closely imitated                our reform of
Devon and Cornwall.           So at last all is settled as to the great
boundaries."
      The brief visit to Paris, alluded to in this letter, proved
to be a pleasant and by no means unprofitable one.               Dinners
 at the embassy,     soire'es,   evenings at the opera, and other
 amusements,     helped to dilute the draught of science which
 Murchison     had been quaffing           so  vigorously   for so many
 months.     His letters convey           a   droll jumble    of mingled
 science and festivity.       Writing to Mrs. Murchison (April 4),
 he describes    a soire'e at    Lady Granville's.        " There  I saw

 every one," he says, not excluding Thiers, to whom                 I was
 presented,   and had some chat.             He seemed to be delighted
 to hear of Guizot's good reception in England, and called
 him ' un homme Eminent.'           Thiers is the drollest little body
 you ever saw, more like Dick Phillips the chemist, with his
 spectacles, than any one       I can   recollect at this moment.       I
 heard him to-day in the Chambre des Depute's                  — a short,
 clear, and  pithy speech, and       I  can understand how and       why
 he rules.

     "
       To-day    I had  De Verneuil with me from nine to one,
when we adjourned to M. de Meyendorf's,                who starts to
night for Petersburg, and with whom we arranged a Eussian
campaign for June,       July,  and August.      It is agreed (if I  do
not change my mind) that        I sail for Petersburg   the 25th May,
De Verneuil coming to meet me some days before.                    The
advantages      are too   great  to be lost,   both   as respects   the
Russian factotum and administrator, and De Verneuil."
     Amoug the hospitalities, he was especially pleased with
a soiree    or banquet      at which     he  was   entertained by a
                                                                  "

from M. Elie de Beaumont. In return for these kindnesses
he gave a dinner at the
                              " Eocher de Cancale," to a

which included Arago, the two Brongniarts, ]£lie de Beau
mont, Noggerath of Bonn, D'Orbigny, Valenciennes, Eusseger
from Egypt, D'Archiac, Bou6 (then fresh from Turkey), and
De Verneuil.
     The paper on the Boulonnais was well received at one
of the best meetings of the season of the Geological Society
of France.       Alexander    Brongniart    was   in the chair, and
an interesting discussion followed the paper, some of the
speakers    impugning the right of the Old Eed Sandstone             to
be regarded as a terrain, and Murchison          standing up stoutly
in its defence.
     After these few weeks in Paris, passed in this pleasant
way, he returned to London, having now but little time to
prepare for that Russian campaign, the plan of which he
had sketched out.       "What this plan was, and how        it was put
in execution, will be told in the succeeding Chapter.

                      CHAPTER          XIV.
           A GEOLOGICAL TOUR    IN NORTHERN RUSSIA.
    AMID the ceaseless revolutions which, during the long
lapse of geological time, the surface of our planet has under
gone, few tracts have escaped the effects    of those movements
by which the rocky crust has been crumpled and broken.
The older the rocks the longer have they been exposed to
these movements,    and the greater therefore are the fractures
and folds which have been made in their mass.         Hence the
task of the geologist,  though it may be often easy enough
among    the  unaltered deposits   of recent times, frequently
becomes more     and more difficult    the higher the antiquity
of the rocks which he seeks to interpret.         The older the
record, the more imperfect and illegible      may we expect its
pages to be.
    It was among some    of the older chronicles of the geolo
gical record that Sedgwick and Murchison        had now been at
work for many years.       With   rare   sagacity they had suc
ceeded  in eliciting the evidence    of the order of succession
among    some   of the oldest and most shattered        rocks of
Europe.     They had developed    that order in Britain, and as

   far as  they were able had traced its continuance among simi
  lar rocks on the Continent.          Many a time, however, had they
  been thwarted and baffled by the obstacles             presented by the
  dislocations       and contortions of the rocks, insomuch              that,
  although they felt sure that the general story               as  they had
  interpreted it would be sustained by further investigation,
  they could not       as  confidently defend all their details.
       In   the course of their work, accounts        had reached       them
  of marvellous regions in the north-east of Europe, to which
  the underground movements,             so  disastrous to the rocks of
  the central and western tracts of the Continent, had never
  reached    — a sort of geological elysium, where no volcanoes
                                                                              "
  had ever broken out,           where no " convulsions        of nature
  seemed ever to have disturbed the crust of the earth,                 from
 very early geological times         ; where the most ancient rocks,
 elsewhere        heaved   up into hard crystalline       mountains, lay
 still in their original half consolidated state,           as  if  the  seas
 in which         they were    laid down      had   only   recently     been
 drained     off.    Moreover, they had heard that in these undis
 turbed rocks fossils were found — shells,            corals, fishes, very
 like,  if   not the same      as, those  which they had disinterred
from      Silurian,    Devonian,     or Carboniferous      formations       at
home.        Murchison      heard still more      about these      wonders
during the visit to Paris referred to in the previous Chapter.
Evidently some good work was to be done in that Eussian
territory.         He might be able among such undisturbed rocks
to    demonstrate       by   a new mass of evidence          the order of
sequence       already determined in Britain, and to show that
instead of being a mere local arrangement,                that order was
really the normal one for Europe,           if not for the whole globe.

great knowledge of fossils would be of inestimable service.
The plan was accordingly sketched out, and forthwith                                 put
into execution.

was through the German geologists, and notably from Hum-

Silurian work of the English geologist was held by the highest geological

to stir up every sympathy of a naturalist.                We little know,
at least we do not know enough, in England of Ehrenberg's
 immense knowledge.         He is not merely a microscopic but a
 great philosophic observer.      Humboldt places him in a rank
 above     Cuvier, on account of the superior soundness                 and
 accuracy of his discoveries.      . .   .   Tell Sedgwick that       I  am

given to us this morning by Humboldt.                                   I       ventured to
mention of what great use your book would be to him before
he launched his               '
                                  Cosmos,' and       I hope    you   will   send    him one
of your first copies, through his relative Baron Biilow.                                  He

the   English Humboldt.

intend to broach, and have indeed done                          so here.        Seeing that
our various national associations prevent the men of all parts
of Europe from meeting each other,                               I   propose       that two
years hence, that                 is,   for 1842, each nation should abstain for
a   year to have its local meeting, and that we should all con
gregate       in   a   central town of Europe.                  Frankfort, the seat of
the Germanic                Diet, easily accessible from England,                   France,
and Italy, appears to me the best spot, and that we should
honour the close of Humboldt's life by placing him in our
chair.        No one         is   so    generally beloved, and no one was ever
his enemy, and he would give us                          a     fine broad philosophic
discourse.             If
                       I      can [induce] you and one or two strong men
to get up the steam,                    I    am sure    it   would be       a   really good
thing, and productive of much real advancement and enjoy
ment.         Write to me, Pension Anglaise, St. Petersburg, and
say what you                think of it.         I   am certain that the             British

Association      would rejoice to have          a year of reldche after
Manchester, or wherever we may go to next year, and by
having     so much time to prepare            we could make out an
 excellent   bill of  fare."
       With introductions to the authorities at St. Petersburg,
the travellers found their way smoothed for them.               To con
tinue our quotations : — " The chief of the douaniers asked for
 '
   Murchison,' and we had the advantage of having our things
passed and sealed up         with the Imperial arms, so that    I  might
have smuggled        a  mammoth."       Similar good fortune, by the
friendly aid of the Eussian authorities, awaited them during
the whole of their tour in the dominions of the Czar.
      After some preliminary sight-seeing, their plan of work
was arranged, and all preparations completed.             Baron A. von
Meyendorf was about to start on            a  tour through the country
to inquire into the state of manufactures and trade in the
internal    governments.         With   the    view of adding     to the
value of his report, he induced Murchison and De Verneuil
to accompany him, together with Count A. von Keyserling
and Professor Blasius.          The Baron's objects, however, were
so different from those of his fellow-travellers,         and his rate
of progress through the country         so   utterly incompatible with
adequate geological observation, that after a few weeks'            trial
they had to part company with him.                While he rushed for
ward to complete        his statistics, Murchison and De Vernueil,
accompanied by Koksharoff,          a young Eussian officer, who has
since done ex cellent service to Eussian geology and mineralogy,
followed at a more leisurely but still by no means         a slow pace.
For about two months they continued on the move.                Passing
northwards by the great lakes, they reached Archangel, and

made some explorations along the shores                        of the White Sea.
Ascending the Dwina, they penetrated into the heart of                             the
government of Vologda, and sweeping westwards by                                Nijnii
Novgorod, and the valley of the Volga, reached Moscow,
whence they returned by the                Valdai Hills to St. Petersburg.
      The mode of travelling differed very greatly from any
with which           Murchison's         previous geological rambles had
made him acquainted.                 Mounted on a light caleche,                some
times with five or six horses                    harnessed       to   it,   he rushed
through the country, over sand, boulders, and bogs, at the
rate of often as much as ten or twelve miles an hour.
                                                                               " With

Sydney Smith had once given to him of Holland,               — "the
place of eternal punishment for geologists, all mud, and not
a stone to be found."
     Over wide districts of territory there were no inns.        The
travellers quartered themselves for the night on some priest
or peasant, sleeping generally on their own " shake-downs "
upon the floor.       Nevertheless, they seem to have escaped
the   "                                 "
        creeping and biting horrors        by which such a berth
is usually accompanied.        The food being necessarily often
indifferent, at every available place they laid in     a new stock
of provisions, among which roast-beef would appear to have
usually had a place.       At one wretched village, for instance,
                   "
it is noted that we dined on our portable soup, with an egg
or two, followed by the inside of our roast beef, the exterior
being by this time (therm. 80°) in a greenish, mouldy state."
In  the towns, however, thanks to the semi-official character
of their journey, better fare and more comfortable quarters
were    secured   to them.    Thus at Archangel, the governor,
together with the English and French              consuls, afforded
them much help.          "
                           Everything,"    says  Murchison, " was
light and easy, except two great dinners of twenty- five per
sons each, which we ate      in company of Eussians, Germans,
Norwegians,      French,   and   English, — all these    languages
going a good pace throughout the meals."
     One of the pleasantest parts of the journey seems to have
been    the luxury of tea-drinking,       especially after days of

     The journals     and letters written during the tour give a
detailed enumeration of the stages, with copious notices of
the geology.      The writer seems to have been too busy with
the rocks to have had much leisure to observe, or at least to
describe,   what had not a distinct geological bearing.               Now
and    then,   indeed,    he    does make       a note    of some    social
custom or other non-scientific           fact.     Thus, at one    of the
villages    through     which     he  travelled      there had been     an
epidemic among the horses, and the ceremony of blessing the
animals was going on as he passed.                  "A   parish priest in
his robes was chanting in the centre of a group of horses,
whose heads       were    held around him by various men and
women.       We stopped the carriage for an instant to             see the
ceremony.       After a short prayer (his books lying before him
upon    a table) the priest dipped a sort of brush into a bowl
of water which he had consecrated,                 and   turning to each
horse dashed      some water       in its face, and afterwards on its
 flanks.    The running back and movement of the horses, the
 solemn faces       of the peasants,        and     of their   wives   and
 daughters,   who stood aloft on the high steps and balconies of
 the cottages, produced a very pleasing subject for the artist,
 and  I   regretted   for the hundredth time that            I had not    a

 original country."
      For the Eussian peasantry he conceived a high admira
 tion, which subsequent travelling            in the country only con
 firmed.     Their patience, good-nature, courtesy,          readiness     of
 resource, and cheerfulness,         called forth his frequent praises      ;
 nor less was he satisfied with the intelligence           and   civility of
 the officials with whom he came in contact.                  He entered
 the empire willing        to be pleased,       and  he left   it with an
 almost enthusiastic appreciation which lasted to the end of
 his life.
      Long leagues     of jolting over rough roads and byways
 tried at once the patience of the travellers and the timber
 of their carriage.       Here is an account of their triumphant

 approached Ijora,       so    this    gave   the   blacksmith     a three
 hours' job, whilst we were in          a   horrid hostelry.    Travelling
 on at night, we broke down again              within a hundred yards
of the post at the gate of Petersburg, and were obliged to
sleep here.      The wheel renovated,          we started,   and   it again
became dismembered five hundred yards from the starting-

      Murchison was fond of rapid geological work.               With his
faculty of quickly seizing the salient features of the geologi
cal structure of a country, he liked well to move swiftly
from point to point, eye and note book busy all the while
noting     and recording each point as he went along.               During

this first Eussian tour there was ample scope for the                grati
fication of this taste.         The general structure of the regions
visited was simple enough,            so  that a few traverses and the
examination of sections          at comparatively few points,         gave
the order and arrangement             of the rocks over vast areas       of
territory.      The difficulties of the task are thus summarized
by him      : —
     " Three causes impede geological researches in Northern
Eussia    :   1st,  The flatness and unbroken surface of the coun
try  ;  2d, The      thick cover of drift and alluvium        ; and, Zdly,
More than anything, the suspicion of the peasants, who never
would give information, inasmuch as they believe that you
are    in search of something by which they may be taxed or
oppressed by some order          of the Government, or its employes."
      And yet, notwithstanding          these scruples,    a vast deal of
cross- questioning        of the natives went on all through the
journey, sometimes          not without      good   effect; for,  in their
necessarily rapid traverse           of the country,      the   travellers,
having no guide-book literature to help them, trusted to the
 natives for information         as to sections     worthy     of visit on
 their route.        At Usting they met the man who had              made
 the now well-known deep sinkings                 in the frozen soil of
 Yakutsk, in Siberia.         Murchison     notes, that after a long    in
 terrogatory, he learnt that, with the exception of about 60
 feet of alluvium,       the shaft to the depth of 350 feet was sunk
 in hard grey limestone, with partings of shale and coal.
       By taking advantage         of all available information,       and
 making good use of their eyes along the line of journey,
 the travellers succeeded,         in spite of the flatness, and the
 interminable        sand,  clay, and boulders, in establishing the
 order of the         palaeozoic  formations     over   a great    part of

Northern Eussia.              From       a  lower mass of ancient crystal
line rocks they had           made       out  a most     complete and interest
ing ascending series of Silurian,                   Old Red Sandstone,              and
Carboniferous         deposits,      not hardened, broken, and crumpled
like the corresponding rocks in Britain, but                          flat, and only
partially consolidated.                So young indeed did               these    truly
ancient deposits appear,                that it was difficult to realize that
soft blue clays and loose friable limestones were the geolo
gical equivalents of hard fractured slates                         and marbles in
Western Europe.              Only by recognising in them the charac-
       Pterichthys, a Fossil Fish of the Old Red Sandstone  of Scotland and Russia.
 teristic fossils of the typical districts could their true geolo
 gical horizon be ascertained.
    By much the most important observation which they
 made was the discovery of the                   Old Red Sandstone fishes in
 the   same beds       with true Devonian shells—                   a  discovery the
 full import of which will be perceived if we remember the
 long and arduous struggle which Sedgwick and Murchison
 had    had     to show that the             Devonshire killas answered               in
 point of geological time to the Old Red Sandstone and Con -
 glomerate of other districts.
                                              " If  I   had seen nothing more
 than this," Murchison             writes, "    it would       have     been a great

 remarkable that he was no doubt anxious to get back to the
 Association Meeting, where he would have the opportunity
 of announcing his important discovery.                While on board the
 steamer dropping down the Baltic, he wrote                 full of glee to

     Of      the    memorably successful meeting of the                        British
Association in Glasgow in 1840 some notes may be gleaned
from his letters written under the enthusiasm of the time.
Thus, to Dr. Whewell he says — " We never had such good
work      as   in our geological section         ;    and   I   am told by Sabine
that Section A was admirably conducted by Forbes.                                  The
opportune          arrival of Enke, Agassiz, and Airey gave a great
brilliancy to our last days.               From the Duke of Hamilton,
whose palace has been open daily with dinners of fifty per
sons, down to my hearty friend Thomas Edington, there is
but one feeling of satisfaction.            It   is, I  give you my word, the
only meeting which           I    have attended where nothing has been
done which       I    could wish altered, save the statistical display                ;
all the rest has been done kindly, cordially, and well, which
I   very much attribute to the excellent Lord Provost and the
Locals, who have brought together all classes.

for the Times        ;      the   good, manly, unaffected             bearing of our

omitting the glorious day at Arran, when                 I       lectured to   a   good

marched         up at the close of the day to Brodick Castle with

the heir of the House of Douglas, preceded by the piper —
all these things,      I   say, have   well repaid me for my journey
from    Nijnii Novgorod,          and have more         than confirmed the
anticipations       I  entertained of the success of the Glasgow
meeting."        To that success Murchison              himself contributed
much.      Still holding the office of General Secretary, he had
to superintend a vast mass of details which, though separ
ately insignificant            enough,    combined       to   determine the
success    or failure of such a meeting.                 The kindly, genial
President, was not         a  man of science.        Instead of attempting
to prepare     a  scientific address, he very properly left to the
General Secretaries          the task of drawing up a         brief sketch of
                                    " It  is my fate," wrote Murchison

with Sabine, to prepare            a note    of the King's speech, to be
                         1
read at Glasgow."
     To this meeting a general interest attaches in the history
of British Geology, inasmuch              as  it brought into notice and
into personal acquaintance with the geologists                    of the day
two men who have since made their mark in the literature
of British Geology —Hugh                 Miller    and    Andrew Crombie
Eamsay.
      The name of the stone-mason               of Cromarty had for some
years    been     known       to geologists     who took interest in the
older rocks      as  that of a diligent and successful collector of
the fossils of the Old Eed Sandstone of the north of Scotland.8
He had recently come to Edinburgh                    as editor    of a news
paper.      In    the   columns of that journal he had begun to
publish sketches of the structure of the strange fishes which

he had disinterred, and graphic pictures of the scenery and
geology of the Cromarty          coast-line.    These contributions
had already attracted the notice of some of the leading
geologists     of the day.     Hence   a   kindly and appreciative
welcome greeted Miller's personal entrance            into the ranks.
The cordiality of his reception was shown by none more than
by Murchison, who, indeed, had been largely instrumental in
 bringing him forward, and to whom he next year gracefully
 acknowledged his gratitude by dedicating to the author of
the " Silurian System

 Sandstone."
       Mr. Ramsay was then a young man, who, betaking him
self to Arran, had scoured its glens, hill-sides, and shores, and
made a large geological map and model of the island.             These
he exhibited at the      British Association meeting, accompany
ing them with an explanatory paper.           His work showed him
to possess in     so eminent a degree the qualities out of which
 a good field-geologist is made, that Murchison           was greatly
 impressed with his capacity, and proposed to take him abroad
 with him in the following year.        Though that determination
 was not carried out, it led directly, as we shall         see, to Mr.
 Eamsay's joining the Geological          Survey, and thus opened
 up for him the path by which he has risen to distinction.
       Sedgwick did not appear at this meeting      ;  indeed, he had
 become so remiss      in his attendance at the gatherings of the
 Association     as to suggest   that he meant to retire from it
 altogether.      His  presence   was missed    during some of the
 discussions in the Geological Section, for an observant eye
 might now have perceived the first speck forming of that
 dark cloud which, slowly gathering year after year, finally

  blighted all his close friendship          with Murchison,     and led
 him to retire from the society which he had brightened for
 so many years.         Immediately after the meeting Murchison
 sent    him a letter containing          some  account of what had
 been done.       That letter has a special interest in connexion
 with future events.          It  serves too to show the active part
 its writer took in the management              of the Association,      as
 well   as  his characteristic regard for high social position      : —

meeting.       I  say a strong measure, because on my broaching
it to him he wrote me a letter of four sides (just before he
left us, and in the middle of the meeting) to show that he
was in every respect         disqualified.    Such, however, was not

alternation alluded to in my opening address (which               I  send

also     resolved to pull out Hugh           Miller of Cromarty, and
other Scotsmen of the north, and on the last day                 I gave  an
expost     of all that you and myself did in the beginning of
this foray, and held up our sections and our Dipteri.              Agassiz
followed, and ended          by naming the        curious new winged
creature Pterichthys Mtileri.

general application of his theory.

 Silurian in that region [North Wales], as inserted by your
 self in my map, was done without Ordnance maps, and

myself were aware of the             age  of the beds in the Vale of

 De la Beche and Phillips pressed me about the natural line
 of separation between          S.   and C., on which        I  replied   as
 in my book, that in many parts a fixed line of demarcation
 was impossible, but that          I was  convinced that to whatever
 extent the same species of fossils as in the Lower Silurian

 result of some traverses which he had made across the supposed boundary-
 line between the Cambrian and Silurian tracts of North Wales.            He
 could find no fossils in the so-called Cambrian rocks differing from those
 of the Lower Silurian series, and stated that " if there be any boundary
 between the Upper Cambrian and Lower Silurian systems, it must be
 defined by other evidence than that of fossils." — JBrit. Assoc.    Reports,

     After all the scientific and social work of the Association
 Meeting at Glasgow had been successfully completed                   there
began another series of hospitalities.          Not a few of the landed
proprietors, specially those who had taken part in the gather
ing, invited the more prominent members of the Association
to visit them.      In this way Murchison and his wife               found
themselves     once more    in the heart of the Highlands, enjoying
the scenery and good cheer of that regioa              From Lord Brea-

old homely shieling of the Black Mount               ;  but part of the
journey was planned to include a visit to the north of Scot
land, with Agassiz, to look after the Old Red Sandstone and
its fishes.    By the 29th of October he had reached Alnwick
Castle on his homeward journey, whence he writes to Sir

      The " frost-biting         referred to the remarkable series
 of observations        by   Agassiz     among      the    glaciers of the
 Alps, and the extension of them to Scotland by Buck-
 land, Lyell, and Agassiz himself.              Many years earlier Sir
 James Hall had directed attention to the way in which the
 rocks on the       surface    of the country had been smoothed,
 polished, and striated, by some great natural agent.              He made
 a careful examination         of these " dressed rocks," attributing
 them to the effects of some powerful           de"bacles   or earthquake-
 waves,    sweeping over the land and hurrying                  along sand,
gravel, and huge loose blocks and boulders.                     A  study of
 the phenomena of the Swiss valleys, however, had taught
 Charpentier, and afterwards Agassiz, that the smoothing and
 scratching of the rocks could have been the work of but one
 agent  —glacier-ice.1      Profiting    by Swiss experience, Buck-
land had already begun to identify             some of Hall's " dressed
rocks" and other superficial phenomena,                as  strictly parallel
with those among the Alpine valleys and plains.                   And now,
in the autumn of this year, the great Swiss naturalist, who
had come to Scotland chiefly to study Old Eed Sandstone
fishes, found everywhere, to his amazement,               the counterparts
of the ice- worn rocks and glacier          de"bris which he had been
so intently looking at among his own great mountains.                   He
not merely corroborated Dr. Buckland's                identifications, but
went    so far as to  proclaim that Scotland, the north of Eng
land, and indeed a great part of the northern hemisphere,
had once been actually buried under vast sheets of ice.
     So bold and      startling     a doctrine involved        an intimate
   1 It is common to attribute the first observation of this geological
agency of glaciers to Agassiz.    It was recorded by Charpentier, however,
apparently as a known fact, five years before Agassiz' s observations
appeared. — Annaks des Mines, 1835, viii.

acquaintance with the everyday life and motions of a glacier,
which at that time British geologists          did not possess.        Con
sequently the views of Agassiz met with little favour.                    The
opposition which Murchison promised them was joined                         in
vigorously by other scientific leaders.           Hence -fully twenty
years had to pass, and a new generation            of labourers had to
appear upon the scene, before the essential truth            of Agassiz's
teachmg was generally recognised.1
      But pleasant and useful though this Scotch tour proved
to    the busy General Secretary, it formed            only a kind of
interlude     in the serious task of interpreting the geological
structure of the older rocks of Eussia,            As he said himself,
he had returned from the shores          of the White Sea to take his
place     in the Association       at Glasgow.      Hence, when once
 more back amongst          his note-books and maps in London, he
 returned heart and soul to Eussian              geology.     While the
 incidents of travel remained still fresh in his recollection
 he wrote the        article   (already referred to) for the March
 number of the Quarterly Review, on " Tours in the Eussian
 Provinces."       While reviewing the works of recent travellers
 in that part of Europe he reveals, in a characteristic                  way,
 his own identity.         For there must have been few readers of
 the gossipy article who did not perceive that its author had
 been    with Moore in Spain and Portugal, that he had                   sub
  sequently dabbled in art at Eome, that he retained a               senti
  mental affection for the old Highland Jacobites and the doings
                           " out in the ' 1 5," that he was addicted
  of  those who were

in   short, he could be no other than Roderick Impey Murchi-
son, though under      a somewhat different guise from that in
which he was ordinarily known.
      The more serious work of this winter appears to have
consisted partly in the preparation of the memoir on the
continental     Devonian rocks with Sedgwick (and, of course,
with the repetition       of delay    at   Cambridge   and   urgent
entreaty     from London),     but  mainly    in drawing    up   an
account of the Eussian journey for the Geological Society.
This latter task helped to indicate more clearly the points
of defective knowledge which were to be cleared up by the
next tour.
      That tour had been partly planned before he and his
companion, De Verneuil, had left Russia.           It was heartily
entered    into by the Eussian authorities, from whom, indeed,
 Murchison      received a flattering    request to continue    his
labours, with the promise of ample assistance.          He deter
 mined to avail himself of these offers, and strike across the
 Russian Empire, into the heart of the Ural Mountains.           So
long and arduous a survey was evidently one which could
 not be accomplished in a short summer holiday.          It  would
 require longer time and more endurance than that of the
 previous year.
      Two Societies claimed and certainly received Murchison's
 firmest  allegiance — the Geological Society, and the British
 Association.     His proposed absence from this country, how
 ever, altered    considerably  his  relations   to both, and    he
 accordingly made up his mind to resign the post of General
 Secretary    to the British Association.      In intimating this
 design to the President,    Dr. Whewell,    he could  justify his
 absence this year by the importance         of the work he had

312            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                               [iw.
undertaken abroad,       as well as  by the fact that he had not
hitherto failed to take his share of work at every meeting
of the Association since its foundation, and he concluded his
letter with the assurance, that when the 29th of             July   came
round, he would not forget the gathering to be held then at
                                                              "
Plymouth under Whewell's leadership, but would drink to
their healths     if any liquor can be had in the Ural Moun
tains."
      Things    had turned    out otherwise         at  the   Geological
 Society, for there, at their anniversary in February, and with
 the knowledge that he would be absent from England                  dur
 ing the greater part of the year, his associates            once more
 placed Murchison       in the President's chair, and sent him on
 his self-imposed travel with all the prestige which such                 a
 post of honour carries with it.
       As already mentioned, he had formed a wish to help the
 young geologist who had shown         so   much geological      skill   by
 his model and description of Arran, and that wish had to
  some extent taken practical       shape      in a plan to carry Mr.
  Ramsay abroad with him.        The latter, accordingly, came to
  London about the middle of March           ;  but at the last moment
  the proposed     plan of conjoint travel was changed.              This
  change, at first so bitterly disappointing to his young friend
  and future colleague, but in the end          so fraught with benefit
  to both, was thus announced by Murchison              at the time    : —
  " Having decided
                       upon going to Eussia, and not to America
  (and   I shall be off in ten days),  I  have     unwillingly given up
  the idea of taking you with me           ;   but, in doing  so, I  have
  secured for you a much more lucrative place than any which
   I could have offered you about myself.              Air. De la Beche
   has  kindly promised to place you on his list of assistants of

is one for which you are particularly fitted,       I  hope you     will
approve of my endeavours to serve you."
     Mr. Eamsay has kindly furnished the following reminis
 cences of these early days of his intercourse       with his future
chief :— " I think    I  must have dined five or six times with
Mr. M. during my thirteen days' stay in London           ; once at the
Geological Club, at the Crown and Anchor by Temple Bar,
where   I first   met some of the great geologists whom          I had
not previously seen in Glasgow at the B. A. meeting.                Mr.
M. introduced me specially to old John Taylor, a famous
man in the mining world, and much respected              and beloved
by all the geologists,       and indeed by every one.          He was
treasurer to the Club.        I sat  between  him and Major Clerke
— an old warrior, with      a cork leg, a man of perfectly polished
manner,     witty, and with a vast fund of anecdotes,             some
of which were of the complexion called blue.            At that Club
meeting,     I   recollect   Sedgwick     and   Buckland,     Phillips,
Greenough,       Fitton, Lyell, Sopwith, and Owen, and there
were others that       I forget.    Forbes was then a young man
just on the eve of starting to join Graves in the              ^Egean.
The dinner made a great impression on me.                  Mr. M., as
 President   of the Society, was in the chair, but           I  do not
recollect anything that took place except the mirth created
at our end of the table by Major              Clerke and old      John
Taylor's deep voice and pleasant laugh."           A  few days after
 that dinner the President was on his way to Eussia, while
his friend     joined the Geological Survey at Tenby, there
to begin a long and distinguished             connexion     with that
branch of the public service, of which he is now the honoured
 and esteemed chief.

314            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                        [an.
   Two days before starting Murchison sent a parting           note
to Sedgwick, in which he wrote        : — " To  cleanse an Augean
stable filled  with Rhenish, German, and Eussian fossils,       and
to leave    the home   of the British Association clean      swept
and   all in order, has been no light work for the last fort
night.    To make the map for our memoir gave me no small
trouble, but now all is done,        and    the whole concern     is
ready to go to press,    if the Council does not turn crotchety
and puzzle-headed.       If  they do, we must publish elsewhere
without    loss of time, for the data are good.       ... I am off
the day after to-morrow                  God   bless*  you.  Go  to
Plymouth and fight my battles.        It  is now your turn."

                          CHAPTER XV.
   CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN RUSSIA AND THE URAL MOUNTAINS.
    IT  was  with a more ambitious programme,         and with the
advantage     of the previous year's experience     of the country,
that Murchison       once more,   in the spring of 1841, bent his
steps   to the Neva.       De Verneuil again accompanied him,
and    shared   in the honours and the toils of a still more
eventful and successful campaign than any which they had
yet undertaken together.         The two friends had grown dear
to each other.       But apart from the ties of mutual esteem,
they    presented     a singularly   happy    conjunction  of qua
lities for their special scientific work.       Murchison's  quick
eye   in detecting the leading elements of geological structure
would have       been   of comparatively     minor value without
De Verneuil's      wide knowledge of the early forms of life,
 on the determination of which the comparison of the rocks
 yet unvisited    with others already well known was mainly
 to be based.       In  their Eussian   colleague   von Keyserling
 they found an admirable travelling         companion, and one to
 whose judgment and powers of observation the success of their
 conjoint work in the empire of the Czar was largely indebted.

316            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                   [uu.
     The route chosen,       as  before,   lay by Paris and Berlin.
During a short halt at Paris Murchison had an opportunity
of gathering the opinions of the geologists              there as to the
work which Sedgwick and he had been doing in Devonshire
and    Ehineland.       He lost no time in letting his friend
                         "                                         "
know    the  result.       Every one here," he writes, is most
anxious    for  the    appearance     of our memoir,            as   well   as
Dumont and the Belgians                        Whatever      dubiety may
shroud the minds of some of our countrymen, the thing
is already quite done       as  to the Continent.          All    the  palae
ontologists are with us, and        I   am happy to       tell you    I   saw
yesterday in Elie        de   Beaumont's closet         the. copperplates
of the table of colours of the             great     map    of France, in
which Devonian, Silurian,         and    Cambrian       are   all regularly
engraved.
     " As
           you are going to Plymouth this year,                  I  beg you
will look about      jrou   both inside and outside of the Sec
tion   C          It   may be the object of                      and
to mystify our divisiona           But stand       to  your guns.        The
types are clear and distinct, and beds of passage are not
to frighten us.   ...    It would gratify me much            if   you could
devote an hour to me immediately after the               Plymouth meet
ing, and tell me how all went             off.  ....       The geological
sight here is the Artesian         fountain     at   Crenelle,      which     I
visited yesterday.       It  is a noble rush of smoking water —
quite a comfortable tepid bath.            Portez-vous bien, my dear
friend.    Think of me when        I am   in Siberia,     as I shall   think
of you holding forth on the Breakwater             ;  and wishing you a
happy meeting, and an absence of all gout, believe me,"                  etc.
     There would seem to have been only one incident of note
in the early part of the journey      :  Murchison and De Verneuil

1841.]
                        ST. PETERSBURG.                           317
were all but arrested, in entering the Prussian territories, on
the charge of issuing false notes, which they had unwittingly
obtained at Paris.       They were helped out of the difficulty by
Humboldt.        Such portions of their short stay at Berlin        as
could be spared from the hospitalities abundantly offered to
them by their German scientific brethren, were devoted to
the acquisition     of additional information as to what was
known of Eussian geology.           They arrived at St. Petersburg
on the 30th of April.
       The Eussian capital was at that time full of bustle and
excitement, on the occasion          of the marriage of the eldest
son and heir of the Emperor Nicholas.           A  magnificent series
of  fe'tes  had been organized to celebrate         the event.    Our
geologists had determined to        see these  sights before begin
ning their      work.     Besides, Murchison      looked forward to
obtaining considerable official assistance for his survey.         He
judged it a good stroke of policy to make the acquaintance of
 as many of the leading ministers and heads           of departments
as possible.      At   the  British Embassy he met many old
acquaintances, and made not a few new ones, obtaining like
 wise the much-coveted invitation          to the Imperial     Palace.
 How these days of festival were spent is best told in his
letters to his wife   : —
      " The last few
                        days have given us pleasant dinners, at
Lord Clanricarde's, at the French Ambassador's, at General
Tcheffkine's, where we settled our line of march, at the Minis
ter of Finance's, Count Cancrine, and, yesterday,           at Prince
Butera's.      The last was the most        sumptuous of all these
feeds, many Circassian        lacqueys,   and mushrooms in every
 dish.    From General Kisseleff, the Minister of the Imperial
Domains,     I had a history   of the successive denudations of the

            '

wood of each region of Eussia, and how each denudation had
proceeded       from south to north.             Herodotus describes     the
regions bordering on Turkey, now grassy steppes, as dense
forests.     This being for centuries the great line of march
of Tartars and Easterns towards Europe, was cleared                   first ;
secondly,     a  middle region, half wood, half arable, as at Mos
cow, etc.  ;   thirdly, the present forest region, all in the north."
      " The event which charmed            me was the great Court ball
of Wednesday, on the occasion of the marriage,                to which we
were invited by his Majesty's             order.    The entrances    to the
wonderful Winter Palace are              so numerous that you are not
surprised when you perceive how             a  thousand star-and-gartered
eminences       and well-dressed women have           all within an hour
                                 '
found their way into the             Salle Blanche'      The whole of this
 exquisite Palace being re-built and re-gilt, it is now in full
 beauty, and the blaze of light, the elegance           of the candelabras,
 and the masses of gold, quite rivet attention.                We have no
 notion of lighting, and       I now understand the criticism of the
 foreigners who attended our Coronation.
       "We waited for our presentation, which took place in about
 half an hour, when the Emperor came up to Lord Clanricarde,
                                             '
 and asked for me, saying to me,               You have travelled a great
 deal in our country, and intend to do                 so again.'   On my
 thanking his Majesty          for the kindness of my reception, he
                                   '
 cut me short by saying,              C'est a vous que nous devons nos
 remerciments profonds de venir parmi nous pour nous e'claircir
 et de nous      e*tre si utile.      Je  vous prie d'accepter    mon per
  sonnel,' etc.       He then asked if that was not my companion
 near me, and De Verneuil had his talk                ;  but my excellent
  friend being short-sighted, had mistaken the Emperor, so that
  when his Majesty         left us, De V. turned to me coolly and

      " It was however in the advanced
                                                 part of the evening that
 I really      became intimate with the Czar.        I had    glided through
 all the apartments, and was seated in converse with Count
 Strogonoff, when the Emperor appeared,               and we were all on
 foot.      He selected me, and leaning against a pilaster began
 a regular conversation,         asking me my opinion on various parts
 of the country.           After  I had told him where I had been, he
said,   '
           Great   traveller as I am, you have already seen large
tracts of my       count1y which I have never visited.'              He then
got me to open out upon my own hobby, and put me quite at
home      ;  I ventured     on my first endeavour at explanation, by
stating how dearly            I  was  interested in the        structure of a
country the whole northern region of which was made up of
 strata which       I  had spent so many years in classifying and
 arranging in other parts of Europe            ; how their vast scale in
 Russia had surprised me, and how they offered evidences which
were wanting in the western countries.                  We then talked of
coal, and       I ventured     on a geological lecture in order to ex
plain where coal would not be found, the uses of our science,
etc.    I    ushered    it in by saying that      I was certain that his
Majesty liked to know the truth, and my honest opinion, and
he instantly         said,   'Surtout, parlez franchement.'           Having
given him the Silurian reasons against any coal deposits
worthy of the name in any of the very ancient rocks on which
his metropolis was situated, and a general view of the                 ABC,
to all of which he listened most attentively,             I then comforted
him about the great coal-field of the Donetz, in Southern
Eussia, to which         I was destined to go.   '
                                                   Coal,'  I said, 'was to be
looked for in the south, and not in the north, which seemed

in the latter, but annihilated in the former tracts.                 '

of the Empire, even under the reign of my son                      !

offered a few words      in favour of the Crown peasants of the
north, against whom the wood-cutting                  remark was directed,
and spoke of their intelligence, honesty, and the absence of
all great crimes, and how it had astonished us to travel through
so wide a space, sleeping       with our doors open, and in lofts or
where we could, without being robbed,                  and  in tracts        where

     " After
              asking what was to be the length of our next tour,
and what we hoped to find out and                     see, he desired me to
express    every wish to his officers, and all my wants should
be supplied.

           inquired about my former career, in what arms                     I had

chatted away, and talked of his children, and the happiness
of his social circle.
   " On
          my saying that     I had     served     in infantry, cavalry, and
staff in Portugal, Spain, and Sicily, his Majesty evidently
took to me, for he said that his doctrine always had been that
the army was the best school for every profession, and he
was right glad to see that       it  made a good geologist.                 I then

adding that       I    had been out at six in the morning in the

      " Two
                days had passed, and amidst my thousand occupa
tions    I  had forgotten         the   Emperor's words.              On Friday
morning, when in my dressing-gown, d la Russe, at break
fast, the son of old Mrs. Wilson, our landlady, rushed in ex
              '
claiming,       La, mother, only think of               it !   At  eight o'clock
the Emperor came in a single drosky to the English Church,

and then he went through all the ceremony.'                        The old   Ad
miral, being       a    Protestant, was buried in a vault under the
English Church.            I then  bemoaned         my want of tact in not
having had my uniform on and ready at the church to meet
the great man who thus honoured the memory of my coun
tryman."
     The letters and diaries written by our traveller at this

 he met at the    Imperial entertainments.       Daring the day      he
 seems to have found time for an occasional interview with
 some   of the scientific men of St. Petersburg, and for desul
 tory preparation for his journey.          But evidently courtiers
 and court life had for the time quite dispossessed        geologists
 and geology in the attentions of the author of the " Silurian
 System."     At   the beginning of the week following that in
 which he had made the acquaintance of the Czar and Impe
 rial family, he attended a ball given by the newly married
 Czarewitch.      From his reminiscences of that evening a few
 sentences may be quoted.
     " The
            Emperor talked to me again, asking me what           I had
                                   '                          '
been doing this morning.             Four hours,' said he,      at the
School of Mines, and two hours with Professor Eichwald                  !
Why, you will quite tire yourself before you set out on your
long journey.      You must have good stout legs,' he continued,
passing his hand at the same time to the side of my thigh,
which he pinched.         He then discoursed of discipline, system,
etc., and alluding      to the review  of the morrow, he observed,
'
  You will    see  three of my sons in the corps of the cadets.'
'The Grand Duke Constantino will,             I suppose,   command
them?' said     I.     'Command!'     replied he.   'No, indeed! he
 will not   even be     in the front rank of privates;     he   is yet
too   young.      The little fellow     has  plenty   of talent, but
 requires to be kept in order.         We must have a good bridle
 on him for some time to come.'         His Majesty again spoke to
 me   with gratitude concerning my labours, and said he had
 no doubt my success        in my present profession was mainly
 due to my old     military education, which he thought was the
best school for     all men.

 marriage being over,   it was time to take to real work, and to
 begin the geological researches on the grand scale which had
 been devised through the departmental        activity of General
 Tcheffkine,  then serving under       the Minister   of Finance,
 Cancrine, and being chief of the School of Mines."
     Count von Keyserling was named by the Imperial Govern
 ment  aa one of the geologists of the expedition, with the in
 valuable Lieutenant Koksharof, who was again appointed to
 accompany the travellers, and smooth their way for them.
 The plan of operations embraced a series of traverses of the
 vast central and southern provinces of the empire, together
with as full an examination as could be made of the chain
of the Ural Mountains.       The party was to divide for short
periods, and meet again at given points, to compare and con
tinue its observations, with the expectation of being able, per
haps, to concentrate   the work of even two summers into one.
     "All  our inspections of collections, schools of mines,
academies,   etc., being over, and our notebooks filled      with
memoranda of things to be seen in Eussia in Europe and the
Ural Mountains, there      was still one grand public fete to be
witnessed.    The Emperor, as Cancrine had reminded me,
had asked me to see him among his true Bussians at Mos
cow.    But this was not to take place for a fortnight, and in
that time the geological division under        my orders    might
effect much.    So we galloped away to Moscow."
     Their object was to examine the various outcrops of
limestone and thin seams of coal south of Moscow — a task
which   was successfully      accomplished   without any note
worthy incident.     Up and away to their labours,     sometimes
by three o'clock in the morning, the travellers contrived to
get over a goodly number of leagues      of country, and, rattling

 over the ground in their tilega, to raise many a thick cloud
of dust from the " Tchornaia Zemlia " or black-earth of             the
 Russian plains, so that they returned to Moscow in a sadly-
 begrimed condition, but in time for the f£tes.
   "The     great  event of the Emperor            presenting the heir-
apparent to his people was about to come off.                At  10 A.M.
we drove to the     Kremlin.       We were ushered through crowds
of Eussian officers in the palace, and eventually found our
way to the top of the building.            I was on   the balcony, close
to the room whence the Emperor              issued.    He observed me,
and nodded to me.        At  1 1   he issued on foot and descended
the steps in   full Cossack    dress to the Grande Place,         which
he had to cross       to reach the great church, and at least
20,000 persons now filled it.          A   very narrow way had been
formed up to this moment, but when the great bell tolled
and Nicholas      issued forth to the threshold, all line was
broken, and the crowd presented itself in one dense mass
before   him like a wall.       He stepped down towards them,
and some touching his clothes, others his hands, he waved
his hand gently up and down, and the dense mass opened
out before him.       Like a wedge he worked his way through,
the adoring multitude, who were               clinging  round his legs
and touching his clothes.        .   .   .
    "
       Profiting by Demidoffs kindness, by half-past             twelve
we   finally stormed the Kremlin, and forced on into the
central tower, where we placed the niece of Napoleon [the
Princess Mathilde] between          De Verneuil and myself, like a
Princess of the Kremlin, M. Demidoff acting as her Eussian
marito, and we as her French and English aides-de-camp.
We were destined to wait for the great sight an hour or two,
during which excellent sandwiches and good Madeira and

m1.]            FESTIVITIES AT            MOSCOW.                 325
sherry,   and the French       conversation, full      of naive and
sparkling sallies from the daughter of Jerome, made us pass
the time most agreeably.      At length the    corte"ge  arrived — the
good  Marie in her caleche and four greys, the Emperor on
her right hand, her brothers on the left, and the Grand Duke
He"ritier passing close along the line of troops.         When they
entered the   Holy Gate of the Kremlin, the sight of course
closed for us.
    " As we descended the staircase,
                                           thinking all sights were
over, the attendants stopped us at a doorway, and, in an
instant, the Emperor, with the Grand Duchess on his arm,
passed   within a few paces of us.       He at once recognised us
with  a  gracious nod.     Of this I should   not have felt so cer
tain if Count Benhendorff had not told me two hours after
wards that his Majesty had informed him of our position.
Nicholas's eye is everywhere, and long may          it  be so !
    " Count Benhendorff
                             gave us an account of the Imperial
reception.    At Ribinsk — a thriving      commercial town on the
Volga, with 30,000 inhabitants       — it appears    that the people
who had never seen the Emperor kept up such a roar under
the Imperial residence, that at last, when midnight came, they
were requested to allow the Emperor            to sleep.     The hint
was no sooner given than obeyed.              But what followed       ?
Not a man slunk sulkily away       ;  the loyal mass lay down and
slept at their posts  till the return   of day was ushered in by
a general chanticleer from those sturdy monarch- loving          Mus
covites.    Well then may Nicholas           exclaim, 'These     good
people are not yet so advanced as to have learnt not to love
their sovereign
                 '
                   — words which     he used to me     in speaking of
the Eussians   of the interior.
    "
      Benhendorff also informed me that the horse-artillery

which we saw this       morning   had marched 110 versts the
day before, ie. seventy miles   !  This beats the famous march
of the old Fourth Dragoons, my father-in-law,             General
Hugonin's     regiment, which     marched from Canterbury       to
London in    a day,  and acted that evening in the Borough in
quelling one of the Lord George Gordon riots in 1784."
    But it was now time to doff uniforms and court-dresses,
and take to the more homely garb of travelling         geologists.
Murchison and his friends had planned their journey in such
a  way that    it should comprise many minor lateral excur
sions, and they now proceeded to put the plan        into execu
tion.   Starting  from Moscow, they crossed       the empire by
Vladimir, Kasan, and Perm into the Ural Mountains,            and
the edge of the vast steppes of Siberia.     From these remote
bounds they turned       southwards to explore the southern
Urals as far as Orsk, whence, bending their course once more
in a westerly direction, they passed through Orenburg, re-
crossing the Volga at Sarepta, traversing the country of the
Don Cossacks to the Sea of Azov, and then turning north
ward to make        another traverse of the empire back by
Moscow to St. Petersburg.
    Five busy months passed away in these journeys.         Mur
chison kept as usual a    full diary.   Being mainly geological,
his memoranda were subsequently elaborated into the great
work on " Russia      and the Ural Mountains."        But among
them occur records of incidents       of travel and other notes,
 which give us glimpses of the scenery         and people  among
whom he lived, and of the way in which this extensive and
rapid survey of the Eussian domains was achieved.
     As on the previous journey, the main highways of the

 mi.]           THE START FROM             MOSCOW.              327
 country were followed.       Provided with a formidable Imperial
 document, countersigned and double-sealed to enforce atten
 tion from all persons      in authority   along their route,    the
 travellers had usually little difficulty in procuring    horses at
 the stations.    In   most cases, indeed, the chief dignitary of
 each place waited on them personally, and        in not a few in
 stances   treated them with the frankest hospitality.          The
 kindness which Murchison experienced in this way even in
 the wildest tracts of the empire, filled him with that deep
 affection for Eussia and the Eussians       which used to show
 itself continually all through his life.    But neither Imperial
 ukase nor kindly proffered assistance         could wholly over
 come the natural difficulties    of the country.    The geologists
 had made up their mind to a good deal of rough fare and
 sorry lodging, nor in these respects     were  their prognostica
 tions unrealized.
     During the earlier part of the journey through Vladimir,
Nijnii    Novgorod, and Kazan, there was little either in the
geology or the scenery to delay the expedition.         Murchison,
indeed, seems to have got      so disgusted with the interminable
red sandstones and marls as to break out into some doggerel
lines in French, that being the language which was now his
only mode of communication with his travelling companions
and the natives of the country.         These rocks were not yet
understood by him.       He became proud enough of them before
long, for they furnished to him the type of a new geological
subdivision, to which, from the province where they were so
well   developed,  he  gave  the name of " Permian."
     In  spite of these tedious red rocks, Kazan afforded     some
interest.    The fat jolly Vice-Governor had instructions to look
well after the travellers, and it would appear that he did his

best.    In   their honour he donned his full uniform, white
laced hat, and numerous orders, and arrived at their         inn with
the determination that they should see everything           in Kazan
forthwith.      In vain they explained that     one of the Professors
had already kindly offered to escort them through the collec
tions of the University.        What    ! had he not received the
Imperial command to look after them himself?             and besides,
had he not been a sailor in the days of the old war, when
the   British and Eussian fleets were allied, and did he not
still remember a few broken words of English — " I           beg you,
         "
sare,"     ver much wind," etc.     !    He would show them the
collections, and everything and everybody too.           De Verneuil
and von Keyserling had made a detour.          Murchison, therefore,
under the supervision of the Vice-Governor,              took further
notes for the     Ural Survey from the specimens        and informa
tion obtainable      from the Professors, and attended sundry
feasts into which the exuberant hospitality of          Kazan broke
out.     When the party reunited, and all was ready for the
march again, the Vice-Governor must needs give one fare
well banquet.       " We sat down," Murchison writes, "
                                                                forty-
 five  in a small room,       and the Vice-Governor was quite
                                                  '             '

'                     '
   Mary Dickenson       when in England."
      Over many leagues       of red rocks the party journeyed
through the government of Perm towards                the long     low
ridges of the Urals.        They passed on the way a gang of
manacled prisoners bound for Siberia, to whom, amid his
notes of
            "
              Roth-todt-liegende,"
                                      " Nagelflue," and other
                                                                geolo
gical matters, Murchison devotes a few words in his journal.
About a hundred and fifty men and women, under a strong
 military escort, the men in some cases manacled in couples,

                         SIBERIAN EXILES.                         329
  were marching to their exile.          "Thank God!" he writes,
  " in
       England we have the sea for our high-road to banish
  ment  ; for such scenes are very harassing."
       While the exiles were tramping along the highway, the
 geologists,   having gained a rising ground, were luxuriating
 in the first distinct view of the real crest, if it may be so
 called, of the chain of the Ural Mountains        —a  long, slightly
 undulated line, rising behind a succession of wooded ridges,
 and forming a singularly unimpressive landscape, considered
 as a part  of one of the leading mountain-chains of Europe.        It
 was not easy to say when the mountain              land was really
                                                  "
 entered, so gradual had been the ascent.           Though the Ural
 had been a chain in my imagination, we were really going
 over it at a gallop, the highest hill, indeed, not exceeding (in
 elevation above its base) our Surrey Lower Green-sandstone."
 With no rocks      on either side  of the dull road, and with dark
 rainy weather, the passage of one of the depressions         in the
 low watershed of Europe           and Asia    became    dreary  and
 monotonous,      till  the travellers   found   themselves in the
heart of the gold-mining region and in a comfortable inn at
 Ekaterinburg.
      Over vast tracts of Eussia the rocks lie in horizontal
 sheets, so  little disturbed that, failing river gorges and other
natural sections, it becomes no easy task to determine their
proper order.        Like a series of sheets of cloth laid on a
table, the uppermost conceals          those  which lie beneath    it.
Eastwards, however, they have been ridged up into the long
swell pf     the     Urals, and our travellers, having       already
acquired a good deal of miscellaneous information from the
labours of Humboldt, G. Rose, Ehrenberg, Helmersen, Hoff
man, and others, regarding that       little-known tract, were now

330           SIR RODERICK MURCHISOS.                         [IBB.
bent upon discovering how far the elevation of the           Ural
chain had exposed the edges of the strata, so as to allow their
order and thickness and fossil contents to be determined         in
an easier and more satisfactory way than could be done over
leagues of the flat lowlands.    They lost no time in beginning
their work, and before many weeks had passed, by dividing
their forces into two parties, and moving upon separate        but
parallel lines of research, with occasional reunions by con
verging traverses at the chief mining establishments, they
succeeded   in ascertaining the general geological structure of
the Ural Mountains, in such a way as to permit the main
masses of the rocks   in that chain to be effectually compared
with the geological succession     already established elsewhere
in Europe.
     One great impediment     in their way was the want of any
even tolerable map on which      to record their work  —a   want,
the paralysing effect of which only the geologist who has
been  similarly placed can adequately appreciate.       " Were    I
Emperor of Russia," he writes,     "I would make verily at least
one thousand   of my lazy officers work for their laced coats,
and produce me a good map, or they should study physical
geography in Eastern Siberia.      Excepting General Tcheffkine
and a few, very few,    I never met with any man who knew
how to handle a map.       It is really an affair of an hour to
get a governor to make his way upon a map along a well-
beaten road.    I never shall   forget my surprise last year at
Nijnii Novgorod, when the Government House was               ran
sacked for a map, upon which my        line of march to the south
of Moscow was to be traced.         At    length what came forth
from this centre of Eussian       wealth and commerce,     in the
very  fair of Nijnii, and in the Government          House?  —A

district map of Schoubert's which          I have     so anathematized    ?
— No,    but one of the little three-rouble maps which                 the
common traveller buys, with simply the names of the chief
places and small towns        !   The same occurred at Kostroma,
where the Governor had no other.
     " If such    be the case  in the heart of Eussia, how are we to
expect that the best-informed            natives here       in the Urals
should have any idea of their broken and diversified region               ?
Eussia must produce geographers            before     she can expect    to
have geologists.       The cost of a single regiment of cavalry
would    effect this great      national work     ;  and would that the
Emperor could be led to         see its desirableness and efficacy for
all  good measures       of internal    improvement       !   I never yet
heard a Eussian speak of any place as being east, west, north,
or south of such a point, but merely          as so    many versts from
this or that town.          Ask him in what direction and            he is
dumb.      First he will say it is to the right or to the left,
according     as he    may have travelled       ;   and  it is only by   a
serious cross-examination, which would puzzle a barrister of
the northern circuit, that you can guess at something like
the fact.     But alas    ! after fancying myself informed, how
wide have       I  found nature from their mark             !   Here, for
example, you        will find people -disputing         as to whether a
leading    place,    such as Stataoust,      is to the east or west
side of the       Ural; and      as  for  the roads,       they  trust  to
their clever peasants, stout horses, and ever-resisting             taran-
tasse."
     The absence       of reliable maps, though it proved a con
tinual hindrance in the process of geologizing, was never
allowed to retard the bodily activity of the party.               Of that
party and its local        auxiliaries,  as   they started on one of

their exploratory        tours,    the journal gives the following
 account : —
     " A route from the Zavod
                                        [mining-station]    of Chresto-
 vodsvisgensk across the Ural chain to the valley of the               Is,
 on the eastern      watershed, was now to be undertaken,               as
 arranged     in our programme.           But     this  was    no slight
 affair, inasmuch     as   no party had travelled by this old and
 abandoned corduroy road through the forests and sloughs
 for many years, yet, by sending peasants              across,   arrange
 ments were made.
      " At  3  A.M., 2d   July,  I  roused the whole party, and at £
 past four we were in march from the Zavod, being a party
of twenty cavaliers of most grotesque and varied outline.
The President of the Geological Society need not describe
 himself.     The Vice-President of the Geological Society of
 France sported his long blue Spanish cloak, and a broad-
brimmed, round-topped,            Moscow grey hat, which, on the
 back    of a Wouvermanns'          grey horse, formed an essential
 item    in the motley group.            Herr Graube, the Master of
 the Mint, who led us, had his long boots above his knees,
 and large furred coloshes, with his little German cap.              Von
 Keyserling,    in his green cap and jacket, bestrode           a gallant
 brown, and his servant,        Juan the Venerable, turned out         on
 a Bussian saddle     in a long black cloak, on a white Cossack-
 like beast.     The Ispravnick of the district, who honoured
us, was a sort    of sub-military looking figure, with spectacles
 and    Life-guard     boots,    superadded     to a black     shooting-
jacket.     The German doctor of the Zavod, a most obliging
 man, was mounted on a capital iron-grey, with high action.
 Lastly came       our    two    Eussian    officers,  Karspinski     and
 Koksharoff,     both of whom were knocked up by our rapid

ride of   yesterday.      The former, dreading the result, to-day
 liad strapped     a large   pillow on his russia-leather red and
 yellow demi-peak saddle.            Our bearded    fellows were per
 haps the best for the painter, with their caftans, double-
  coned hats, and long boots       ; one armed   with an axe behind       ;
  another   with De Verneuil's           gun in hand    ; a  third with
 long Turkish pipes     ;  and others astride of animals carrying
  sacks, bags, and beds.
       " Our start was somewhat cheerless          as to weather,      for
  the day looked lowering      ;  and in a few minutes we were in
  the interminable     boggy forests which fringe the flanks of
  the Ural.     It was soon evident that       all haste was in vain.
  The sloughs exceeded all that my imagination had conjured
  up.    The road was a sort of bridle-road, not to be described
  to English understanding, for it consisted in most parts,
  and for ten or twenty versts, of planks            and   round trees,
  most of them rotten and breaking, placed over the quag
  mires here and there, the track along which seemed hope
  less, but for the dexterity of a Eussian horse.         If  the plank
  broke and his leg went in up to the hock, he pulled        it leisurely
  out, whilst with the other he was fighting his way up the
  rounded    slippery   single     plank which     remained.        If his
  tread on one end brought the other up in his face, he would
  gently and evenly move on          till the equilibrium was estab
  lished,  and he gained another safe footing.            Add to this,
  massive trees, including     the noble Pinus cembra and others,
  lying across the road,         immense roots branching           in all
  directions, sedge and long grass          up to the horse's belly,
  and you may have some              idea of   a  bridle-road     in the
  Ural."
       Not much geology could be done under such unfavourable

conditions, nor could any clear                notion be formed of the
general aspect of the Ural chain, though the peculiarities
of the wooded regions became only too familiar.                         Now and
then the travellers succeeded              in getting above the line of
wood,    so as     to catch      a   glimpse of the summits of the
Ural and the country beyond.                    Thus at the Katchkanar

 splintered crags, shooting high over the damp sombre forests,
 and nourishing       in their crevices and amid their slopes                      a

 Swiss valley.       From this peak they could look on one side
 over the far rolling sea of dark pine, with here and there                        a
 snow-streaked summit rising island-like out of                       it  ; on the
 other side lay the vast plains of Siberia, with                         the level

featureless surface, and to the eye at least with the bound
less horizon of a great       sea.1
      At  other places on the crest of the chain rocky scarps
were encountered.          From Stataoust the party reached some
conspicuous rocks rising along the water parting between
Europe and Asia.            " Clambering up to the summit, and
                                                        '
with one leg on either Continent, we sang                 God save the
Emperor.'      In  this sequestered spot, however, neither officers
nor workmen knew the present national air, which                  I   had
heard at St. Petersburg and Moscow, but began to chant
            '
our old       God save the King,' which they had sung               since
the    time of Peter the Great.            I  then hummed this new
air, and this music of Levoff was thus first given out in
the western borders of Siberia."
     But the most exciting and instructive work which they
carried out in these remote regions was the exploration of
some of the river-courses.          Owing to the need of abundant
water-power       for mining purposes,         the streams     had been
manipulated       in many different ways, some being turned
into a succession of dams and waterfalls, others deprived of
their water to fill lateral reservoirs.        It was in these natural
sections that the true structure of the Ural might be most
confidently searched for, and special care was given to them,
though     but    for   the   active co-operation      of the    mining
authorities, these denies would have proved far more for
midable obstacles        than the morasses and corduroy bridle-
tracks.     How the work was done may be judged from the
following extract : —

 that his first love was God             and the Emperor,         the   next
 strangers   ;  for he had travelled          in Eussia, and knew the
 value   of hospitality.         The descent       of this river is quite
 unique, for the water-traveller must quit his canoe at every
 one of the hundred mill-races.            There are upwards of two
 hundred      of these      mill-dams     between Ekaterinburg           and
 Kamensk.       At    every one of these, one's goods, chattels, and
 self must go out and in, and his canoe be shoved over the
 rough roots,       sticks,   and blocks      (often held     together    by
 large   blocks       of  stones),     and    dropped     some    eight    or
 fifteen feet    as  the case may be.              No ordinary traveller
 can   execute    this journey without great loss of time and
 patience.      For us the authorities were so active that at
 each stoppage       a multitude      was waiting to get us through.

 went (at what cost          it matters not in this land), carrying
 with us   the inmates of one village till we reached the next.
 No one who has not descended this Siberian river would
 believe how much comfort and industry appear on its banks.
 No mill, numerous as they were, was without six or more
little carts before it.         A   dense  population lives all along
the Issetz.      Good white large churches rise up               here and
there, and everywhere the cottages are nice and clean."
    More adventurous was the descent of one of the streams on
the other or western slope of the Ural.              Von Keyserling and
De Verneuil had been making independent observations, and
the party re-united at a raining station on the Serebrianska,
a small stream flowing into the Tchussovaya, which descends
into the great Permian lowlands.             " The descent of the Sere-

               he says,             one of the most          memorable days
of my life.      The distance to be accomplished by this winding
stream was        seventy versts, or nearly fifty English miles.
When     I went    to rest, the bed       of the river was almost quite
dry, with not water enough to drown a rat, and yet we were
to effect the miracle         of floating down in a six-oared boat.

 curves of the stream.         With   a hundred     groundings        and
 stoppages, we got tired of our big boat of honour, and took
 to the canoes.    These answered well for a while, but trust
 ing to shoot through some stakes and nets (myself on my
 back at the head of the canoe), we (i.e. De Verneuil and
 myself)   were capsized in a strong current.            I   saved    my
 note-book (see the stains), but my cloak, bag, pipe, etc., went
 floating down.      A   curious scene    followed, after we had
 scrambled out to the shore.         The other canoe shot by and
 picked up our floating apparatus.        Fortunately      this letting
 off the waters had brought down some natives to catch fish,
 and they had a fire, by which         we dried ourselves, whilst
 their large wolf-dogs     lay around    us.     When we re-em
 barked, we shot several ducks (Merjanier),           and here       and
there found limestones and shales striking to the N.N.W.
 Some of the limestones were charged        with Devonian fossils.
    " After this, evening began to fall.        Saddles,    anticlinals,
and synclinals     arose  in magnificent masses on the rocky
banks, but our boat-bottom was soon knocked to pieces by
grounding at least   a hundred times, and whisking round as in
a waltz at each shock.       It now filled  so  rapidly that we had
just time to escape.       We had then a fine evening scene.
We landed on shingle, and got into the forest, not having
seen a house or hut for fifty miles.        The dense wildness of
the    scene, the jungle     and intricacy    of a Russian        forest,
can    never be forgotten.     We had to cross fallen trees and
branches,   and to force through underwood up to our necks.

vertical beds to form peaks, then coiled over even like ropes
in   a   storm, or broken in every direction.                      Making many

   " On the
                 following      day we worked away down the river
in the same great leaky boat as before, the boatmen singing
their carols, and abusing the Ispravnicks and proprietors
who force them to drink bad                      vodki       or whisky by their

so    unlike what our coarse               country           fellows   would sing.
With       no stimulants,       getting but black bread, and working
in wet clothes, for they were continually in the river shoving
the boat on, they sang in rhymes, one of which                            as trans
lated by Koksharoff was          :    —
  '
      My   love she lives on the banks of a rapid stream,
      And when    she goes to the garden to pull  rose, she thinks of me.'

Another of these ditties began — Mary, come back from
                                                  '
the bower.'       A third       was   a   comic song, quizzing            a    soldier
who got into      a   house when tipsy.              A    fourth was     a   jollifica
tion of peasants       in   a   drinking-shop,           to beat the maker of
bad brandy, with        a    famous loud refrain               in which all the
boatmen joined heartily."
      When, after toils of this kind, the travellers found them
selves again     in one or other of the busy mining stations, they
met with much courteous,              and even exuberant, hospitality.
Thus before leaving Ekaterinburg                 a   dinner was given in their

       Posts were neither frequent nor regular, or at least the
geologists were too constantly on the move to be able to count
upon many fixed addresses to which letters could be sent for
them.          Murchison,       however, though busy, body and soul, in
Eussian geology, naturally found his thoughts many a time

The principal       man, or coachman,   was a fine long, aquiline-

loose shaggy fur.       He had the three wheelers in hand, pre

 danger for the riders, and for us also, who, in case of     a  fall,
 would have been well smashed."
      These Bashkir of the Ural had no sympathy with the
 geologists  in their search after the mammoth and other bones

 creatures in red dresses.            The confidence of these primitive
people is very great, for they allowed us to grope for tea
spoons and bread          in the cupboards in which their bank-notes
and roubles were lying loose !"
     Living in Bashkir tents, the geologists learned to relish a
sort of diet which anywhere else might have been deemed
hardly tolerable.             One staple article of food in summer
                                          "
 among these simple people is Koumiss," — a preparation of
mare's milk, — " the staff of life, the bread, meat, and wine of
the Bashkir."            Of this liquor Murchison would appear to
have become fond, and to have thriven on it.                 He tells how
at one of the Bashkir stations, where the party had spent
the night, " after a very good breakfast, all sorts of saluta
tions followed, such as the drinking                  of Koumiss     to the
prosperity of our host.             Then we heard his story of losing
sixty sheep, killed by three wolves last winter           ; next we found
that he paid        so   many roubles for his present wife, and that
her dress cost him more than herself.                 I expressed   a  wish
to him to have a Bashkir vest, belt, pouch, and cap, and he
offered me his own.              It  was with difficulty that    I got him
to take the value to replace them."1

      At    last, with note-books laden with descriptions               and
sections of the various traverses            which they had made          of
the Ural chain, the travellers began to move once more into
the great western plain.            They had succeeded in reaching
the central masses of that chain, and in recognising, by fossil
evidence,      that    from a nucleus of granite and crystalline
rocks, Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous strata are suc
cessively thrown oft           This evidence had been industriously
gathered from river-channels, road-sides, mining operations,
and every available source of information.                For days to
gether     they had been off soon after daybreak for renewed
hammering, and many a time night descended                    upon them
while      they were      still plying their task.       Now and then,
indeed,     when pinched for time, they even essayed to use
their hammers in the dark, after the manner of M. Boub4e,
whose example Murchison used jocularly to quote, up to the
end of his life.1
      It  was now time to        turn westwards, towards the coal
fields   of the south of Eussia, the exploration of which had
been     fixed as one of the chief objects of the expedition.
But Orenburg lay in their way, with its governor, the brave,
though unfortunate, hero of the Khivan expedition, General
PerovskL         He was then at his country              quarters, in a
picturesque wooded valley at the far edge of the Steppe, a
long way to the north-east of the town.                  To   see  a little

Stataoust, and medals A la Rwae, hung round me."

           geologist, said Sir Roderick, used to maintain that a good deal
of geological work could be done as well by night as by day. Rocks had

acquaintance      of a noted Eussian     soldier, were attractions
Murchison could not resist.          So he undertook     the inter
minably tedious drive across the Steppe, and spent a few
days with more thorough pleasure than he had enjoyed since
leaving home.       With all the comforts of civilized life, this
place was yet quite in the wilds, — Bashkir attendants, with
their picturesque costumes, a blazing bonfire lighted in the
encampment, and the moonlight glancing on the lances of
the Bashkir guard.         Perovski made a great impression on
the retired officer of the 36th. One evening he gave him
the following anecdote : — When the utter failure of the
                                "
 Khivan expedition become known, all Eussia turned upon
me, and     with any other master than my good Emperor        I was
 a   ruined   man.    But the Emperor declared he would not
 condemn me until the opinion of the Duke of Wellington
 was obtained, who, being a Marshal in the Eussian army,
 should have the whole case laid before him.         This was done
 through Baron Brunnow, and then came the Duke's dictum             :
 '
   I  am   of opinion that General Perovski acted       as a skilful
 general, and that      if  he had not retreated when he did,
 instead of losing a fourth part of his army, he might have
 lost the whole.     Success was impossible under such intense
 cold.'"    On this judgment being given, the Emperor not only
 absolved Perovski, but gave him the government of Oren
                                   "
 burg. The General added, — You see that             I owe every
 thing to your illustrious Duke, and      I beg  of you, when you
 return to England, to take some opportunity of letting him
 know what a grateful person          I am."   "Thia," Murchisou
 adds,
         "
           I took care to do."
      The visit to the General led actually        to yet another
 traverse of the Ural, for he showed the travellers       a map of

the southern part of the chain, so greatly superior to any
thing which they had yet been fortunate enough to meet with,
that it prompted a strong desire to take one final look at the
Ural geology, and with his help among the Bashkir popula
tion, they succeeded        in once more crossing the chain in its
central part, and collated their work in the southern and
northern portions.
    At   last, however, they had unwillingly to turn their

geology there was nothing either very interesting or com
plicated to detain them.           They therefore hurried on through
the Kirghis Steppes to Sarepta, crossing once more the great
Volga, and tracing as they went some of the limits of the

 ancient sea of which the present Caspian is but a shrunk
 remnant.      Through the plains of the Don, among Cossacks
 and Kalmucks, their course was yet more rapid.              On 8th

 September the journal records, — De Vemeuil sleeping in
 the hut, and myself in the carriage.         What is a Cossack
post station    ?   Everything about it is very different from a
 flaming great wooden      Russian station.    First, you  see a  dot
 upon the Steppe, which magnifies as you approach it to a
 thing about the size of the smallest Irish hut, and not very
 unlike one in externals, being concocted       of mud and reeds,
 with very little wood.       But the interior is very different
 from an Irish cabin.      I now  write in a room ten feet square,
 and on the table lieth the regular sealed post-book.           This
 official chamber is six and a half feet high, and has a large
 stove in the corner, a door four feet high, and two windows
 eighteen inches by nine.        The walls are all well white
 washed, the      tables well scoured, and the floor well beaten
 and clean swept."
       Skirting the sea of Azov, they turned northwards into the
 coal-field of the Donetz.      There they made a series of most
important observations,      bearing both on general questions of
geology and on the industrial resources            of the Eussian
Empire.       They found the coal-seams      to lie,  like many of
those in the north of England and in Scotland, among the
marine strata of the Carboniferous Limestone, there being,
so far as they could see, no true " Coal-measures," in the
geologist's sense of that term, in Eussia.      They learnt, more
over,    that though the coal was quite workable,           and had
indeed been mined for years,         it lay among     strata which,
unlike those of the vast tracts in the centre of the Empire,
had been subject to such underground           disturbances    as  to

present many large dislocations and many foldings.             They
traced  it westwards until they found it die out again on
ancient crystalline      rocks, while northward     and eastwards
they learnt that     it  passed   under sheets of Cretaceous and
Tertiary deposits.
     In the course      of this prolonged tour, while the main
attention of the geologists had been given to the structure
of the solid rocks, their ingenuity had been on many occa
sions called forth by the anomalous features presented by
the surface deposits of the country.      These difficulties started
up in renewed force on the way north to Moscow.                They
are thus stated in the journal : — " The surface          of Hussia
affords some puzzling       problems.   In  passing from south to
north you first meet with the tract of the northern drift, the
materials of which        become   more and more numerous          at
every ten versts.        Still the old rule (applied by     me last
year) answers     perfectly, viz., the diluvia are three- fourths
derived from the subjacent rocks, so as largely and loosely
to indicate the zone of country you are traversing, provided
you have the key to the subsoils of Eussia.            Thus, whilst
the loose stuff was all yellow in the country composed of
yellow Devonians, so to-day, viz., from Lichvin to Kaluga,
you are immersed either in ferruginous, or reddish, or white
sands.    The latter prevail in great quantity in the horrible
tracts north    and south of Peremyschl       — a most wretched
town, — and their presence is well explained by the destruc
tion of the yellow        and white   sands of the Carboniferous
Limestone   ; for,  with the exception of the section opposite to
Peremyschl, and one or two rare localities, the valley of the
Oka is here denuded to         a  width of several versts, which
space is flooded   in spring-time.    This is one of the numeroua

cases which realize       in modern times (viz., in spring-floods)
the geologist's     idea (mine at least)       of the condition of the
earth's surface during the intermediate period, viz., shortly
after emersion from the sea, when the mammoth had left his
bones sticking in the mud.
       " The
              drifting and excavation are explicable as in other
places.     The vast spaces denuded and broken up in the most
horizontal districts explain perfectly the vast masses of local
detritus in the northern governments, and their transport for
150 versts southwards.
       " But how
                    explain the Tchornaia-zem which overlaps the
diluvium of the north, and is also spread over vast regions of
the centre and south of Eussia, sometimes                 in river valleys,
sometimes      on slopes,    sometimes      on high plateaux, and is
always of precisely the same composition, without a trace of
true pebbles, or, in short, of any extra ingredient                 ? What
colours the black loam        ?  If  it be of vegetable       origin, whole
forests    of mighty extent must have been destroyed to pro
duce it.     But how destroyed     ?   In all other    superficial deposits,
whether in bog, in mud, or in the youngest tertiaries, we find
traces    of the trees, branches, grasses, etc., but not           a vestige
have we in the Tchornoi-zem.            All is  a  black, uniform, finely
levigated paste, sometimes highly tenacious,                and very much
so when not worked into         with the plough, for after labour it
works into a fine black mould.              In    this virgin state     it is
seldom to be seen, for 90 to 100 parts of all that is good in
soil, from the Ural to the swamps of Poland, is already in
culture.      The specimens     I selected, however, had evidently
never been touched by plough or man                  ;   they were taken
from the precipitous sides of the Oka, just after a subsidence
of the cliffs which exposed the section, the lowest deposit of

Perhaps it is Tertiary, but only perhaps, for we have similar
ironstones under the chalk at Kursk, and similar limestones

operation, then are we to suppose that the Tchornaia-zem is
the result of a great change of a pre-existing terrestrial sur
face       ?     To believe in this seems to me very difficult, and for
this reason, that no imaginable destructive sub-aerial agency
could produce a general wide-spread and uniform condition.
By what conceivable sub-aerial agency can this very thick
black cerate have been spread out as with a mighty trowel,

the last covering of mud and slime which was left by the
retirement of the Liassic                       sea,    and was to       a   great extent

      By the beginning of October the various members of the
 party, who had separated for the purpose of making different
 traverses of the country, were once more brought together in
Moscow.        There several days were spent by Murchison " in
 condensing thoughts, comparing notes, examining Von               Key-
serling and Koksharoff, consulting with De Verueuil and all
the party, and preparing two general sections,               a Tableau
 Ge'ne'rale, the map, and the report of fourteen pages to Count
 Caucrine on the results of the 'Expe"dition Ge"ologique.'         Also
 a letter was concocted to old Professor Fischer, for publication
in the Bulletin     de Moscou    and the German periodicals, giving
a slight sketch of our doings, and in which          I first suggested
the term Permian."           Petersburg was reached      again on the
 8th of October.
     Of his last few days in Eussia the journal            records   the
following memoranda        : —" Having     travelled 20,000 versts in
the distant provinces without losing a pin, we were twice
robbed between        Novgorod      and Moscow      of our beds and
things behind the carriage.          One trunk only was left in the
hinder    parts,    and this     was   viced   on ; but besides     this
security,   I resolved to guard       it from the station where we
detected    our losses, and so letting        down the head of the
caleche,   I laid  De Verneuil's      double-barrelled gun over the
rear, and determined to bag the first         thief who approached      ;
and in      this  form    we    reached    Madam     Wilson's house.
Besides     several   interviews     with the old minister,      Count
Cancrine (who was much gratified with my report, of which
he had prepared a digest for the Emperor), and a dinner at
his house, and the same at Tcheffkine's, we were occupied

in looking after more than twenty cases of fossils, which had
arrived from our distant parts, and were deposited           in   the
magazine    of the School of Mines.
     " All our reports and work being delivered in, official
letters were     received announcing      the Second      Class    St
Anne in diamonds for myself, and a plain cross for De
Verneuil,   as a   mark   of the Emperor's approbation of our
labours.

                                                      Saturday the
 24th, and  Friday was fixed by the Emperor for seeing us —
a great compliment, as       it was  His Majesty's working day
with his ministers.       On these occasions    Nicholas   uses no
ceremony.       After thanking     us for taking   so much pains
about the Ural Mountains, and after asking        if I thought    the
gold alluvia were likely to last much longer, he desired me
to open out and explain         the rolls of drawing     and paper
 under my arm.      This  I did  secundum artem.    He was serious
when he was receiving his lesson about the productive and
 non-productive tracts of coal, and the rationale thereof, and
 laughing   when he      saw the    Productus   Cancrini and the
 Qoniatites   Tcheffkini   inscribed   upon the roll, he asked,
 '
   Quel espece de produit est celui-la de mon ami le Comte           ?'
 'And    so you    have seen General Perovski?          He is my
 good and dear friend.      I hope you   were pleased   with him    ?
                                                                      '
 I  had then to sing the praises,        which   I   naturally did
 con am/ore, of the frank and gallant soldier who had been so
 truly kind, and also so very useful to us.

    into his noble and frank countenance,                          and then let them
    try to tell me he is a tyrant.                No   ;   utter ignorance of the
    nature       of the man has led to this most unjust                                 notion.
    Nicholas       is above all deceit, and squares                      his conduct on
    more noble principles than that of any potentate of modern
    times.         He disdains subterfuge, and is transparent as to
    all his emotions.               Hence   if   ill-served         (knowing perfectly
    what       duty    is)   he does not suppress               his feelings.             He   is
    sometimes quick in his anger, but like all such generous
    souls, his confidence in his friends             is    unbounded.              Firm and
    unchanging in his resolves as an Emperor of Eussia must
    be,   if   he desires to reign, his untiring                   aim   is   to ameliorate
    every institution which he can touch.                          But alas    !   so     bound
    up    is   everything in Eussia by forms, customs,                          and preju

    good,      and capable          of making       every conceivable reform,

      The official courtesy and real kindness shown to     Murchi-
 son  in the metropolis made the leave-taking more than a
 matter of mere form.       From one and all of his friends he
 received the heartiest congratulations and good wishes, with
 the expression of a hope for his speedy return.          He notes,
 for instance, that Count Cancrine, the virtual Prime Minister
 of the Empire, " embraced us, kissing me three times ; and
 thus encouraged      with every promise if   I would return, we
 took our leave."
     In spite of    fogs and other delays, including     a feverish
 attack, the result      of the last week     of excitement    and
 conviviality in St. Petersburg,      our traveller   reached   the
mouth of the Humber on the 1st November.                  The last
record   in the Eussian journal, written while the vessel was
within a few miles of the Yorkshire coast, is as follows :—
     " Seven months and seven
                                    days have now elapsed since
I  left my home on a fine day in the end of March, and            I
hail Old England with a shining sun again after having
travelled through space equal to the diameter of the earth.
The Kirghis, the Kalmuck, and the Bashkir excitements
are now to give way to plain         English comforts, of which
I  have    neither tasted nor thought since     I  bade   adieu to
them."
     Thus ended Murchison's Eussian campaign.           The ample
record which is given in the great work by his colleagues
and himself      has  made   the general scientific   results long
familiar to geologists.        The geological   structure   of the
Eussian     provinces   was   now   for the first   time   broadly
sketched out and mapped         so as to  bring the rocks of one
half of the European continent into family relationship with
those of the other half.       Nor were the benefits     conferred

only on the country in which the long and arduous journey
had been made.           New light was thrown on questions of
general geological import, such             as the  structure of moun
tains, the physical geography of the times of the Old Red
Sandstone,    the classification of the Devonian and Old Red
Sandstone rocks of Western Europe, the history of the earlier
part of the Carboniferous period, the true order and relations
of the red rocks lying between               the Coal-measures and the
base    of the Jurassic series, the former extension of that
ancient sea of which the modern Caspian and Sea of Aral
are but the diminishing            fragments, the southern extension
of the ice-borne boulders carried during the Ice Age from
Finland and the north far into the low plains of Europe,
the occurrence of gold and its distribution in the old alluvia
of rivers.     The campaign indeed proved to be most fruitful
in its   issues.     It raised Murchison         to the same place      with
regard to the        geology of Eussia          that Pallas    fills in its
botany.1     It  opened out a new field for research, and paved
the way for the good work which has since been done in
Russia by other and later observers.
       On Murchison       himself its influence was profound.             It
gave breadth to his method of dealing              with palaeozoic rocks     ;
it increased his aptitude in applying the             evidence    of fossils
to determine      questions of geological chronology,               and    it
strengthened his confidence in his Silurian and Devonian
work, and in the principles            on which that      work had been
based.      Bringing him          too    into   constant    and intimate
association with foreigners and foreign ways of life and
thought, the Eussian campaign increased in a high degree

his sympathy        and respect       for men and things        abroad,
removed      from him much,        if   not all, of that insularity of
feeling of which      his countrymen are         so often accused, and
made him more than ever the considerate              friend and cour
teous host of     all scientific brethren whose lot brought them
to this country, no matter from what quarter of the globe
they might come.
    Whether the influences of this bold and skilfully con
ducted    journey were altogether beneficial may be matter
for doubt.       In the   course   of a few months the geological
structure of a vast empire embracing the greater part of
Europe had been sketched out — a feat to which there had
probably      been   no   parallel     in the annals of geological
exploration.      The success of the campaign and the applause
which that success brought from all quarters, were so great
that a more than usually well-balanced              nature might well
have felt the strain too severe to keep its equipoise.            From
this time forward characteristic's          which   may be traced     in
the foregoing narrative became            more strongly developed     in
Murchison's      character.    In  his letters and in his published
writings    his own labours fill a larger and larger space.         His
friends could trace an increasing impatience of opposition or
contradiction     in scientific matters,      a growing    tendency to
discover in the work of other fellow-labourers           a want  of due
recognition on their part of what had been done                by him,
a habit, which became more and more confirmed, of speaking
of the researches of his contemporaries, specially of younger
men,   in   a  soit of patronizing       or condescending way.       He
had hitherto been, as       it were, one of the captains of a regi
ment  ;  he now felt himself entitled to assume the           authority
of a general of division.       To many men who did not know

iMi.]             INFLUENCE OF SUCCESS.                           357
him, or who knew him only slightly, this tendency assumed
an    air of arrogance,    and was resented      as an  unwarranted
assumption of superiority.         But they who knew Murchison
well, and had occasion to        see him in many different lights,
will doubtless admit that these failings were in large measure
those    of manner, and at the most lay openly on the sur
face    of his character.      You saw some of them at once,
almost before you saw anything else.          Hence   it  was natural
enough      that   casual   intercourse   with    him    should  give
the impression      of a man altogether wrapt up in his own
work     and fame.     Yet underneath      those   outer and rather
forbidding     peculiarities   lay a generous      and sympathetic
nature     which   inspired    many    an act  of   unsolicited   and
unexpected kindness, and which was known to refuse to
be alienated even after the deepest         ingratitude.    The suc
cess    of the Eussian      researches   probably    quickened   into
undue     prominence some of the less pleasing features             in
Murchison's      character, but they in no way lessened           the
measure     of kindly interest and sympathy which, in spite of
the way he often chose to show them, were those             of a true
friend.

                       CHAPTER XVI.
            THE CHAIR OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY.
     WITH the prestige which the Russian geological tour had
given him all over Europe, Murchison returned to resume
his town life in London.       There lay a vast amount of work
before   him to be done this winter (1841-2).       First of all
the notes of the explorations in Russia had to be carefully
worked out     in anticipation of the visit which it had   been
arranged should be paid to him by his fellow-travellers,
with the view of settling their plans for the preparation of
their   conjoint   volumes on the geology of the Muscovite
dominions.       The   experience which     the writing of the
Silurian System had furnished warned him that his new
literary venture would       be  no easy task  ; we  shall find,
indeed, that   just as in the case of the growth of that work,
so  in the elaboration of Russia and    the Ural Mountains, the
progress   of his pen, slow enough of itself, needed to be con
tinually sustained by fresh arguments with the hammer.
Only now, the intervals of field-work, instead of taking the
geologist to old haunts, social and scientific, in Wales and
the Border counties, led him to wide digressions into Scan
dinavia, France, Germany, Poland, Russia — in short,        into
many far separated       tracts of the Continent, whence fresh
evidence could be gathered bearing on what had come to

be his great geological quest — the true order and classifica
tion of the older fossiliferous rocks of Europe.
     But besides    this main piece of work, he had now to
take his place and perform personally the duties of Presi
dent of the Geological Society, an office to which,         as  we
have seen, he had been for the second time elected, just
before   he started on    his second journey to Eussia.      Since
he had previously filled the chair he had vastly increased
his reputation.      Moreover, the fortune inherited      by Mrs.
Murchison had very considerably augmented his income               ;
hence,    while   eager  to sustain   his position   with dignity
and hospitality, he found       himself much more      able to do
so on a large scale than     in the old and more modest days
 at Bryanston Place.
     Add to these various avocations the numerous              and
exacting calls upon the time and thought of a man who
occupies a prominent place in London society — calls which,
though now increasing enormously on Murchison's             hands,
he yet strove to meet as far as he could — and we see what
the change must have been from the wilds of the Urals to
the turmoil of London.
     The narrative now to be followed        will lead us through
the doings of the busy years which culminated in the pub
lication of the work on Eussia.          It was during that time
that the classification    developed in the Silurian       System
received its broad basis in Europe.        In that time, too, the
seeds began to germinate      of the estrangement   which utterly
destroyed   the ancient brotherly friendship between Sedgwick
and Murchison.       There is thus a special interest attaching
to this period  in relation both to Murchison's life and to the
progress of palaeozoic geology.

entirely destroyed that              I   do not feel for your loss of                  twenty-
five couple of good hounds                 !   and the only compensation                           is,

the thing was impracticable.1                   Last week        I      was at Beaudesert
trying to shoot in snow, but not prevented during two days
from geologizing the fine high wilds of Cannock Chase among
the old Marquis's blackcocks, grouse, and big boulder- stones.
Then    I     went to Lord Dartmouth's, where                     I     met   a    large party
and read an inaugural                 address           to the Midland Geological
Society, and made five speeches after dinner (Lord Ward                                            in
the chair) to all the ironmasters, the most effective hit being
when, in the absence of other fighting men,                               I      stood up for
the army and navy, and talked of                          a     withered laurel or two
which       I   picked up under the

                SYDNEY SMITH'S ORANGERY.                                            361
    Before the end of the year the inaugural                           address   men
tioned in this letter had been printed and circulated among
his friends.        From one of these, the facetious Sydney Smith,
he received the subjoined acknowledgment                       :   —
   " DEAR MURCHISON, —
                       Many thanks for your yellow book,
which is just come down to me.                       You have gained great
fame, and       I am    very glad of         it ; had it    been       in theology,    I
should have been your rival, and probably have been jealous
of you, but as        it is in   geology, my benevolence               and real good
will towards you             have fair play.
    "    I   shall read you out loud to-day.                Heaven send          I may
understand you           :    not that     I   suspect     your perspicuity, but
that my knowledge of your science is too slender for that
advantage       — a knowledge which just enables me to distin
guish between           the Caseous and the Cretaceous formations,
or, as   the vulgar have          it,   to know chalk from cheese.
    " There are no people here, and no events, so                       I    have    no
news to tell you, except that in this mild climate my orange-
trees are now out of doors, and                in full bearing.         Immediately
before my windows, there are twelve                      large oranges on one
tree.        The trees themselves are not correctly the Linnean
orange-tree,        but what are popularly called the bay tree, in
large green boxes of the most correct shape, and the oranges
well secured          with the best pack-thread.                   They are uni
versally       admired, and,            upon the whole, considered finer
than the Ludovican orange-trees of Versailles.                           Best regards
to Mrs.       M. —Yours, my dear Murchison, very truly,

        " DEAE MUKCHISON, —
                            Many thanks for your kind recol
lection of me in sending me your pamphlet, which                                 I       shall
read        with all attention and         care.        My observation        has neces
sarily been so much fixed on missions of another description,
that        I   am hardly reconciled to zealots going out                with voltaic
batteries and crucibles for the conversion of mankind, and
baptizing their fellow-creatures with the mineral acids                              ;    but
I    will endeavour        to admire and believe              in you.1
        "
            My real alarm for you            is,   that by some late decisions
of the magistrates,             you come under the legal definition                        of
Strollers, and nothing could give me more pain than to see
any of the Sections upon the                     Mill   calculating the resistance
of the air, and showing the additional quantity of flour
which might be ground in vocuo — each man in the mean
time imagining himself               a   Galileo.        We have had Mrs. Grote
here     :      Grotius would not come.              The basis of her character
is      rural, and she was intended for                   a   country clergyman's
wife     ;      but for whatever she was intended, she                   is   an extra
ordinary clever woman, and we all liked her very much.

 which   I shall diligently read.     May there not be some one
 among the infinite worlds where men and women are all
 made  of stone — perhaps of Parian marble          ?     How infinitely

     The anniversary address given to the Geological Society
in February      1842 was a laboured        production,        occupying
forty of the closely printed pages of the Society's Pro
ceedings,   and must have     somewhat exhausted both reader
and audience from its mere length.              During the interval
of ten     years   which   had passed      away since Murchison
read   a   similar discourse,     his  favourite       science    had   in
some departments made          rapid strides;       but in none       had
its progress been     so remarkable as in the classification of
the older fossiliferous rocks, a result which sprang in great
measure     out of his own labours.         Naturally therefore         he
dwells upon his share in the          triumphal       progress    of geo
logy.     Giving his brethren of the hammer                 a  sketch of
the steps     by which    the classification      had been        worked
out, he alludes to his adoption of the term
                                                         " Silurian," re
marking that he had some pride in restoring that name to
currency in remembrance       of the boast of the Roman general
Ostorius, who, on conquering Caractacus,              declared that he
had blotted out the very name of the British Silures from
the face of the earth.     He justifies the use of a geographical
terminology,     and very   pointedly     calls    attention      to  the

364                 SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                   [1s42.
absence         of any zoological boundary between the Cambrian
and Silurian systems,                a fact which       had already been ad
mitted by Sedgwick.1                  He gathers together with manifest
satisfaction the evidence                of the extension of the Silurian
system in Europe, Africa, America, Australia, and the South
Seas.        The Geological Survey had been making progress                      in
South Wales, and had begun to grapple with the problem
as to the separation between Cambria                      and Siluria.     While
alluding to its progress under the leadership of De la Beche,
Murchison refers again to the work of the Survey in Devon
shire, and to his own labours there and on the Continent                         in
conjunction with Sedgwick.                    The rocks of Devonshire lead
him to say a few kindly words of Hugh Miller's Old Red
Sandstone,         which     had recently appeared,           and to speak       of
the wonderful series of bone-cased uncouth fishes furnished
by the Old Eed Sandstone of Scotland and Eussia.                          Among
his allusions to fossils there occurs a reference                     to the re
markable announcement by Ehrenberg of the occurrence of
still living species in the Cretaceous rocks, a fact which
                "
showed            the danger of         as   yet attempting      to establish a
   1 Proc. Oeol. Soc., iii. 641.          The principle on which Murchison had
proceeded in his Silurian classification was that which had guided Wil
liam Smith among the Secondary rocks — " Strata identified by their
organic remains."         If, therefore, he found a series of strata containing
nothing but Silurian fossils, he was logically bound to class it as Silurian.
This was the inevitable          step in store for him, and that he saw it coming
seems    to be indicated in this address. He says that " the term ' Cam
brian' must cease to be used in zoological classification, it being in that
                               '                   "
sense synonymous with Lower Silurian,'               and adds that the line of divi
sion placed on his map between the two series has no longer any paUeon-
tological significance.       He hints that the Cambrian series is but a local
subdivision of the same great pabeozoic group.                 Sedgwick's suscep
tibilities do not seem to have been roused at this time, but the subse
quent perusal of this address and that for the next year led him to protest
against the proposal to wipe out the Cambrian system from geological
nomenclature.         See Sedgwick's Letters to Wordsworth, Letter V. p. 86,
 and /HI."/, i', p. 380, note.

geologists,     and notably of L. von Buch, to whom he con
veyed the Society's Wollaston medal, he winds up his oration
with a long disquisition on the glacial theories which had
been       discussed       at Glasgow, and regarding which                     he had
then announced his intention                       " to show               He refuses

to allow Agassiz to cover the northern parts of our hemi
sphere      with sheets of ice, but admits that the evidence com
pels him to concede that the land was submerged                                beneath
an ocean over which ice-rafts and icebergs sailed southwards.
         Here is Murchison's              own report of his discourse and
the meeting,      as sentat the time to Sedgwick :—
         26th February 1842. — " The anniversary went off glori
ously, though          I   say so.        The morning discourse was well
received, and      in truth        I put a deal         of powder and shot into       it,
foreign and domestic, and took                     so   much pains     as to stop   my

people coming          !    The morning room was full, and               I     read for
two hours without losing                  a   man.      I   entered at length into
the Silurian and

temporary division set up between your lower slaty rocks and
my superior groups on the ground of positive observation of
infraposition, and          if    in the end        (as I   now firmly believe) no
suite of organic remains               will       be found, even       in the lowest
depths, which differs on the whole from the Silurian types,
why then we prove the curious law that in the earliest
inhabited       seas   of our planet the same forms were long con
tinued.

which we adopted              would have led to fatal errors, such as
                                 '

    Systeme    Hercynien              and other hypotheses, and that now
all must come right, to whatever extent (and the extent can
probably never be defined) the base of the Lower Silurian
zoological type may be extended. . . .
    " Our dinner went off ' con amore' and
                                           every one says
it   was   the best (Adam                  Sedgwick only wanted) which we
ever had.           I   did my best to make                         it of   a public character,
and had my two Knights of the Garter, one on either side

                                             I           so handicapped my                 running
horses     that they each made play where                                   I     wanted it.      I
send you       a    scrap    from the Morning Post, possibly written
by         .    .   .   Knowing that he was going to furnish some
thing, I      popped my speech [about the Emperor and Baron
Brunnow] into his hands, being well aware that words are
weighed at St. Petersburg.                       Tell Whewell of our frolics."
      Among the survivors of that small band of enthusiasts
who founded the Geological Society, one of the most promi
nent still took, even in his old                             age,   a   keen interest in the
Society's affairs.           No face was more familiar at the meet
ings than that of G. B. Greenough, no voice more                                              often
heard in the discussions.                        Every new theory, or proposed
reform of an old one, every suggested                                   change        in the estab
lished nomenclature of geology, was sure to receive                                           keen
scrutiny, and probably more                          or less of active or at least
passive opposition, from the veteran President                                    of the Society.

He used even to astonish the propounder of some novelty
by demonstrating, or at least endeavouring to demonstrate,
that what was thought to be new was really only another
version of what had been known long before, had perhaps
been even taught by Werner                   himself.     We have seen that
this happened to be his                    mood      of opposition             when the
Devonian question came up for discussion before the Society.
And yet with this adherence to his early habits of thought,
and       with a doggedness of opposition which, though always
courteous and good-natured, must often have been provoking
enough, Greenough retained the deep respect                              and esteem of
every member of the Society.                        This was manifested now
by    a   movement to perpetuate his features                   in a bust, to be
placed and preserved in the apartments at Somerset House.1
Murchison took a leading share in the organization of this
scheme, which when propounded to Greenough drew from him
the following acknowledgment, addressed to Murchison                                  :   —
      March 30, 1842. — "For the exertions                      I    have       made       in
behalf of the Geological Society                I    have been most             liberally
remunerated by the confidence                   reposed   in me at all times
by the body at large, and by the invaluable                                friendships
which       I   have formed        with many of the members.                    I accept,
however, with much pleasure, the distinction                         now presented
to me, viewing          it,   as
                              I     do, not merely as an acknowledgment
that I      have faithfully discharged my duty, but also                              as   a

      Whilst the geologists of Britain were in this graceful
way crowning with honour the latter days of one of               their
 earliest fellow-workers,     another member of the brother
hood of hammerers        was about to begin a career      which has
 gained for him     a high place in the annals of geological dis
 covery, and with both         of these   events   Murchison was
 intimately associated.      The Provincial Legislature of Canada
 had voted     a sum of £1500 for     a  geological survey of the
 province.     With the view of securing       a competent person
 to undertake     the duties of such a survey, the Governor-
  General applied to the Home Government, mentioning                 in
 particular   the name     of Mr. W.   R    Logan, and requesting
 Lord Stanley to ascertain whether, in the opinion of the
  Geological Society of London, or other competent authori
  ties, he was considered to be qualified.      This official request
  was communicated to Murchison, as President of the Society.
  Mr. Logan      had   already distinguished     himself    by some
  admirable surveys of the South Welsh coal-fields, and by
  observations on the formation       of coal.    He had worked
  enthusiastically as a volunteer in De la Beche's staff of the
  Geological Survey, and his large sections, drawn to          a   true
  scale of six inches to a mile, led to  all the subsequent admir
  able sections by De la Beche and his colleagues.        Murchison,
  who knew these labours well, and had made use of them in
  his Silurian map, recommended      the proposed appointment in
  the warmest terms, adding that       it would " render essential
  service to Canada, and materially favour the advancement
  of geological inquiry."      Shortly afterwards Mr. Logan re

ceived the appointment, and returned to Canada, his native
country, to lay the foundations, and for about thirty years,
in spite of many        discouragements,    to work out the develop
ment of one of the most important and successful geologi
cal surveys that have ever been carried on in any country.
     Summer had brought back leaf and blossom ere bags
and hammers         were furbished up anew        for field-work.    A
plan which had been discussed            the previous year   in Eussia
was now to be put into execution, viz., that Murchison should
with his comrades make a careful examination of some of
the best sections of the older rocks of Britain, for the sake
of renewed and more definite comparison with those of the
Continent, and especially of Eussia.           Count Von Keyserling
duly arrived, and after the usual and indispensable hospi
talities in London, Murchison          and he started on their    Eng
lish tour.       Beginning      with the Isle of Wight, they first
worked their way over the Secondary formations westward
as far as Cheltenham and the Malverns.              Then they turned
northwards       into the old Silurian region,       lingering  at the
rocks and       country-houses        which   had  been   Murchison's
favourite haunts ten years before, and passing across the
 undefined and increasingly indefinable line between             Cam
bria and Siluria, away over Sedgwick's domains even to the
far promontories of North Wales.                Turning still north
 wards, the two geologists        halted in Durham to compare the
 rocks and fossils of that county with those of the Eussian
                                   '
 province whence the term            Permian' had been taken.      The
 northern     coal-fields,   so like in some respects to those of
 Eussia, offered many points of interest for comparison.            So
 intent, however, were the travellers in gathering materials
 for the illustration       of their Russian work, that they pro-

longed their journey into Scotland, tracing the red sand
stones which emerge from under the coal-bearing tracts, and
in which they saw much to remind them of the great areas
of Old Red Sandstone      in Russia.       Crossing to Carlisle on
their southward journey, they worked their way through the
Lake district, thence down the great Carboniferous Limestone
tracts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire           into the Staffordshire
coal-field until they once more found themselves              on the
slopes of the Malverns.
    Such was the round of country examined.               One or two
parts of the journey deserve notice from the sequel to which
they led.   In  the course of their traverse       from the Silurian
into the Cambrian      region,     the travellers were     as  unable
as anybody had ever yet been to draw any satisfactory line
between the two tracts.     Mineralogically      there was really no
true boundary line, and zoologically it had been agreed even
by Sedgwick himself that no distinct assemblage             of fossils
had been ascertained   to belong to the Cambrian series.
    The Geological Survey under De la Beche had now been
extended into Wales.     When Murchison and Von Keyserling
were on their tour, the Survey forces were           at work among
the Silurian   and Cambrian        strata, and had already,      after
much careful mapping, made            out some important       points
regarding the relation of these strata.         Some    of these are
referred to in the following extracts from a letter by De la
Beche to Murchison.      Llandovery, 3\st     July   1842. — "Touch
ing the Silurian system, heaven knows where             it is to end

all going to prove the same thing.          The cleavage no doubt

is abominable, but by very careful hunting of all the natural
sections,       and giving lots of time to           it,   the affair has at last
come out clear enough.          ...       It   would be      a   long story to go
further into the old story hereabouts;                      that your Silurian
system must have          a   jolly extension at our hands over the
rocks of this land seems certain."
      The extension referred to was mainly due to the labours
of Mr. Eamsay, who, since he left for Tenby, had been hard
at work among the Welsh rocks.                   On the 7th August of this
same year he reported progress to                Murchison        as   follows   :
                                                                                     "
                                                                                     I

that all your rocks, under           a   somewhat different form, spread

I   should much like to show you some of the evidences of
this Cambrian revolution."
         These were important labours            in the progress of British
geology     ;   but their special interest in the present narrative
lies in their relation to Murchison and his views.                           It will
be seen that they confirmed his belief                     in the extension of
the      Silurian forms of life among the older rocks, and they
no doubt contributed not         a   little to foster that spirit of con
fident assertion which marked his next oration to the Geo
logical Society.         He counted as personal friends the men
by whom these researches                 had been conducted,            but until
this summer, when he took Count Von Keyserling with him,
he had not become acquainted                   with the way in which their
actual      work in the       Geological         Survey    was carried on.

round to    see.    They found their friend, on a bright Sep
tember morning, on the summit of the Beacon, busy with
his theodolite, and learnt something of the laborious detail
of geological surveying, so different from the hop-step-and-
jump kind of work with which their Eussian experiences
had familiarized them.
     An important      change   took place this autumn in the
Geological Society.      Lonsdale, feeling the growing weakness
of his health, and the increasing urgency of the calls of the
Society upon his powers, had resigned his Curatorship, with
the purpose of seeking rest in retirement.             As Murchison
had been the means of bringing          him to London, and had
enjoyed his close friendship, as well     as   the quite invaluable
aid which Lonsdale cheerfully rendered in palaeontological
and other matters, he now took an active part in promoting
the subscription     for a testimonial to the worthy Curator,
expressive of the universal regret at his retirement.         A silver
cup, together   with a sum of £600, were presented by Mur
chison and Fitton, in name of the subscribers,           to Lonsdale,
who, unable at the time to find a vent for his feelings, sent
a characteristically    modest   and grateful note to Murchison.
" Should life be                             "  I
                  granted me," he said,            purpose to pursue
the study of fossil polyparies, and    it will    be a source  of per
sonal gratification  if my friends will transmit     to me any speci
mens they may     think me capable of examining, and for the
means of conducting this     inquiry I shall  be indebted to them."
     For fourteen years Lonsdale had been in the midst of
all the activity of the Geological Society.        During that time
not a publication had been issued by the Society which did
not owe much to his careful supervision.              But the official
work which he performed so well, and which              undoubtedly

had no small influence on the general progress of geology in
England, represented only a part, and perhaps not even the
chief part, of the obligations under which he placed the
members    of the Society.     There were few of the geologists
engaged,   like Murchison, in active research        and  in inde
pendent publication, who had not recourse to Lonsdale as an
ever ready and sagacious helper.        In  a body of men who,
busy with the same pursuits, are always necessarily to some
extent rivals, there must needs arise ever and anon occasions
when unwarranted assertions        on one side are met by more
or less angry recrimination on the other, and when the truth
of the question in dispute becomes clouded by the per
sonalities of the disputants.      Such cases, despite the glow
ing eulogiums in presidential addresses, were not unknown
in the Geological Society.       Lonsdale's perfect impartiality
and candour,     and his tact and shrewd sense, enabled him
to moderate    these ebullitions, and to preserve     the harmony
of the brotherhood.
                                                                   «
     Though   he now retired from Somerset       House, he could
not so easily wean himself from the Society and the pur
suits of its members,      with whom he had been so long and
so  intimately associated.     He went down to Dartmouth to
enjoy pure air and give himself up to the unremitting study
of his favourite branch of inquiry,       the structure of fossil
corals.   But we find him carrying         on still, as of old, a
voluminous correspondence with the President on affairs of
finance,  the preparation    of the Society's Transactions, the
 choice  of office-bearers,  and other matters of business, be
sides the    more   strictly scientific subjects on which they
were both engaged.
     Lonsdale's   resignation brought into the service      of the

374          SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                           [is&
Society, and prominently       into geological pursuits, another
naturalist of greater knowledge and wider fame.          When the
Curator's determination to leave came to be known, various
names   were   talked   about in reference      to the   supplying
of his vacant     post,  among them that of          Hugh Miller.
But, after some delay, the final decision among nine can
didates was made in favour of Edward             Forbes, who had
recently been chosen       Professor of Botany in King's Col
lege,  and whose brilliant researches        in the ^Egean gave
promise of a distinguished career as       a naturalist and palae
ontologist.
     The appointment of Forbes to be Curator of the Geo
logical Society must be regarded as an event of considerable
importance in the history of geological progress        in Britain.
While still an enthusiastic student of natural history under
Jameson at Edinburgh, he had struck out into that little-
trodden path of research in zoological and botanical distri
 bution wherein he continued to be throughout his too short
 life the great pioneer.        Already,  by excursions     in this
 country, in Scandinavia, and in Switzerland, he had been
 led to recognise the connexion between        geological changes
 and the present grouping of plants and animals.               For
 tunately   provided    with   further   and more     advantageous
 opportunities of concentrated research, by being attached to
 Captain Graves's surveying ship in the ^Egean Sea, he had
 thrown quite a fresh light on the way in which the pro
 secution of zoological research     might be made subservient
 to the elucidation   of some of the most interesting questions
 in geology, such as the history of existing species of animals
 and the geographical changes       of which they have been the
 witnesses.    By these bold and original investigations he

is42.]                    EDWARD FORBES.                               375
had in a special manner attracted the notice of geologists.1
And now that his duties at Somerset House brought him
 into direct relationship with the leaders of geological inquiry
in Britain, his subsequent scientific work took thencefor
 ward a more decidedly geological aspect.
      It  is not, however, in his relations to the general pro
gress of the science,        but in his connexion with          the more
limited field of palasozoic geology, that the advent and work
 of Edward        Forbes require notice here.          His position      as
 Curator at Somerset         House undoubtedly led directly to his
subsequent appointment            as  naturalist    to the Geological
 Survey,2 to the admirable arrangement of the palasontological
collections placed under his charge in the Jermyn Street
Museum,        and to the good       service which      he rendered      in
working       out the natural history of Silurian and Tertiary
rocks.      It brought him also into intimate personal relations
with      Murchison,      De   la  Beche,   Eamsay, and the others
on whom the progress of palaeozoic geology              in this country
mainly depended.
      The winter of 1842-3        was  with Murchison a very busy
one.      It  was to be his last season of office as President           of
the geologists, and besides the proper official duties, which
he conscientiously discharged, he entered           with renewed zest
into the social festivities        for which    the Belgrave Square
mansion had now become              well known.       There were       few
men of note        in literature, politics, science, or art to whom
   1 In  1841  he had received from the Geological   Society the balance of
the Wollaston    fund, amounting  to £30, to assist him in carry ing on his
researches.
   s The actual proposal of Forbes to De la Beche for employment in the
Survey was made by Mr. A. C. Ramsay, who had known the young
naturalist well since 1840.

376           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
the soirees of the President of the Geological Society were
not, or might not have been, familiar.
     At  the anniversary in February, when he would resign
office, he had determined to give an address             to the Society
containing a detailed report of progress, and in particular a
more    pointed statement       of his position with regard to the
impending changes in Cambrian and Silurian nomenclature.
How he meant to proceed is shown in the subjoined letter
of 16th October:—
     " MY DEAR SEDGWICK, — On the 1st of next month                   I go
to press  with the work on Russia, which with amplifications
and emendations        is composed of the memoir referred to you
last year, and two which         I have  read since on other parts       of
Muscovy and on the Ural Mountains. The country is described
in ascending order, and         I  therefore must cast my Silurian
                                                             '
chapter at once into type, with a preamble on                  Palaeozoic
rocks,'   which      shall  render my views        intelligible   to   the
 Eussians, for whom the work is hereafter to be translated.
 In  doing this     I  necessarily give a little sketch of our own
 operations in the British Isles and in the Rhenish Pro
 vinces, and then go on to show how Eussia completes the
 proofs desired, and confirms our views.             Now in effecting
 this to my satisfaction,      I wish  to have your own authority
 to speak out concerning the Cambrian rocks zoologically
 considered.      You know as well         as   myself that on those
 parts of the Continent which we have            'seen  together,    there
 is but one type of fossil remains beneath an unquestionable
 Devonian    zone,     and that we have called          Silurian.      The
 same is   still more clearly exhibited in Eussia in the lime
 stones, sandstone, and shale, which lie beneath true           Old Red
 Sandstone,    filled both with fishes        of Scotland and shells

of Devon.        The Silurian rocks of Eussia,         Gothland, and
Sweden rest at once on the crystalline           slates of the north.
The same succession         has been recently established (zoologi
cally) in Brittany by Verneuil and d'Archiac this summer,
though there they have inferior slaty rocks without fossils
unconformable        to Caradoc sandstone.         Whilst these in
quiries have been deciding the zoological succession           on the
Continent, and extending it even into Asia, our own region
at home has been silent.           I was  rejoiced therefore when     I
knew you had been again into North Wales, and that you
had taken young Salter with you, because you could then
make up your mind to put your oracle out, without having
it trumpeted forth by others.
       " In the meantime, besides what Mr. Maclauchlan stated
in respect to Pembrokeshire, De la Beche and his workmen
assure me, that the whole        of that tract is nothing more than
Caradoc sandstone         and  Llandeilo   flag, or Lower    Silurian,
folded over and over in troughs, and exceedingly altered
by intrusive rocks and changed by crystallization and cleav
age.      They contend also that the very same identical fossils,
in  the very same     strata as those which    I  have described and
figured     as Lower Silurian at Noeth Grug, north of Linn-
dovery (and only a few miles from the Old Red escarpment),
are repeated over and over, up to the sea-coast at Cardigan,
and to the north of it.         To this  I  cannot say nay, because
in my work         I   have described descending        passages  into
what     I certainly  conceived, without perhaps sufficient exami
nation, to be a great inferior slaty mass, and in which              I
never observed       the fossils  in question.    If their position is
true    it would   be  in vain to contend for Cambrian rocks in
South Wales, and certainly           not as identified     by organic

378                    SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
remains,       though          I    am certain there are inferior                 slaty grau-
wackes at St. David's, like those of the Longmynd in Salop,
which are much older than my fossil Silurian — and of this
you know           I    have decisive proofs in Salop, where the Cara-

Lower Silurian (and that you have yourself now stated in

Ambleside (at the latter place Keyserling and myself con
vinced ourselves      of the same) is the same thing, and      if no

follows, that the only fossil        type which     remains to be
appealed   to is that    of the Snowdon slates.        In our recent
visit, Keyserling and myself collected a good many fossils
both on the north and on the west flanks of that mountain,
and my friend, who is a very good conchologist, came to the
conclusion    on the spot, that the prevalent and abundant
forms are two or three species of Orthis (flabellulum            and
alternata) well known in Lower Silurian and Caradoc, with
a rare new form of Leptcena ; and Sowerby, who has since

  you now say that the slaty region to the north-west of the
  Silurian rocks was left undefined               as to  fossils, on account
  of your never having examined the forms you so long ago
  collected (and take any line you please, either to contend or
  not for great thickness of the lowest fossiliferous strata),
 then     I shall be at    ease, and    know how to use your authority
 as   well   as  my own.1
    1  Murchison's    anxiety to carry Sedgwick with him, if possible, in hia
 change of the Silurian base-line, is well shown in this letter and in the
                                 "
 following postscript to it : — In the part which specially refers to what       I
 have been writing to you about,      I  should, in case you will authorize me,
 propose to write something such as follows : — After asking if no efforts
                                                                   '
 had been recently made to determine the point if there were or not a
 group of older fossils than the Lower Silurian, and some paragraphs
 relating thereto,'   I go on to say,
                                      '
                                        Judging from their infraposition, great
 thickness, and distinct lithological characters, it was presumed (when the
 Cambrian system was so named) that these greatly developed inferior
 slaty rocks would be found to contain a class of organic remains peculiar
 to themselves, the more so as the few forms then discovered in them
 seemed to differ from the     Lower Silurian types. Subsequent researches
 have, however, decided otherwise.          In the slaty region of the north
 west of England, of which by hard labours he so long ago rendered
 himself the master, Professor Sedgwick has now satisfied himself that
 the lowest organic remains which can be traced are no others than those
 published as Lower Silurian, whilst in revisiting the mountains of Cam
 bria and Snowdon, whose framework he was the first to explain, he has
 come to similar conclusions respecting the oldest fossiliferoua tracts of
 North Wales.'

Then Mr. Sharpe et hoc genus omne.
    " This is the form in which       I  should wish to place the case, both
because it is in my mind quite true, and also because, as        I   have said in
my letter,    I wish you to speak in your own place."
    Sedgwick made no objection at the time to this statement of his views.
On the contrary, when he received the proof-sheets of the address he
made comments on other parts, but, BO far as can be judged from the
letters still extant, offered no criticism whatever on the proposed narra
tive given in the preceding extract.         He returned the proofs with the
remarks, " The papers are excellent, and use my hints as you think
right.   ... I  have looked over the slips and made marks.   ... I  did look over
the peroration.      It is very good." It was, to say the least, unfortunate

        " The                                                                  rocks

  it is well that        we who have been the agents               in first enun
  ciating    it should not         be frightened and driven out of our
 fairly won views because the Cambrian tail-piece was not
finished     off.      For my own part,          I  am as convinced as          it is
  possible to be, that we have now thoroughly ascertained                         not
  that,  if he had really any strong objections to the statements in the
 address,   he did not frankly express them at the time when the proof-
 sheets were sent to him.         Had he done so we can hardly believe that he
 could afterwards have found occasion to say of any sentence in that
 document     :  "I    smiled when    I  read this strange passage ; but    I did  not
 think it worth while formally to contradict it ; in omission and commis
sion it is a virtual mis-statement of the facts." — (Letters to Wordsworth,
later edition, p. 87.)       Sorely by first sending his friend a sketch of what
he meant to say, and then the proof-sheets of what he had said, Murchison
showed no common care to secure his concurrence. It is hard to understand
why Sedgwick should have entered into verbal and other criticisms in the
most friendly and even jocular style, and yet have left untouched a
                              " smile," and which he felt to be "a virtual mis-
passage which raised a
statement of the facts."
    But what was the " strange passage " which called forth these sharp
words?      As quoted and italicised by Sedgwick himself, it ran as follows :
" We were both aware that the Bala limestone fossils agreed with the
Lower Silurian ; but depending upon Professor Sedgwict's conviction that
there were other and inferior masses, also fossiliferons, we both dung to
the hope that such strata, when thoroughly explored, would offer a suf
ficiency of new forms to characterize an inferior system."
    On this passage he remarks as follows: — "When the author states
' that we both
                    clung to the hope that the Cambrian groups would offer a
sufficiency of new forms to characterize an inferior system,'            I  can only
reply, that    the hope  to which  he  clung was  not derived from   anything I had
                                         I
ever said or written; and that had not, in 1842 and 1843, the shadow
of a hope that any new system of animal life, any group of new forms
'
   marking an inferior system,' would be found among the Lower Cam
brian groups.        I  had constantly expressed, and repeatedly published, a
directly contrary opinion."       (The italics are in the original.)
    Now it will hardly be believed that Murchison's statement is not only
borne out by passages in Sedgwick' s letters, but seems actually based
upon them. In support of this assertion two extracts may be given.

 Staffa.     It  was represented          urgently to Murchison           that    as
 wick says: — "To        my knowledge of the sections       I  added nothing last
 autumn, but     I    hoped to make out distinct fossil groups, indicating a

 (in the letter quoted above in the text), Sedgwick remarks,

the island was likely to come into the market, no more
fitting "purchaser could be found than the Geological Society
of London, and that in the hands of that learned body it
would remain       as a  perpetual monument consecrated          to the
progress    of science.     It  is needless to say that this project
never took shape.         There is little sympathy in Britain with
any such fanciful         notions regarding the acquirement           of
places    of great natural       interest by the State      or learned
societies   for the good of the country and in the cause of
scientific progress.       Fortunately that fairy isle is too small
and too barren to warrant the cost of protecting walls and
notices to trespassers,       and its wonders are of too solid and
enduring a nature to be liable to effacement           by the ruthless
curiosity of the British tourist.        And   so  it stands amid the
lone   sea, open to   all comers, lifting its little carpet of bright
green    above the     waves     which have tunnelled its pillared
cliffs, and which are ceaselessly         destroying and renewing
the beauty of the sculpture they have revealed.
     From the foregoing letter to Sedgwick it is clear that
the preparation of the address to the Geological Society, and
in particular     the   forcible enunciation      in it of his views
regarding the classification of the older rocks, engaged much
of Murchison's      attention during the winter.          When at last
the anniversary        came    he   produced    a   most voluminous
oration, extending over eighty-seven closely printed octavo
pages, and discussing         not only the question lying at the
time nearest his own heart, but the general march of geo
logy all over the world.             Again he presents to foreign
geologists  — filie  de Beaumont and Dufre'noy — the Wollaston
medal with due laudation.           After a  kindly and appreciative
eulogy of Lonsdale and welcome             of Forbes, he plunges at

once into the palaeozoic rocks, and is soon              in the midst of
Silurian and Camhrian nomenclature, laying down with re
newed emphasis the view that his own Silurian deposits
contained      the records      of the earliest type or fades              of
organized existence.         In   the early summer of the previous
year Sedgwick had written            his now well-known letters to
Wordsworth on the Geology of the Lake District, in which he
summarized in popular but accurate form the results of his
long labours among these mountains.               Another observer, Mr.
Daniel Sharpe, already referred to, had been at work upon
the Cumbrian tracts, and transferring his knowledge of them
to the investigation         of North Wales, had announced his
belief that Sedgwick's Bala rocks were really, both by fossils
and physical continuity,           the very same as some of           Mur-
chison's Lower Silurian        series.1   Sedgwick himself had spent
   1 In the beginning of his paper Mr. Sharpe stated that the view of the
infraposition of the so-called Cambrian rocks of Sedgwick to the Lower
Silurian of Murchison was adopted by the latter geologist on the autho
rity of the former.    In long subsequent years, Sedgwick bitterly com
plained that this was a mis-statement, which Murchison never corrected,
but, on the contrary, proceeded to profit by, though he had abundant
opportunity of rectifying it in this address.   And the inference drawn is,
that Murchison    was guilty of disingenuous conduct unworthy of a gen
tleman, still more of a friend (Introduction to British Paleozoic Fossils, p.
Ixxiii.) But, so far from regarding it as a mis-statement, Murchison him
self repeats it in this very address. He says that he steadily relied on
Sedgwick's original opinion, that great masses of the slaty rocks of North
Wales lay below the Silurian rocks.     His respect for Sedgwick's opinion
was profound, and that opinion he believed to have been all along in
favour of the infraposition of all the so-called Cambrian rocks.         This
belief, as we have already seen (ante, p. 225, note), was commonly held by
geologists, and, if a mistake, Sedgwick never did anything to set it    right
until he found some of his Cambrian formations claimed as Silurian,    when
he maintained that he had never made any error in his work, except in  being
misled by his friend.    The charge of unfair conduct on Murchison's     part
was utterly unfounded.      Nothing could have been more candid than the
way in which he acted in this matter. Equally groundless was the accusa
tion that he had " stolen a march " upon Sedgwick, unless we are to be
told that under such conduct we must include making our victim privy

tions of the North Welsh area, with the view of clear
ing up the difficulties in the way of reconciling his own
work with that of his friend.           But he could not establish
any distinction by means of fossils between the rocks which
he had called Cambrian and those which                 Murchison        had
termed Lower Silurian.          He intimated this to the President,1
who now, with evident satisfaction, announces              it  as   further
proof that the Silurian type of organic remains had been
firmly established as the oldest in the geological record.
Murchison further dwells on the important aid given to
his interpretation by the labours of the Geological Survey,
which,    as we have       seen, had now been extended            into the
 Silurian tracts of South Wales.         While eulogizing the work
of the Ordnance Geological Surveyors in Wales, he turns to
that of their fellow-labourers, and notably Captain (after
wards General) Portlock, in Ireland, adding words of praise
to his notice of the geological map of Ireland by Mr. (now
 Sir Eichard)    Griffith — that wonderful achievement,              which
gives its courageous        and undaunted      author    so   honourable
a   rank   among     the    great  geological map-makers           of this
century.
     We need not follow the address through its review of
contemporary foreign geology, with its elaborate analysis of
what had then been recently accomplished in Eussia, the
Caucasus,    Asia Minor, Turkey, the Alps, Hindustan,                  Aff-
ghanistan, China, Egypt, and North America, or through its
beforehand to the theft, and submitting for his approval the plan by
which he is to be cozened.    Yet Sedgwick asserted that the first intima
tion he had of Murchison's claim over the Upper Cambrian rocks
as Lower Silurian was obtained accidentally, some years after the seizure

details regarding the progress          of dynamical and palaeonto-
logical geology.        Its main interest for us lies in its relation
to the controversy, now imminent, regarding the palaeozoic
nomenclature          and to Murchison's      position    in that con
troversy.        Writing of it many years afterwards he thus

Von Buch, Humboldt, and all the foreign geologists,             as well
as   my colleagues       in the work in Russia, saw the necessity
of this.       I  therefore   openly proclaimed my conviction that
the masses of hard and slaty rocks of Wales to the west of
my Silurian map and sections, and which were supposed to
 be Cambrian, before their order and contents were elaborated
 by the surveyors and Sir            H. de la Beche, were simply
 folds and repetitions of the already classified Silurian rocks
 of Shropshire, Hereford, Eadnor, etc.           It  is from this date
 that     I considered    my classification to be established on the
 broad European scale."
       Resigning the chair to one of the founders of the Geo
 logical Society, Henry Warburton, Murchison concluded his
 second and last tenure of the office.           "
                                                   I bid  you farewell,"
 he said to his fellow-members, " as friends          in whose society,
 whilst acquiring knowledge,         I  have passed the happiest days    .
 of my life.       ... I have    deeply felt the honour of presiding
 over men who in the course of a quarter of a century have
 demonstrated that there is no such thing               '
                                                    as    odium geologi
 c-urn,,'  and whose members, rivals as they must be, have only
 sought to excel each other in their ardent search after truth."

Did the enthusiasm of the moment lead the writer to forget
                    '          '
the very marked       odium       which had been evoked during the
early Devonian      warfare     ?    Had the angry words of Mac-
culloch vanished from his memory                 ?   It  was well, indeed,
that they should, but not without leaving behind them just
trace  enough to keep him, even in the glow of excitement,
from painting in too rosy a hue the intercourse of men whom
even the brotherhood          of science could not save from the
ordinary frailties of humanity.             To his eulogistic language
the geological doings of after years furnished a comment of
bitter irony, since his own name, to his deep grief indeed,
and most unwillingly on his part, came to stand out pro
minently in the most noted instance of the odium geologi-
cum which the history         of British science has yet offered.

~T)ELEASED from the trammels of office, Murchison                                       began
-*- * to prepare for an early start to the Continent.                                        His-
Russian work                needed   much additional              confirmation and
elucidation from adjacent countries, and he resolved to per
fect    it,    as    far   as possible,   by further research in the field.
In     the midst of these preparations               a     small but useful piece
of work was begun, which                   is   referred    to     in the subjoined
letter   :  —

Useful Knowledge, and which                 I     have (after promising to do
something            for three years) at last thrown into form.                              You

attempted,            and all I    wish you to do          is   to mark with your

    A       good many years had now passed away since Mrs.
Murchison took her part in a Continental excursion.                                          It   was
arranged that she should accompany                               her husband this year,
settling down at some central place, and leaving him to
make more distant and laborious forays by himself.                                            They
started in April, and went first to Paris. Murchison has
left some reminiscences of this time. " At the Institute and
elsewhere       I   had arguments with Elie de Beaumont, when                                         I
found that he disbelieved the statements of Sedgwick and
myself in our tour of 1839, viz., that in Bavaria there existed

an entire conformity between the Carboniferous Limestone
and the underlying Devonian.           This phenomenon      did not
suit the theory of the man of authority who was to become
a Senator of Napoleon the Third, and Secretary of the         Insti
tute.     I  never had any serious    dispute with De Beaumont.
But    as he settled   his belief on certain data known to him
then, and formed his theory, which would not tally with
the new discoveries,       which he ignored,    I necessarily   went
forward, and       so  offended  him.    My excellent friend De
Verneuil      and others have shared the same fate.        In  those
days, however, we were on very friendly terms, and, as on
former occasions, he gave me a dinner at the Palais Royal
 D'Archiac     was then rising fast to the eminence as a geo
logical writer and sound reasoner (combining palaeontology
and field geology) which he has now attained (1865).              On
the other hand, D'Orbigny, who was a dashing palaeontolo
gist, and too fond of rapid identifications, though he made
beautiful collections of fossils, was evidently on the wane.
       "It  was on the occasion of this   visit to Paris that  I was
 presented     to Louis   Philippe, and had a long conversation
 with him.       M. Guizot, who was then Prime Minister, and
 who, when he came to London            as ambassador,   had dined
 with me at the Geographical Club (he being then President
 of the French Geographical Society), asked me to one of his
 'grands     diners,'  at  which  the   Chancellor, Pasquier, and
 several    great folks were present.     On the following day      I
 received     a letter, evidently the work of Guizot, from the
 Aide-de-camp au Hoi, saying that his Majesty would be
 happy to receive me at the Tuileries at          12 o'clock on the
following day, and mentioning the gate at which            I was   to
 enter.      Driving thither, in full uniform, and my Silurian

System    in hand to present,            my approach       to   the    King's
saloon showed me how the            Roi citoyen might at any moment
be disposed of      in   case  of an insurrection.      My   carriage drew
up close to a side-door, which at once opened into a small
room    in which several clerks were writing,           as  in a counting-
house, one of whom told me to sit down.                Presently     a livery
servant (none of the cleanest) appeared, and asked me, ' Est-
ce que Monsieur vient voir le Roi ?' and then told me that
the  King would soon          see me.     After waiting a few minutes,
                            '
he returned,     saying,      Le Roi vous verra    !' and   opening a door
from this writing-shop, there was the King, who literally
seemed to open the doors for me himself.                 No chamberlain,
no officer, not even a sentry between the             King and an arch

       Louis    Philippe was most           affable    and    kind in his
manner.       He made me sit down with him in a bay-window
facing the Carrousel, and begged me to unfold my maps and
explain them, saying that he was profoundly ignorant of my
science.      He nevertheless         talked of the great coal forma
tions he had seen in the United States, and, in alluding to
his travels in Norway, related the following               story  : —'  I was
one day (said he) standing on the sea-shore, and gazing at a
ship in the offing, when an old pastor of the country, eighty
years of age, who was near me, exclaimed,                "You only look
at the sea, sir, but you do not see what is under your feet !"
On doing     so,  I  found that     I  was standing on gravel and sea-
shells, a  little above high- water mark.             The old clergyman
then continued       : — " When I      was young the sea washed these
shells, but now        it  never   reaches them    ;  and so you see we
believe that our land is rising !"           From that moment          I con
ceived (added       the King) that the earth is always swelling

 my theory is foolish and untenable !'
      " In the course of the interview the same
                                                                 lacquey re
 turned, saying gruffly, 'Monsieur Guizot, votre Majeste"!'
                                      '
 on which the      King exclaimed,      Ah  !  Monsieur Guizot is my
 master, and     I must go to   him ;   but  I would wish you to do
 me the favour to wait here a few minutes.                     I  will settle
 matters     with him, for  I  want to return and go on with this
 interesting talk."
     "The bright-eyed Citizen King kept his promise,                      and
was both entertaining and pleasing              in a long subsequent
talk.      A   day or two afterwards       he sent me a large            gold
medal,     with his head on one side, and on the reverse,                  '
                                                                             A
 M. Murchison, de la part du Roi."              In    short,   I   had every
reason to be pleased with the courteous and gracious recep
tion    I  received   at the hand of Louis       Philippe    ;   but  I came
away with the impression that he wanted that dignity and
reserve which imposes upon the French people, and had put
himself into a false        position by the absence of all state
entourage,     without which no one, whether king or emperor,
can rule France."
     From Paris the travellers journeyed into Rhineland, and
thence     parting from Mrs. Murchison, the geologist                  struck
eastward      to increase the collection of materials for the geo
logical map of Russia and the surrounding countries which
it was proposed        should accompany the letterpress of the

Leonhard's museum at the latter place.            . .  .

6              SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                             [MM.
      " Dear old Leonhard, with his
                                          pipe and his little bandy
                 '
legged     dog     Tegel,'   was   a fine  specimen     of a polished
German Professor.           Igneous to the backbone,       for he even
believed that rock-salt, gypsum,          and hsematitic     iron were
produced by intense heat and fusion, he admitted, but could
not explain, the difficulty      I  had had in examining the Ural
Mountains, viz., why the iron-ore which is in contact with
eruptive rocks is the most magnetic         ?    On another count his
disbelief in the metamorphism of great mountain masses of
gneiss    and mica-schist        was   founded solely on his own
minute researches,         in which he had never seen igneous
effects extend more than a few feet or yards into sedimen
tary strata beyond the point of contact."
      Before trusting himself to the unknown wilds of Poland
and the Carpathians, Murchison           turned aside to pay a short
visit to Berlin, with the view of renewing his acquaintance
with the geologists there, and gaining information regarding
Russia    as well  as the scene  of his purposed new labours.        His
journal contains some reminiscences           of Humboldt and Court
life which may be quoted :— " From Berlin             I  went to Pots
 dam to see Humboldt, on Sunday the 28th of May, after an
 absence of two years.         On this occasion   I had brought with
 me the sketch        of the Geological Map of Russia in Europe
 and the Ural Mountains, and consulted him on all points
 connected     therewith, to profit by his advice and his addi
                                                                   '

                      the moment     I  mentioned to the      King that
 you were coming here, he begged you would dine with him
on this, his only day for receiving foreigners.             Unluckily  I
had no time to let you know the King's wishes, and of course
you have come without your dress clothes              ;  so the  King's

can be done.'
      "
        In the Baron's absence         I  was arranging my maps, and
                                             '
he presently came back, saying,                The King, regretting very
much you cannot dine with him, wishes to                    see  you at once.
His Majesty        is sitting for his portrait in the dining-room (on
account of the light), and he          will thus have an opportunity
of talking with you — only put off your great-coat.'                       This
being done, and taking my hat in my hand, and putting my
work on the Rhenish Provinces into the hand of Humboldt,
I walked with        him along a corridor, through the great coach-
roofed salon tfentrte, through a           little anteroom, with dinner
set for the        officers, and thence        into the dinner-room, in
which      I    was to have dined        if I   had had a pair of black
pantaloons and a coat with me !
      " I  had, however, so friendly a reception that it was
worth many dinners.             Passing behind the screen to go to
the window in which the           King     was sitting to the artist, his

voice was at once heard.             1st das der Murchison           ?   and  in
a second        I was before him.         On his countenance was the
same complacent          smile, in his small blue eye the same kind,
cheering,       and intelligent twinkle, which left its impression
upon one in the saloons of the Duchess of Sutherland, at the
good deceased Duke of Sussex's dfye&ner at Kensington, and
last, not least, when the         King honoured           us by becoming a
geologist      in Somerset House.1
      "After all sorts of preliminary inquiries he went on at once
   1 The
           King of Prussia,   on the occasion    of his recent visit to London,
had been      admitted an Ordinary    Fellow    of the Royal    and    Geological
Societies.

to home and London questions — the building of the Houses
of Parliament, Nelson's Monument in Trafalgar Square, the
statue for its top, who         it  was that admitted him into the
Royal Society,       etc.   The conversation       was then turned by
Humboldt        to Russia, and the        King expressed his surprise
that    I had been so great a traveller, on which         I had    only to
say that     I was a pigmy alongside of Baron Humboldt.                  The
Rhine- works were then alluded to and Prussian geology." . . .
     " On afterwards
                          talking to Humboldt about the difficulty
of the question concerning the Mammoths and their preser
vation in Siberia, he more fully explained the views de
veloped      in his work.       'All    these  animals," said     he,   'are
found in foreign soil, and we know that men even have
been preserved       in like manner.        Thus, Prince Menschikoff,
who was exiled to Siberia and died at Obdorsk, was buried
there in     full uniform, with all his medals and orders             ;   and
on opening the ground a few years back, his Excellency was
found nicely preserved,          moustachios,     orders, and     all, and
much more perfectly than           if he had been embalmed.             This
 disinterment caused a good deal of hubbub,              as it was done
 without the authority of the Priest or Papa, and the ex
 cavators     went  so  far  as to    pluck the Prince's moustachios
 from his face and send them to Russia in proof of the fact.
 Just    as Prince Menschikoff has been preserved,            so  may the
 Mammoths, who had wandered                beyond   their usual line of
 travel,    have  fallen into crevices,       and been    potted up in
 frozen earth.'
     "
         Speaking of politics,      I  asked him how matters            were
 going on here, and         if there    was   really much excitement.
                                                               '
 He seemed to say it was much exaggerated.                       But,' said
      '

 measures, he would render himself perfectly contemptible."
                                                                              '
      " He told me he had made a curious hit in
                                                               reading    the
 Timceus of Plato, as given by M. Martius.                He finds in the
 mouth of Polonius, the Jew, certain theoretical                 conjectures
 respecting      the gradual uprising of Continental masses, which
 seem to harmonize          exactly with the views of modern geolo
 gists.    I   told him of the        King of      the  French's remark
               '
 about the        growing of the land of Norway,' and the anec
 dote of the old Norwegian priest with whom                  His Majesty
 conversed when a wanderer about the world.
      " But the hour of three was                          and the Baron
                                           approaching,

 got into     double quick       to be in time for the royal table, and
 I adjourned to the railroad
                                       '
                                         restauration,' where       I dined,
 smoked my cigar, and wrote these memoranda."                  .  . .
      " I cannot       leave Prussia without again        confirming my
observations of former years.            The troops of the line, cavalry
as  well   as  infantry, are chiefly hoys       (I  speak of the mass),
and the Landwehr           are the best soldiers.      How can cavalry
be worth anything, when a dragoon                goes to his home after
three years' service,        just when he is well formed?               How
keep horses        in condition with lads from the plough           ?   How
have good gunners           after two years' practice      ?     Hence the
raw and awkward appearance of the sentinels, even at Berlin.
The system must be changed, or Prussia is sure to lose her
first campaigns against any old and well-disciplined army."
     In entering Poland it            was    Murchison's     intention     to
gather    from museums, professors,           bergmeisters,      and   every
other available source of information, besides actual inspec
tion of the rocks where visible, the nature and position of
the geological       formations bordering the Russian tracts.             At

10               SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
Warsaw he fortunately secured                   the     services   of Professor
Zeuschner of Cracow, who accompanied                         him into the Car
pathians,      and whose      previous knowledge of these regions
helped       to save time and to make the tour more useful and
instructive than      it would     otherwise      have been.        Among the
endless geological        details of his letters and note-book, there
occur occasional entries which show that the rocks were not
the only attraction in Poland.
      " Here    I   am    in Warsaw still         Le    beau    del cCltcdie was
followed by storms which have been                      so   violent that       I   am
not sorry to have delayed my departure a little.                     To tell the
truth,   I   wished to     see   the Mazurka well danced, and as the
devil and bad weather have willed                 it,   the best dancers have
been     ill, and the Colonel directing the ballet has not been
able to gratify me yet.
      " Whatever                   come over          Poland, her charming
                         changes
women        will never change.          May they always preserve their
eweet manners, warm hearts, and generous sentiments                         ;   with
such qualities they          will improve the race by whom they
have been conquered."
      Received everywhere          with    a   frank and hearty hospitality
which charmed            him, Murchison         seems to have exerted               his
utmost to please his entertainers.                    At     one country-house
we find him          recounting the pleasures                and   perils of the
Ural Mountains, and the march of the Siberian exiles, to an
audience to whom anything                 about    Russia or the Russians
had    an absorbing         interest.      Again, he       is   in the midst of
Polish national songs and dances, making minute inquiries,
and showing the keenest                 personal interest in the charac
teristics of the conquered               and partitioned kingdom.                   At
another       time he keeps        a    family circle amazed         by   stories of

1s43.]             IN TEE CARPATHIANS.                             11
English railways, tunnels through mountains, and a scheme
for making    a  roadway between France and England            under
the Straits of Dover.     And thus, even where interminable
sand and boulders concealed      the rocks below, and deprived
the geologist   of one great source of pleasure, he made up for
the loss by many a pleasant hour       in the midst of the inner
domestic life of Poland.
      Getting out of the plains into the valleys and ravines of
the Tatra range of the Carpathians, he and his companion
had sometimes       to wade knee-deep       in snow.     They made
many traverses of the rocks with the view of comparing the
structure of the country with that of the Ural chain.          Amid
the heaps of detritus in some of the valleys, he speculates
on the former presence       of glaciers,    but regards the grand
source    of all the gravel and waste       as traceable  not to any
superficial action, but to the upheaval of the solid nucleus
of crystalline rocks through the secondary formations at the
time of the birth of the Carpathians      !    In such  observations
as these we see     how completely the early lessons of waste,
taught him by the valleys of Auvergne, had been forgotten,
and how thoroughly he had identified himself with the cata
clysmic school of geologists.
      Returning from the Carpathians by Cracow to Breslau,
Murchison turned aside to make a section through the chain
of the Riesen, Erlitz, and Sudeten Gebirge, by Freiburg, Wal-
denberg, and Glatz into Bohemia.        Getting through the hills,
he found himself       on the  interminable plain       of northern.
Bohemia with its fortresses, stopped at one gate by the
             " Sind Sie Baron oder Graf ? " at another,
challenge,                                                        by
being carelessly driven against a wall, and at last brought
to a stand by the complete     collapse   of his broken carriage,

                                                 '
                                                      Silurian System,' and
at once recognising the            great   similarity       of the Bohemian
fossils to my own types, copies of which he made with his
own pencil, he from that day went to work steadily, found
and described hundreds of new forms, and finally made one
of the most classic works of our               age, the Sysibme Silurian,
de Boteme.
      "
      I     have had of course long and continued intercourse
with this gifted and excellent man for the last twenty-two
years      (I   write this in 1865), and every year         I    have learned
to admire and esteem him more and more."
      After some time spent among the Silurian rocks of the
Prague basin, and arguments with Barrande about them and
their fossils, the traveller turned north again into Saxony.
At Dresden art            and art-criticism    for   a    few days took the
place      of the science which had for              so   many years driven
them out of Murchison's note-books.                   On the    1   9th    July   he

occurs in his journal :— " This is a proud day for me. A
budget of letters awaiting me from Warsaw, besides most
agreeable      letters from Tcheffkine,          Helmersen, and others,
contained one from Count Cancrine, officially announcing to

       Official rules debarred        Murchison       as   a   British subject
 from wearing foreign orders in Britain.                    Efforts had been
 made     to obtain a relaxation of these rules in his favour,

 himself in the matter.            The arrival of these fresh tokens
    1 This was the great vase of Siberian aventurine, four feet high, and
 six feet in circumference, which henceforward formed one of the most
 prominent objects in No. 16 Belgrave Square.             It was bequeathed to
 the Jcrmyn Street Museum, where it now stands, with its massive por
 phyry pedestal.     Owing to the difficulty of obtaining so large a block,
 and of polishing such a hard material, only one other similar vase has
 been made, viz., that presented to Humboldt, and now in the Royal
 Museum, Berlin. — See Bristow's Olossary of Mineralogy, sub voc. Avon-

 of the   esteem       in which science and scientific men were
 held in Russia, raised the question again               as to the orders
 and the general treatment           of men of science by the British
 government.         This subject      formed    one of the topics now
 gravely discussed        by the geologist      and   the illustrious    tra
 veller at Berlin.         We return to the journal.
     " 2lst July. — A
                               royal day, devoted to the          King of
 Prussia and Humboldt.             I went to Potsdam by the railroad,
 and saw the great traveller walking with the crowd from
 the station.  .   .  .   We went to work upon the Carpathians,
 several results of my tour          in Russia, Count Woronzow, and
 many topics.
     "I  read him the letter           I  had had from Helmersen,          in
 which, inter alia, he speaks of the ouvrage sublime of M.
 Humboldt.      His eyes brightened at this unexpected               praise,
 and he said     it was the first kind word he had had from
 Russia concerning his last work.               A   snuff-box, indeed, in
 diamonds, with a portrait of the Emperor, he had received                   ;
 but these and official documents           he valued slightly     in com
 parison with such unbought praise.
     " On
           producing my documents from Cancrine concerning
                                                                      '
the vase and the Emperor's kindness, he at once said,                   This
must be made known to the public in justice to all men of
 science, and to prove          how they are appreciated        in Russia.
                        '
Besides,' said he,        after the unpleasant circumstances        attend
ing your decoration          in England,     I  should like to let your
ministers feel a little.'          So taking the documents          and   in
scription, he added,
                           '
                             I will see that this  is noted with a slight
comment in the Preussische            Staats-Zeitung,    and then    I hope
it may find its way into your           papers.    But if not, you ought,
in justice to the Emperor, to have a notice of it inserted in

any paper which M. Peel reads.'             He assured me he had
made every effort     with the great Sir Eobert to induce him
to relax the order       in council respecting       my foreign order,
and again repeated       to me what indeed        he told me    in Eng
land, that neither the Premier nor any of the leading persona
seemed to have       the slightest idea of the relative value of
scientific merit.     He has evidently the opinion that Peel is
not   a  truly great man, but one who shrinks from noble
efforts, unless interest or expediency        leads him.     Hence we
went into discussions on various proofs              of this aloof from
my small concerns.
    " We    were  in the midst of such chat, when his chasseur
                       '
came back, saying,        The King     has had the letter,     and the
                                              "
Englishman is to dine at Sans Souci.'
     The gossip of the journal regarding            Humboldt     is here
interrupted by a full narrative of a Court dinner at Potsdam,
where in a quiet unostentatious way the                 Royal    Family
received    their guests, and where Murchison appears to have
been vastly pleased.        It resumes as follows :— " Travelling
back to my inn and unbuttoning,           I returned in plain clothes
to the Baron's rooms        at Sans     Souci (for he has them in
both palaces), and there we renewed our chat.              He told me
he had taken the liberty          of writing to Peel in re Robert
Brown, suggesting      a pension     for the Princeps Botanicorum,
and stating that he did this entirely without Brown's know
ledge.     I, of course, lauded the effort as      it deserved (indeed
I  had previously spoken of        it to Humboldt, and Buckland
had written), and added,       '
                                 I was sure that on this occasion
his voice would prevail'           Still  he   seemed to doubt,      and
placed little reliance on what he called the buckram minis
ter — the man of    sees, and saws,     and appliances.

      " We
              parted at the great gate of the Royal Gardens, and
 I got    back to my inn, packed up and rolled back to Berlin,
 having in company the King's architect,                who had been to
 his Majesty with plans in the evening.                 As soon       as these
                                                                     '
 were disposed of, the royal party would assemble                       en  petit
 comitd.'     That evening my friend Baron von Orlich was to
 show his Hindustani            drawings;     on other occasions          Hum-
boldt and       others      read    new   works    and   criticised        them.
Thus quietly         and     unostentatiously, happily        and      sensibly
live the King and Queen of Prussia.                  Long may they              so
live, and God bless them           !
      " I   was again      in the Hotel de Russie at            1 0    o'clock    ;
wrote letters      ;  slept five hours, and was up at              5    o'clock.
 Off at    7 in the Eisenbahn for Leipzig, and have written my
day's work     just   as we reach     Wittenberg, at     10 o'clock."
      There were still some geological            sections   to explore         in
the Saxon duchies before Murchison could rejoin his wife.                       So
he once more turned south to Leipzig, and then south-west
wards      by Gotha and Eisenach to Berka.               Under date 25th
July     the   following       entry occurs     in his journal :— " Well
may a geologist         say he never can bespeak         his bed    !      I had
taken leave of the essentials            of my work on the slopes of
the Thuringerwald, and was bowling along                  at a merry pace
from Marksohl          to Varta, when, having nothing to look at
but the so-called tiresome            '
                                        Bunter Sandstein,'       I    took up
my memorandum-book                 of   two    months    old,   and       found
'
   Eeichelsdorf      and      surrounding      country to     see      on     my
return,' — a note      I  had taken from Germar at Halle.                 Alas    !
I   had passed by my game, and, after travelling two and a
half German miles,             was   now    as   much from my point.
Arrived at Varta,          I  balanced    for a few seconds.            On the

forward and homeward                          side of the argument       lay my wife,
anxiously expecting me at Baden, the meeting of the British
Association at Cork awaiting                          me, and the desire to reach a
good         inn at Frankfort without more bivouacking.                               Then
again        there was the bother                    of returning, getting into the
Hessian bad roads, and being bored to death, and, after all,
perhaps, to see               little or nothing to repay me in the way of
analogies to my Permian, amid the Zechstein,Kupfer-Schiefer,
Grauliegende,                and    the    overlying Bunter, with which the
tract        I    was to explore              is beset.     A   faint heart, however,
thought            ,1,   would never have obtained the Emperor's vase,
and          Zuriick nach Berka                   was the word given, and             fresh

pair of horses was at once harnessed to take me back."
      At         the Eeichelsdorf             mines he came upon       a   curious and
credulous              bergmeister,       on whom the miners had played so
many tricks by supplying him with fossil wonders of their
own device, that his collection of sea-devils and all manner
of unknown monsters had become one of the lions of the
district. Our traveller writes, " paid him eleven dollars
                                                       I
for his whole collection                  !       The fossilized spitz-hound or his
own dog was, however, too strong even for him.                              '
                                                                                What     is
this large flag?'                  said   I,      seeing   one covered   over     in the
drawer.
                 '
                       Das ist nichts.'       '
                                                  Aber lassen sie mich sehen.'
                                                                                  '

bitte,       das thut nichts.'                 This increased      my curiosity, and
pulling           out the       flagstone      I     saw on turning      it   over, the
dog
      '

      It     was the 29th of              July      before Murchison rejoined his
wife at Baden.                 After various excursions            and visits to geo
logists          011     the way home, they reached England                in time for
the meeting of the British Association, which had this year
been fixed to take place at Cork.

     There had been considerable political excitement during
the summer       in the south of Ireland.          So serious indeed      did
the prospect appear, as reported           in the papers which found
their way into Galicia, that Murchison                  wrote    thence    to
Phillips, gravely proposing whether it would not be wise to
ask   Government        if  the meeting      of the Association could
with safety be held at Cork.              Such fears were enough of
themselves      to   make     the success of the meeting           at least
doubtful.      But other causes stood in the way.             It  had been
originally agreed that York should be the place of meeting,
—a     decision    overturned     in the end by a majority of the
General    Committee.         Those who favoured         the   Irish town
seemed     to    forget    afterwards    that considerable        exertions
were needed to insure a good attendance, and to make                       all
the machinery of the Association work smoothly and har
moniously.        When, however, the executive           and the leading
members reached          Cork, they found that no adequate pre
parations    had     been    made, and      that the visitors from           a
distance    were     few    in number.       " That which we
                                                                      hoped
would prove to be        a south   of Ireland meeting, turned out to
be a mere city of Cork concern.                 It  was desperately       up
hill work, and the few of us who had any position were
obliged   to swell ourselves out and speechify, and            jollify, and
make the best of a very untoward thing.                We were never        so
near shipwreck as at this Cork meeting.                For myself,     I  was
so  imbued with our desire to go to York that                  I  was con
stantly putting in that word instead of Cork."
     It will    be remembered         that in the early discussions
regarding     the order of the rocks          in Devonshire, reference
was now and then made to the rocks               in the south and south
west    of Ireland, whither, indeed,           Murchison      would have

betaken      himself had he not been withdrawn by the greater
attractions of the Ehineland geology.                 Having now, how
ever, got as far as Cork — a place he had not seen since that
memorable         day    when Sir Arthur Wellesley's              expedition
sailed     for Portugal — he determined          to make a dash at the
older rocks which form the noble iron-bound coast line from
Bantry Bay to the mouth of the Shannon.1                     Several weeks
were given to this work, and at last after so prolonged                      an
absence, Murchison returned to his desk in Belgrave                  Square,
and the elaboration           of the text and map of the work on
Russia.       We get a pleasant picture of him and of his regard
for his old friend at Cambridge, from the following letter                 : —

but De Verneuil was with              me,   and   I was   very busy about

the mail by teaching him a small vocabulary of Irish, had remonstrated
with him as to the high price (two guineas) then charged for Ladies'
 tickets at the British Association meetings.     In parting he gave her his
own platform ticket, with the promise that if she should ever in after life
 meet him, he would endeavour to befriend her.         Years afterwards that
 same ticket was put into his hands at the Association meeting at Bir
 mingham.      The girl was now a mother and a widow, in great difficulties,
 and striving    to gain a living by teaching.     Murchison   took immediate
 steps to relieve her present wants, and to interest others   in providing for
 her future employment and comfort.

work (according            to his own account)           in Cambria, and           will
doubtless         fire off instanter, as he was all               full of it when      I
saw him at the Athenaeum.                         He knew nothing of your
having been in Wales, nor did                     I   know of your doings at

       The epithet " smoking applied to himself by the writer
                                   "
 in this letter was an appropriate and distinctive designation.
 The habit which,       as we have      seen,  marked him out in old
 days    in the hunting-field, remained         as strong    as ever.       So
 great indeed was his love of a cigar or a pipe, that                in the
 winter of 1840-41 he set on foot a movement in London to
 found a new club, to be called " The Smokers," or " The
 Raleigh," the fundamental basis of which should be the free
 use of tobacco.          He himself framed        a prospectus      of the
 undertaking, wherein he drew              a  gloomy      picture of       the
 miseries of smokers        in the existing clubs of London, either
 precluded from the solace of a " whiff," or, if permitted to
indulge their taste, banished          to some scanty       and cheerless
 attic.    In  the new fraternity everything was to be designed
with a view to insure the most untrammelled enjoyment of the
weed.      Special importation of the best tobacco, well stocked
wardrobes      for the convenience        of such members        as   might
have     occasion    to quit the atmosphere of smoke             for social
intercourse     with the outer world, good wines, artistic cook
ery, and suitable literature were among                the attractions of
the prospectus.        This document,      sent by its author to       J.   G.
Lockhart, drew from that caustic friend a brief and char
acteristic   note  : — " Your Grace's puff is quite admirable            ;   it
could not be mended were Raleigh to rise for the purpose.1
   1 It was a favourite and almost inveterate joke with some of Murehi-
son's friends to quiz his love of rank and position by styling him    " Duke
or King of Siluria," "Lord Grauwacke," or some other title referring
to his scientific work.     Lockhart, who often sent short notes to him,
usually addressed him as "Your Grace," or " Your Highness," and after the
Russian campaigns as " Dear Grand Duke."          At the same time Cony-
beare congratulates him on his Muscovite successes, beginning    with " Dear
and most illustrious   Count Silurowski    Ouralowski."    Murchison   rather
liked this sort of thing.

I  wholly decline the honour of belonging           to the club.     I
have no club habits, and hate especially          all smoking in a
room but what is solitary."
     The winter of 1843-44 found Murchison full of work over
his Eussian volumes, correcting proofs, and carrying on a large
correspondence with friends      in this country and on the Con
tinent  as to the rocks and fossils     which he had to describe,
but escaping,   as of old, for a few days' shooting now and then
at  Up Park or elsewhere.       One of the questions which occa
sioned a good deal of flutter    in the scientific ranks during this
season was the determined       opposition shown by Whewell to
certain  proposals   of the leaders of the British Association.
There had been a pretty general feeling that in its cycle of
perambulation that body should begin again with the towns
in which it had held its earliest meetings. We have seen that
York had been almost fixed upon for the assembly in 1843.
That town had now been selected for 1844, and          if the former
order were to be observed, Cambridge          would entertain the
Association in the following year.          Whewell, however, set
his face most persistently against this proposal             To con
ciliate him, the Council proposed to choose some other place
for 1845, and to take Cambridge          next in order.       But he
 declared that this would be equally objectionable,        grounding
 his argument on the law and practice of the Association in
 favour of a wide range of places to         be visited.     Even in
 Cambridge,    however,   his friends, such    as the  Dean of Ely,
 and Sedgwick, refused to support him, and energetically          lent
 their assistance to the Council of the Association.         Murchi
 son, of course, had his      full share of meetings and letter-
 writing on the subject.      From his letters the following may
 be selected as having    still some interest, inasmuch     as it well

defines the position which, according                    to one of its founders,
the British Association should                 aspire to   fill : —
                                       "BKLORAVK SQUARE, March                1, 1844.
         " MY DEAR MASTER,          — As    you have written to me with
perfect candour concerning the future meetings of the B. A.,
you will,      I   know, permit me to reply to you in the same
strain.      We had a meeting of the Council yesterday, and                               I
communicated,           as   you desired, your sentiments, etc.                    You
must not be surprised when                 I    tell you that the opinion of
all      present (and    I   know   it to      be the general feeling of the
B. A.) is opposed to your own concerning the regulating
principle of the Association. We repudiate the idea that
the chief aim of our existence is to stir up a few embers of
latent scientific warmth in                the provinces.        If, indeed, that
were truly our main object,                I   for one would          cease     to play
pantaloon or clown in the strolling company,                             even      if it
should have a benefit night,           as      you suggest, for the followers
of Caractacus        on the frontiers of Siluria             !   We think that
nearly all the places you enumerate are wholly incapable of
receiving the B. A. in its present stature, and                   if it   is to pine
away in size (as at Cork), the body can no longer enact the
part which entitles it to the nation's confidence.
    " In such case it could no
                               longer be what it has                             been,    a
parliament of science, which finds the ways and means of
 carrying out researches which, without its stimulus, would
 never be undertaken          ;   nor could      it,   with such poor backing
 as Portsmouth, Shrewsbury, etc., pretend for one moment to
 act by public opinion upon the Government of this country.
 Unless we have full meetings, our funds fail, and we can
 no      longer institute     the   first experiments which, satisfying
 public men of their usefulness, lead them to adopt our                              re

it is by no means necessary or even desirable that the
Association wheel should go the same round, catching up
its old friends (none of them we hope off                               work},     nolentes
wlentes,     still it is essential to our well-being, if not to our
existence, that we should now and then secure the embraces
of a university ; — it           is,
                                 I         say, indispensable           to have          from
time to time        a   fresh infusion of scientific blood, and                     a    rally
of our oldest and best friends,                  etc.   ;   if   so,    where      (Oxford
being      lost in her tracts),        I    say, can we obtain such except
in your honoured Alma Mater?
      " But whilst      I    first argue my        case       con amore,   I       at once
admit that the very look of the Master of Trinity when he
chides his foster-child,              is   entitled to the greatest respect                 ;
and  I     for one can imagine no good and effective meeting of
science at Cambridge             in which he does not co-operate.                         I
know and have               known his strong objections                   to an early
meeting      there, but     I   venture to hope that to oblige all his
scientific friends from whom he differs on this point, he                                will
so   far relent     as to    allow us to revisit        a     place so dear to us,
at no very distant day.                My proposal, therefore,              is,   or rather
my urgent         request       is,    that after chastening             us and com
pelling us to break our cabalistic cycle, by making us take
a    new    place     for our first meeting                 after      York, our good
Master will again receive us with open arms, and that how
ever repugnant           a    meeting       might be to him in 1845, his

opposition having sent us to fresh pastures in that year, he
will    once more put us into condition (pardon my old habits)
by     a Cambridge training.           Now,     as clerk of the course
which the B. A. has to run,            I  have got the fresh pastures
ready for 1845, wherein we may fatten.                 In   the   name    of
the Corporation, inhabitants, and science                (such     as  it is
with Phil Duncan at its head), Bath has invited us warmly
to visit her in 1845, and with Lord                   Lansdowne        as  a
President, we should then have a good show and collect a
good purse, for      it is the centre of a net-work of railroads
open to Ireland and the south-west, and four hours from
London.        But good   as   it may    be,  the Bath meeting        would
sound      as  a great bathos in our prospectus,          if  followed by
the poor diets of smaller provincial towns, and then will
come the very nick of time, when Cambridge                   can reinvigo-
rate us.       Pray, therefore, unite with our scientific friends
at Cambridge,       who are,     I  hear, far from being confined         to
the Dean of        Ely  and      Sedgwick, and by allowing us to
announce       that Cambridge will succeed to Bath, assure the
public that we still possess within us the national scientific
strength."
     It was    ultimately arranged that the Cambridge meeting
should be held in 1845, with Sir John Herschel               as President.
     Among the younger            scientific Societies of London, the
Geographical occupied           at this time a very inconspicuous
position.       Founded in the year 1830 chiefly by members of
the Ealeigh Travellers' Club,            it  was designed    to foster the
progress of geographical         research by collecting and publish
ing narratives of travel     ;  by forming     a good consulting library
of geographical      works, especially of maps and charts; by
keeping illustrations of the best kinds of instruments for

exploration in different climates           ;   by aiding with suggestion
and information any traveller about to explore                   ;   and by enter
ing into correspondence with other geographical and scientific
societies, and      with persons interested in geographical                         dis
covery in all parts of the world.                At   the original meetings
when the Society was organized, Murchison attended, and
he showed        such interest    in the Society's           welfare           that   in
1843 he was chosen President.                   Its fourteen years of life,
though by no means without vigour, gave little promise of
the dimensions and           importance         which the Society subse
quently attained.          How this success was reached, and how
intimately Murchison was associated with                   it,   will be referred
to in later chapters.          For the present we            see         him in the
chair of the young and still straggling Society, reading                               to
them,        in the early summer of the year 1844, the first of
those anniversary addresses for which                  in his later years he
was perhaps more widely known than even for his geological
achievements.         Turning over the pages of that early address,
we see the germ of all those which succeeded                         it  — broadly
                                                                           a
sketched outline of geographical            progress over the globe, with
sagacious forecasts as to where explorations should be carried
on, and what ought to be looked for, and with                                 a   blend
ing of geological exposition which gave                a   scientific meaning
and      cohesion    to   scattered   and       unconnected          observations.
The first of his addresses            is   stamped      too with           a      feature
which marked all his discourses to the Geographical Society
—    a   painstaking analysis     of the work of foreign                   travellers,
and      a   generous recognition of merit wherever                      it   could be
found.         Undoubtedly, this characteristic            has done much to
give the        Geographical Society of               London         a    position of
weight abroad.

     These duties at the Geographical               Society, the revision of
proof-sheets of the Eussian work, and an unexpected visit of
the Emperor of Eussia to London in May, when, of course,
the explorer of the Ural Mountains                      gladly renewed           his
experience of that monarch's                courteous      and even friendly
bearing to him, kept Murchison longer in town this year
than usual        It       was the beginning of         July        before he was
ready to start, and            as he had to be      back in September              to
be in time for the British Association                     meeting       at    York,
he had comparatively little scope for an extensive                              tour.
There still remained             one great conterminous             region to be
visited for the completion of the Eussian map.                                   The
 Scandinavian      peninsula had already             yielded         an abundant
 series of Silurian fossils, and Murchison had often quoted
 them, but he had never seen the country from which they
 came.       His plan for visiting that part of Europe is thus
 told by himself       :   —
     " MY DEAK      PROFESSOR           FORCHHAMMER, —          I   have resolved
 to visit Christiania           at the    meeting    of the Scandinavian
 philosophers under Hansteen and his conjoint Presidents.
 I was     for some time undecided about             it,   as
                                                            I       wished to get
 my great work on Eussia finished, but finding that this                           is
 impossible before the early part of the winter on account of
 various delays which must always occur in extensive scien
 tific publications,       I    have resolved    to take        flight for Ham
 burg and Copenhagen                in the first days of July, and hope to

 somewhat       more   perfect.     At all     events      I shall   see    the

     Travelling rapidly into Denmark he halted for some days
 at Copenhagen,       paid his respects there to King Christian
viii., whom he found to have some knowledge                     of geology,
 met the scientific men of the city, and revived his love
 of  art-criticism      among     the     baa-reliefs     of  Thorwaldsen.
Arriving in time for the meeting of the savans at Chris-
tiania, he found it a very different affair from his British
Association. " The scientific meeting," to quote from his
            "
journal,      opened by a general         assembly       on the evening of
 our arrival, when the first president, Hansteen, sat still, and
the    third    president,   Dr.    Holst, announced          in a solemn
manner the laws and method of election, and the distribu
tion of time.       The hours of meeting were             so managed      that
no two sections were ever sitting at the same time                 ;  and as
 no section works more than two hours, every man may                       cull
from any school he pleases.             Besides    these, there are three
general meetings in the hall of the Storthing.
     "  At our first               the medical men were desired to
                       meeting
leave the room, and        in a trice three-fourths of the chamber
were seen moving into an adjoining room                      to elect    their
presidents      and   secretaries.     The plural        number must be
employed,       for the apothecaries         have    a separate      medical
section distinct from that of the doctors             !   The spreaders of
plaster    and    lint and compounders            of medicines      play an
important part in Scandinavia,             and are as necessary to the
doctor    as   the attorney    to the barrister         in England.       The
migration of all those sons of Esculapius at once showed

posed.       Out of the remaining fourth we had to form all the
other four sections.
      "
         Grouping together in a corner of the hall, we geologists
chose our own President and                 Secretary.     Forchhammer
addressed      us      in Norse, saying,     as I  was told,   that Von
Buch declined to take the chair because                I was here, and
that    I was princeps inter geologos : he therefore proposed me
as President      !     To this    I warmly objected   ; not wishing to
be a King         Log, and having no knowledge whatever of
the language,        I   urged that   I should be in a false position.
Notwithstanding,           however,   all I   could say,  I  was all but
elected.      But, to my great delight,         and   with my vote for
him, M. de Buch was chosen in spite of himself.                    He is
really a wonderful man, since he talks Norse very tolerably,
and is quite able to explain himself on all points.
     " At the first
                           general meeting held on the second day,
from one to half-past three o'clock, we had three subjects              :
1st,  Hansteen       ;  2d, Oersted, or the identity of Electricity and
Magnetism       ;   3d,   Eetzius, on the Eaces of the Human Species.

Ministers of State, and a bishop or two, with the consuls of
France, England, and Eussia, were assembled, first in a great
room above stairs, and afterwards           in the dinner-hall beneath,
where we sat down, nearly two hundred               in number, at three
tables.     We had        a bad  dinner of four dishes, but it was very
agreeable, and conducted without a trace of confusion.
     "  In  the evening       the geologists went with    Keilhau (Von
Buch and all of us following) to an upper part of the valley

       Thursday Morning. — Here         I   am at my last day, and
have     scarcely   had  time to say a word           of the meeting.
Though up at six o'clock,         the day has usually been con
sumed, on my part,      in eating, drinking, talking, and twice
giving lectures of an hour and a half long,            till  the evening
has arrived, and then fttes go on      till midnight, with       no dark
ness.     The table of meetings, etc., will best explain how the
different affairs proceeded.       Hansteen made         a  quiet Presi
dent  ;  but neither he, nor his second, Boeck, nor his third, Dr.
Holst,   possesses  any eloquence for the social part of the con
cern.     It was in consequence of this that my            little tirades
at the tents of the students        in the Botanical Gardens, and
again at the last public dinner on Thursday, produced                quite
an enthusiasm.        Hansteen literally      read    his after-dinner
speech in proposing the King's health          !
    "
        On the last evening they had             toasted the      King of
Sweden and Denmark, and had got low down                  in the lists of
toasts, connecting    my name with the British Association for
the Advancement of Science, when,            in reply,     I  took leave
as a    royalist, to propose the health of the Stadtholder, the
representative     of his sovereign, and      a type     of Norwegian
hospitality;     for although    his excellency had fed us well,
and was seated at our table, the philosophers           had quite for
gotten him.       The old Count Lowenskiold replied in a brief
but very energetic speech, and seemed much gratified.
    " But                   '

connected with old England, was the most telling, because                 I

     Before    leaving the Scandinavian assembly,              Murchison
received    from his friend ]£lie de Beaumont the gratifying

     To  see    something       more   of Scandinavian geology and
geologists,    Murchison passed on from Christiania to Stock
holm,   visiting       Gottenburg on the way,          and    making the
acquaintance       there      of the future distinguished Professor
Love'n, who accompanied             him during most of his stay in
Sweden, and with whom he soon came to be on the friend
liest terms.       At Stockholm       we find him once more at Court
and full of enthusiasm over the kindliness and courtesy of
the royal family.          He spends his evenings sometimes with
Berzelius, at whose house he meets with the best scientific
society   of the capital,        sometimes     hearing   a lecture from
Eetzius,    or    sipping a glass of punch with Love'n.               The
days are given to geology, and specially to the marvellous
examples    in that region of the striated and polished rocks
which had now been universally recognised                as  in some way
the work      of ice.         He is still full of the notion of sub
mergence     and icebergs,        and chronicles    with much wonder
the size and extent of the huge ridges               or osar which, like

 the gravel eskers of Ireland, and kames of Scotland, run
 over the country    in the most striking and puzzling way.
      It was part of his plan to revisit St. Petersburg to con
 sult with Count von Keyserling          as to their joint under
 taking, and particularly to receive from that indefatigable
 explorer the latest new data for the geological map of Russia.
 Another object not     so prominently put forward,   but doubt
 less having its   full influence in drawing him once more to
 the banks of the Neva, was the presentation of a gold medal
 to the Emperor Nicholas, which had been struck         in honour
 of that sovereign's   recent  visit to England, and which the
 geologist had undertaken to convey to his Majesty.          With
 these incentives he accordingly turned eastward and up the
 Baltic, coasting   the  Aland Isles and the indented shores of
 Finland,    landing at every halting-place of the steamer to
 make    fresh  observations   regarding the rocks with      their
 striae  and groovings,    and finally getting to St. Petersburg
 on the 24th of August.
      The only items of general interest which can be gleaned
from the letters and journal of this time refer to the Em
peror Nicholas.      That monarch     had recently been plunged
into deep grief by the death of his beloved daughter the
 Grand Duchess Alexandrina.       But he sent for Murchison, and
talked freely with him on a great variety of topics.          The
journal gives us a very characteristic picture at the outset
of this interview.       Murchison    had driven   down into the
country to the Peterhoff Palace,        and was   waiting in the
antechamber,      when he found, standing in one corner, his
friend Sir William Allan, President of the Royal Scottish
Academy, with his picture of Peter the Great.           " Without
my warm encouragement          this excellent and modest man

would not have been here to-day.                  A  week before, when        I
 went to      see  his work, he told me that he was on the point
of departure by the next packet, and that, owing to the dis
tressed condition of the Imperial               family, he had given up
all hopes of seeing the Emperor, though when in Scotland
 as Grand Duke Nicholas, the Emperor had known him well,
had bought pictures of him, and had charged him never to
 come to Russia without           seeing him.      Thereon     I  stimulated
him, saying that it would be a dereliction of his duty not to
 announce himself, and          I urged him to do      as  I had done,     and
write      to   Count Orloff, and then leave              the   case  to    his
 Majesty.       If   he did so,   I offered   to bet that he would suc
 ceed.     The result proved that        I  was right."
     "While     chatting in the waiting-room, Murchison, to his
 consternation,       discovered    that the medal had disappeared             !
 Search     was    made     everywhere,    but in vain, and he had to
make      his appearance        before   the   Czar without       the object
 which     it  had    been his ostensible        mission to present per
 sonally.       The stolen medal was afterwards recovered                   by
the police in a jeweller's shop, where              it had    been sold by
the driver of the drosky.
     The conversation with Nicholas is thus reported in the
journal :— " The Emperor first asked me what people said
of the reason of his visit, to which           I could   only reply that      I
was    little versed in state affairs, and merely supposed that
he wished to see the progress               we had made since he was
                                                                         '
first in England.          On which he interrupted         me, saying,     Ah
but  !   no, no    !  I   had but one object in my journey, and
that was to study the personal               character    of your Queen.'
'

say/ he continued,           you English think that your Sovereign
has so    little to do with politics and state affairs that his
or her     character    signifies little,      your ministry      regulating
all things.        That     is very     true      as  regards    your   home
affairs   and   colonies.       But you will give me leave to be
of opinion that,      as regards      your relations to the Continent
of   Europe, the        personal      character      of the    Sovereign of
England is of great importance to all of us who are your
natural allies.'      He also spoke of other estimable              qualities
of the Queen, and of how much good she did, of which no
public     account    was given.          In     short,  he   quite rejoiced
me    by the      tone   and      warmth      with     which   he  eulogized
Queen Victoria.
     " ' There was     a time,    it is true, when       I had  some reason
to bear you a grudge          ;  things were going badly, but now all
is well settled, and       I  like the English in good faith.            I   am
yours entirely.        My visit      has made known to me the char
acter of your Queen,            of which     I   have formed the highest
opinion.      I  have every confidence           in her, and though she is
bound to people who might draw her from the right path,
I  am persuaded         that she will never act against              the true
interests of her people.'           Here his Majesty no doubt alluded
to the Louis        Philippe and Leopoldine influence,              and the

that you will        be     compromised         in these African affairs        !

God preserve us from a war, but            if it breaks out,1   1 tell you,
my good friend,       as    I   have already told your Queen, that        I
have not a battalion,         I  have not a vessel that     will not fight
for you.'
       "Then, alluding to the French Revolution of 1830, his
Majesty went on,
                         '
                           No, no,   I don't change my opinions.         A
revolution such       as    that (1830) accomplished by a mass of
villany and baseness could not lead to a fixed and stable
state of things    ; I said so at the time, and shall always say so.'
       " Returning to
                           England proper, he said,
                                                        '

you that with all my astonishment at your external progress,
there was one sign which much grieved                 me  :  it was to see
how much less respect the lower classes showed                     towards
their Sovereign than at the time of my first visit ; and               I do
not hesitate to attribute this marked change to the demo
cratic movement         which is passing at present through the
whole of Europe.'
       " On then
                   asking after the health of the Empress, his
countenance      all at once changed, and taking my hand, which

he warmly pressed,              Yes,' said  he,     we have also had a
terrible trial, but    I   have indeed had a test of the affection of
my people which has touched                my heart.    As regards the
death of my dear daughter' (and here the tears burst from
his manly eyes),         '
                            I   wished to have her buried by night,
without      any pomp         whatsoever,    accompanied      by a single
battalion and some followers.            What was then my astonish
ment to     see the   whole population from Tsarskoe Selo to the
citadel (twenty versts) forming such a dense column that

deep silence the anguish of my soul,           truly touched my heart.
Then    I felt what it was to possess the love of one's people.'
     " The
              Emperor was near his dear child when she made
her last sign to him to approach            her, when kissing her and
                                                           '
putting his ear to her expiring voice, she said,             Papa, never
forget the person to whom          I  owe everything.'     This allusion
was to Miss       Higginbotham, the governess of this excellent
and    beautiful young princess,          and no nobler trait of her
character could she have left behind her.
     " From Tsarskoe Selo to the citadel, the
                                                          Emperor, at a
foot-pace and on horseback,          followed the hearse like a man
smitten with      so dire a grief, that he was unconscious         of the
world around.        But when the pageant and the lights of the
mausoleum       were around       him, and the imposing ceremony
of depositing the remains            commenced,     after two or three
convulsive efforts to restrain himself, he burst into              a flood
of tears, and for the first time during his reign, Nicholas
was    seen to be but mortal by his court and his faithful
soldiers.     There was not a dry eye in the church.                   The
sternest grenadiers were        in tears."
     Quitting this painful subject, the Emperor gave his guest
the opportunity of saying,         in allusion to the falsehoods cir
culated    as to  his own character and that of his nation, that
" it was only by using the pen and telling the whole truth
about them, that these false reports could be suppressed in
Europe."
               " Ah diable    !  as to the pen,     I  don't understand
anything about        it;   that is not my trade.         At   the   same
time    I  am none the less grateful to my good friends who
will tell   the truth.     That is all that    I desire."
     " I  then (alluding to the origin and cause of the dislike
to his government         and person) ventured to speak          out and

 tell him plainly that touching England the whole matter lay
 in the suppression      of the Polish insurrection, and that        if
 our public were once properly instructed         as to the  origin of
 that affair, and the total want of good faith exhibited by
 its chief actors, the false sentiment which had been raised
 by the Franco-Polish        party would     be extinguished.       If,
 therefore, his Majesty     approved of the whole subject being
 thoroughly canvassed and exposed,         I  knew that the editor
 of the Quarterly Renew would like to get up              a series   of
 reviews on Poland.        He replied, ' Do   so, by all means, and
 say the truth.      You know me well, and you know that is
 what   I like.   But with all your efforts you will have some
trouble in showing the face of the cards.           The Poles have
 suppressed     everything.     There are things which are only
 known to our family.        For instance, to give you an idea of
the origin of this insurrection, and of the manner in which
these    gentlemen      behaved.     There    were     suspicions   at
Warsaw that plots were being organized,             and my brother
 Constantino wrote to me on the subject, and begged me to
give him my opinion.           I  answered   him at once, saying,
" Lay aside all these suspicions     ;  have  full confidence in the
Polish army.         It is an army, of which the noble officers
will never break their oath.         The Polish army has never
been    unfaithful"     Conceive then my surprise, when on the
very evening of the day when my letter arrived, my brother
being asleep without a guard, they tried to assassinate him          !'
The Emperor further said that          if his letter  to his brother
had    been    published,   he  would have      required no better

rising the insurgents took possession          of all my brother's
papers.     He left them all his documents.            Among these

38             SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
there was a declaration written by liis own hand that he
would never attach any credit to these kinds of conspiracies,
and he trusted entirely       in the loyalty of the Polish people.
Why were these two letters not published                  ?    Why did
these    Czartoryskis,     and    these    people  who      had all my
brother's letters in their possession, suppress them            ?   Why,
as   men    of common       honesty,    did they not let the truth
appear   ?   Hence,    I repeat,  it is the truth only that      I desire.
As for revolts of misguided people, they may be pardoned                   ;
but the revolt of a whole army — an army to which                         I
 confided   the care of Poland — for       I had not 10,000 Russian
troops    in the kingdom, such baseness never can be for
                                                                        "
 given, and    as an  old soldier, you must be of that opinion.'
     At  the house of the Grand-Duchess            Helene, Murchison
 records   that "we      had    good   fun with old       quaint    B —,

 and   smoker.       When    we left     in the evening he had no
 carriage whatever,     having come in a street drosky, which he
 had paid     off.   Wishing to give him a lift, Von Keyserling
 and myself picked him up on the bridge, and squeezed him
 into our little caleche.      As soon, however,     as we    had driven
                                               '

 plus rester,' and pulling out the stinking half-smoked cigar
 which he had in his pocket all the time at the table of the
 Grand Duchess, he jumped from the carriage, and kneeling
 on the ground,      lighted   it  at one of the flaming pots of oil
 which were burning in honour of the Emperor, and called
 out for a drosky,     in which he followed us to the Mineralo-
 gical Society."

 Murchison obtained a promise from the Grand-Duke Michael
that   a specimen   of the great wild oxen of the Vistula should be
procured alive, and sent for the acceptance of the Zoological
 Society of London.        There had been a good deal of merri
ment at the table, and the Grand-Duke, in taking leave of
the geologist, said to him, " Adieu done, mon cher.
Eassurez-vous, nous vous enverrons            un bison tout entier et
en 1'ouvrant vous trouverez la-dedans votre meclaille !
                                                                 "
      After this short and pleasant sojourn in St. Petersburg,
Murchison       journeyed      homeward       by   Berlin,   where     he
renewed his acquaintance         with Humboldt and others, dined
once more     with the royal family, and obtained still further
materials for the completion of his Russian map.                It   was
in the latter half of September            that he once more found
himself in England.
      This northern tour had been unexpectedly successful              in
its geological    results.   To the flat unaltered Silurian        rocks
of the     Russian plains       no  base    had   yet been found,      so
that neither Murchison         nor his colleagues     could tell what
the oldest     fossiliferous strata     of   these  tracts rested     on.
But in Scandinavia         he    had found the       old platform      of
metamorphosed        rocks on which         the Silurian    formations
reposed,     and   on    which    he   believed the whole of the
fossiliferous deposits      of   the north      of Europe must lie.
He had likewise learnt much           as to the    organic contents of
the older formations from the numerous museums to which,
through the friendly aid of Berzelius, Keilhau, and Lovdn,
he had enjoyed unrestricted access.            The abundant illustra
tions of ice- action had likewise brought before him in a
new    light many of the phenomena of that northern boulder-
drift which      he  had traced      over the    plains   of Northern

40            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
Germany and Russia.         Moreover, the conference with Von
Keyserling    at St. Petersburg bore fruit in the subsequently
published volume on Russia, for that undaunted explorer
had traced his geological lines through the wilds of North-
Eastern    Russia, a    region    in   great    part unknown,     and
stretching far beyond the limits of forest growth up to the
shores of the icy sea.
    In other    respects   the tour had been an advantageous
one for Murchison.        He had come into personal contact
with the scientific men of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,
and formed     acquaintances,    and in some cases friendships,
which, lasting     through life, helped to broaden          his hold
upon the general scientific activity of his time.
    Again,    though the tour       lasted   little more than two
months, it had brought the traveller             into personal   rela
tions with four of the crowned heads of Europe.               It was,
of course, his steadily increasing reputation which secured
him    this   attention.    Though keenly alive to such social
distinction,   he   was   well   aware    that he owed it to his
science,   and   he  endeavoured      to   repay the obligation by
losing no opportunity of doing his best to strengthen the
position    of science   and   scientific    men    with the powers
that be.
     Back again in London, he applied himself strenuously
to  the final completion of the Russian book,             which had
been so long in hand.          So great had been the delay, so
numerous the alterations and improvements occasioned                by
his own fresh observations         in the adjoining countries,      as
well  as those  of Von Keyserling and others since the original
surveys of 1840 and 1841       in Russia, that the estimated cost
of the work was more than trebled.           The printers' charge for

       "RUSSIA AND THE URAL MOUNTAINS."                             41
corrections alone amounted         to more than twice the sum
originally    destined for the printing of the whole volume.
At last,    however,   in the month of April 1845, the preface
was    written, and in the      course    of the summer the first
copies were issued.
     Judged merely from the bibliographer's point of view,
The   Geology   of Russia in Europe and        the  Ural Mountains
was    a  magnificent work.        It   extended    to   two massive
volumes,     the conjoint labour of Murchison,       Von Keyserling,
and De Vemeuil          The first volume was written by Murchi-
son   from his own notes and those of his colleagues             ; the
second, treating of fossils,     was the     work    of De Verneuil
In  the first volume, a    re'sume' is  given of what was known
of palaeozoic geology 'in Europe and America up to the date
of publication.     The successive geological      formations of the
great Russian plains are described,         and then follows a de
tailed account of the structure of the Ural chain.            The last
chapters, among the most readable and generally interesting
of the whole, treat of the more recent deposits, the forma
tion of the Aralo-Caspian        basin,  the gravels    and drifts so
widely     spread    over the   low grounds,      the   range  of the
Scandinavian boulders, and the extent and origin of the
" black earth," and later alluvia. In short, the volume pre
sented for the first time a clear outline of the geology of
more than      half of the Continent, and crowned the work
which had been in progress        ever since Murchison's earliest
observations     of the transition rocks on the banks of the
Wye, by combining on one broad canvas a picture of the
whole succession of the palaeozoic rocks of Europe.
     Though     the  task of putting       this geological    material
together    had been intrusted to Murchison, the honour of

this great contribution to science was equally shared by bis
colleagues.   They had taken part in the toils of the field,
and   contributed to the mass    of detail out of which     the
general deductions   had been evolved.   The work was appro
priately and gratefully dedicated   to the Emperor Nicholas,
who had taken throughout a lively personal interest in its
prosecution and completion.
     With the publication of Russia and    the Ural Mountains,
Murchison's position in the very front rank of geologists
was universally acknowledged.     Step by step, with unwearied
industry, he had risen to this proud eminence.      During the
remaining    years of his busy life he     displayed the same
untiring energy.    But he had thenceforth no new kingdoms
to conquer.     His years, therefore, were passed in consoli
dating what he had reclaimed, and in witnessing the exten
sion of his work by others into all parts of the globe.    The
story of this second half of his scientific life has now to be
told.

                       CHAPTER XVIII.
                           KNIGHTHOOD.
     THE first and most active half of Murchison's scientific
career may be considered to end      with the publication of the
great work on Russia.      Twenty years had passed away since
he sold his fox-hounds and came up to London — an earnest
and painstaking auditor at the lectures        of Davy, Faraday,
and Brande — twenty busy years, which at their beginning
found him utterly ignorant of science and scientific methods,
and at their close left him at the very head of the geologists
of Europe.      During that eventful period his life was one
of constant activity both of body and mind.          He had been
late  in starting  as a man  of science, but he more than made
up for the delay.
     We have traced how, after various essays in different
directions, he finally settled down to the study of the oldest
fossiliferous rocks    as the business    of his life; how, with
great   sagacity, he followed them     from country to country,
and made them reveal      at last their contribution to the his
tory of the earth and its inhabitants.        It was not merely
the geological structure of a part of Britain which he cleared
up when he put these rocks into their true order and rela

tions.     In grouping them      he discovered     a series of early
pages    in the story of the progress of animal life upon our
globe — portions of a record which, in its grand features, bore
evidence, not of any mere local significance,       but of probably
a world-wide       application;   Following    up his successes in
his own country, he confirmed         the general   application and
importance of his deductions          by tracing this same great
geological     succession  over wide regions     of the Continent.
His views had been adopted            by geologists    all over the
globe, and he had now, year after year, the gratification of
receiving, from even the most remote           quarters,   tidings of
the light which his classification threw upon the study of
the older rocks.
    The main outlines of the scientific work of his life were
now    filled in.     Henceforth he busied himself completing
the details of the picture.       To do this still required much
active research, which was devoted         chiefly to various parts
of the Continent of Europe.          But we trace from this time
forward     a gradual relaxation of the engrossing       hold which
geology      had for these twenty       years  retained    upon    his
thoughts and affections.       Not that he ceased to be     as keenly
alive  as ever to the progress   of his favourite science, but with
the advance of years he gradually allowed geographical           pro
gress to claim a large share of his time and interest.             He
identified himself heart and soul with the Royal Geogra
phical Society, and for at least the last ten or twelve years
of his life was probably better known to ordinary newspaper
readers as a geographer       than  as a geologist.    This was no
new current of thought to him.             He had himself been a
traveller long before he became a geologist.            As we have
seen, he was one     of the members of the Raleigh Travellers'

Club who started the Geographical Society, and, while still
deeply immersed       in the preparation of the work on Russia,
he had written       an elaborate    address   for that Society,       of
which he had been chosen President.           In  the remainder of
this record of his life, therefore, we shall find him not only
still wielding his hammer, but coming to the front           as a  most
earnest    and influential promoter     of geographical    enterprise,
identifying himself even personally with            the success and
the fate of travellers, and rousing the dormant sympathies
of his countrymen and government           into active co-operation
with his own.
       During the years immediately preceding            the   date    at
which we are now arrived, much interest had been taken in
this country in the exploration of the Polar regions.               The
first impulse to this interest had been given by the British
Association, which at the Newcastle meeting             in 1838 had
adopted     a series   of resolutions strongly urging upon the
 Government the propriety of fitting out an expedition to the
high latitudes of the southern hemisphere,           for the purpose
primarily     of carrying out important        observations     on   the
subject of terrestrial magnetism.        In 1839 Sir James Clark
 Eoss sailed with the       " Erebus" and " Terror," and, after an
 absence    of four years, returned with a noble harvest of
 results in many different branches of science.           So   brilliant
 was his success that     it rekindled the old passion for the dis
 covery of the north-west passage, and thus, long before the
 charming narrative of his voyage was published, the im

 patient nation had resolved that the Erebus and Terror,"
 which had      so   gallantly  escaped   all the dangers of the
 antarctic ice, should not be allowed to lie idle in port, but
 should be once more sent on         a mission of Polar discovery.

46              SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                              [HUB.
In   the month of      May (1845), Franklin and his brave com
rades sailed on their hapless voyage.
     Among those who watched             with keen interest the de
spatch of this expedition          to  the   frozen    north were     the
members      of the    Geographical Society of London.             Their
President, Murchison, in delivering to them his second and
valedictory address in quitting          the chair, spoke     in hopeful
words of the sailing of this new venture to discover a north
                    " Proud shall we
west passage.                              geographers be," said he,
" if our gallant Vice- President, Sir John Franklin, shall
return after achieving such an exploit            ;  and gladly,   I   am
sure,   would we then offer him our Presidential                Chair   as
some slight recompence         for his arduous      labours."    The in
terest thus expressed      in the fate of Franklin remained active
at the heart of the         speaker   through the long subsequent
period of suspense         and foreboding,       stimulating     him    to
earnest    appeals    for further inquiry      as   to the   fate of the
voyagers,    until at last, after two-and-twenty weary years of
uncertainty, the sad story \vas brought home by M'Clintock.
     In resigning    the Geographical Chair to his successor            in
office, Murchison      referred  with some satisfaction to the in
crease of members        during    his Presidency, and notably of
"                                          " He had
  persons of high consideration."                      striven," he said,
"
  by every means in his power, to augment the members of
the    Society,  to attach to its      list names of distinguished
men, and to render the Society as popular as               it was scien
tific."   The piles of letters still extant among his papers bear
witness to the activity of his correspondence            in this matter.
During this his first tenure of the Presidency he began that
system of recruiting and organizing which some years later
he resumed when once more at the head of the Society, and

     The British Association assembled           this year (1845) at
Cambridge under the             Presidency of Sir     John Herschel,
Sedgwick taking the chair among the geologists.               Murchi-
son contented        himself with exhibiting an early copy of the
Russia and       the  Ural Mountains, and contributing some com
munications which had been made to him from geological
friends abroad.         He had the gratification, however, to find
both his devotion to the             Association   and   his scientific
 reputation acknowledged by his election to be President at
 the meeting      to be held   in 1846 in Southampton.
       It  had been determined      that the authors, who had dedi
 cated their work to the Emperor Nicholas, should present
 it to him at St. Petersburg         in person.    Accordingly,   Mur-
 chison and De Verneuil once more bent their steps together
 to the Russian capital, agreeing that after they had deposited
 their volumes        there they should take a conjoint geological
 tour through the south of Sweden, where so much of in
 terest had been noted        in the previous year.
       The earlier portion of Murchison's journal of this tour is
 devoted      mainly to the sights of St. Petersburg, and to the
 dinners and receptions          by the Imperial     family, where he
 was      welcomed     with every mark of esteem.            From   the
 Emperor himself he received             a measure of cordiality and
  even of confidence which astonished         as much   as it delighted
 him.       The following excerpts       from the journal will show
 the footing on which he stood         : —

reading when             I    entered, the Emperor              said,      'You       see me
poring over the last revision of our penal code, which has
never     been rendered            uniform,      codified,       or adapted            to the
advancement           of the times.           We had an immense mass of
undigested       and ill-consorted            materials, and             it is high time
to settle them           all down in a spirit more tolerant and mild
than of old.             To legislate for Russia           as    she       is,   is   no easy
matter for those who do not thoroughly understand our people,
their dispositions and condition.                      What can be so absurd
as these   continued tirades against us, and especially against
myself, because we do not regulate                         things         as     you do in
England      or France?            As for myself, these gentlemen, the
journalists, detest me, because they look on me                                as the    rock
which will never               yield to their assaults.              I         hold myself
responsible      to God alone,' added he, showing much intensity
of feeling   ;   it
                 '       is   for Him alone to judge me.                   It    is   He who
has placed me            in this responsible position, and               I       will never
change     in order to please (you                   will pardon         me the phrase)

or   a   king of England;               the     respective       conditions of our
peoples    are       entirely      different,        and   what goes well with
you would lead us to ruin.                      It   isI   then,     I     who am the
rock against which               these gentlemen           bear      a    grudge.        The
worst of all this crew are found from time to time among
our Eussian renegades.'
   " I naturally again expressed my regret that His Ma

obliged to         me,    that he had real gratitude towards an Eng
lish gentleman who espoused his cause on a principle of
probity and honour.                    After       I   had      declared     that nothing
would give me more sincere pleasure than to serve him in
extending science or in lowering his enemies, he took me by
the shoulders, and looking me through (for what an eye he
has   !)   exclaimed,
                             '

first on the right cheek, and -then on the left with                             a    hearty

delighted with the Emperor's conversation                                  with me, and
the expression            of his attachment               to England, Englishmen,
and our Queen,               and congratulating myself upon the good
old alliance being sure to be maintained,                         I   asked     him   if   he
(OrtofF) foresaw anything which might disturb this harmony
between       our nations.              At first         he said no, but correcting
himself, he said,                Yes, there   is    one event which has recently
                          '
transpired,       which possibly may lead to trouble, but when                             I
mention       it,      you will laugh at me.                 You have just sent an
ambassador             to Constantinople,                who,     though doubtless          a
very able and            a   very upright man,               is   the only Englishman
with whom my master will hold no friendly communication.
So strongly does he dislike Sir Stratford Canning, that every
thing proceeding                 from him         will   be viewed         in an irritable
             by the Emperor.                Now you know,' he added,                       the

     " The next
                   morning (Thursday), the eve of our departure,
Tcheffkine was with us early, and announced,                as  a secret,
that the day before      I  had been named        to a Great Cross of
St. Stanislaus, and De Verneuil           to a Second      Cross  of St.
Anne.
     " At              I went
           midnight            to bed, and was speedily awakened
by a serjeant with a dozen of crosses on his breast, who
came    in with candles, accompanied            by Madame Wilson's
Gregorio (the Russian servant),          and     holding in his hand
two ponderous       despatches     containing the new orders           for
De Verneuil and myself.           At first    I  begged that the con
ference might be deferred       till daylight, but    the serjeant per
sisted, and kept his post        until   I   sat up in my night-cap
as a   Knight Grand Cross of Stanislaus, and signed the book
of receipt, when     I  gave the envoy a dozen of silver roubles,
and the tilega was soon heard           to rattle quickly      from the
door, and      Mrs. Wilson's     was   again    left to quiet at two
o'clock A.M."
     From the festivities of St. Petersburg Murchison and De
Verneuil     turned once more to field geology.           Sailing down
the Baltic and skirting the shores of Finland, they began an
examination of the ice-worn rocks and an argumentation
thereon, which appears to have taken up quite as much of
their time and thought         as the   structure and fossils of the
 ancient rocks.     Murchison      stood   out stoutly for icebergs,
 and   traced,   or believed    he could trace, their impress           all
 along the Finland      coast and over the whole of the southern
 tracts   of Sweden.       De Verneuil      interposed    on   behalf of

 glaciers.       Thus the debate was renewed which had begun                             so
 vigorously when Agassiz startled                       geologists   by demanding
 whole continents of ice to                    account       for the ground and
 polished rocks of the northern hemisphere.
      When the two travellers landed                      at Stockholm they each
 found everywhere             fresh materials           in support of his theory.
 They took a tour through the southern portion of Sweden,
 contriving, amid the fascination of the ice-work of that region
 to make         sections     in illustration           of the Silurian        deposits
 which proved of service in future illustrations of palaeozoic

 Stockholm, where they found Berzelius, and the other scien
tific men of that metropolis, ready to welcome them,                                   and
where      they were received              at Court.          Pursued by furious
storms, they prolonged their tour into Gothland                              and then
into the province of Scania, where, at Lund, they met the
well-known archaeologist, Nilsson, who gave them                           a  disquisi
tion on craniology.             "
                                   Nilsson asks,"          so the  journal records,
"as the greatest favour,              the cranium            of a Highlander.              I

with special affection          as  coming       so near     his Phoenician type."
     At     Copenhagen,         on the homeward journey,                  Murchison
renewed        his intercourse with               the     Danish      acquaintances

whom        he had met        in the previous year.               In   the   King   he
found an unpretending but interested                          student of natural
history, who had formed              an admirable series                of cabinets,
and who himself led him through                 it,   "
                                                          happier in    a   museum,"
so    the journal     remarks,      "than in governing                 a   kingdom."
On reaching Paris, Murchison                 learned that his wife was              ill
at Tours, to which place            he at once continued his journey.
It    was    the    old Eoman        fever    which         had prostrated        her.
Already convalescent            when her husband arrived,                    she was
soon able to be moved to Paris, where                     a   stay of some weeks
was made.
      While at St. Petersburg Murchison had been in com
munication         with   Count      Nesselrode           and other dignitaries
there regarding       a   proposed    appointment to some post in the
Eussian service, the apparent                object being to secure such               a
title and position in that service               as       would obviate official
objections at home             to   the   use     of the         Eussian       orders.
Eumours of this project had reached London, and of course
soon grew into an              exaggerated      story, which           in due time
found its way to Murchison.   Writing from Paris to Mr.
John Murray, he remarks, "  cannot imagine what can have
                                     I
put   it   into any one's head (except that Lockhart                    is   fond of   a
joke) that   I     had been named     a   general         in the Russian service       !
At first   I   thought nothing of the slip of your pen, because                     it
struck me that in         a   multitude of letters you might have had
one for     a   general   officer on your table             ;   but, meeting with
Mr. H. Ellis here,     I      found, to my very great annoyance                   and
regret, that this nonsense had been             a     topic of talk in London          !
It   never was      in contemplation to make me                   a    military man
again   ;   all that was designed on the part of my friends in
Eussia was to have accorded to me                 a       scientific post in per

fore he left Paris, however, he received           intimation   that the
project had been carried out, though in a somewhat different
form.       He was appointed by the Emperor of Eussia an
" Effective
                 Member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences,
 with all the rights, privileges, and rank attached               to that
 office   in the Imperial service."1       Shortly afterwards he was
gazetted      in London    as  having the Queen's privilege to wear
 the Russian orders.
       The sojourn at Paris formed a pleasant interlude be
 tween the field-work        in Scandinavia and the ordeal of feast
 ing which, unknown to himself, was then in store for Mur-
 chison in London.          He presented himself for the first time
 to the Academy of Sciences since his election.              He likewise
 appeared       at the Geological Society of France, and being
 now brimful of ice-work from his recent Swedish and Baltic
 experiences,      was put up by his friends there to give his
                                                                     "
 opinion.        For the battle of " Glaciers versus Icebergs was
 then being fought out in Paris       as well  as elsewhere.    Durocher
 claimed him       as a friend of the forlorn iceberg      ; Martins   as a
 partisan of the glacier.       He found that the contest grew warm
 in spite of the subject, and that the majority of the French,
 as    might have been predicted from their greater proximity
 to the Alps and          Pyrenees, were glacier men.            Nothing
  daunted,     however,    he stuck to his de'bacles and ice-floes.
  He remained indeed true to this his early creed for many

years afterwards,    until the advance of opinion caused him at
last to concede      a sort of divided       empire to bergs       and
glaciers.
     Mrs. Murchison      had recruited in Paris, and could be
moved to England       just in time for Christmas.       Once more
in London, and turning to the work that lay before him,
Murchison found two tasks awaiting him, one the narrative

ice-work    and   Silurian   rocks of the north, the other the
preparation of his address for the British Association,          for
tunately for him neither of these labours was very pressing,
nor,   as he  performed them, very arduous.             For he had
hardly got well settled       down at home when he received
the following announcement,        which had been communicated
to his old friend and instructor at Oxford      : —
                                     " WHITEHALL,  February 5, 1846.
     " MY DEAR DOCTOR                     — You will
                             BUCKLAND,                   be glad     to
hear that yesterday,      on our own spontaneous        idea of Mr.
Murchison's     claims to a mark of favour from his own
Sovereign,   Sir James Graham, with my entire concurrence,
wrote to the Queen, advising Her Majesty to confer                  the
honour of knighthood on Mr. Murchison at the first leve"e.
     " The value of the distinction will
                                               be that it was un
solicited and unprompted, and           that it is intended      as    a
recognition by the Queen of Mr. Murchison's              services    in
the great cause of science        and human knowledge. — Most
truly yours,                                      ROBERT PEEL."
     The proposal,    as  gratifying   as  it was felicitously      ex
pressed   and  wholly unexpected,       Murchison    accepted, amid
the warm congratulations of his friends and associates.               It

 was     the   second   instance     of the kind which had recently
occurred      (Sir Henry De la Beche's knighthood having been
the first) to show that the valuable geological work done                in
 this country       and abroad        by British geologists      was   not
wholly unknown and unrecognised                by their own Govern
ment.        One   immediate effect of the accession           of dignity
 was to call out a vigorous display of a truly            English mode
of showing sympathy and goodwill                  Murchison      was    in
undated       with   invitations     to dinner, not only from his old
friends, but from       a host    of new ones.   Not much continuous
mental work could therefore be expected from him for some
time after the 5th of February.              But by the beginning of
April     he had been able to prepare his account of the Scan
dinavian icebergs for the Geological Society, and two months
later he presented a memoir upon the Silurian rocks, in this
way relieving his well-kept journals of all their voluminous
details, which now passed into the Quarterly Journal.1
       The meetings      of this Society remained        pleasant,   often
amusing,      and even exciting.        The older heroes had not yet
departed, while a younger race, sometimes of great vigour,
had gathered round them.             The " cuffing of opinions," which
had been an early trait among the geologists,            still continued
to draw to their evening meetings               a good   many listeners
who had no special geological            bent, but who enjoyed good
humour and wit.            Leonard Horner filled at this time the
President's chair, contributing no scientific renown               to the

Society,   but guiding its affairs    with singular sagacity and
foresight.    Under     his sway the ponderous      quarto Trans
actions,   which    few hut   professed  geologists  ever thought
of buying or reading, and which from their costliness        could
only appear at wide intervals, to the detriment alike of the
science and    of the authors of the papers, gave place to the
present Quarterly Journal, a convenient and regularly pub
lished record of the communications made to the Society.
During his Presidency, also, while younger palaeontologists
were rising into eminence by their work among the fossils of
the earliest formations — Forbes, Morris,        Davidson, Salter,
M'Coy, and others — a graceful act of recognition came from
the Society to one of the older school, who, in enfeebled
health, had quitted its service       to seek rest in retirement.
The gentle      and   ever helpful Lonsdale received     this year
(1846) the Wollaston       medal,  the highest honour   in the gift
of the Society.
     Among those who kept up the old spirit in the gather
ings at Somerset       House, none came more welcomed         than
Sedgwick.      For several years past he had appeared more
frequently    as an    author of papers than he had done for
some time previously       ; and a paper by Sedgwick was sure
to bring a     full meeting.    His subject had been the slates
and older rocks of North Wales and Cumberland, a subject
peculiarly his own, but on which other writers had recently
put forth different opinions.         As these papers     have   an
intimate relation to Murchison's position, let us turn for a
few moments to what the Woodwardian           Professor had been
doing in regard to his former Welsh work, the true mean
ing and value of which had been perhaps somewhat obscured
by the more recent observations         of Bowman, Sharpe, and

IM&]     SEDQWICK'S LABOURS                     IN CAMBRIA.               57
the Geological Survey,      as well   as   by those of Murchison.        He
felt and expressed at the time, in letters to the latter friend,
that  it was absurd to theorize about the structure of a great
region, such as that of     North Wales, merely from one or two
small sections, and this was what he thought had been done
both by Bowman and Sharpe               ;  still he felt that    a renewed
examination of the ground would                 be    of advantage   to his
views, and accordingly he had spent a portion of the autumns
of 1842 and 1843 in North Wales, in the hope, as he wrote
to Murchison,     that he might succeed in showing,                by fossil
evidence,   that there existed in his older or Cambrian rocks
a type of life     different from that in Murchison's Silurian
series.    But, as we have seen,1 he            had failed in that part
of his quest.     He could not find, any more than other ob
servers, a geological   line of division between Cambria and
Siluria.    He succeeded, however, in establishing one or two
important facts in palaeozoic geology.
    For the first time,       so  far     as  appears, he showed        that
the so-called Upper Silurian          rocks of Murchison         over wide
tracts of country, do not graduate downwards,                 as the  latter
geologist   had represented, into the Lower Silurian, but rest
upon them in what is called an unconformable succession.
In other    words,   he proved that after the               Lower Silurian
rocks had been       deposited,     a long period of time elapsed,
during which they were upheaved                and exposed to waste at
the   surface   before    the    Upper       Silurian     formations were
laid down upon them.             He maintained also, that hardly
any of the species which lived during the older period sur
vived these great changes of physical geography,                   so as to
re-appear in the Upper Silurian waters.                     Hence he now

regarded     the older fossiliferous rocks of Wales as divisible
into two great groups          : — 1st, A vast lower      series embracing
the so-called     Cambrian and Lower              Silurian rocks, which
he    believed   to   be geologically       united, and to which he
gave     the   name     of the Protozoic group          ;  2d,   An upper
series resting over wide districts, upon the upturned edges
of the Lower, and embracing the Upper Silurian formations
of Murchison       up to the base of the Old Red Sandstone.
While tracing out the boundaries between these groups, he
had given renewed attention to the relics of ancient volcanic
action in North Wales, and again clearly recognised                   that
 some of the igneous masses there had been ejected contem
poraneously with the deposition of the aqueous rocks among
which they lie, while others had been thrust subsequently
into cracks of the overlying formations.1
      With these views       as to the vague     boundary-line between
Cambria and Siluria, Sedgwick does not seem for some time
to have had any solicitude          as to the  ultimate decision of the
question.       He had      made     the rocks of North Wales            so
thoroughly his own, by years of successful toil, that the idea
of relinquishing his hold upon them and regarding them                   as
forming part of the domain which had been rightfully con
quered by another,        had probably never been seriously         in his
 mind.     So far from looking upon the final determination of
 the   boundary-line      as    likely to curtail his dominions, he
 seems to have contemplated             the fusion of his own empire
 with more than half of Murchison's into one great whole,
 leaving only the upper and minor part of Siluria to retain
 its distinctive name.        And when, on further examination, he
 found additional proofs of the significance              of the great dis-

 which had been missed                 by Murchison, he felt justified in
  after years in drawing the line between Cambria and Siluria
 where,       as   it seemed to him, nature had drawn it by that
 break in the succession, claiming                as   Cambrian the whole of
 his own series and all the Lower                      Silurian     rocks of his

        That the Cambrian system should have an upward exten
 sion instead of the Silurian system having a downward one,
 had been surmised by at least one geologist besides Sedgwick.
 The idea was broached by Phillips in                   a note to      Murchison,
 who,      in alluding to it in his reply, remarked,             " I  cannot read
 the paragraph which follows in your note without being hurt
 by the possibility to which you allude of the Cambrian going
 up to the Wenlock Shale.                As a matter of fact, unquestion
 ably it     does.     But what is Cambrian          ?  Why,     as  De la Beche
 has shown           in South Wales, nothing but Lower Silurian.
 Now, bear in mind, that my two clear and distinct types,
 Upper and Lower Silurian, were proposed to geologists, and,
 being laid before them, they were asked to                    see   how far the
 lower type would go down.                 This is repeatedly put to them
 in my book."
J       The point in dispute must seem to outsiders to have been
 but     a  petty one.      After all, it was merely whether one name
 or another should           be  given to a certain series of rocks upon
 which both of the geologists                 had been       simultaneously at
 work.         Had Sedgwick continued his researches to their
 proper development,            had he taken the trouble to have his
 collections of fossils examined and named instead of allowing
 them       to remain for years          in their packing-cases,          had he,

by fossil evidence         as well  as   by physical structure, shown
the distinctiveness of his rocks and their passage into any
other known geological            formation, he would have estab
lished a good title to all that he afterwards                 claimed.       He
did not do this.         All  the while, however,         Murchison, with
less brilliancy and power, but with more industry and per
severance, was toiling to effect            it among what were at the
time supposed to be other rocks, but which proved in the
 end to be in great measure the very same as those of Sedg-
 wick.      He succeeded in determining their order, and showed
 their relations to the next succeeding                geological    deposits.
 He maintained that he had discovered                   a distinct     type of
 life, — what he had termed the earliest or Protozoic type.
 He had given it a name — Silurian                   ;   and    he   naturally
 refused     to alter his classification         until it could be shown
 that he had included more zoological types                     than one, or
 that some still earlier type had preceded what he had sup
 posed to be the earliest.
        The question, in whatever way            it might   be settled,   in no
 way affected the title of either claimant to the honour which
 he had well earned.            As yet, indeed, they had not become
 disputants.        It is remarkable      that neither at this time, nor
  for nearly a dozen of years later, did they come to open
  rupture.1     This postponement         of the disagreement         must be
     1 There seems to have been some danger of a rupture in the summer
  of 1846.    Sedgwick had written a paper upon the geology of Cumber
  land, in which, without avowedly attacking Murchison' s classification of
  the older rocks, he indirectly opposed it. He speaks of the erroneous sec
  tions, by which the position of the Llandeilo flags had been incorrectly
  fixed, places these flags in the same general line with the Caradoc beds,
  and proposes a threefold division of the older fossiliferous rocks, viz. : —
   1st, Cambrian, including the oldest fossiliferous rocks ; 2d, Middle group of
   Lower Silurian, including Llandeilo, Caradoc, and perhaps Wenlock ; 3d,

mainly attributed to Sedgwick.                   Though naturally sensitive
and impatient of the interference of others                      in his geological
domain (he had once angrily resented a supposed                            interfer
ence of Murchison),             he somehow          failed to perceive, or at
least    openly to oppose, what must needs be the issue of
his friend's       strong      contention       as   to the absence of any
zoological significance for the so-called Cambrian                            series.
brought from the author of the Silurian System a letter to Sedgwick, in
which the following sentences occur: —            "I   did not read your memoir
until about a month ago, when my attention was called to it both by
letters from Elie de Beaumont and by a visit from De Verneuil.                   I at
once saw either that I must defend the position taken up in the opening
chapters of the work on Russia          ...  or allow geologists to think that the
shot you have fired in the eleventh hour was effective in breaking up all
my entrenchments.         If we had fully co-operated as coadjutors to pro
duce one wort in Wales and the adjacent parts of England as in the Alps
and Scotland, there is every probability that when we found (as we must
soon have done)      that you had no fossil type essentially differing from
the Lower Silurian, the whole of that stage might have been merged in
the term Cambrian.       ...    I  can see no shade of a reason for changing my
classification of Upper and Lower.            The very limits between them          I
would select to-morrow       if  I  had to begin afresh.    ...   I shall express in
public,  as  strongly  as I do  in  private, my  real grief  in being compelled, for
the first time in our career, to hold any material geological opinion at
variance with your own, and shall announce that if you could produce
                                 I
a group of peculiar fossils, would at once subscribe to your views. . . .
Be assured that nothing of late years has annoyed me so seriously as
to be compelled to make this defence of the views which I have elabo
rately worked out, and the classification which             I  had established after
much toil and travel."
     The paper which called forth this protest was a continuation of one
which Sedgwick had communicated to the Society in March 184S, and of
which an abstract was given in the 4th vol. of the Proceedings, p. 576.             I
did not mean to refer, even in a footnote, to any writings on the difference
between Sedgwick and Murchison, save those of the two disputants them
selves.   I am sorry to be compelled to depart from this intention by the
reprint of the following passage (from an essay published in 1872) in Dr.
Sterry Hunt's recent volume of Chemical and Geological Essays (1875).
Referring to Sedgwick's paper of March 1845, that writer observes :
" That this abstract is made by another than the author is evident from
such an expression as — ' the author's opinion seems to be grounded on the
following facts,' etc. (p. 448), and from the manner in which the terms
Lower and Upper Silurian            are applied to certain fossiliferous     rocks in

   Gifted with       uncommon        vigour of mind         and   of body, he
   roused up at intervals to great exertion, and accomplished
  in a brief space geological            feats which would have taken
  other men a long while painfully to achieva                  But these rare
  powers were retarded          by a lethargy, under which he passed
  long intervals of quiescence,           — intervals      in which he was
  probably busy enough             with college      and other work, but
  Cumberland.      Yet the words of this abstract are quoted with emphasis
               '
  in ' Siluria (1st edit. 147), as if they were Sedgwick's own language re
  cognising Murchisou's Silurian nomenclature."         To this passage the fol
  lowing footnote is added in the reprint :
                                               " A letter to the author, written
  him by the late Professor Sedgwick after reading the above, confirms the
  opinion here expressed.    The abstract in question was furnished by Mur-
  chison himself to the Geological Society, the secretary of which declined
 to receive the abstract offered by Sedgwick of his own paper."
      If this last statement was made by the venerable Wood wardian Pro
  fessor, it may be charitably attributed to the failing memory of age,
 aggravated by bitter feelings, which were only too likely to distort the
 recollections of the past.     That it is as utterly untrue as it is odious, is
 proved by the very style of the abstract itself, which is unequivocally
 Sedgwick's.      No two styles could be more readily distinguished than his
 and Murchison's.       The expression which Dr. Hunt quotes occurs as a
footnote,    and was evidently added by the secretary or editor by way of
 explaining what was not very clearly put in the abstract. The terms
 " Lower " and " Upper Silurian " are applied in the abstract to fossili-
 ferous formations in Cumberland, which the Professor himself showed by
fossil evidence to correspond with what had been called " Lower and
                                                                          "
" Upper Silurian " formations in Wales. The expression, " the lower or
 Protozoic system," occurs at the end of the abstract as a designation for
rocks older than and supposed to be marked off by fossil characters from
those of the Upper Silurian formations.        This use of it was characteristi
cally Sedgwick's (see Proc. GeoL Soc., iv. 223, and ante, p. 58), and would
have been at once objected to by Murchison, seeing that it struck at the
very base of his fundamental doctrine of the unity of his Silurian system.
I   feel that some apology may be required of me for even alluding to such
a charge against a man who from first to last was at least a high-souled,
honourable gentleman. Had the imputation remained as it stood in the
original essay I should not have deemed it worthy of notice.         The subse
quent introduction, however, of the authority of Sedgwick, who too was
a man of scrupulous honour, seems to demand that Murchison's bio
grapher should indignantly repel a charge which no one would have dared
to make while the old lion was alive.

when his real or supposed ailments left him no energy for
original geological     labour.     Perhaps it was partly this pro
crastinating temperament,         and partly a naturally       generous
disposition which kept him         so  long from taking umbrage at
Murchison.        In following     the   events    of the next ten or
twelve years, however, we must bear in mind that at any
moment the peace might have been broken.
       From this digression     we return to Murchison's        work in
the summer       of 1846.     After visits to friends in different
parts of England, and among other places to Durham, where
 he    revived his recollections of the Grammar              School, the
 foul drain, the cathedral pinnacles, and the mill-girls or
 " cotton dollies," as the
                              boys used to call them, he repaired
 to London to gather together there            as  many of the foreign
 savans     as   had   accepted      his invitation     to  attend   the
 Association meeting.        Oersted and Forchhammer came from
 Denmark, Eetzius from Sweden, Schonbein from Switzer
 land, and Matteucci from Italy.
       Not being quite sure whether the Southampton of those
 days would furnish a large           audience to orators in science,
 he    had   taken   some    trouble     to   give the    meeting   more
 popular prestige by securing several leading public men               as
 Vice-Presidents,     including     the Duke      of Wellington,    Lord
  Palmerston, and      Mr. Lefevre,       the   Speaker,   besides  such
  prominent names      as those   of Herschel and WhewelL           As a
  cunning piece of strategy, he induced Sir James Clark to ask
  Prince Albert to attend, which the Prince very willingly did,
  not only coming to the President's address, but attending
  next        at the different Sections.       " It diverted me much,"
         day
  Murchison writes, " to      see  how utterly ignorant the Prince's
  equerries    were of all that they saw          and  heard,   and how

  the Prince examined    them.    I  was struck   with his mathe
  matical knowledge,    for on quitting      Section A, at which
  Whewell,   who presided,     gave   a demonstration of a new
 theorem,   his Royal Highness explained what it meant to
 his gaping attendants     as we   drove   away to another room.
 It  was indeed the misfortune of this sensible and gifted man
 to be surrounded by persons         (as  Humboldt    foresaw    long
 before) who were so inferior to himself."
      The British Association was now fifteen years old.            It
 had come through its infancy       so  well, that there could be
 no doubt of its vigorous growth.        Nevertheless, some of its
 early detractors continued their opposition, to which piquancy
 was given by the various ways        in which derision and con
 tempt could be expressed.      Among these persistent enemies,
 the most conspicuous     and formidable was the Times        news
 paper, which had followed the Association         with the most
 uncompromising hostility, refusing at last to print the lucu
brations of the philosophers unless inserted         as   advertise
ments, but continuing its sneering paragraphs or contemptuous
articles.   Some of the maligned body felt this keenly.         They
could not realize that they had really a ludicrous side       ;  that
their feasting   and holiday-making,       their frequent mutual
laudation, and, above all, the opening which their meetings
afforded for any hobby-rider to air his crotchets, were features
which could not but strike the non-scientific outsider, who,
if he  could not appreciate the science, might not unnaturally
form but a poor estimate of the usefulness of the Association.
No one of the members winced more under these attacks
than Murchison.      Once or twice, indeed, he had written to
an editor either to protest against    the spirit  of his remarks,
or to correct   some error   in a statement of fact.     Somehow

the Southampton           meeting       had evoked a renewed outburst of
 criticism on the part of the Times.                  "
                                                        Notwithstanding all
my efforts and those of my associates," Murchison remarks
 in his journal, " the meeting was held up to ridicule in the
 Times.     But     I was nothing cowed, and, at the public dinner
 at Southampton,          I declaimed        against  such ribald vulgarity
 and ignorance,         saying     I   was ashamed my eminent         foreign
 friends should go away with the impression that the Times
in its vituperation of science represented my country, and                   I
vehemently         declared that tempora mutabuntur.             Afterwards,
 when visiting at Broadlands,                 I was    complaining to Lord
                                                              '

said he,       never mind them           ;  a man   who is not Times-proof
                                  "
cannot succeed         in life.'
      Middendorf, the Siberian explorer, who had attended the
Association meeting, went with the President to Broadlands,
and naturally          a good deal         of the conversation    turned on
                                     "
geographical         subjects.         Though Palmerston was Foreign
Minister,       the house       did not abound          in maps   of distant
countries,       and when      it was desired that Middendorf should
give the party some account of his ultra-Siberian                     travels,
no map could be appealed to except an old                  D'Anville, which
Lady Palmerston brought down from                    a bed-room."
     Another house visited at that time was Embly, the seat
of    Mr.   Nightingale,         father     of the now well-known and
                                 Florence Nightingale.        " Wheatstone

required,      and peering        into the faces of all the women, he
selected Florence as his accomplice,                 and, having taken her

formed the trick.         On talking to my friend about the talent
of the girl, he said,      '

I  could go about to fairs with her and pick up                 a deal  of
money.'"
     Before returning to London, Murchison extended his visit
as  far   as  The Lizard.       On the way back he halted at Bath
to see his old friend and coadjutor,            the late curator at the

that he is little more than an anatomie vivante.              He assured
me that     it had cost him three weeks to convince himself that
the Stromatopora        polymorpha was a true species.         He admits

firmly to my Lower Silurian, and no one will abandon me,
my   case    being based on plain reason."
     With the close of the year 1846 we reach a well-marked
point in Murchison's         career.     He had for some years previ
ously been working with great energy, and at last he had
enjoyed      the satisfaction of launching the narrative of that
work in the Russia and Ural Mountains.                    The success of
his labours in science, and the great value of his services to
the British Association, had been recognised by his elevation
to the President's chair,           and he had      been honoured    by a
special mark of favour from his own Sovereign.                He seemed

to have gained all that in such a career as his was possible,
and he might well have been excused had he determined
thenceforth to be content   with the laurels he had already
won.    But his activity would not allow him any such
retirement.

                      CHAPTER XIX.
      A WINTER IN ROME, AND TWO SUMMERS      IN THE  ALPS.
    IN the early summer       of 1847, when the end of the
sessions of the Geological and other Societies was approach
ing, Murchison began seriously to cast about for fresh fields
and pastures new.     A  trip to Cambridge, to visit Whewell,
and see the fossil treasures    of the Woodwardian museum,
then recently arranged by M'Coy, under Sedgwick's super
vision, suggested no new outlet for him in British geology.
Subsequently,   during a short stay in Paris, where among his
old scientific friends he met the veteran Von Buch, it was
agreed that he should make       one of a party to attend    the
ensuing meeting of the Scienziati Italiani at Venice, and to
do some   Alpine geology by the way.     Out of this proposal
there gradually grew a much more extensive        plan.    Lady
Murchison had not been very well since her fever at Tours.
For her sake   a change of scene seemed eminently desirable,
and thus   in the end it was resolved to let the house in
 Belgrave Square, and go abroad for a year or more.           In
 accordance with the geological part of the plan, the eastern
 Alps would first be visited ori the way to Venice.     Then   a

 1347.]       BRITISH ASSOCIATION BORES.                              69
leisurely journey would be made southwards to Eome. there
to winter.      Next spring might take the travellers to Naples,
and lastly, the succeeding         summer,    if all went well with
them,      would he spent among the central Alps.                Thirty
years had passed since that early art tour which Murchison
and his wife,        in their younger days, had taken through
 Italy.    In  repeating   it once more they carried with them a
 new source of enjoyment.          In the cities geological museums
 would now claim,        and would no doubt receive,          as   much
attention     as   the  art-galleries used to do      ; while in the
 country, admiration of picturesque        scenery or venerable     ruin
would be mingled with observation of the rocks and their
fossils.
        The start, however, could not be taken until after the
beginning of      July, for  the President of the    British Associa
tion at Southampton required to attend               the  meeting      at
Oxford, and there resign the chair to his successor in office.
If   we may judge from his           own note-books,     this Oxford
meeting seems to have brought out, rather disagreeably,              one
of the points of contrast          between    the  gatherings     of the
British Association         and   corresponding     meetings    abroad.
With all the sections sitting simultaneously, and for some
four or five hours      a day,  it is  often difficult, or quite im
possible,    to hear more than one or two papers             out of a
number which may have been marked out for special atten
tion by the enthusiastic member.               And if this member
chances     to be an office-bearer      in one of the sections, his
sense of duty may keep him sitting there, listening, perhaps,
to one of the dreary bores who annually inflict their tedious-
ness on the Association, instead of finding his way to one or
more of the other sections to hear the announcement              of new

facts   in which he is perhaps specially interested, and regard
ing which, it may        be, he  could himself speak a few effective
and welcome words.           Murchison notes his disgust       at these
inflictions, and would appear to have found some relief from
them in " ordinaries at the Star," " dinners with the dons of
Christchurch," "breakfasts in Canon Eow," — in short, his
general impression of the best business of the meeting seems
to have been pretty much the same as Aguecheek's definition
of life, that " it rather consisted of eating and drinking."
     After the close of the meeting             there  still remained
another     ceremonial     before the migration to the       Continent
could be accomplished.
                               "
                                 Early in July," he says,    I
                                                            " went to
visit my dear friend George Peacock, Dean of Ely, and met
a delightful     party, including the       Bucklands, Lord North
ampton,    Willis,  etc., and thence we    all proceeded to the Cam
bridge    installation, on which day      I  was admitted by Prince
Albert, in presence of the Queen, to be an honorary M.A.
S — and       I  were    to have    received   the  honour of LL.D.,
and our red gowns were ordered, but the caput of the Senate
found out that, being neither Lords nor Privy Councillors,
we could not have that distinction.              S — , who was very
proud,     was   mightily     chagrined;    but   I consoled   him by
begging     him to look at Herschel, Whewell, Sedgwick, and
all the clever fellows who, like us, only wore black gowns
as  Masters of Art.
      " At the                             Her Majesty in the Lodge,
                 evening reception by
I  presented Struve to her.        Whilst walking across the quad
rangle of    Trinity, Leverrier on one arm, and Struve on the
other, we saw the Duke of Wellington coming towards us                in
his red gown, and        I at once said to the two great astrono
mers,    'Now, gentlemen, here is the opportunity.'              Struve

 was    overjoyed,     saying   it was the     thing of all others he
 wished    ;  but Leverrier turned on his heel and left us, saying,
 '
   Pardonnez, c'est plus fort que moi ; je suis Francais." "
       After these detentions        and a hurried     preparation   in
 London, Murchison started for the Continent.            His wife had
 already preceded him, and had been awaiting him for some
 time at Homburg, where he himself arrived on the 12th of
 July.       As usual, he made full entries in his journal, espe
 cially of all objects of geological interest met with in the
tour.      Nearly a month was taken up in getting to Venice,
for the route chosen lay through Bohemia to Vienna, and
 then in a series of zigzags, to and fro, across the eastern
Alps, to      see geological   sections.    The copious details in the
journals regarding         Alpine geology were partly made use of
in the great memoir on the structure of the Alps, to be after
wards referred to.         From the other memoranda some glean
ings of more general interest        will be taken.
       Between Murchison and his friend De Verneuil              there
had grown        up  a sincere   and warm attachment,     which, tried
under many different conditions, had only grown firmer with
each succeeding        year of intercourse.      They were now again
fellow-travellers.        Von Keyserling, too, had quitted Russian
soil this summer.           He joined      his former  companions   at
Olmiitz, and there the old triumvirate of the Urals met once
more.       With Barrande and his wonderful collections from
the Silurian rocks of Bohemia, they had, of course, much to
talk about and to       see  in the few days spent in his company.
      The first entry in the journal after the arrival in Vienna
is as follows : — " After seventeen years' absence everything
here seems       in statu  quo, except   railroads and steam naviga
tion, both, however, great changes for the heavy Austrians.

Trieste.       My object      was to    visit my old antagonist but
good friend, Dr.         Ami    Boue",  who after a very ubiquitous
and active      life, and having done his best to illustrate the
geology of Europe from the Highlands of Scotland to Turkey
in Europe, is now living a secluded life in this spot."
      When the development             of geology in Europe is to        be
traced, the story of the life of this zealous follower of the
 science    will be found to form one of its not least interest
 ing features.         Originally   of French extraction, his family
 had settled       in Hamburg, where he himself was born in
  1794.      During his boyhood         and youth, when the French
 armies had overrun Europe, there appeared              to be good rea
 son to fear that in the commotion of the times his little
 patrimony might be swept away.                 His guardians accord
 ingly resolved that he should have           a profession    to fall back
 upon in     case   of need, and that of medicine was chosen.            In
 pursuance      of this plan he came to Edinburgh                with good
 introductions, studied          there   under Jameson         and   Hope,

and took his degree in medicine      in the year 1816.       By that
time, however, the      war- clouds had dispersed.       It  was no
longer needful that he should contemplate           the possibility
of having to live by his profession.       He had taken     a special
liking to geological pursuits, and under Jameson's guidance
had acquired considerable knowledge of these subjects.            His
summer holidays were spent in long rambles over the moors
and mountains of Scotland, and in a few years he wrote and
published   in French his Essai        Geologique sur TlZcosse, a
work full of accurate observations, and in several respects
much in advance of its time.        Subsequent    wanderings took
the intrepid geologist over      a great  part of the Continent,
and through some of its most unfrequented paths.             He was
the earliest pioneer who made known the geological             struc
ture of Turkey.      His zeal led him to undergo          privations
of no common        kind, and many a time to risk his life.
Once he was poisoned and reduced to         a state of prostration,
from which only a constitution of iron could have restored
him.    Meanwhile, his pen had been       as active as his hammer.
Besides several separate volumes, including a valuable guide
to   the geological   traveller, he    had   written   upwards      of
eighty papers in different scientific journals on many various
branches of geological    inquiry.    We have already seen that
he had entered the lists with Sedgwick and Murchison in
regard to the structure of the Alps.          It was true that he
had now retired from active field-work.            But his activity
in other ways, and especially with the pen, remained unim
paired.

had planted over the steep slope of one of the last spurs of
the  Alps  ; keeping yet fresh his interest in the progress of
geology, and well acquainted       with its contemporary        litera
ture  ; full of reminiscence of an older time, and showing a
marvellous memory for even the minutest details of places
he had not seen since his early student         days  ;  pleased, too,
to use again that knowledge of the English tongue which
he had gained     sixty years before, and to find that his work
in Scotland was gratefully remembered by those who had
come after him.      Long letters, written without spectacles in
an almost     microscopic   handwriting, continue       to carry his
friendly sympathy and pleasant gossip to far distant lands,
and serve still    as a visible link to bind the present genera
tion with     one   of the early and almost        extinct race of
geological pioneers.     Floreat in pace  !
    From Dr.     Boue" and    his pleasant    gardens     overlooking
the broad plains of the Leitha, Murchison and De             Verneuil
turned southward to strike into the Styrian Alps — that old
geological   hunting-ground where Murchison and Sedgwick
had worked so hard.       Eailroads had not yet crossed or pierced
the  Alpine chain.     Each pass had to be toilfully climbed,
and thus for those who had eyes for them, the rocks, flowers,
and scenery     could be looked at leisurely,        so   as  to fix a
lasting impression in the mind.         But now the Semmering,
the Brenner, and      Mont Cenis can be traversed easily asleep,
doubtless with much accession of physical comfort, but             with
the loss of some emotions, for which such comfort            is but a
poor exchange.       In their  ascent of the Semmering        our two
travellers had time to look at     a cutting then being made on
 the road, and to note its geological      interest,  to sketch      the
 outlines of the dolomite peaks, and cutting off on foot the

  zigzags     of the road to enjoy the cool fresh morning air of
  the mountains,       yet  to reach the summit long before the
 coachman and his panting horses.             In  the course of such
 pedestrian feats in advance of Diligence or hired carriage,
 much excellent work has been done in Alpine geology.
       After   so  long an interval, and after  so intense a devotion
 to the older rocks, it was pleasant to get back once more to
the Secondary and Tertiary strata of the Alps. Murchi-
 son led his companion          over   the Styrian mountains into
the      Emms Thal, and then         across to the    deep mountain-
girdled lake of Hallstadt, with its village clinging to the
cliffs.      Of course he could not avoid crossing once again to
Gosau, regarding whose rocks he now felt inclined to admit
that Sedgwick and he had in some measure been mistaken.
And thus revisiting old haunts with                more    experienced
eyes,      and passing    again  through mountain scenery which
every succeeding        visit can only make more wonderful and
impressive,       he reached    Innspruck,    there   to rejoin   Lady
Murchison, and to meet Von Buch, with whom it was agreed
to    see   some more     Alpine geology on the way together to
Venice.
       Leopold von Buch has been already frequently men
tioned in the course of this narrative.          Murchison had met
him often at Berlin, had been some time in his company on
the occasion        of the Scandinavian meeting described in a
former chapter, and had for several years been in frequent
correspondence        with him.       He had formed      a  very high
 estimate of      Von Buch's powers, of his stubborn energy, and
of the almost youthful freshness of his faculties in spite of
 the     passing   over him of more than threescore         years and
 ten.     He had now occasion during their excursions          on foot,

 sometimes       in rough weather and            still rougher wilds, to
learn more personally of him.                The notes in Murchison's
journal give us the picture of            a man   of extreme determina
tion, great perseverance, and           a contempt     for physical priva
tion, which furnish a good illustration                of the indomitable
 spirit which carried        Von Buch to the head of geological
 science    in Germany.1

         Seeing that at Von Buch's slow pace we could not
 reach St. Cassian        until far in the night,        I walked on in a
heavy drenching rain to beat up the Cure" of St. Cassian and
get the supper ready.          . .  .  Von Buch has just arrived wet
    1 Professor Ramsay furnishes the following note : — " Von Buch was at
the Cambridge British Association Meeting (1845). At Murchison's request
I took him there on the outside of the mail-coach from the head of the
Haymarket.       His luggage always consisted only of a small baize bag,
which held a clean shirt and clean silk stockings. He wore knee-breeches
and shoes.     Peter Merian, I think, told me that Von Buch in his old age
once started in the afternoon alone from Zermatt to walk over the
Matter Joch (Mont Cervin Pass).          They did everything they could to
dissuade him, for there is a glacier-pass to cross, but go he would.
Sometimes people have been lost there in crevasses, and though I crossed
it easily with my wife, yet for an old man to go in the afternoon, and
alone too,    was certainly hazardous.     So they sent a couple of guides up
after him, who avoided him, and passed him by, keeping away from the
path, out of his sight. Going on a good way they turned back, and walk
ing down the path, met him, and told him that they had been up to cross
the glacier Breuil on the Italian side, that snow had fallen, and that the
glacier was quite impassable.      So he turned, and went back to Zermatt,
much against his will.      I met him last in 1852 with Merian at Turt-
man in the Rhone valley. He was then quite unaltered, and just as
 Murchison describes him. By that time Sir H. de la Beche was very ill,
and unable to walk. Von Bnch asked much of him, and said impressively,
 ' II faut bien conserver M. De la Beche.'      Of all the English geologists
 I  am sure he respected  De la Beche most."

         Sept. 3. — We had not gone far on our road to        Brunecken,
distant twelve leagues, and with         a fine panorama     of dolomites
around us, when         it was evident that M.     de  Buch could never
accomplish       half that distance.      He seemed to De Verneuil
and myself to be staggering,            and every     now and then he
sat down on a block of stone.                He would, however, hear
no reason      ;  said he had often such megrims          in the streets
of Berlin, and would persist.            At  a snail's pace, and after a
hundred halts,         passing   through some Alpine villages,          he
allowed that he was fairly beaten, and at last accepted my
proposal      to walk     on fast to Brunecken, and bring or send
back a light caleche to the point to which a practicable
road came.          So   I  stepped   out once more, passing       by the
hills on one side of St. Leonhard, with the best of the
dolomite peaks on the other.

any aid from De Verneuil or self, though                a  little drop of
my Kirschwasser            seemed to do him good.          But what he

   at the last Wirthshaus        before we came over the Colfosco
   Alp, he was on foot till six o'clock in the evening, having
  been from mid-day more or less           in the rain, and the last
  three hours a drenching one, without an umbrella.               Arrived
  at the priest's    house, the old man       in his dripping clothes
  (angry with us     if  we alluded to his state, his hands, which        I
 touched, being icy cold), actually sat for two hours, fortunately
  in the hot   stube  of the priest, the thermometer        outside being
 nearly at freezing point.          He joked, told stories, ate     a good
  dinner, and was up at five o'clock         next morning, ready to
 start   in his still moist and damp garments.                 Hear this,

 was    grateful   for the carriage the last two miles.                But
 since his arrival he has        quite rallied    ;   has eaten a capital
 supper    of soup, forellen, ham,         and pancake,       and is now
 in bed, not, however,           before   he    told    us  several   good
jokes.

 unconquerable       spirit   and his play of soul            During his

creed of the great pioneer           of Alpine research, he wrote in
the book of the      little inn on Mount St. Gothard :—
                     " 0  Sancte De Saussure

Murchison thought himself a true and thorough                    disciple of
the school       that preached the doctrine of convulsion and
cataclysm      as the   origin of the present       irregularities of the
earth's surface.        Even now amidst what are everywhere                at
the present       day admitted to be relics of vanished             glaciers,
and    with the far gleam of the existing glaciers within sight,
he stuck sturdily to the creed which even the Scandinavian
evidence      had not shaken.          "  I continue in my old belief,
because     I  see  nothing in the valleys which can be legiti
mately assigned to glacier action."               In  short,   in the vast
masses of moraine-rubbish and scattered boulders, he recog
nised traces only of the powerful torrents              set   in motion by
such convulsions as those whereby he supposed                     the chain
of the Alps to have been upheaved.                 But in Von Buch he
found a far more thorough-going disciple of convulsion than
himself, — one whose views were too strong even for him !
He writes : — " When Von Buch says that the granite blocks
on the tops of the           Jura were       shot  across    the valley of
Geneva      like cannon-balls by the great power of the explo
sive forces of elevation,        I feel the impossibility of adhering
to   him !"      There must have been a smile on De Verneuil's
face     over this schism         in the camp        of  the    anti-glacier
leaders.1
    ' Von Buch explained the rounded mammilated forms of rock-surface
 (now unhesitatingly regarded as roches moiUonntes due to ice abrasion) by
 reference to the concentric exfoliations which many crystalline rocks
 exhibit, and whereby a rounded contour not unlike that of roches mou-
 lonnees is undoubtedly given to exposed knobs or detached blocks.

80             SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                     [we.
     Among the details of the geological             work, there occur in
the journal    scattered     references      to the ways      and manners
of the people.       The characteristic         devotion   of the Tyrolese
to their Church, their simplicity and contentedness,                      their
activity and energy, find now and then a passing eulogium.
Thus the question        is asked      : — " Is not   the Catholicism         of
the  Tyrol the very best of religions for a good, virtuous,
and poor people      ?   They are full of firm belief, void of gross
superstition,   with stout bodies, strong heads, and warm hearts.
May they ever remain          so   !   May no cursed economists, may
no Miss Martineaus           and cotton-spinners ever enter              these
blessed valleys    !    Were    I    Emperor of Austria,       I  would for
bid the use of the loom in all this glorious country               ; glorious
for its deeds of chivalry and arms, glorious for its thoroughly
honest and pious       people    !    I say it in truth,    and before my
God, that    I would give all         I possess to have     the faith, and
belief, and happiness of these poor Tyrolese."
    " Von Buch's broad
                                 religious creed is pretty much my
own.     He states that it was seriously proposed                      to   the
Academy of Berlin to discuss the question                  if  governments
had a right to domineer         the people      ?   At  the same time he
admits   that the masses must have a comfort and                     a  belief,
and agrees with me         in admiring the state of the Tyrolese."
    While the pedestrian excursions, with their accompany
ing discussions, were in progress, Mrs. Murchison had been
quietly waiting at Botzen until the travellers should rejoin
her   there.    On the        10th     September      the  reunited party
reached Venice, which they found               full of preparation for the
scientific assembly       in the following week.            It   was a new
sensation to meet old geological friends among the darting
gondolas of the Grand Canal, and to get the latest geological

gossip    beneath     the   arcades    of Saint Mark.       Venice was
very    full     The old city had determined to give its visitors
a good reception, and in its own characteristic way to mingle
festivity, fireworks,       and boat-racing with the more prosaic
business      of the men of science.         That business, moreover,
was to be spread over a fortnight, thus giving a good oppor
tunity of noting how, in Italian fashion, a congress of savans
was held.         Owing to the arrangement         of having different
meeting-hours       for the sections,    a listener could hear all that
 took place in more of the rooms than            one.    Availing him
 self of this advantage, Murchison, after attending the small
 but select reunion of geologists, and taking part in its pro
 ceedings, could mingle with the geographers, or listen to the
 papers on agriculture and mechanics, or put his head into
 the doorway of the doctors and apothecaries, whom he again
 found to muster strong        as  they had done at Christiania.
      One amusing         incident of the meeting        arose out of a
 discussion     among the geographers         and antiquarians regard
 ing the ancient large round map of the world by Fra Mauro,
 which hangs in the Palace of the Doges.             The question   as to
 the exact extent of the Frate's geographical           knowledge had
 branched out into arguments on the old Phoenician voyages,

           One point of doubt and debate centred in a vessel

 geographers to jump up and decide.            It  appeared more than
 doubtful     if it was a ship, and thus the section closed      !  Now
 what   a day we had had        of ingenious nothings and misplaced
 learned verbiage, thought        I, as we  walked away."

 various heads, chiefly Australian.           Citing Siberia and the
 new countries, and the researches of Leichart, Mitchell,            and
 Sturt,  I  showed how the north and south chain of Australia
 would probably prove to be auriferous,            because of the same
composition        as the  Ural, etc."
     At    the    close   of the meeting    a geological   pic-nic was
organized to explore         the Venetian Alps.      The party, eleven
in number, included De Verneuil, Murchison, "Feld-Marschall
Von. Buch," as he was sometimes              playfully called, Pareto,
De Zigno, and other Italians,—           a  very merry party, which,
for about a fortnight, hammered the rocks, told stories, tried
to the utmost the resources of unfrequented inns, and finally
separated in excellent humour, leaving Murchison to rejoin
his wife at Padua, and thence to travel slowly southwards to
Home, where he had arranged to winter.
     Once more, then, after the lapse of        thirty years, he found
himself on the high roads of Italy, — Bologna, Florence, Pisa,
Siena, Viterbo, Borne.          With very different eyes did he now
traverse     these    well-remembered routes.        The sight of the
scenes which had kindled his early enthusiasm              for art and
classical     antiquities, renewed      again  somewhat     of the old
fervour.       But there came with it now       a pervading geological
flavour, which reveals itself sometimes with an odd bluntness
and apparent        incongruity among his memoranda         ; for, while
still with an eye for picturesque            outlines and interesting

escape notice    — blue marls, macigno, volcanic tuffa, shell-

and valleys on the line of march,         come in among art         criti
cisms or descriptions        of landscapes     and    antique   remains.
From day to day he enters with laborious detail the geolo

 exhaustive    memoir on the rocks      of Italy.     The veriest scrap
of a section interests       him, and receives at least a passing
 notice in his memoranda.

 felt the rising of the storm.      Its peoples, separated into arti
 ficial nationalities, and, agitated by various and conflicting
 emotions,    furnished   a   study of absorbing interest to any
 attentive student of human nature who chanced to live and
 mingle among them.        Murchison, t.      ugh no politician, could
 not be in the midst of the excitement without catching some
 of it and transferring it to his daily record of events.           For a
 while, indeed, his narrative of the sayings and doings of the
 various parties in the political arena completely usurps the
 place of rocks, fossils, art, and antiquities.           Some   extracts
  will  serve   to  show    in what a stirring time           his second
  Italian sojourn was passed, and how shrewdly he could some
  times    note  events  as    they occurred,      or  as   they loomed
  dimly in the future.
       It  was at Florence,    as early  as the   middle of October in
  this year, that the first indications of the coming troubles

met him, and he thus prognosticates                    :   —" People            who know
the Florentines tell me that all this vox populi                            will subside
with the first tramontane, or cooling north-west wind, but                                       I
put little faith in their sayings.                 An enormous change has
been made       in the whole framework of Italian society, of the
ultimate effects of which                I    am by no means                 certain.            I
cannot see the mighty assemblages of singers                            in the streets,
nor their enthusiasm,           the crowds         of drunken people in the
low   caf4s, and the        complete         license   which they are taking,
without     a fear   that the revolutionists, that               is,   root and branch
fellows, will work something of their own out of                             it,   and        will
shake,    if   they do not eventually upset, the throne of their
benevolent      sovereign, the Grand Duke."
      Things were beginning to look very dark at Rome.                                        One
of Murchison's first remarks on his arrival there                                             fol

years ago, and        a   single walk round my old haunts led me to
see   that in beggary, filth, and decay, she                is   more pre-eminent
than ever.       What     a   singular fatuity in those who govern to
expect to produce effectual reforms, when all                          is   as     rotten at
the core as the mouldering antiques,                    whose foundations are
daily giving away under the old edifices                     !     A    truly efficient
reform would be to retrench one-half of the overgrown charges
for cardinals        and priests,        employ the poor, and reanimate
this land of the dead."
      Again he breaks forth          — " Oh for

 day of retribution to come         ?    Not,  I apprehend,      for many     a
 day.    There is no intelligent middle class.              I expect, how
 ever, scenes of great disorder and tumult, followed by a good
 deal of highway robbery,          and the revival of the good old
 times of the brigands.
      " How is
                 improvement to be combined with the conser
 vation of the Papacy     ?     How is the spiritual power of the
 Pope to   be untouched     ?   How is His Holiness to be left in
 undisturbed possession of the influence             he wields over all
 Catholics,  foreign   and domestic,         whilst in his own States,
 the laws, internal government,           trade, commerce, etc., are to
 be administered     by civilians     ?   That this separation will be
attempted     sooner or later no one can doubt, now that                  His
 Holiness has put arms into the hands                of many thousand
citizens, two-thirds of whom            will  seek for such an adjust
ment, and    will eventually      compel it."
     But,   apart from       this    temporary      political     aberration,
how thoroughly geology had now engrossed                      Murchison's
mind is well illustrated by what he says of himself a day
or two after he had settled down in Eome.                 " A visit to the
Vatican revived some of my foregone pleasures                  ;  and glori
ous bright gleams       over all the Campagna            and the distant
snowy mountains, with the             sea  glittering at Ostia.        These
and the finest sunsets        from the Pincian are not enough for
the unhorsed      geological    knight.      For here, in truth,      I  find
myself a fish out of water, an animal without belongings,
and deprived       of the conditions in which            I  have lived for
some years past, viz., a set of men with pursuits entirely
akin to my own.        The other avocations of the sight-seer in
the Eternal     City are forced on          me,  faute   de mieux,     and   I
endeavour with these, and visits to the studios of the Tene

rani and Gibson, to occupy the mind, but in vain.                    These
are only scherzi.     My geological note-books            of the summer
lie undigested, and     I  lack the courage and stimulus in this
city of indolence      to work      them    up into something.            In
short,   that something      on the     Alps and Apennines would
be too general      and   desultory,     and    too   little decisive      to
satisfy  me.   I  feel this, and must desist at present from the
endeavour.     I wished to be in Sicily and doing something,
but the troubles stopped me         ; and now      I find I   might have
gone there and explored the mountains before the snow fell.
I  look daily to the Apennines with               a   wish to be there,
but their backbone is       a mass    of snow, and      I  should only do
things by halves until       I can make clear transverse sections
of the whole chain.       I   may, however,       make a run to      Tivoli
and the Sabine Farm of Horace, and compare the rocks                   with
the version given of them by PonzL              But this is fragmentary
work, and unworthy of           me.      Often do      I   wish that the
long quarantine of winter were passed, and that                I  was once
more at work with my hammer, and out of the gulf- stream
                                '             '
of English sight-seers and        Syntaxes in search of the pictur
 esque.    And yet    I have joined an English club here, where
 Lord   L— ,  gouty and unable to stand on his legs, talks of
 his shooting pigeons and larks from his carriage, whilst                    a
lot of young dandies are betting on their horses and their
 performances   in red coats.     As   a  climax,   I  am   just going out
 with Canino [Charles Buonaparte]             mounted       on one of his
 nags to view the throw-off at Magnonella on the road                       to
 Civita Vecchia."
     After this tedious      fashion,   with an occasional          country
 excursion and    a peep at the rocks, such as            they  are, of the
 Campagna, Murchison         contrived to get through the winter

1w7-s.]  POLITICAL DISCONTENT IN ITALY.                                87
at Rome.     With the earliest advent of spring he started for
Naples to renew his acquaintance            with the volcanic aspect
of that region.    But while the season of the year brightened
from mid-winter towards summer, the political horizon grew
each week more ominous.          Disaffection reigned everywhere,
breaking out abundantly into open revolt            ;  governments     in
terror unable    to act,   troops   fraternizing with        insurgents,
crowned    heads   seeking    safety   in flight,     communism       and
democracy rising on      all sides and threatening          to supplant
every   constituted authority.      From Vienna, Berlin, Paris,
each post brought     more exciting news, which added fresh
fuel to the fire of Italian discontent.                Naples was no
longer  a very safe or pleasant      place for a stranger         to stay
in.   Murchison remained long enough to witness the expul
sion of the Jesuits    in obedience to popular clamour.               He
thereupon,   after   getting as far south         as    Sorrento,   turns
northward again.      On the 1 2th March we find him writing
thus : — If
         "    I  croaked about the prospects of the Italians
in their new condition, and foresaw in the establishment                of
civic guards the germ of the overthrow of all monarchical
government,     how forcibly is this conviction driven home
now that the French Republic is re-established by the zealous
co-operation  of the National Guards of Paris          !   This is what
I have foreseen for years.     I have always said that in the for
mation of the National        Guards,     France had established         a
body of janissaries who would change dynasty and govern
ment at their   will and pleasure."     . .  .
    " If the detestable law of the division of property, which
deprives an industrious individual of the power of establish

were to be applied to England, then should we proud islanders

Among the crowd was young 0 — , the son of the Neapolitan

every youth.
     " Then came the
                         vespers and the Moccoletti, when all the
Corso and many parts of the town were illuminated, and the
people walked and ran up and down the Corso, each with his
little taper.     The sight     was grand      and   curious.     In   the
meantime,     before   dark,   one of the leading zealots, whose
name    I forbear   to mention for old acquaintance          sake, had a
large white placard posted on the east wall of the Palazzo
di Venezia, with the words ' Dieta Italiana          !'
     " The              and vociferations of the
            shoutings                                squads, with their
various    banners, during the Moccoletti, and           still the order
with which all was conducted, were truly striking.               Eows of
women stood on the raised flags which flank the Corso, with
carriages here and there.        After about an hour and a half of
this nonsense,    a  cry ran from one end to the other, and in
two minutes every light was extinguished,               and the people
filed off to their houses, charmed        with their fete and their
revenge.
     "                                    so much as the       union and
       Nothing surprises     a foreigner
celerity with which these festive rows are got up.             The man
date of the fiery cross could have been nothing to the prompt
                                                '
stage-like evolutions of young and old Roman!" When such
a play has to be enacted every one is          in his part, all singing
in harmony, and all knowing the words."
     " Rome,    April   2. — Yesterday, April      the 1st (ominous),
was    a great   jubilee here, with illuminations          taking place
in the evening, on account of the recovery of the head of
St.    Andrew, which was stolen from its resting-place in

 1S4B.]       THEFT OF        ST.  ANDREW'S HEAD.                         9 1
 St. Peter's, to the great horror of the Pope, who, with many
 of his flock, had viewed this theft of the holy relic             as a sad
 omen.        This head was richly bedizened,           and the thieves
 having taken from it all that was valuable to them, buried it
 outside of the gate of the Cavalli Leggieri, where, being dug
 up,    it was carried in an ecstasy of joy to the Pope.                My
 '
   laquais de place' Ramieri says, that the loss of the orna
 ments is nothing, the great point being the recovery of the
head and the 'cervelle' of the Saint.          As this   St.  Andrew was
said to have been brought           from the Eastern Greek Church
territories,    the common people had suspected the Emperor of
Russia (now in bad odour)          as the thief.     I wonder    it did not
occur to them to lay        it at the door of some canny Scot, who
sought to sanctify the Land of Cakes            in these perilous times     !
Would        any rational being believe that this is one of the
many dramatic scenes in the risorgimento                dell'  Italia, and
has followed close on the expulsion of the Jesuits !"
      Now and then, in the midst of this unwonted devotion
to political events, there occurs an allusion in the journal to
the      science   which, for the      time,    those  events     had   dis
placed.        Thus  :—"  Geology, Rome.         Well is it to turn from
the dark vista of communism               and destruction with which
the political horizon is shrouded             to Nature and Nature's
works.        But alas  ! in Rome and around it there is little to
be done.        A ride the other day with M. Louis enabled me to
review the succession         of the tertiary and volcanic rocks on
the right bank of the Tiber,           i.e., in all the tract between
Ponte Molle and the Porta dei Cavalli Leggieri behind the
Vatican."
      Nevertheless,    in spite of these various impediments,         some
pleasant excursions were made, partly geological, partly anti

quarian, up the valley of the                         praeceps
hills of Latium, and over the heights of Albano.                                       It   was
during these rambles that the materials were gathered for
the descriptions afterwards given of the geology of that part
of Italy to the Geological Society.1                       It    had been Murchison's
intention to explore the Apennines and cross over to the
eastern side of the peninsula, for the purpose of examining
the cliffs of the        Adriatic     ;    but in the disturbed state of the
country such         a   tour was found to be impracticable.                           Accord
ingly, he at last broke up his winter camp in Borne and
turned northwards,              to attempt that further                 Alpine campaign
on which he had now set his heart.
      " Rome    to   Narni, May           1.   — Thirty years         ago   I travelled this
road with my same old wife, then a young one.                                     The Cam-
pagna    is indeed the same, but                       I   see   it with very different
eyes now, — that          is,   geologic^.        Formerly       I    talked of the rocks
of Salvator Rosa, now            I    know that Salvator Rosa was                      a    gross
humbug.          Mr.     Ruskin           is    quite right in his dictum that
Salvator's      rocks      are all inventions                   or    scene-paintings         for
those who never studied nature.

Rome, to answer for all former sins.                         The Pope has published
his Latin allocution, and has abjured the Roman wars which
his subjects and ministers have waged in spite of him, and

made of the             Alpine ridges, valley after valley was explored,
and lines of geological section were drawn at intervals across
a great part of this chain.                   Beginning with          a   tour on horse
back through the northern end of the Apennines, Murchison
struck into the main chain of the Alps by the pass of Mont
Cenis, crossing          it to Chambe'ry, thence to Chamouni, and down
to Geneva.              A    sojourn was once more made at Vevay, among
Lady Murchison's Swiss connexions, after which the geolo
gist started alone to make another section                                of the Alpine
chain by way of Val de Ferret and Courmayeur                                   to Aosta, and
back by the Saint Bernard to Martigny and Vevay.                                            The
Swiss scientific congress was held this year at Soleure, and
Murchison             attended       it,   meeting     there     the leading Swiss
geologists,           with some of whom he turned southwards                                into
the glacier valleys of the Oberland.                      The later stages of the
tour included much climbing and detailed work around the
Lake of the Four Cantons, the Hohe Sentis, Sonthofen,                                       and
Bregenz          (see    Plate     IIL), until       at last reaching               Basle    the
travellers sped down the Ehine, and with two or three halts
by the way to                see   old scientific     friends,   finally landed               in
England.

94              SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                [IMS.
     The journal of this prolonged Alpine tour consists mainly
of geological       notes, which were afterwards         worked up into
the memoir       on the Alps, already referred         to.   Two objects
seem   to have been constantly in the traveller's mind               :   1st,
To get hold of the structure of the mountains and disentangle
the true succession of the crumpled           and fractured groups of
Alpine rocks      ;  2d,  To  see for himself the nature and value of
the proofs so confidently adduced           by his opponents       in the
glacier-iceberg       controversy    as evidence    of the former      vast
extension     of the present glacier system of the Alps.
     So thoroughly          had he wedded     himself to the iceberg
hypothesis,     and      so  prejudiced had he grown against any
effective  geological work on the part of glaciers, that even
now, in the very stronghold of the glaciers, he refuses to ad
mit them into the list of powerful terrestrial agents. Floating
ice and de"bacles caused by the convulsive upheavals                of the
mountains      will, in his opinion, account for all the phenomena.
When he meets with vast piles of detritus in some of the
valleys,   now generally recognised as re-assorted moraine
stuff, he notes that it " would doubtless be called moraine
by the ice-mad folks." The advent of such               a disbeliever into
the very sanctuary of the glaciers           provoked discussion, for
he rather boasted of his opposition.            At Aosta, for    instance,
the worthy meteorological          Chanoine  Carrel, to whom glaciers
 and their doings had long been familiar, answered the adverse
 argument with the easy nonchalance            of  a man who     felt that
                                               " The Canon,"
 argument of any sort was needless.                               says the
           " fires his shot           dreamily       if all were true as

 gospel.      We have striated rocks, and polished surfaces and
 blocks.   Nothing but ice could ever polish, striate, or trans
 port.   Hence all was ice down to the lower valleys.'              If you

 why not?'"         This was too much for Murchison.                  But   it
was nevertheless           true,  and he lived       in some measure to
acknowledge        it.
      With another and more noted champion of the glaciers
De Charpentier, our traveller entered into further discussion.
That shrewd observer had clearly shown the spread of the
huge erratic blocks over the plains of Switzerland and along
the slopes of the         Jura, and had connected these blocks with
a former wide extension of the glaciers.                 Murchison visited
him at the pretty hamlet of Devens, and went with him to
see the famous       blocks of Monthey and other travelled boulders
of the neighbourhood.              Charpentier, in explanation of his
views, drew a        little diagram in his companion's           note-book,
showing how the highest erratics               had been stranded      by the
greatest spread of the ice, and how, as that ice shrank, the
stones were lodged           at lower and lower levels.          Murchison
                                         " This little
adds a note to the drawing            :                 diagram, drawn by
the hand of M. Charpentier, shows his ingenuity, but does
not convince me."
      His scepticism could hardly be accounted for by want of
acquaintance       with glaciers.       In this very tour    he spent much
time among the ice in the Mont Blanc group of mountains,
making some good ascents with Auguste Balmat, and keeping
his eye ever open to the reception of evidence of the work
which land-ice actually performs.

    On the way down the Rhine valley, and during the short
halt at Bonn, chance once more brought Murchison               and
Von Buch together.      The veteran geologist, none the worse
of his recent Alpine sufferings, was busy with the study of
the Chalk and the Nummulitic       Limestones,   throwing into   it
all his youthful ardour.    He listened to Murchison's narra
tive, and especially to that part of it relating to erratic blocks
and glaciers, and no doubt ministered some comfort to the
narrator's    mind by standing   out, as of old, for torrents    of
water sweeping everything before them at the upheaval of
the Alps.

months, the travellers resumed        their   place  in Belgrave

                          THE COPLEY MEDAL.
        IN less than two months after his return to England
  from his prolonged        tour of 1848, Murchison            produced    at
  the Geological Society one of the longest,               and what was
  considered by some of his friends to be perhaps the best of
  all his original memoirs.1          In this elaborate paper he com
  bined his recent observations           among the     Alps and Apen
  nines with those of a former year among the Carpathians,
  his special object being to prove        a  transition from Secondary
  into Tertiary rocks, and to show over what             a  wide extent of
'
  Southern Europe, and in what massive proportions,                  rocks of
  Eocene    age  extend.       In early    days Sedgwick and he had
  done good service       in showing how the vast Secondary de
  posits of the   Alps range upwards into older Tertiary masses.
  They had erred, indeed, in some respects.              Their contention
  as to the age    of the Gosau beds had not been sustained by
  an appeal to facts.       Nevertheless,      Murchison had felt sure
  that they could not have been            so  wholly mistaken        as Con

tinental geologists had supposed, and that this conviction of
his had been well founded he now proceeded to demonstrate
in this paper.      By the evidence of good physical sections
and of fossils, he showed      that instead of a meagre develop
ment of the older Tertiary strata, there existed       in the chain
of the Alps, and throughout the South of Europe, enormous
masses belonging to that geological series.      The hard, greenish
sandstones    and schists, which form such notable        mountain-
ridges   along   the flanks   of the Alps, he showed         to be of
the same general geological age as soft clays and sands              in
the north-west of France and the           south-east of England.
 Undoubtedly he availed himself to the full of the assistance
he had derived      from the geological     friends with whom he
had examined the ground, and without whose local know
ledge indeed     he would have       been comparatively helpless.
 But he    as  fully acknowledges      the obligation.    It   was  no
 small merit to bring all the scattered observations         of many
 different students     along   the great line    of the Alps into
 relation with each other, and to make them lend their aid
 in bringing out some essential features in the architecture
 of these mountains.
      The judgment formed of this essay in Alpine geology
 by a very competent judge is flatteringly, but doubtless
 truthfully, expressed in the following extract.          Von Buch
 had hitherto been in the habit of writing to his friend in
 French.     He now begins      a  letter in English, but after the
 first paragraph    (here reproduced),    relapses into the former
 language.     His English, however,      as the reader may judge,
 was quite as good as his French, and, indeed,            showed     no
 common     mastery of a foreign language, expressing         vigorous

  — MY     DEAR   SIR, — Your admirable             paper on the             Alps has
  always been my companion            during my rambles last summer
  in Switzerland.      Every day when           I       took forth my breviary
  I   could not help to repeat
                                  '

  of sound and extensive         combination,             the very test of an
  eminent geologist, was never before               ;    such talent of exposi
  tion will always be a very rare and admirable                            gift.    You
  do approach the Nature to           lift up her veil with due rever
  ence and     attention to her, and then she speaks                           to you
 graciously.      Others   come hastily with spurs and boots and
  gross hands to draw the veil, as            it was       a   curtain, and they
  discover   behind not the flying nature, but                  a phantom          they
 have constructed themselves.              Such are the makers of coral-

     No apology seems needed for giving Von Buch's letters verbatim.
 Some   of their characteristic features would be lost by any correction.
 And even with their slips they are very remarkable productions to have
 been written by so venerable a foreigner, who acquired his knowledge of
 English at a time when the language was not so much known on the
 Continent as it has since become.
      8
      Darwin's admirably worked-out theory of the formation of coral-
 islands, now so generally received as a sound and firmly established con
 tribution to scientific reasoning, evidently found no favour in the eyes of
 this dear old geological Tory.
    3 He refers to the
                           explanation which accounted for the growth of
 volcanic cones by the accumulation of successive eruptions of solid
 materials round the focus of emission.       His own famous doctrine was
 that of the " Erhebungs-Kratere" — that        is,
                                                  that volcanic cones are so
 many huge blisters raised on the surface of the earth by the outward
 swelling of the molten masses within.   Though sturdily maintained by

      Whether the rapid preparation         of his great memoir, or
the transition      from Continental life to the more exacting
calls of London had told on his health, may be doubtful, but
now, for the first time     in this biography, we meet with Mur-
chison as an invalid, and even somewhat of a valetudinarian.
Lady Murehison, too, was ailing.          So  in the summer of 1849
they spent some time at Buxton and other watering-places,
and in visiting friends, with the view of getting rest and
renewed      health.    The geologist took very unkindly to this
change in his occupation.        He had never been used to think
of his bodily frame except         as a machine        for carrying his
indomitable spirit from place to place.              But now his note
books and letters assume a hue not unlike that of his friend
                                                                  " How

and the reminiscences         of old Peninsular comrades formed
but a sorry exchange for the scrambles with De Verneuil,
Von Buch, or Escher von der Linth, up the slopes of the
 Hohe Sentis or Tyrolean Dolomites.
       He had planned several pleasant             rambles during the
summer.        For instance, he wrote to Phillips :—
       " 28th  July   1849. — This watershed       of England is per
haps the best place during the cholera-plagues,             and I wanted
good air and quiet.       I hope  to be soon as sound as a geologist
ought to     be in the summer, and then think of excursionizing a
little before the Birmingham meeting, and             I wish to consult
him and his followers, and espoused by some geologists of note, especially

which he derides in the above letter, has prevailed.

you about this trip.                My present notion is to join Ramsay, if
he    is,   as
            I         suppose, somewhere in North Wales, there to learn,
as   well        as
                  I     can, the progress that has been made since the
bygone           days of Silurianism.       I   really wish to bring myself
up to the existing state of knowledge in these beloved
regions,          and      a   few mountain -walks    will,I    trust, complete
my cure.               Inter alia,   I   shall take   a    glance       certainly at
your Malvernia, of which you have rendered every corner
so attractive."
       But       a    few weeks afterwards     his tone alters      —
                                                                    :
       "                   19, 1849. — MY DEAR RAMSAT,        —
           August                                             I     never wrote   a
letter with more repugnance than when                  I      inform you that    I
cannot           join you at the foot of Snowdon.                 In truth   I   am
(I   regret to say)             quite unfitted for any geological excursion
on account              of health and nerves.     I   have been more ailing
this year than in any previous one, and                I      have not regained
what   expected at Buxton.
       I
   " This    the first summer in my life in which
                      is                                                   I   have
been       fairly obliged to strike work, and the very thought of
it   adds to my depression.               Hoping, however, that          I   may be
in better plight when the Birmingham meeting comes off,                          I
trust to meeting you there, and who knows that later in the
autumn       I         may not accomplish what        I       have failed to do
now under your kind and instructive auspices."
       By the time of the assembling of the British Association
at Birmingham                  in September, he had   so    far recovered him
self   as to be able to attend the meeting.                   The proximity of
the Silurian territory gave the geologists                    an opportunity of
makiug an excursion into                  it   under Murchison's guidance.
A goodly gathering                 mustered round him as he led them into
the Dudley              caverns,    which Lord Ward lighted up for the

 occasion.        There he gave them              a subterranean         lecture    on
 the story of the ancient sea-formed                  rock within which they
 were assembled, and then emerging again to daylight, he led
 them      to the    top of the Wren's             Nest, where, amid much
 merriment, and with general approbation, he was enthroned
                                         "                          l

       But immediately after the meeting                       we     find him       at
 Brighton drinking mineral waters, and noting each disor-

as   if  he had been all his life a confirmed valetudinarian.                       A
man whose chief subjects of thought at the time would seem
to have been the miseries of " suppressed gout," " ill-arranged

relative effects of " bismuth pills," " blue pill," and " cordial
rhubarb ;" and who, after trying in vain the virtues of " Carls
    1 These doings at Dudley formed the subject of a string of doggrel
verses by some local bard, published at the time, with the title of              " The
Dudley Gathering, a Ballad." This was the second time that Murchison
had given an underground lecture in the Dudley caverns.                At  the former
meeting of the British       Association in Birmingham (1839) he had led a
similar party of excursionists.       See his description of that earlier visit in
a letter to Hugh Miller, in Bayne's Life of Hugh Miller.

such a man could hardly be expected to produce             any cohe

of yesterday    ! It is freedom from these ailments which is the
basis of the success of great public men — an iron stomach,
the skin of a pachyderm, and no nerves, forming the sine qud
non of a Duke of Wellington."
     In  the brighter intervals of this season of despondency,
                                                              "

to prepare a memoir        on the pseudo-volcanic    rocks   of Italy,
more to revise the subject and keep my hand              in than to
give out many new observations.              But  I must speak my
mind on several points of Tuscan, Roman and Neapolitan
 igneous action, and on the succession of the events.             Also
 began to speculate      on a general     Geological Map of Europe.
 With this sort of serious occupation, much idling, and a
 good deal of open air promenading — the weather turning into
 a fine Martinmas summer        —I   have eked out my time."
      While still in this unwonted state of nervous depression,
  he received the announcement          that the Royal Society had
  unanimously assigned to him the Copley gold medal.                 The
  terms of the award ran thus       : — " That the Copley medal be
  awarded to     Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, F.RS., for the
  eminent services he has rendered to geological science during
  many years of active observation in several parts of Europe,
  and especially for the establishment of that classification of
  the older palaeozoic deposits, designated the Silurian system,

 1s49.]                THE COPLEY MEDAL.                                 105
 as set    forth in the two works entitled The Silurian System
founded on          Geological     Researches      in England,      and The
 Geology     of Russia and      the  Ural Mountains."
      By none were his claims to the honour more urgently
 pressed than by his generous old friend Sedgwick, to whom
 he thus wrote at the time           : —
      "Nov.     23, 1849.  — MY      DEAH    SEDGWICK, —      I have lighted
 my candles to write to you in an orange fog, and to thank
 you for your letter of yesterday,                and   still more for your
 warm espousal of my claims to the Copley medal, of which
  I heard from Horner when he wrote to announce the result.
 That result, prefaced          as  it   was   by the cordial support of
 all the geologists, is unquestionably the highest honour                    I
 have      ever received,       and     the   more     gratifying from    the
  manner      in which the vote passed unanimously through the
  R.  S.   Council     Airey, in writing to me about it (and he was
  the proposer), said      it was   carried nem. con. and nem. tac.
        "
           My wife and self are both very sorry to hear of your
  poor health.       We are all in the same boat.               For the first
  two days after her arrival here, she has been a sufferer.
  And at times       I say   of myself that      I  am but an old woman.
  But the Copley is a sort of cordial-ball for an old poster,
  and    I  must revive,    if possible.     I knew     very well the causes
  of your silence        without your repeating           them.    There are
  but few friends on whom              I  could count to the death, and
  that you, my dear Sedgwick, are one of them, is one of the
  things    I  am most proud of."
        Gradually       regaining      his former health         and   spirits,
  Murchison        resumed     by degrees his place in the midst of
  the activity of the learned             Societies   in London.     He had
   been appointed       a Vice-President         of the Eoyal Society, and

was oftener       at  its meetings than before.             The following
extracts    from    his correspondence        show how thoroughly he
had at last got once more into harness. To Sedgwick he writes
on 18th January :— "        If you rally quite, and ever intend to be
at our Society this winter,        I   should like to bespeak you for
the 6th February, when         I  give forth on the pseudo-volcanic
rocks    of central Italy, and when we shall                necessarily    go
more into the question           of elevation       craters   which   Lyell
has reproduced.         I am convinced that the truth lies neither
in the extreme of Von Buch and De Beaumont, nor in that of
Lyell.    ...    I  suppose   we shall give our Wollaston            medal
this year to Hopkins, and it could not go to a better man.
    "
       I  was in the chair of the Royal Society last night as
one of Lord Rosse's V.-P.'s.         .  .  . The paper on the alkaline
bases,   by Dr. Hofmann, astonished               me, and proved     to me
(an old pupil of Brande and Faraday) that                I was   incapable
of understanding the elements and phraseology of the science
as it is now carried on.         As a mathematician,         you could do
so  with    a  little labour   ;  but the isomerism of ammonia, in
which all the ammonia escapes, puzzles me sorely.                      It   is
another world of science."
     To Phillips, on 9th February             : —" I  suppose you know
that at the last anniversary of the Eoyal Society                   it   was
announced      that Lord     John Russell would           give £1000 per
annum for the advancement of science, to be at the command
of the Council of the         R   S.      Entre nous,    I  wish that the
Premier had divided this thousand into two parts, and had
given one to our great national patriarch of science, the
British    Association, and another             to the corporate    metro
politan body.        But the offer has been made spontaneously
on his part, and      it  was not for men of science to repudiate

it.    They have put me on the committee              of the   R     S.    to
prepare a report on the objects proposed to be carried out by
the grant.      ...  It  occurs to me that we must fly at game
at least as noble as we of the B. A. have attempted to take.
 In truth,   the minister    will, if he carries out this project, to
a great extent disarm the B. A., which,          if it  have no funds
to dispose of,     will simply   become a pleasant      rendezvous for
a   few men of science on a provincial tour        !
      " At the last                               I                         if
                        meeting of committee         suggested that
we were anxious to show the Government               all that could or
might be done for the advancement of science, we ought, in
mentioning what has been done by the B. A., to point out
the great desiderata        which for want of money we could
not accomplish.         I feel that this is due to the B.         A.   .  . .
"We, the B.     A., really were started into existence on account
of the lethargy and want of general spirit in the            R   S.  ;  and
if the  latter is to do real good, they must imitate us or let us
do the good work."                                                           •
      To  J. D. Forbes, 16th March. — "You would             see   by the
circular received from the Secretary that the move which                    I
made    in favour of a broad and liberal view of the Govern
ment grant to science          prevailed, and that the principles
acted on by the       British Association have been adopted in
the end.       I say this, because    I may assure you that         it re
quired all my energy to get the point carried.            At  the meet
ing of the Council where all was settled,          I presided    ; and      I
hope you     will approve of our losing no time and going to
work instanter in employing all the money we can get in a
good cause."
      As the summer wore on, symptoms of the maladies of
the previous year began to show themselves, so that a retreat

to the Continent was resolved              upon.     Our two invalids of
Buxton and Brighton repaired first of all to Vichy to try the
waters    there.     Murchison no sooner found himself among
the    rocks    again  than his old geological            ardour    began to
revive.     In   a week or ten days he had explored                the rocks
all round the watering-place, and collected materials enough
regarding      them   to    furnish     a   paper     afterwards     for   the
Geological Society.1
      From Vichy he made a lengthened                  excursion into the
volcanic regions of Auvergne, which he visited with Lyell
twenty-two years before.            Recent rambles among the extinct
craters    of Italy had awakened              in him stronger interest
in volcanic geology.          Under the guidance           of worthy M. le
Coq, of Clermont, he saw the ground again, and formed very
decided, though probably erroneous opinions, regarding                     the
 succession of events        in the volcanic history of that part of
France.       In particular,       we    find him discarding the un
doubtedly correct views          as to the     formation of the valleys,
 which Lyell and          he   had     adopted    after    Scrope,   and re
turning to the true-blue convulsionist faith.                "The denuda
                                                                      " could
tions between these plateaux of basalt,"               he remarks,
never be explained by actual causes.                  Millions of years of
such a puny stream as the Dordogne                 could never deepen a
valley.      All  that actual causes effect here is gradually to
widen the valley and to fill it up."             And he speculates that
 subterranean       commotion       and violent upheaval at a point
 from which the ground was starred by radiating rents, had
been the origin of the existing valleys            !

         This year the British Association was to meet at Edin
burgh.            In
            letter of 31st May, Murchison had written to
                           a
Hugh Miller about that gathering as follows :— " At a
meeting           of the         Council            of the British     Association, held
yesterday,             I   was named President of Section C (or Geology
and Geography),                  with yourself and James Nicol                        as Secre
taries for our special science, and with A. Keith Johnston
for geography.                   As     I       moved    that you be placed in this
office, and as my motion passed unanimously (and indeed
with acclamation                  in a full meeting),             I   trust you will not
allow anything to prevent your accepting                                 it.      I   honestly
confess that no honour could be more gratifying to me than
to occupy the Geological Chair in my native country, and                                             if
I know           that the author of The Old Red Sandstone will be
one of the Secretaries                          I   shall be still more proud             ;    for    I
consider          that         we come          from the same nook of land; the
Black Isle and Cromarty being inseparable.
    "        I
       have written fully to the excellent and venerable
Professor Jameson, telling him how, when the subject was
first broached                 to me by my geological                  friends,       I   always
insisted on declining the honour                           if   every due respect were
not paid to Jameson.
         "   I   am writing by this post to                 Nicol at Cork. My great
object is to revive and give greater                            breadth        to the         opera

discussion             to be brought before us.                  Pray try your skilful
hand at one of these, and get up also through others a good
scene or               two for our meeting-room.                      Sedgwick talks of
dashing off             a general memoir on the south                  of Scotland.              He
will never write                  it,   but we shall perchance                  have      it    well

110              SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                 [wn.
      Quitting,     therefore,   the   cheires   of Auvergne        and the
water-drinkers of Vichy, Murchison repaired to the northern
capital to preside over the Section of the geologists.               Always
glad     to have some striking announcement                 to make to his
friends of the Association, he had the good fortune on this
occasion to be able to publish a lucky discovery which he had
stumbled upon while at Vichy. Bounding the eastern margin
of the broad plain of theLimagne,the bills of the Forez stretch
in undulating masses between the valleys of the Allier and
Loire.      French geologists, finding the rocks of these hills to
be altered and crystalline, had placed them low down                  in the
geological      scale, a position, indeed, to which, judged only by
mineral evidence, they might well be assigned.                   Murchison,
in one of his first rambles, discovered             a  few fossils in these
same crystalline masses, and in subsequent searching found
more, which on examination proved                 to belong     to the same
great      series  as   the  Carboniferous Limestone of England.
He at once saw the value of this fact in relation to the
geology of the older rocks          of central France, and in         a  brief
notice      to the British     Association drew attention to it and
to the       corroborative    evidence     which it furnished,        of the
truth of       a statement     long before     made by Sedgwick and
himself, that       some, at least,    of the coal-fields       of the Con
tinent were laid down after the older Carboniferous                     rocks
had been fractured and upheaved.1
      At     the close of the meeting         Sedgwick and Murchison
 once more, and for the last time, became fellow-travellers.
 Leaving Edinburgh on the 9th of August, they first halted
 at Dunblane, not on geological             errand    bent, but to see the

Cathedral,     and ramble    out to Sherriff      Muir to look at the
field of battle, and search for the stone from which the piper
blew the war-pibroch that led Murchison's clansmen to their
death.      A little  geology    was done       as  the two comrades
climbed together to the. top of Ben Lomond.                Thence they
found their way to Inveraray, on           a   visit to the Duke and
Duchess of      Argyll     Of this time Murchison writes :— " We
were     truly received with open arms by the accomplished
pair.     It  seems to have been a marriage           made in heaven.
 Sound thinking,      quickness,    method,      and a deep sense of
religion combine       to render the Duke a very remarkable
young man.         The Duchess is quite equal to him.              With
the     good-humoured,      placidly-jocose, and       solid  historian,
 Prescott, full of good manners and fresh stories told in a
very easy and agreeable way, we had for two days the erratic
 fire of Sedgwick, whose episodes, flights, and parentheses
fairly marvelled our Transatlantic kinsman. They naturally,
 however, delighted      each other, whilst the steady r6le of C.
 Howard, and my occasional          hammerings       by the way, made
 up a very efficient table-talk."
       After a few days of mingled talk, geology, and sport at
                                         "
 Inveraray, our traveller reached the hospitable              retreat of
 Lord Murray, at Strachur."           There he enjoyed more chat,
 saw some more geology, and helped               to catch  skate, crabs,
 and     other  treasures   of the    deep    in the shore nets, and
 left with regret a home brightened            by culture, music, and
 the intercourse of pleasant         guests, drawn together        by a
 genial    and hearty hospitality.      Several     weeks were spent
 in these desultory       employments,     during which Murchison
 passed through a good part of the central Highlands, stay
 ing, as of old, with hia hospitable        friend Lord Breadalbane,

and enjoying the sport to be had about the Black               Mount
and Glenorchy.
    This Highland ramble, though not ostensibly for geologi
cal purposes, has an interest in the progress of the develop
ment    of British     palaeozoic    geology.    Murchison    had not
looked in detail at any of the crystalline rocks of the High
lands    since the early days when          Sedgwick and he were
companions        among   them.     In  the interval his experience
had grown, and he now could look upon them with different
eyes.     Instead of being content to treat them merely               as
fragments of the primeval crust of the earth, he now traces
in them everywhere         proofs   that they were originally only
sand, gravel, and mud, which had subsequently been altered.
He tries to make out their foldings and their order, con
jectures that some of them            may be of Silurian     age,   and
though not able to ascertain           much of precision and value,
his notes and recollections of these autumn observations
served him in good stead          in later years, when he accom
plished the last great feat of his life, — the establishment
of the base of the rocks of Britain, and the structure of the
north-west Highlands of Scotland.              To this feat we shall
return in    a  later chapter.
     His subsequent wanderings in Scotland, after the hospi
talities of the Highlands, were mainly geological, and are
thus described by himself       : —

which he had never seen, and of which you had given such
tempting accounts.2                After a trip on the Clyde, to look at
the clay-slates there, we journeyed to Girvan,                     in the neigh
bourhood         of which we worked right hard for a week.                   What

explored        them     in the valley of the Meifod, or on the slopes
of May         Hill,   etc.    That they should have remained              so  long
unknown is            a great   opprobrium to Scotch geologists.             I  find
that the true Calymene Blumeribachn                     occurs in quantity low
in the series of Girvan.               The Government surveyors tell me
 that      it is    also the case      in North Wales, where that same
 species goes down to the base, or very nearly, of the whole
concern.

travelled southwards      to Loch Ryan, and thence by Glenluce
to New Galloway, across the granite, and thence to Castle
Douglas and the headlands            south   of Kirkcudbright.         At
Dumfries we got hold of Mr. Harkness, a very energetic and
hard-working young man, who is going to give us a paper                 of
some details of the county of Dumfries, and           all its zones or
zone of Graptolites.       It will  be read early this session.        At
Moflat we worked closely and hard for some days to find out
the mineral axis of the region.        I believe   that there,  as else
where,    particularly in the Lammermuirs, there are several
axes.
    "  I may give    a little something      to the Geological,    for   I
see  that many mdmoires pour servir must come out, and
many hands, hammers, and eyes must be exercised before
the   south   of Scotland can be brought into anything like
order.     All  the northern frontier of these rocks, laid down
by Maeculloch, must be done over again.

                       you are going to do in this matter.      Accept

    In   a letter to Hugh     Miller, Murchison expresses a very
sagacious inference, which his recent tour had led him to draw,
and which subsequent         detailed examination has confirmed,
while at the same time he unwittingly utters            a sort of pro
phecy as to his final geological work, which really came               in
the end to be fulfilled : — " As far      as  my researches    go, they
teach    me that    whilst the Silurian        rocks occupy    so   very
large a portion of the south        of Scotland,    they are far from
being very thick.        Their apparent      enormous    development

is due to countless        flexures.   . . . Unquestionably       there   is
no top or bottom       to the series      in the southernmost of the
 Scottish Silurians.      I look, therefore,   for the top and bottom
 of my system    as  it is now expanded in an European sense
in the Highlands of Scotland          ;  and so, after all my labours
and peregrinations,      I   think of returning to work at home,
 and ending my days where          I began them."      .  . .
     The results of this rapid tour in the south of Scotland
 were of considerable      importance in relation to the history of
 British palaeozoic geology.       The chain of undulating uplands
which stretches from Port Patrick to St. Abb's Head had
formed the ground of some of the most interesting observa
tions of Hutton, Playfair,         and    Hall regarding       the former
revolutions of the earth.        From the time of these observers
it had been known that the rocks of those tracts, called then
           "
by them primitive schistus," were crumpled and twisted by
some of the early movements of the earth's crust, which pre
ceded the deposition of the flanking sheets of red sandstone.
Hall, in one of his rides, had found fossil shells in them, and
the    rocks were afterwards classed in the vaguely-defined
" Transition series." In later
                                     years Sedgwick had compared
them with     his Cumbrian and Cambrian masses, but from
mineral characters       rather than from fossil contents.              Mr.
J.  Carrick Moore and Professor James                 Nicol had after
wards obtained      fossils,   which     placed   the    rocks   definitely
in the Silurian system.         Mr. Nicol had given much atten
tion, especially to the eastern parts            of the uplands, but
hitherto no clear views had been published             as to the general
structure of the region, and still less        as to  any possible suc
cession of the rocks determinable by fossils, though a singu
larly able and suggestive sketch had been given at the recent

 Edinburgh meeting of the British Association by Sedgwick.
 Hence, following        up the clue given by the Woodwardian
 Professor,     Murchison, with his companion,          Mr. Nicol, was
 able to show, by means of fossils, that well-marked               repre
 sentatives    of his Llandeilo and Caradoc formations occurred
 in the south of Scotland,— a notable          step  in the progress of
the extension of his Silurian domain over Britain.
      Before, however, the notes of this Scottish ramble could
 be elaborated into the memoir, which in the following Feb
ruary was read to the Geological Society,1 Murchison's rest
less industry had urged him into the midst of a new and
fresh field of work.        We have seen how much for a year or
two past, ever, indeed, since his first Scandinavian trip, his
mind had been exercised with questions of glaciers, icebergs,
and de'bacles.       Each fresh mass of loose gravels and detritus
met with      in the course of his wanderings set him thinking
anew on this subject, and the more he thought the more did
he seem to feel the difficulty of seeing how solid ice could
ever have been spread over the land, and could have pro
duced, or have aided       in producing, the piles of rubbish known
generally by the name of " Drift."          In Russia,   Sweden, Den
mark, the Alps, Italy, and lastly in Scotland, he had been
brought face to face with these problems, the result being to
make him a firmer believer than ever             in great torrents and
rushes of water let loose by subterranean          upheaval.     As soon
as he    had returned from Galloway, with its abundant mounds
of ice-born detritus, he set to work upon the superficial de
posits of the south-east of England.          At intervals during the
winter and spring he scoured the valley of the Weald and

the uplands of the North and South Downs, searching, as he
said, for "     Drift, drift, drift wherever     I could find it."     He
communicated,        as usual,   his results to the Geological Society,
— this time in a voluminous memoir specially devoted to a
statement of evidence           which seemed to him conclusive in
favour of other and far more powerful action than any which
the geologist sees       in operation now.
       In this memoir       a protest   is sounded   against  the views
of those who, following out the, doctrine of Button, refused
to admit, as valid geological         causes, kinds of agency different
from those at present at work.              These writers, it declared,
"
   have, in their too great eagerness to explain much that is
still obscure, forced the former energy of nature                  into a
quietude which is inconsistent with the proofs of her violent
revolutions." But these " proofs " were precisely the same
as those       relied on by the author's       opponents,    who denied
that they necessarily, or even probably, should           be referred to
violent and sudden action. Murchison's contention in favour
of " great oscillations and ruptures " of the earth's crust lead
ing to the sudden breaking-up and submergence of tracts of
land partakes of the very same vagueness which Playfair had
long before complained of when arguing against the similar
views of Pallas and De Saussure.               He does not, any more
than any of his predecessors, explain the modus operandi of
 his ruptures and       de'bacles.   Time, that great arbiter of dis
putes, has decided against him in this matter of the origin of
        " drifts " of the south-east of
 the                                        England, which, instead of
 being referred       to violent    convulsions and floods, are now
 regarded as among the most striking proofs of the long con
 tinuance of quiescent sub-aerial waste such           as  is still going
 on.      Nevertheless,    in protesting against     the  doctrine that

nature's operations have always been, on the whole, as gentle
as   they are at present, Hurchison was probably in the right.
The interval           during which man has been observing                    what
takes       place     around him has been infinitely                 too   short   to
warrant him in dogmatically assuming                       it to be the type by
which all past energy is to be measured.                           From a wider
view of the history of our planet, the conviction arises that
as the sum           of potential energy within the earth must have
been gradually             diminishing      as the globe         has cooled, the
manifestations of subterranean                action may have been lessen
ing likewise, and may therefore have been far greater in
their earlier than in their later             stages.1
         Murchison's mind at this time seems to have been fuller
than ever of zeal for the former potency of Nature's opera
tions.          Besides    the   memoir just referred            to, he    gave    an
evening         discourse     to the Royal Institution " On the former
Changes  of the Alps" (March                    7),
                                   wherein he returned to
the charge against the
                       " uniformitarians," appealing to the
undoubtedly stupendous                    overthrows of the rocks of the
Alps       as   triumphant proofs that the present quiet uniformity
of nature has not lasted always, but has been disturbed by
enormous convulsions, which,                 in upheaving mountains, have
strewn their sides and the surface of the plains with vast
piles of shattered detritus.2

of the tropical character of the Carboniferous flora "      !

      The same creed of this laudator temporis acti appears still
 more strongly expressed in his private correspondence.                 For
 example,   in writing to Mr.      J. P. Martin,     who had given some
 attention to the Drift, he says      : — "You know my object in thus
 stepping forward to generalize the facts boldly, for a stand
 must be made against the fashionable               nonsense of washing
 the Weald for thousands           of years by ordinary sea- action."
 In  a later note he remarks to the same correspondent : — "              I
 have repeatedly      shown in other works that operations               of
 great violence, not of Lyell's quietude, have             been repeated
 on and along the same axes or habitual lines             of disturbance.
 Of these disturbances        I  only [now] deal with those of the
 last great geological revolution, in which the mammoths and
 their allies were specially massacred and destroyed."              Again,
in writing to Sir Charles Lyell with reference to the finding
of supposed footprints of air-breathing animals low down in
the older rocks of Canada — a position in which, according to
his views of the progress of creation, they ought not to occur
— he    says,
               "  I thank you for your discourse,            and am not
frightened out of my views by your pithy PJS. on Logan's
footprints.1     Hitherto, we know absolutely nothing of land
animals in the Silurian world, and now that we find tracks
of them, the animals are of the lowest or reptilian order.
This is just as it should       be.      If Logan    had found the print
of an aldermanic Robinson Crusoe's foot, as he was intent
on realizing the first turtle-soup, then          I  would knock under.
It  is well we have some of these points to wrangle about, or
we should become as quiescent as one of your most tranquil
periods, and you would yourself call out for a revolution."

these tracks was soon exploded.     They were admitted not to be the work
of vertebrated animals. See op. cit. viii. 223.

      In   a   later letter to Sedgwick, these curious tracks from
the Canadian rocks are referred                       to    in connexion with the
discovery of           a   remarkable fossil lizard-like              skeleton           from
the yellow sandstones of Elgin, then and long subsequently
considered          to belong          to the Old     Red Sandstone,               but now
referred        to the       New Red Sandstone,               or Trias     :   —   "I    have
just been seeing the confounded                            frog that leaped in the
primeval         Devonian          days     of our whitish          yellow siliceous
sandstone           of Burg        Head and         Spynie Loch, near Elgin.
It    is   as    beautiful         a    vertebrated        little monster           as    any
one of the Brown Coal or (Eningen period.                             And he is to
wag his tail next meeting, to the infinite delight of Lyell,
who is inebriate with joy, and who will have him out in a
new edition before we can launch him in our own Journal.
Mantell describes                it,   and really has great merit              in having
suggested           long ago that certain queer little gemmules                            of
the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Forfar, long ago figured by
Lyell, were the spawn or                    eggs    of batrachians.1           We have
now got the Triton                     who laid them.          At firstI       suggested
that this siliceous sandstone                   might be of the same age                   as
my Braambury               Hill    rock (Brora), which         it   much resembles          ;
the more         so, as near           this very Spynie Loch there are strata
of the Oolite          age   ;   but in the very same rock are the scales
of the Stagonolepis fish of the true Old Red.*
    " hold          said so when Logan's tortoise-marks from
         I   (and          I

those early days          can   have    no   influence in changing our
general argument founded on marine succession.                  They have
found also the trail of a tortoise and some small plants —
potamogeton" etc.
      In   the month of      July    1851, the   British Association met
at Ipswich.        Murchison says, "        At   this meeting1   I induced
my associates of the Association to fill up the vacant letter              E
in our list, unrepresented            by any Section since the retire
ment of the medical men to their own Association, and                      I
constituted it      as the    Geographical and Ethnological section.
As long       as  they were subordinate to the geologists             (Sec
tion C), the geographers were submerged."
      At    the close of the meeting          he started for the south
west of England to visit his uncle, General Mackenzie, at
 Cheltenham.         The veteran rejoiced to go through the old
 campaigns       again with      his nephew, who        somewhat     briefly
 chronicles the event                          " with
                             as  three   days          my uncle and the

 '
   olim meminisse.'           In truth    the geologist's   thoughts were
 now bending to a new scientific venture,                 and   every   day
 was grudged which kept him away from the field.
    1 This is not strictly accurate.    It was at the previous or Edinburgh
 meeting that the rule passed, " That the subject of Geography be
 separated from Geology, and combined with Ethnology, to constitute a
 separate Section, under the title of the Geographical and Ethnological
 Section."    But probably Murchison meant to say that it was at the Ips
 wich meeting that the rule first came into operation. He was chosen
 then as the first President of the new section.

                         CHAPTER XXI.
                                SILURIA.
     THIRTEEN     years had now passed since the publication of
The   Silurian   System.   In this interval    great strides had been
made     in the extension     of the classification propounded       in
that work to the older fossiliferous deposits in many widely-
separated parts of the world.          The order brought out of the
original Silurian     rocks had proved         to  be   no mere local
phenomenon.          The general type of life yielded by these
rocks     had   been    identified    as   characterizing the    oldest
fossiliferous formations all over the globe.          Murchison him
self had done        much in carrying out           this  extension in
Europe by his travels in Russia and in Scandinavia.                 He
had likewise watched with growing interest its progress in
the other Continents, and had kept himself abreast of the
advancing knowledge.         At length      the idea occurred to him
to gather up the gist of all this accumulating research, and
present    it to the world in     a compact     volume.      His inten
tions, after he had made a         little progress in the undertak
ing,   were thus stated      to  his friend Hugh         Miller, whose
powers      of graphic description he lost no opportunity            of
eulogizing :—

view of primeval geology          ;   more particularly         as respects               all
my Silurian foundation-stones.              I   should not perhaps have
thus endeavoured to put my house in order, which                        I   thought
I   had sufficiently done        in the first chapters of the work on
Eussia (where everything was described,               as    I   shall again do
it,   from the beginning), had        I    not been urged to do                  so       by
my best friends, and particularly                by Sir H. De la Beche
and the Government geologists of my country.                       ...      I     have
been       stimulated to get up        a   readable   and general                view,
which     I   hope to be able to send you by next summer."                       .    .    .
      For the next three years, Murchison's journeys were
mainly devoted to the congenial task of gathering from
fresh observations        in the field, from comparisons of museums,
from conversations            with other observers         as    well       as    from
their published writings, materials to be worked up into
the new book which was to represent                   the actual state of
Silurian geology.
         He could not begin this new venture better than by
visiting some of his old haunts along the Welsh and English
border, and        extending thence his examination into Wales,
coming, as he did, with eyes of greater experience to see again
his typical sections, and compare them with those in other
parts of Europe.         At   the end of his work,      in which he had
asked       his companion of the previous year, Mr. Nicol, to
join him, he thus reports progress to Mr. Ramsay —                 :
      "
          Holyhead, August      15, 1851. — I     cannot quit the shores
of the bare but once well-clad                  dark isle of the             Druids

your introduction to that hearty good man, Mr. Williams of
Llanfayringhornwy,1 with whom we passed two days before

124:                   SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                                   [i
we came hither.                  I have   made a good and honest transverse
section          from Ludlow,        by Welshpool, Meifod, the Berwyns,
Bala, and thence, with deflections to Caderldris, by Barmouth,
Harlech, Tan-y-Bwlch, and Llanberis, to this place                                           I        am
delighted with all your mapping, and above all pleased with
Selwyn, who joined us at Bala, and took us in hand for
Cader Idris.            It   is a glorious region for a final base-line of
all that is fossiliferous."
       From Anglesea,              where       the section       was run out to sea,
it    was natural to look to Ireland for some continuation                                            of
it.     Accordingly          a descent was made              by Murchison and his
companion upon the Green Isle for the special                                         purpose of
looking after its Silurian sections.                       The grievous destitution
then prevalent in that country finds nearly                                    as    much com
ment        in the letters and notes of the geologist                               as the   rocks
and         fossils.     The subjoined extracts                  will show how the
subjects were commingled                   :   —
       "    I   have been looking for many a long day for any base
of Siluria in Britain, and until yesterday, between Black-
water and Talliconner Bridges,                      I   never       saw    it,   as    made           up
of fragments of mica-schist, quartz-rock,                           etc.   ;   in short, of all
antecedents.            To-day we had no reason to hope for                            a   similar
base-line.         But Griffith's map gave us an outline, and his notes
a     direct indication of the fossil-beds,                  i.e.    of Silurian, related
to primary rock              ;   and in following          it,   despite         of wind and
rain, we worked out all our points north and north-west of
this comfortable                 little inn, and the table                 is   now strewed
with the relics of the lower fossil group."

         Before starting on this tour he had asked Sedgwick for
any suggestions                  as to   points requiring elucidation.                When
he got back to England                        he wrote   to the           Cambridge Pro
fessor — "   :    I      wish    I   could have      so arranged            matters    as to
meet you            in Scotland          ;   but, to say the truth,         I     had much
rather be in Ireland, despite of misery and rags.                              ...   I   now

ing to look up two or three typical sections this autumn,                                 if
the weather prove dry and settled."
         In      spite of their disagreement             on one geological             ques
tion, these two friends continued to be on intimate and
cordial terms.               This very summer, for example, Murchison

 could still write            as  follows to his comrade: —        "J —    being
 a most pugnacious              and vindictive     Frenchman, judges others
 by his own measure, and thinks that because you and                      I have
 had     a    wrangle about SiL and Cam. we                 are,  or may have
 been, estranged            !  He little knows the nature of our friend
 ship."        We may take another sample of their friendliness,
 and, at the same time, a whimsical picture of the Cambridge
 geologist,       from a letter of Murchison              to Whewell,     of the
 previous year          : —
      "  I    learn     by the papers of this day that Sedgwick has
 had     a  very bad accident, and has fractured his right arm,
 and as, of course, he is             in durance and suffering,        I do not
 think of writing             to him.      I will, however, be very much
 obliged       to you to convey to him my kindest                 regards,  with
 my hearty wishes that the year which we enter on to-day
 may bring very different fortune to him than that which has
passed.          In  the summer he wrote to describe the abscess               in
                      '
his leg        as a       volcanic eruption."       Dislocations or faults in
various parts of his body are, poor fellow, no new things to
him    !     He is specially unlucky on horseback.                  I have  just
been out shooting [at               Up Park], and young Tom Erskine,
one of your lads at              Trinity, who was with       me,  tells me that
Sedgwick's horse is called The Mammoth, and is an enormous
animal      !    No wonder, then, if he is bruised           so  much by such
a catastrophe          as   being rolled under the monster.
     " It is
                  high time, however, that my dear old friend should
abstain from these gambols, and                if  he can be persuaded that
the gout can be as well kept off by good peripatetic discip

    Indifferent health and numerous ailments had undoubtedly
done much to hinder the work of the Woodwardian                         Pro
fessor.     He took his revenge by playfully satirizing them
and their victim.         Did ever man, for instance, draw a more
absurd picture of himself than is given in the following
letter, written (14th       April   1851) from his canonry at          Nor
wich    ?  In estimating      the amount of Sedgwick's work, and
the hindrances he had to struggle against, we must bear                   in
mind his continual          conflict with bodily infirmity,           which
even though sometimes            partly imaginary, was none the less
irksome.

am picked to the bones, and though               I  have a good income
for an old bachelor,        I   do not always      contrive to make the
ends meet, so that       I  am poorer and poorer every year.             But
I  do mean to mend my ways, turn a churl, and save money
for my executors.
       I
     " have had a miserable           residence.     The influenza never
quite left its hold upon        me, and the cold cathedral      confirmed
its grasp.     I  did my best to barricade           my lungs from the
cold air.     Ever since      I  came into residence      I have   gone to
my stall with a black velvet cap arching over from the
occiput to the    os  frontis, and a tremendous          black respirator
over my jaws and muzzle.             So that   I look like  a true angelic
church-militant going to war with a black helmet and a visor
so   far uplifted    as  just to show a running snout and              a big
pair of blear    eyes.      My cold is better, though my lungs are
still impatient of cold air.

the little stable was terrific, the pony and my Lord rolling

'
    Well, doctor, what do you say now to Mr. S. having
ratted?'        replied,   'Alas! alas! and the worst               is,   he   is   a
water-rat!'"
       After    a   prolonged     series of autumnal visits to country
friends, Murchison, late in the year, once more took his place
amid the work and bustle of London life.
         He had now again become President of the Geographical
Society, and was giving            a    great deal of time and thought to
the      duties of that office, especially to the most efficacious
means of increasing the prosperity of the Society.                     His forth
coming work on Siluria made, of course, but slow progress                            ;
and, indeed, his attentions to the younger Society were such
as to rouse         a   little good-humoured jealousy in the minds of
some of his older associates among the geologists.                         He ex
    cuses himself thus to the Master of              Trinity   —"
                                                               :   I   have been
too geographical, but was forced into the position by                      a    little
    flattery of my usefulness.            The       public men think much
    more highly         of me for having been the first who worked
    out mentally the Australian            gold,     1845-46, by comparison
    of what I       called the Australian           Cordillera with my auri
    ferous Ural, and for dwelling on            it   in successive years until
    the diggers discovered it."
         This   is   perhaps     the most convenient opportunity                    for
    taking notice of Murchison's               relation to the discovery of
    gold in Australia, on which,          as   is   evident from the foregoing
    sentence, he prided himself not             a    little.   Two years later,
    viz. in the winter of 1853-4, much controversy arose, both
    here and     in New South Wales,           as    to the respective         merits
    of different claimants.             Murchison,        who had previously
    shown considerable          sensitiveness       as   to the due recognition
    of his own claims,          again    threw himself at that time into

the controversy.        His own view of his position may best
be gathered from the subjoined letter to the Times            : —
                    " To  the Editor of  the Times.
       SIR, — In commenting upon a recent vote of the Legis
     "
lature of New South Wales, by which Mr. Hargraves was
recompensed      for having first opened out the gold-fields of
that colony, your correspondent          at Sydney, after an        allu
sion to the inductions of science, has thus spoken of me             : —
'
  Sir R. Murchison pointed out the similarity of the Blue
Mountain     chain of Australia to that of the Ural in 1844              ;
it was considered     a mere speculation,    and, as to any practical
effect, might as well have been written         of the mountains of
the moon.'
     "As    my relation to      this  subject is thus summarily
settled,  I must,   for the credit of the science which      I have    so
long cultivated, state the following facts       :— The   comparison
above alluded to was drawn by me after             an exploration of
the  Ural Mountains and an examination of rock specimens
gathered from the whole eastern chain of Australia                by my
distinguished friend Count Strzelecki.          In   1846  I    renewed
the subject,    and    applied my views practically by inciting
the unemployed Cornish tin-miners to emigrate and dig for
gold   in Australia.      Both of these notices were published
(1844    and   1846),   the one    in the volumes of the Royal
Geographical Society, the other in the Transactions of the
Royal Geological Society of Cornwall.           I  have every reason
to   believe   that they are the earliest printed documents
 relating to Australian gold     ;  and, unquestionably, they were
 both anterior to the discovery of the Californian gold.              Let
 me further state that they produced results;          for in 1847      a

                      THE GOLD QUESTION.                             133
 Mr. W. T. Smith, of Sydney, acquainted              me that he had
 discovered     specimens   of gold, and a Mr. Phillips, of Adelaide
 (equally unknown to me), wrote to me announcing the same
 fact.    It was also   in the same year (1847) that the Eev. W.
 B. Clarke, whose geological labours have           thrown    so   much
 light on the structure of New South Wales, published his
 first essay on the subject of gold in the Sydney Herald, and
referred to my previous comparison          with the Ural
      "
        Seeing, therefore, that    I had become a sort of authority
 upon Australian gold, and that the metal had actually been
discovered and could be profitably worked under due regu
lations,   I addressed    a letter in 1848 to   Her Majesty's Secre
tary of State for the Colonies,          explanatory of my views,
urging the desireableness        of such  a geological   survey of the
region    as   would realize auriferous     and other mineral pro
ducts.      That letter, written three years before         the   opera
tions of Mr. Hargraves, has, through the courtesy                of the
Duke of Newcastle, been printed among the papers relating
to Australian gold presented to both Houses of Parliament,
August 16, 1853.
      " My scientific friends are indeed         well aware that on
various occasions between 1844 and 1851           I  addressed public
meetings on the same important phenomenon              ;  and  I should
not have sought to encroach on your columns had not my
name been associated        in your widely-circulated journal with
the mountains of the moon, of which,          I regret to say,   I have
no knowledge, whether they be situated in the heart of
Africa or in our nearest neighbour of the solar system. — I

134            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.

     In  spite of the      frequent reference         to " science       and
"scientific induction" in the course of the controversy,                it is
not easy even for       a  partial friend to discover        in what way
Murchison's share in the finding of gold in Australia could
be regarded as      in any way scientific, or more than a lucky
guess.     He had come home full of his doings in the Ural
Mountains, and with some rather crude notions as to the
mode of occurrence of gold throughout the world.1                   At that
time he met Count Strzelecki, and saw his maps and the
collection of specimens         which he had brought home from
Australia.    Ready to find analogies with his Urals, Murchison
noted    a general    similarity    of trend in the Australian           and
 Russian    mountain ranges.         On looking at the specimens,
he recognised many fragments           of quartz, and when compar
ing the Australian        with the Russian rocks, remarked that
as   yet (1844) the former had not yielded gold.                   He knew
nothing personally, and very little more by report, of the
geological structure of Australia.        When, therefore, he advised
the   unemployed Cornish miners in 1846 to emigrate                      and
dig for gold in Australia, he had absolutely no scientific
grounds on which to base his advice.              All   he knew was that
there were crystalline rocks with quartz veins                 in Australia
as   in the Urals.       But the same might have been said of
almost any country on the face of the earth.2                   His  advice,
   1 One of his favourite, but singularly unphilosophical, notions on this
subject was, that gold was the last-created metal, and only occurred there
fore in the uppermost parts of any formation.        Theoretically, according
to this doctrine, there could be no profitable gold-mining by sinking
shafts into the solid rock.   He clung pertinaciously to this notion, until
the successful reef-mining of Victoria compelled him to modify it,
   2 Even now, with all the
                             experience of gold-mining since 1846, he would
 be an exceedingly bold geologist who, from the inspection of a few bits of
quartz, none of them containing gold, should pronounce on the auriferous
nature of the country whence they came.        Science has not been able to

 however,      was, under the circumstances,             as good as     could
 have been given,         for if  the miners found no gold, they at
 least    would      be  in   a colony     where      other openings for
 gaining      a livelihood       presented     themselves       much more

 emigration     ;   they might gain     a good   deal
      When        gold had     once    been    actually    found,   it was
 natural to desire         a thorough     examination of the country
 yielding it.      The world was ringing at the time with the
 newly- discovered marvels of the Californian               El  Dorado, and
no one could tell whether a rival to that region might not
 be found     in Australia.        It was at least worth while to ex
plore.      In urging this matter upon          the Government, there
fore, Murchison showed an enlightened desire for the spread
of geological knowledge and industrial development.                      But
he did not thereby establish any claim to have foretold on
sound scientific grounds the really auriferous character of
the Australian rocks.
      Count Strzelecki         appears    to have      been    the  first to
ascertain the actual existence of gold            in Australia.       But at
the request of the Colonial            authorities the discovery was
closely kept secret.         The first explorer who proclaimed the
probable auriferous riches of Australia                 on true scientific
grounds — that is, by obtaining gold in situ, and tracing its
parent rocks through the country — was the Eev. W. B.
Clarke, M.A., F.G.S., who, originally a clergyman in England,
make   BO  clear the circumstances which have determined the presence or
absence of gold in quartz.     If the geologist declares that the quartz will
prove auriferous, he has no more scientific ground for his assertion than
any empiric or miner with a divining-rod.      He makes a guess, and if the
prognostication should be fulfilled he may talk of his luck, but has no
cause to boast of his science.

136             SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                               [IN*
has spent a long and laborious life             in working out the geo
logical structure of his adopted country — New South Wales.
He found gold in 1841, and exhibited it to numerous mem
bers of the Legislature, declaring at the same time his belief
in its abundance.        While, therefore, geologists in Europe were
guessing, he having actually found the precious               metal, was
tracing its occurrence         far and near on the ground.           It  is
only an act of justice to render this acknowledgment,               which
Murchison       himself, through some over-estimate          of his own
contribution to the question, and probable ignorance of what
had really been done by Mr. Clarke, never made.1
      In the spring of 1852 Murchison is found taking infinite
pains over       the    preparation of his address         for the May
anniversary of the Geographical Society.              Seven long years
had passed since, in quitting the President's chair, sanguine
of the success of Franklin's expedition, then just sailing
from our shores, he had wished              it God- speed — seven long
years     of suspense       and   slowly dwindling       hope,    and    of
noble    efforts    for the    succour of the lost.         Against    the
ever-increasing conviction that further search for the missing
explorers was useless, there were some who yet resolutely
struggled,    clinging to every feeble thread of evidence that
might     seem to warrant         even    the possibility of survival
    1 Count Strzelecki's observations were published in 1845, in a volume
entitled A Physical Description of New South Wales, containing a sketch-
map and a good series of carefully drawn sections.      The labours of Mr.
Clarke have been the subject of minute inquiry by the Legislature of New
South Wales (1861), and the result of the investigations of a Special
 Commission appointed for the purpose was to show that his services had
 never been adequately recognised.     See Report from the Select Committee
on the Services   of the Rev. W. B. Clarke, ordered by the Legislative As
sembly to be printed, 1861 ; also a pamphlet entitled the Claims of the
Jiev. W. B. Clarke, Sydney, I860, where, in an Appendix, references are
 given to the dates and proofs of his services.

Foremost        among      these   noble-hearted believers         was Lady
Franklin.       At her own      charges she had equipped one search
ing expedition, and had largely contributed to the outfit of
two others.         In   the spring of 1851 two half- wrecked ships,
perched     on the ice, were said to have              been seen drifting
southwards along the shores of Newfoundland.                     Could these
have been the ill-fated " Erebus" and " Terror" ?                   The very
possibility of such a fact sent          a thrill of excitement through
the people of England, and gave a new impulse to the desire
either to find and rescue the survivors, or at least to learn
their fate and bring home their memorials.                    The President
of the Geographical Society had interested                   himself keenly
in the fitting out of the successive searching expeditions,
and now      in his address he places the subject of Arctic ex
ploration      and the fate of Franklin in the front rank of
interest.      He refuses to take the desponding                view, which
was     now growing general,            but,  in the interests        alike of
philanthropy and of geographical              discovery,     rejoices   in the
prospect of renewed search.
      Other topics of permanent            interest find a place in the
same elaborate         address.     The early labours of Livingstone
in South Africa are alluded to, together with those of Mr.
Galton, and the ingenious suggestion                (verified three years
afterwards      by Livingstone)1 is made from all the data then
available,     that Africa had         originally    had a basin shape,
formed     by an outer range             of harder and         higher    rock-
masses sinking          into a vast and less elevated           central area,
and that this original structure             will be found     still in great

part maintained, whether the rivers escape through rents
towards the sea, or flow inwards to lose themselves             in lakes
or sands.        Proposed commercial routes across the American
Continent, and from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf,
and gold-fields all over the world, are discussed              with the
general and gratifying progress of geography.
     In   the preparation of such a detailed and voluminous
document,        the President necessarily depended         a good deal
upon the aid of the active Secretary               of the Society,   Dr.
Norton Shaw         ; but, in his usual thorough and matter-of-fact
way,    he had done his best to make himself master of                all
the topics on which he had to touch.            Indeed, geography and
the Society were becoming           each year more interesting to him.
His    soire'es   now partook largely of a geographical         element.
Every traveller of note who happened to come to London
was sure to be seen at them, while, at the same time, the
members       of the Society mingled there with other men of
science, literature, and art.         In this way   he strove  to give a
help to the esprit        de corps,  and at the same time bring the
Society more prominently forward.                The membership was
steadily increasing,       the funds, too, had considerably grown,
and there were no debts.
      In helping the         advance    of the Geographical Society,
Murchison brought out in strong               relief one of the most
notable features of his life, often alluded to in the foregoing
narrative, and still to receive further illustration            in later
pages.      He possessed very considerable influence with lead
ing men of all shades of politics.          He met them continually
in society     ;  he asked them to his house, and was            in turn
invited to theirs      ; shot partridges with them in the country        ;
and, having had a previous military             and sporting life, was

1S52.]           HIS SOCIAL INFLUENCE.                                   139
regarded by them as coming nearer to themselves                    in tastes
and pursuits than the typical learned man of science, who
was     supposed    to   be able to     talk only on his own pet
subject,   — beetles, chemistry, mathematics,           or whatever that
subject might        be.      The bundles of letters addressed             to
him, and still extant,         furnish curious evidence          as   to the
nature of his influence,        the way  it was used, and the multi
tude and variety of suitors for it.        At    one time the petitioner
is an old friend, whose nephew,             a most      deserving      youth,
needs a helping hand towards            getting a presentation to an
Oxford      Exhibition,    in the gift, or otherwise within the
influence,    of a nobleman         with whom Murchison              is ear
nestly requested to intercede.           Next comes a poor widow,
whose      great-grandfather,       or  other     remote    relative, had
known       some   equally distant       Highland ancestor            of  the
geologist,    and who would fain get her son into the Scot
tish Hospital,      or other charitable        institution    in Xondon.
Then a Scottish professorship           falls   vacant,    and instantly
siege is laid to gain his influence and aid, which,             if  secured,
are probably      soon set     in motion.      Applications       for testi
monials seem to have been sometimes almost                 as  plentiful   as
tradesmen's     circulars   ;  nevertheless,    in spite of other abun
dant     calls on time and patience,          he    did his best for his
clients, as their letters, grateful for aid and        kindly sympathy,
remain to witness.
       The Cambro-Silurian        fire which had been smouldering
for a little, broke out with renewed and unexampled energy
in the spring of 1852.           Murchison had not been doing or
saying anything fresh on the subject of North Wales.                     In
deed, he had made no material addition to the announce
ment of his geological addresses of 1842-43 already referred

 HO               SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                  [im.
 to.    Meanwhile, however, the Geological Survey had been
 steadily unravelling the structure of North Wales, and had
 pronounced       the rocks there to be     in the main only the ex
 tension, in folded and contorted masses, of the Lower Silurian
 formations of Murchison's original Silurian region.               The officers
 of the Survey restricted the term Cambrian to the thick un-
 fossiliferous deposits      which, in several areas of North Wales,
 were seen to form the base on which the fossil-bearing Lower
 Silurian rocks rested.         Sedgwick, however, refused to accept
this nomenclature.         In   a paper read to the     Geological Society
 on 25th February, he gave forcible expression to his dissent,
using language          with respect     to his old      comrade,      which,
though probably far from being meant to offend, was yet felt
by the       friends of     both    antagonists    to   be    too    personal.
Murchison's feelings         are told by himself       in  a   letter written
to the Woodwardian           Professor two days after the reading of
the paper      : —
     " MY DEAR
                     SEDGWICK, — In enclosing you one of my cards
for  soire"es,   let me beg of you to prepare the abstract of your
paper, so that there should be nothing          in it which can be con
strued    into an expression         on your part that          I   had acted
unfairly by you.         This is the only point which roused my
feelings the other night, and made me speak more vehemently
than    I   intended.       But    I  did intend to tell the meeting
in reference to that very point (what            I  forgot to say) that       I
have over and over urged you to bring                all your fossils and
complete the subject you had undertaken.                   It   is no fault of
mine that you did not do this. . . .
      " But
              enough of this.       I cannot presume to do more than
speak frankly         to you  ;  and whilst    I   daresay you        will not
 change your opinions          about   nomenclature,       I   again entreat

1s52.]         THE CAMBRIAN FIRE AGAIN.                             141
you to allow nothing to appear in print which can lead the
world to suppose that we can quarrel about a name.
        I
     " have sent Hopkins a most amusing letter of old Von
Buch about the Drift and Erratics, which ought,            I think, to
be printed as an appendix or         P.S. to the President's speech,
and    I  have begged him to let you see it.         So send   it back
to me, and pray let us wrangle no more about the vexata
yu&stio.       We have done many a stroke of good work to
gether, and      if  we had waited to describe   the whole Princi
pality and the bordering counties of England, the lamentable
position in which we now stand would never have occurred.
But    I  am told by Logan and others that       if I  had delayed a
single year or two in bringing out my Silurian System with
all its fossils, the Yankees would have anticipated         me.    And
you well know that Wales, North and South, was not to be
 puzzled out in less than many years of hard labour.
       "  I  have been grievously pained to be set     in antagonism
to you, but      I  can solemnly assure you that     I  know no pos
 sible way by        which my present position could be altered
 without stultifying my original view of the Silurian System
as a   whole, and my confirmed and extended views respecting
 it as   acquired from a general survey of the world. — Yours,
my dear Sedgwick, most sincerely,

      The reading of Sedgwick's paper produced a lengthened
debate and some commotion            at Somerset    House.      But it
nevertheless passed the review of the Council, and was printed
and published in the           Society's  Journal.      When,     how
ever, its pungent language,        stripped of all the humour and
 bonhommie of oral delivery, came to be calmly read in print,
there       was a very    general   expression  of sympathy with

Murchison.           At first  the Council       decided    to cancel      the
printed part — a curious decision to make when the Journal
had already been published and circulated over the world.
Ultimately Murchison was allowed to write a short historical
statement       by way of reply, which was placed               in the next
number of the Journal immediately after Sedgwick's paper.
     It  was a most temperate and friendly rejoinder, showing
the writer's very earnest           desire    to    keep   the   peace, and
persuade the world that,         in spite of appearances, no personal
quarrel existed between           him and his old friend.           Later in
the year he again writes to Sedgwick              : —
      "Nov.      22,  1852. —   ... I     can safely aver       that   I   did
nothing whatever to induce the Government surveyors                          to
adopt the line they have, and           I  never went into your region
until they had quite settled all their nomenclature,                  except
a skirmish to Snowdon           in 1842.       It   has a very bad effect
upon the progress           of our science to          see   Sedgwick and
Murchison         trotted out   as  controversialists.       All  our oldest
and best friends regret       it sincerely, and the more         so as there
is really nothing in the philosophy of the               case on   which we
differ.    We agree in the grand doctrine of a progression of crea
tion, and we both start from the same point, now that the data
are as fixed      in the British Isles    as they are in other countries.
    "
       Why then can you not state totidem verbis that the fossi-
liferous part of your Cambrian is my Lower Silurian, or                       if
there be this remarkable community of fossils between the
upper and lower groups, why not call on your part the lower

once proposed for what really now proves to be the same as
Llandeilo     ?     Such an explanation from you would let the
world know that there was no philosophical dispute between

more     will  these two things be united, and           I  therefore wish
that there        should     be   nothing    dissonant in our mutual
expressions       respecting    them.  . . .

mutatur, the thing remains the             same.     If you are ever so
gouty, and as you term yourself, stupified (which                  I  do not
accept), when you receive this, you must not quarrel                with me
for telling you all my thoughts and feelings.                   I  have too
sincere a regard for you not to do so, and the matter must
now be in your own hands."
      It is pleasant to turn      from this sad part of the narrative to
the amusing and most characteristic epistle of the veteran Von
Buch, referred to in the last letter but one.                 Such sturdy
adherence       to the old belief     in the midst of modern defec
tions and heresies          has something       almost heroic about it.
But in spite of its conservatism, the geological                reader   will
recognise the shrewdness of observation              and the wide range
of knowledge, even in minute details, which helped to make
Von Buch so deservedly honoured and admired                   as a magnate
in science : —

Drift paper.       The whole was quite new for me.                   I   think
it is a phenomenon            belonging to the catastrophe            of the
separation of England from the Continent,                so   ably and con
vincing illustrated by M. Owen, after the quadrupeds                       crea

only found round the enclosed north             sea, and not farther south.

the other side of Dover Strait along            Devonshire,   Cornwall,
or Normandie and Bretagne.             So  it was not the climate, but
the impossibility of Atlantic shells to reach the shores of
Scandinavia and Scotland,          which have accumulated           arctic
shells where there is no more their prevailing abode.
       " The shells in the Baltic are
                                           very small, and disappear
entirely since the Gulf of Finland.           The saltness of the sea-
water is not great enough.          So  it was in the Drift time, and
the opinion of a communication of the White                    Sea near
Archangel        with the Baltic in the Drift time is certainly
erroneous.       The shell beds are found in the interior of Hol-
stein, 262 feet above the       sea, and    70 miles from the North
Sea, at a place called Tarbeck, a curious fact, which proves a
canal from the North Sea to the Baltic in ancient times              ;  but
these shells      have no extension      in the Baltic.   The limit of
the shell beds with large      Ostrea,   Cardium, Buccinum rises to
the north of Fiinen, then from the             Kullen to Wermeland,
Christiania, and along the Norwegian shore to the North
Cape.       But such beds are not found anywhere on the coast
round the Baltic, much less between Petersburg and Arch
angel, where certainly they would have been deposited,             if  ever
there     had been a communication from            sea to   sea.     Your
discovery of the shell beds on the borders of the Dwina
proves     it to evidence.   Even all the deposits between Stock
holm and the Wenern described by Sir Charles Lyell are not
formed of the large shells on the border of the North Sea,
but only of the small shells       as  you will  see them    still living
in the Baltic.       So old was the separation of the inland sea

     The preparation of the new work on the Silurian System
had all this while been making but slow progress, although
part of it had already passed through the hands                      of the
printers.     In  the spring of 1852 the author, always able to
get on faster with his hammer than              with his pen, took flight
from    the turmoil       of London life and tried to get           a little
quiet and make some way at Buxton.                  From that retreat he
sends (9th     April)   a  letter to his friend Barrande, from which
a

bring up the Silurian      System of 1835 to what           it is in
1852-3, are the real      motives    for my publication.         The
special object of this letter is to ask you     if you wish    me to
say anything of you or your labours       at the Belfast meeting
of the British Association, which begins          on the 1st Sep
tember."
      But though  a sojourn in the country may be successful
in putting an end for the time to the distractions of life in
London, it does not place one beyond the reach of the post-
bag.     Murchison's  correspondence,     always large, involved
this year an especial amount of work.          By a curious com
bination of circumstances,     a succession      of Professorships
fell vacant in different Colleges throughout the country, and
he exerted himself most vigorously on behalf of friends of
his own who were candidates.           The amount of personal
trouble he cheerfully undertook in some of these         cases  must
have    sadly interfered with his literary labours.          For in
stance, a chair   in one of the Scottish Universities had be
come vacant, and he determined,      if  possible, to have   it filled
by an old friend and fellow-traveller       of his own, of whose
abilities he had a high opinion.         He besieged the Crown
 authorities in whose gift the appointment lay, and received
 a verbal promise of the chair for his friend.       Months, how
 ever, passed, and   no formal presentation        was made.        He
 again applied to his friends   in the Government,       but before
 anything further could be done, the Ministry of the day
 resigned.    Nothing daunted, he successively        laid his    case
 before the   new Premier, Home Secretary,         and other mem
 bers of the Government, and, after further provoking delay,
 carried his point and got his comrade         appointed.     Imme

148                 SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                       [MBS.
diately afterwards             he entered into correspondence                with the
Lord-Lieutenant              of Ireland, and succeeded in securing the
presentation            to two vacant Professorships               in that country
for the candidates              whose cause he took up.                   Among his
papers, too, there is a foolscap sheet of MS. in his own hand
writing, the draft of a letter to the Premier, interceding for
an annuity from the Crown, as a mark of approbation                                 for
the arduous and successful labours of his tried friend                            John
Phillips.          That geologist, however, was immediately after
wards         appointed       Deputy      Reader        of Geology at Oxford.
Kindly, witty, able, and eloquent Buckland had succumbed
to the        insidious       malady which            had    slowly clouded        his
faculties, and a few years later brought him to the grave.
      In     the midst of these exertions                for others, Murchison
was summoned this summer to Oxford to receive the degree
of D.C.L.  In writing about it to Sedgwick, he remarked
that " the scarlet gown, with which your kind wishes in
tended to clothe me at Cambridge,                     has come at last among
the Oxford dons.               Science    is,

much         depressed there.       In     fact old Gaisford's saying has
come to pass,

hear no more, thank God, of this Geology                      !'
    The British Association assembled this year at Belfast.
" The meeting," Murchison writes, " was really successful,
and in every way good, except                    that I     have been too much
travaille by dinners, speeches,               etc.,   particularly in beginning
with an awful feast to the Lord-Lieutenant,                             at which the
Mayor presided — twenty- two toasts, and                       a       sederuut   from
six   till   one   !"
      After the meeting he took                  a    tour in Ireland with his
friend De Verneuil and             a     Eussian traveller, whom he had

                    " REALLY

  brought to the Association.             Of that Eussian acquaintance
  (who,    it is needless to add, was not his esteemed friend
  Von    Keyserling),       he   records   the  following    anecdote    :—
 " When we went to a
                                   great evening party to meet the
  Viceroy,      Lord    Eglinton,    at  Sir H. Bateson's,     my friend
 T— fell much in          love with the pretty wife of the General
                  I
 commanding,        and thought he had made a conquest, inasmuch
 as she asked        him to dinner next day.         There he went, but
 what was his woe when all the lords and ladies having gone
 out from the room, he was left to come out with the parson                   !
 He came to the great ball afterwards,               where   I found    him
 sulky    as a bear.      It was    in vain to explain to him that all
 the people there except himself had high titles.             He thought,
 as a stranger, he ought to have been preferred            to  all    I had
afterwards       a good opportunity of gratifying his pride.         When
we were visitors to Lady Londonderry, at Garron Tower, on
the coast of Antrim,          I happened to meet Lady L. first, when
she said,
              '
                 But where is the Russian Prince        ?'   I  replied,
                                                                           '
                                                                             I
am charmed to hear you give my friend that title, and                if you
will only treat him         as a  Prince, all will  be set to rights.'       I
then of course explained how he had been offended.                     Now
it   so happened       that the General and his wife arrived soon
after, and also many notables.              But when dinner was an
nounced, Lady L. gave her arm to               T—   and led off.     Never
was a man so enchanted,            and   in the evening he said to me,
'
   You   see,    my dear fellow, when one comes into really good
society, one's right position is at once recognised           !'"
       The brief tour would appear to have been meant more
for the purpose of showing De Verneuil and the Eussian
" Prince"        a little   of Irish life    and   hospitality    than for
geological ends.         But of course rocks, soils, and bogs were

 150          SIR RODERICK MURCH1SON.                        [UB.
looked at on the way.      Lady Murchison had not crossed to
Ireland, but awaited the return of her husband at the Menai
Straits, where, with his companions,        he rejoined her.     A
week was spent    in leisurely crossing Wales by way of some
of the more interesting geological sections.     The sight of the
Welsh mountains,      and partly    the furious storms     of the
equinox, frightened their Russian friend, who had again lost
his heart at Dublin, and was now in no mood for prosaic
geology.    So we find the following entry      in the diary   : —
" Took leave of the
                      great T. at the pont of Aberglaslyn, after
he had gone round Snowdon        in   a car, and  in his Parisian
boots.    The good De Verneuil       stuck to me, and, in ad
vancing with him, we soon got to work.         Admirable proofs
 of grinding and rubbing action on the rock bosses which
 advance into the flat plains of the ancient bay of Tremadoc."
 They visited Mr. Ramsay,      and were taken by him to the
 flanks of Moel Wyn to       see  the Lingula    flags ; ascended
 Cader Idris in a bright morning after the storms, with the
 Geological Survey map in their hands, turned thence to the
 hills of Old Radnor, and     so down by Hereford to the      sec
 tions of the Old Eed Sandstone on the Wye.         They reached
 Belgrave   Square on the last day of September.
      But that the return to town did not imply an immediate
 return to geological work is shown by a note written next
 day to Whewell : —
                      " I have just arrived from Ireland vid
 Wales, having (to the great satisfaction      of my wife) been
 obliged  to travel 150 miles from the Menai Straits in our
 own carriage — a strange    thing this to say in this railroad
 age.   We came through Eadnor, Hereford, and all my old
 ground — De Verneuil with us.       I will send you a last word
 on the Silurian rocks.   At Belfast   there was but one opinion

My wife is in         the country, and      I   am going to  join her, to
shoot pheasants."
      To complete the details needful for the completion of the
new Silurian volume, further work in the field was found to
be called      for.    Especially necessary had it become to re-
examine some of the original sections in the Silurian country,
regarding which Sedgwick on the one hand, and the officers
of the Geological Survey on the other, had come to views
different from those which appeared in The Silurian System.
Accordingly, part of the year 1853 was given to this task.
 After a dutiful         visit   to the   old General,     his  uncle,     at
 Cheltenham,        and   the    customary      exchange   of Peninsular
 reminiscences,      Murchison repaired once more to the Glouces
 tershire hills.        I
                      " went," he            "
                                       says, to look over some of my
 old ground, partly with Hugh Strickland, viz., May               Hill, and
 the cuttings of the new railroad around the south end of the
 Longhope ridges.           I  then cautioned      him of the danger of
 working on those lines.            It  was prophetic of his fatal end,
 when he was cut in two pieces at the mouth of a tunnel1                    I
 also   made     some detailed sectioi        s   near  Ludlow,    railroad
 cuttings there having laid open new junctions               — pottering
 work, but necessary in these pottering times, the chief work
 being over."
     1 This melancholy event happened only a few weeks after the ramble
 mentioned in the text. After the Hull meeting of the British Associa
 tion, this amiable and accomplished naturalist was engaged in examining
 a geological section at the mouth of the Clanborough tunnel on the Great
 Northern Railway, when he met with his sad and sudden death.              He
 heard a locomotive's whistle, and looking along the line saw a train com
 ing up, on which he stepped across to the other set of rails ; but at the
 same moment an express train dashed out of the tunnel upon him.

152             SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                           [1S53.
       A   good deal in the way of the comparison                         of geological
sections of the palaeozoic rocks, especially those of Permian
age,    remained        also to be done on the Continent before a
broad      general picture of the                 succession     and diversities of
these rocks throughout Europe could be given in the chapters
of the forthcoming work.                        To get this work done another
tour in Germany was undertaken.                         Mr. (now Professor) John
Morris accompanied Murchison on this expedition, his prac
tised eye and wide knowledge                      of fossils being likely to give
great assistance               in the comparisons         about to be instituted.

at Prague.       Thence             a    rapid journey northwards brought the
travellers to Berlin, where they met Humboldt, G. Rose, and
other kindred spirits.                     Turning     southward and westward
again, they hammered                      through the Devonian rocks, taking
Frankfort      by the way,                 as   far   as the    western    end of the
Taunus.       Reaching thus the Rhine again, they looked once
more at its rocks, and descended its course                       until they struck

       Shortly after reaching            England Murchison sent               a    long
narrative of this ramble to Sedgwick.                      Its voluminous de
tail, which even Sedgwick confessed himself for want of
good maps unable                 to follow, would be out of place here.
But        a few    passages may         be quoted        showing,    as    they do
in    a    touching way, the writer's tender regard for his friend,
and his unwillingness to believe                 that any lasting estrange
ment could ever arise between them.
       "   Oct.    13, 1853. — MY DEAR SEDGWICK, — As                this is about
the time you            betake yourself to the College               walls,   I    now
write to tell you of some results of my .late journey in Ger
many, being sure that they                 will interest        you deeply.          In
fact       I was   going to write to you from Berlin, where                   I    went
to visit old Humboldt, and to tell you of the denouement
of our old region of Saalfeld and adjacent tracts of Thiiringia
and        Saxony.          I    intended that the annonce           should have
reached you          in your geological chair at Hull,2 if only to show
to the world that no bickerings about Lower Silurian                                and
Cambrian interfered with our friendship. But you know what
foreign travel          is,     and how ever moving and fidgety             a     fellow
I    am, and really         I     had no time.    Besides,   I    had then only
passed by Bonn, Cologne, and the grand new railroads which
have        so    finely laid open all our old sections                    along     the
Westphalian frontier.                If ever   you go there again, and take
the Eisenbahn from Diisseldorf, you                   will   stop at every other
station, and between them be whisked through the grandest
slashes          possible       which have been made in our Devonians,

   This was subsequently effected.

the Ehine, and had not conversed with the Sandbergers and
Von Dechen and others.                    So  I felt  that   I should be pre
mature, and perhaps erroneous.                  Now     I have   it all in hand,

                          days at Prague with Barrande, besides the
twelve days we spent together                     at Carlsbad,      where   most
fortunately         I  found him.          His collections are more mar
vellous than ever.            But the great point of interest for you,
as   for myself, is to know the final result of all the Ehenish
business.         As we went thither like Luther and Melanchthon
                                                                    '
(I    hope not        like Calvin), to reform the old                 greywacke
creed,'     it is right that we should show to what extent we
also erred.          Not that any of our sections were erroneous —
not that the chief physical masses are not                        as we placed
                                                                            '

Why, there is no geologist alive or dead who has not made

adopted, we mean the same thing                          :    our views on the pro
gressive         creations,       on the        true order,          on       the      infinitely
greater intensity of former causation                        — on    these and numer

      To this long letter, Sedgwick sent                       a    long answer.              The
generous  spirit in which he could still meet the advances

 tone   of your letter.    It   is frank and friendly, as     it ought to
 be, and      as your letters used to be.        Two or three things
 helped to set my back up.            I  know that   I  am a great pro-
 crastinator, partly from temperament,             partly from multi
 tudinous engagements         that pull hard at        me,   and chiefly
 from    a   condition of health which for months           and months
 together      makes   writing     and sedentary      work very very
 irksome, and almost impossible.             Still, though     a   man    is
 behind time with his rent, he rather grumbles when he finds
 on coming back to his premises that          a neighbour has turned
 out his furniture, taken possession, and locked the door upon
him.       This is exactly what you did."        And then he reopens
the question in the wholly groundless belief that his friend
had " stolen a march upon him," and in total forgetfulness
 of the fact, which has already been proved in this narrative,
that Murchison actually consulted him and made him privy,
by sending both        MS.  and proof-sheets,      to all that he was
doing and meant to          do.     Sedgwick's    confession     as to  his
own dilatoriness is valuable,           for that temperament        of his
led directly to the whole of the dispeace.
       In   the October of this year died, at Bath,         General Sir
Alexander        Mackenzie — the military       hero    of Murchison's
boyhood, the guardian and commanding               officer under whom
he passed his youth, the friend and companion               of his riper
years.      Death had recently been busy severing               the  links
that bound the matured            geologist with the old Peninsular
days.       No tie had connected him more closely and fondly
with them than that which was now broken by the decease
of his uncle.
      Before passing from the record           of this year we may
linger for      a moment    over     the  memory of another         friend

158             SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                               [isss.
whom it carried away into the past — Leopold von Buch.
This    illustrious   man has      already     appeared     in the pages
of this biography,      but mainly under the aspect             of oddity
and eccentricity, which was            the    aspect under which         he
first appeared to casual          observers.      But it is    a pleasure
as   well    as  a duty, in quitting the narrative of the busy
years    during which his active         spirit traversed Europe, to
bear a tribute, however         humble, . to the genius wherewith
he lighted up every branch of science                 which he touched.
His    mental vision was          as  wide     as  it was definite     and
clear.      Admirably     conversant     with      details,  he  was    yet
gifted with that far-searching philosophic spirit which ever
strives    to look through the scattered            facts up to the laws
which govern them.          Probably no geologist of his time had
so  wide    a range   of knowledge and acquirement.               He was
great and original      in physical geography, in dynamical and
stratigraphical geology, in palaeontology.               In  each one of
these branches of science he was a pioneer,               seeing far into
the darkness, and casting         in front of him the clear light of
his own genius to guide the way of subsequent                   explorers.
Personally, too, with        all his idiosyncrasy, impulsiveness,
and    quickness of temper, he was at bottom one of the
largest-hearted     of men, full of tenderness and generosity, care
less of himself, sympathetic,        and actively benevolent towards
others.      With no family or official ties, and possessed of
an income which, though slender,             sufficed   for his moderate
wants, he had rambled all over Europe, everywhere                 making
the acquaintance       of those who followed the same pursuits,
and evincing a personal         interest   in them.      And thus when,
at the ripe age of seventy-nine,           Von Buch, active and in
domitable to the last, was gathered to his rest, there was

hardly     a corner    of the globe into which geology had made
its way where his death was not felt            as a personal    loss.
     By the    decease    of General Mackenzie Murchison received
 a very considerable        addition to his fortune.        In  the mean
 time, however, the event involved him in much extraneous
 work which sadly interrupted the progress of his literary
                                                                       "
 labours.     Writing to his friend Mr. Murray he says, The
 decease of my uncle,         with the business        it  has necessarily
 thrown on me, to say nothing of the Bellot Testimonial,
 with which they saddled           a  willing horse, have shut up         the
 book   for ten days.         Moreover,     the printers have      sent me
 nothing, whilst people tell me that you have advertised it
 as coming out      !   Five entire chapters are not written, and
 the index is not begun, so that the issue of the work, in its
 entirety, this autumn, is utterly impracticable."
      The summer         of the following year (1854) had begun
 before    the book was actually published.               At last it   made
 its  appearance      as    a stout octavo      volume of 523 pages,
 with abundant woodcuts              and   plates of fossils,    under the
 appropriate and euphonious            title of Silwria.      It  was dedi
 cated to De la Beche, by whose labours and those of his
 associates   in the Geological Survey the area of the Silurian
 kingdom has been          so effectively extended.
     As    the publication of this work marks another stage                in
 the progress of British palaeozoic geology,         it may   be desirable,
 in conformity with the plan followed in the foregoing narra
 tive, to take here      a  rapid and general view of what had been
 done    in that department of science since the appearance of
 the original    Silurian System.        The number of labourers had
 so increased,    and the field of their work had now been so
  widened,    that any adequate review of this subject must

necessarily lie wholly        beyond    the  scope of a biography.
Still   a mere    outline will be useful in enabling us to            see
where    in his progress Murchison now stood, and what his
relations     were   to   the  onward march        of his     favourite
science.     The non-geological reader, to whom           a  risumA of
the   stages  of advance, already in great part noted in pre
vious pages, is irksome, may pass over the remainder of this
chapter.     To the geologist, however,     it may not be without
advantage to pause here for a        little to cast   a  glance back
ward, with the view of distinctly realizing the point at which
palaeozoic geology had now arrived.
     At    the time when the       Silurian System appeared, the
rocks which had once been classed under the vague terms
" transition"          "                                   in England
                 and     greywacke" were grouped
into two great series.        Of these one had been elaborately
worked out by Murchison, and had received from him the
name of Silurian.       The other, stretching through the moun
tainous regions of Wales and Cumberland, had been resolutely
grappled with by Sedgwick, who, after partly unravelling
the intricate structure of       North Wales, termed this series
 Cambrian.      It was believed, as we have already          seen, both
by these two observers and, on their authority, by the rest
of geologists, that the so-called Cambrian rocks lay deep
beneath     the various groups    into which the Silurian masses
had been divided.         No distinctive fossils had been found
in them, and in this respect, admirably            as   their physical
structure and      mineral subdivision       were   worked      out    by
Sedgwick, they failed to offer the same facility for com
parison with other regions          which    the  well-characterized
suites of fossils    gave to the Silurian      series.     Fossils had
indeed been collected by him from his Cambrian masses, but

they lay packed away for years, and when at last examined
they were found to present a wholly                    Silurian character.
Still it   was hoped that more extended research might yield
peculiar groups          of fossils, and      thus enable zoological            as
well   as  lithological lines to be drawn through the vast mass
of Cambrian strata.           This hope had not been realized.1
      In  course of time, however, as detailed             in the foregoing
chapters,      various     other     observers   began      to   look at the
arbitrary line of division which had been drawn between
the two territories of Cambria and Siluria.                          That line,
drawn in part by Sedgwick himself, was not based on any
natural feature or series of sections.*            It was    inserted chiefly
as a conventional boundary to separate                    the     tract which
Murchison        knew and had named Silurian from that which
he had not examined,            and which      he supposed        to be occu
pied by the older or Cambrian group of rocks.                          When it
came to be scrutinized on the ground                  it was found to be
wholly illusory.           Mr. Bowman (1840), and afterwards                   Mr.
Sharpe, Sir Henry de la Beche, and Mr. A. C. Ramsay3
(1842), had shown that the Silurian mineral characters and
the Silurian       fossils ranged far beyond            the    supposed       line
of demarcation          into the so-called        Cambrian region, and*
therefore that at least to some extent the Cambrian rocks
were     undistinguishable            from what     had     elsewhere        been
termed Lower Silurian.                 Availing himself of these sugges-

   2 That for the boundary-line Mnrchison was not wholly           responsible,  as
Sedgwick maintained, is shown by the letter already quoted (vol. i. p. 307),
where Murchison, in writing to Sedgwick, actually alludes to the bound
ary-line in North Wales having been inserted by the latter, and evi
dently speaks of a fact which at the time was fresh in their recollection.
   3 It was in the month of June 1842 that Mr.
                                                     Ramsay found fossils at
LlandeUo, proving this extension, and the same fact was made out one
day later, but independently, by Sir H. de la Beche, at Llangadoc.

 tions,  and   strengthened      by the evidence which extensive
 foreign travel had brought before him, Murchison (1841 and
 1842) declared     his belief that the conventional line set up
 between his territory and that of his friend Sedgwick had
 no longer    any geological significance,         and that the term
 Cambrian must       cease to be used     in zoological   classification,
 seeing that the fossils found in the so-called Cambrian            rocks
 were proved     to be of Lower Silurian        types.    Subsequently
 (1842-6), the Geological Survey,        in  the course of its exten
 sion into Wales, ascertained that the very same strata which
 had been termed         Lower Silurian     by Murchison extended
 throughout South Wales, and they were afterwards                 equally
 recognised   all through North Wales.           De la Beche and his
 colleagues thus proved that the terms Cambrian and Lower
 Silurian were in a great measure two names for the same
 series of rocks.
      Geologists   had then to determine         which of the names
 should be retained.        Of the two terms, Silurian had been
 based not merely        on mineral characters, but mainly upon
 fossil evidence.     It  had therefore been capable of adaptation
 in other countries, and indeed,         as we have     seen, had    been
•actually applied to         the  rocks   throughout many widely
 separated regions      in the Old World and in the New.               The
 term Cambrian,        on   the   other   hand,   as   originally   used,
 described a vast succession of strata divided into groups, not
 at first by fossils, but    by mineral characters — the only kind
 of classification    possible   in the absence of fossil remains,
 but one which is apt to possess a merely local significance,
 and to be therefore      incapable    of general application.        This
 is a fact which must be kept clearly in view.                Sedgwick,

though he knew they contained                   some fossils identical with
known       Silurian       species, had    only mineral characters            on
which to base his subdivisions, and to offer for comparison
with the rocks of other countries.                But the Silurian group
ing was founded on fossil evidence, that                    is,   on the general
history of life on the globe.              It   could    be, therefore, and   it
had been, successfully            applied to the rocks of widely sepa
rated countries.
        When the Silurian classification            had been generally ac
cepted and extended into foreign countries, Sedgwick, after                      a
long interval, returned (1842) to the study of his so-called
Cambrian rocks.             Admirably did he unfold their physical
succession step by step through the rugged region of North
Wales.       He had accepted without sufficient examination the
assumption that Murchison's groups were all younger than his
own, and finding           it   difficult to reconcile this postulate with
the facts, had in vain tried to make his sections fit satisfac
torily into those of his friend.           When at last     it    was discovered
that the assumption               had been an error, he attributed          it   to
Murchison,       declaring         that the latter        had misplaced       his
groups, and claiming therefore the Lower Silurian rocks as
properly part of the Cambrian domain.                      But even had the
 author of the Silurian System been wholly answerable                         for
 the mistake, this could not have affected the indisputable
 fact that the order of Murchison's formations in the original
 and typical Silurian region             remained, and        still remains, as
 he placed     it.     Sedgwick's       vehement        contention     about the
 misinterpretation of the relation of the Llandeilo flags to his
 Upper Cambrian rocks, had really hardly any bearing on the
 general     question       of nomenclature.         The Silurian arrange
 ment was right        ;   the application of       it   to North Wales had

  164               SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                      [IK*.
 at first been wrong, but this error could                    not make wrong
 what had been shown to be right, nor could                        it   affect   Mur-
 chison's priority          in having established           a true      palaeontolo-
 gical classification.          He maintained           that, as he had already
 made out          the Silurian       classification,     rocks which proved
 to be the same as his Silurian groups could not possibly
 receive any other name.    By general consent, the verdict of
 geologists all over the world has been in Murchison's favour.
        It   is impossible,     however,      not to feel, and in such a
 narrative as the present not to express, a true and deep
 sympathy with Sedgwick.                    He had given the labour of
 some of the best years of his long and honoured life to the
disentangling of the structure                 of his favourite Cambrian
rocks.        He had far more serious difficulties to grapple with
than his friend        ;   these, by dint of patience, courage, and his
own genius for physical geology, he had successfully over
come.         It   was hard,     therefore,     to find that after all his
labour in conquering            it,   the stubborn       territory was claimed
by another,          who had borne no part in its                    subjugation.
Such, however, was the fortune of war.                      Murchison, by the
laws of fossil evidence, had established                     his   claim to all
territory peopled by his Silurian                 types of life, and when
these types, and these only, were afterwards found                        in Sedg-
wick's domain,             that domain     fell naturally and inevitably
into the empire of Siluria.
     Passing from the general question of boundary to the
internal development            of the Silurian domains since 1839,
we find that considerable               progress had been made before
1854     in two departments, viz., in the order and grouping of
the rocks,         and in the enumeration            and description of the
fossils.      In this      progress Murchison           himself had scarcely

any share, while, on the other hand, Sedgwick played a
foremost     part.    The latter geologist not only did admirable
work in the field himself, but by employing          as his assistants
such men       as  M'Coy and Salter, who brought trained eyes
to the identification and discrimination of fossils, he ren
 dered the most essential service         to this branch of British
geology.       The general order of succession        determined     by
 him among the older rocks of North Wales remained                  un
changed, though his term "Cambrian" was now very generally
reserved for the massive, and up to that time unfossiliferoua,
 strata lying below the fossiliferous Lower Silurian rocks.
 Taking advantage of mineral characters, he had arranged
 the rocks into great groups.         He showed that overlying the
 Bangor group, to which other geologists were disposed to
 restrict the term " Cambrian," lay a well-marked zone full
 of Lingulce and Fucoids, to which he gave (1846) the now
 well known and constantly used term of " Lingula Flags."
At   the same time he made out that over these flagstones lay
 another distinct zone, marked out both by mineral characters
 and fossils, and to which he gave the now familiar name of
 " Tremadoc slate."       Both these zones lay beneath Murchison's
 lowest Llandeilo rocks, from which, though          still showing,  as
 some thought, a      Silurian facies, they were distinguished by a
 general want of community        of fossil species. Thus the estab
lishment and naming of the lowest zones of life up to that
time detected      in Britain was the work of Sedgwick.1
      The Llandeilo group, the basement zone of Murchison's
series, had now been traced         by the Geological Survey over

a great part of Wales.        In like manner       the Caradoc group
had been found to spread over a wide district, and to be the
same as part of what          Sedgwick had termed          the   "Bala
group" of his Tipper Cambrian.             But in the course of his
work in the field that geologist had found (1851) by the
evidence of fossils, that Murchison, and after him the Geo
logical Survey, had probably grouped more than one distinct
            zone under the common term
                                                " Caradoc."     In con
geological
sequence of this suggestion,         the   Survey, on re-examining
the ground, found Sedgwick to be right.             The upper portion
of the Caradoc sandstones turned out to lie unconformably
upon the rest in Shropshire,          and to show quite an Upper
Silurian   character   in its fossils.      This upper part was at
first known   as the
                      "  Pentamerus Beds."         Murchisou, as long
as he could,    resisted   the splitting up of his original sub
divisions.    He had himself failed to detect any break in the
Silurian succession, and now that such           a break was proved
both by physical and organic           evidence,   he strove to show
that it was after all only     a  local phenomenon.        Yet it was
certainly general      all through the       Shropshire and South
Welsh regions.       The true history of the Pentamerus            Beds
had, however, not yet been ascertained.
     With the exception of       a  shifting of the place of one of
their characteristic limestone          bands,   the  Upper    Silurian
groups remained as they appeared in the            Silurian System.
     While all this labour had been bestowed upon the eluci
dation of the order of the rocks, another band of workers
continued busy with the fossils, which had been obtained in
far greater    numbers     than at the time when the Silurian
 System    appeared.      In addition       to   Lonsdale,   Sowerby,

 nation of the original Silurian species, younger men of equal
 ardour and industry had arisen in this country.                Foremost
 of these stood Edward Forbes, Morris, M'Coy, Salter, and
 Davidson.       By their researches the number of species in the
older rocks of Britain had been largely augmented, and new
 and ever increasing light had been thrown upon the history
 of the earlier forms of      life.1
     Another great addition to geological knowledge since the
publication of the Silurian System was the establishment
 of the Devonian System,             as already narrated.     That addi
tion had been obtained by the co-operation of Sedgwick and
 Murchison, with Lonsdale and Sowerby.                The separation of
 the Permian System            from the general mass of the         lower
 mesozoic red sandstones, and its insertion as the uppermost
 member of the palaeozoic systems, was likewise a notable
 change.
     Our brief retrospect, however, would be very incomplete
if it took    no account      of the remarkable way in which the
 palaeozoic classification,      established  in Britain, had been ex
 tended into other countries.            The share which Murchison
and Sedgwick had           in this extension has been traced in the
foregoing      chapters.     It  would be out of place to attempt
even a bare enumeration            of the names of foreign contribu
tors;     but those of De Verneuil           and Barrande     in Europe,

and of      Hall and Dale Owen in America, cannot be omitted.
In all     parts of the world the Silurian type of life had been
recognised        as   that characterizing the      oldest   fossiliferous
rocks.       A   vast number of new species had been described as
occurring in the rocks of other countries.             Nevertheless,     the
distinctive general character remained which Murchison had
recognised        as pervading the rocks classed by him under
the term
               "  Siluriaa"
       Such then was the general aspect of this subject when
he published his          Siluria.    That work gave a fair statement
of the state of knowledge at its date, and combining,                  as  it
did, the substance of so many scattered memoirs,              it proved of
great service        in promoting the methodical study of the older
rocks.       Three      editions have appeared, each removing          some
of the imperfections           and errors of the first, and proving, by
their steady sale, the useful part which the work has taken
in the geological literature of the         time.1
        It  was with the view of embodying          all this progress in
 one      comprehensive        narrative, that the author       of Siluria
     1 It would be far beyond the scope of such a work as the present bio
 graphy to enter into much detail in matters of scientific controversy.
 Enough (some readers may be disposed to think, more than enough) has
 been already said on the subject of the Cambrian-Silurian dispute.         It
 may be mentioned, however, in this foot-note that the appearance of
 Siluria revived the bitterness in Sedgwick's mind.       He believed him
 self to have been most unjustly treated by his old friend, and he gave ex
 pression to his feelings in language of a vehemence seldom seen in scien
 tific writings.     (See Phil. Mag. for November 1854, and Introduction to
 British Palceozoic Fossils.) He called on Murchison to express his regret
 for having fastened an unmerited accusation on him, and in the strongest
 terms denounced what he considered to be the geological mistakes of the
 author of the Silurian System, — mistakes now reproduced and aggravated
 in Siluria.     Most men would have resented such language and refused to
 hold further intercourse with the man who could deliberately print it.
 Murchison could not apologize for an act of injustice which he felt he had
 never committed,       but he continued to use every means of pacifying his
 friend, of whom he still spoke and wrote in the same old affectionate
 terms.

prepared   the chapters      of that work        Evidently one great
contrasting feature      between the      original Silurian System
and this successor      to   it lay in this, that       the  one work
was based     mainly    on    the author's   own     original   labours,
of which it was the fresh and detailed expression, while
the other consisted partly of a re-statement             of these early
labours, partly of an account of their extension by the author
himself, in his own country and abroad, and partly of a
risum& of what had been contributed to the common fund
of knowledge by other fellow-workers.             Valuable, therefore,
as  Sllwria was, and eminently useful         as a compendium        and
indispensable    vade mecum      for students of the older rocks all
over the world,    it lacked    the freshness and originality of the
earlier work.     Nor was it       so  easy to distinguish between
what had been achieved by the personal                exertions   of the
 author himself and what had been worked out for him and
 with him by other fellow-labourers pressed into the service.
Not that he withheld acknowledgment                 of assistance;    he
 frankly   admitted his indebtedness,          and entertained      very
 grateful feelings towards those who helped him.              But gene
 ral acknowledgments       furnish little clue to the appraising of
 the relative value    of each workman's        share in the building
 up of the edifice.       Fortunately for the cause of progress,
 this personal element is of but small moment.              The temple
 of science is ever growing in height and breadth, and though,
 like the mediaeval masons, each builder in that temple may
 wish to leave his distinctive mark upon the stone which he
 has conscientiously and lovingly laid with his own hands,               .
 he must    in most   cases   be content   with the purer satisfac
 tion of seeing the rise of the great building to which he
 knows that he has added something.

                        CHAPTER XXII.
                  THE GEOLOGICAL         SURVEY.
     HATING launched his volume, the author of Siluria had
proposed    another    Continental tour to supplement     that of
the previous year, and enable him to improve,        correct, and
extend    the account    of the German geology in that work,
which he knew to be capable of much amendment.                 But
the   execution   of this design was first retarded, and then,
though carried out, much curtailed by a succession of cala
mities foreign and domestic.         After an ominous     darken
ing of the political horizon in Europe, war had at last
broken out between Russia and Turkey, into which Britain
and France soon threw themselves.        That our country should
declare war against the Emperor whom Murchison so passion
ately admired filled him with surprise and sorrow.       He made
no secret then among his friends, though he found himself       in
a meagre minority, that he thought the war foolish and un
natural,   and so he continued to     think  as long as he  lived.
Writing to M. Barrande immediately after the declaration of
war, he says, —
                   " I  cannot tell you how much     I have  been
grieved and irritated by these untoward events.       I had  quite

never     cease  to regret that we should be at war with               an
ancient ally of near 300 years' standing. . . .
        I
     " have
                 given my best and arranged Silurian collection
to the British Museum, because the Trustees have purchased
yours.     . . .
     "  I think of   leaving London either the 21st or 23d         July,
my wife being at Lichfield House, Eichmond, for the sum
mer.      If you  get this soon you may write to me, Clausthal,
Harz, whither       I go to   see  Ad. Roemer, and ascertain       if  he
really has any true Silurian there.             I shall also endeavour
to fortify      my Permian foundations          by re-examining the
Todte-liegende of various         tracts.  This operation      will pro
bably take me to the south of Breslau."
    But the excitement of war-time, added to his own chagrin
at the breaking out of such a contest, was not the only cause
which kept his movements uncertain.              His brother, to whom
he was bound by a life of tender affection, had been ailing,
and the state of health of the invalid was now such as to
cause much anxiety.          In  spite of all their geological bicker
ings, there was       still no one to whom Murchison could             so
openly unbosom his innermost thoughts,             or turn so instinc
tively for sympathy       as Sedgwick.     When the prospect looked
gloomiest, he thus wrote to his old comrade           : —
      " Alas   ! my dear friend,      I am in a grievously afflicted
state, and quite unequal to much business.            My only brother
Kenneth, to whom          I am  sincerely attached, is stricken with
death, and cannot survive many hours, or days.              His malady

(a heart disease) has made frightfully rapid progress           in the
last few weeks.        I am myself bent  down by    a vile influenza,
which has left me weak,           and my doctor has ordered me
abroad.     But for this unfortunate state of affairs       I  should
have been on the Brocken.          I had resolved to see again our
old ground, and satisfy myself, in sitd,       as to whether there
are any fossil-beds older than the lowest Devonian."
     Three days afterwards he writes again : —
        I
     " had no
                    hope, but certainly was unprepared        for the
rapid dissolution of my poor brother, who died at half-past
four on Tuesday, 1st of August, in my presence.              He con
versed a    little with me even a few minutes before, and he
only struggled       to live on in hope of seeing his only living
sister,   Mrs.   Hull — but in   vain.   This is a sad shock for
my worn-out         nerves,  which required a cheerful summer
tour, and now       I  am nailed down by all sorts of business,
every act of which reminds        me of my loss.      We have been
loving brothers through life, ever since he           came,    at five
years old, to Durham school, where        I, being two years older,
had to fight his battles."
     It   was under the melancholy of this bereavement,             and
with the further depression         caused by indifferent      health,
that Murchison,         by medical advice, again set out for the
Continent.       It   could not be    a mere    tour for gathering
renewed energy.         So long as a hammer     could be carried or
a section be visited he must needs turn his excursions               to
a geological      use.    Hence he chose this autumn        a region
where,     amid much varied scenery, he could find plenty to
interest him among the rocks          — the   Harz and Thuringer-
wald.      He was again accompanied          by "the trusty John
Morris of Kensington."

       The gorges and scarps of the Harz, bristling with their
 dark needles     of fragrant pine,          remained       still what they
 were in the early days when the two knights of Cambria
 and Siluria climbed their slopes.             But of their rocks more
 could now     be said than was            possible     then.     Even into
 these quiet valleys modern          geology had made its way, and
 resident observers had gathered              collections     of the fossils.
 It had become therefore          an easier task,         with these local
 aids, to group the rocks        and fix their relations to those of
 other parts of Europe.         How Murchison and his companion
 now did this, and how, continuing and improving their work

joint memoir to the Geological Society.1                    Abstracting the
geological   matter     which went to form part of that essay,
there remains    little of any personal interest in Murchison's
notes of his journey.        It is clear enough, indeed, that before
he had been many days at work he had forgotten all about
his ailments, and become as thoroughly engrossed as ever
in " Spirifer-sandstone," " Stringocephalus limestone," Mela-
phyre,   Permian, Bunter, Trias, and other cognate subjects.

 meeting at     Liverpool      Of that meeting Murchison has left

 grand     Music    Hall    .   .    .   Much    that followed on other

 well together, getting       Drs. Conolly and Latham to preside
 on their own hobby.             I   steered,   I  hope, clearly through
 some difficulties.        On Monday           I  proposed   the Duke of
 Argyll    as our  next President at Glasgow.          ... At the grand
 Presidential dinner in the Philharmonic, attended by seven
 hundred persons,        I  was put        in the chair,    because Lord
 Harrowby had lost his voice.                 He sat on my right hand
 while     I  made the speech.           The best and jolliest thing,
 however,      of the whole was the finish of the meeting at St.

 It was a really good thing, But this killed me ! "

1s54.]         DEATH OF EDWARD FORBES.                              175
     The last phrase of this extract seemed at one time likely
to be realized, for immediately after the meeting             he got so
ill  that his wife, then visiting in Berkshire, was sent for.
Recovering soon, he moved southwards,               and   in November
went to Up Park.          But to be there at that time of the year
and not to have a gun       in his hands formed no part of his plans.
The result might have been anticipated.               He returned     to
London in a very low state of health.              But his admirable
constitution carried him through this grand climacteric year            ;
only thenceforward        he abjured a habit for which he had long
bean celebrated     —he     ceased to be a smoker.
      To all lovers of science in Britain the autumn of this
year was clouded         by one, of the saddest calamities       which
had befallen the progress of natural history in this country
for many       a day.      Edward Forbes,      young,   bright, full of
promise,     and   already    with a world-wide reputation,        died
after a brief illness.       How Murchison felt the loss he thus
expressed at the time to his friend at Prague           : —
      " MY   DEAB BABRANDE,      —I    have been requested by Mrs.
Forbes (through        the medium of Professor Ramsay)           to an
nounce to you the distressing         news of the death of her hus
 band, Professor     Ed ward Forbes.      This lamentable event took
place    at a   villa near Edinburgh, on Saturday the 18th of
 November.        In  common      with all my contemporaries,       who
 loved and esteemed E. Forbes            as I did,  I mourn   over this
 sad catastrophe, and can hardly realize         it to my mind.      Six
 weeks ago, and at a concluding fe'te given to the British
 Association at St. Helen's,         near Liverpool, he sat on       my
 right hand in perfect health and in the highest spirits                ;
 whilst   I,  almost    double    his  age, was   then suffering   from
 fever and pain, which ended in a severe illness, from which

 I have been recovering, and which       I well-nigh   made fatal
 by giving way to the solicitation of my friends to drink
 champagne, stand up, and make a speech for the advance
 ment of science.       Better that several old 'sabreurs,'    like
 myself (who have pretty nearly done their work), should
 have passed away than that the bright genius and profound
 knowledge of Edward Forbes should be extinguished.             He,
 poor fellow   ! met his death from neglecting   a cold, which he
caught in his last autumnal expedition,     and in pertinaciously
insisting upon continuing his lectures when really       ill  Per
 haps you    will do well to write a few lines to Mrs. Edward
Forbes, Wardie, near Edinburgh, as condolences         from such
persons as yourself, De Verneuil and De       Koninck (to whom
I  write), will be soothing laurels to hang over the tomb of
her illustrious husband.
       I
     " have made all the corrections
                                         you have pointed out to
me in my     Siluria, and will also prepare the table of organic
remains    you suggest.     Pray double your criticisms.      You
know how many subjects        I had on hand, and how much my
time was engrossed by geographical and other public topics
when     I put my Silurian chapters together,      so pardon    the
result.    150   copies out  of 1500 only remain to Murray,
and these    will probably be sold next month."
     In  the progress of this narrative we have now arrived at
the beginning of the last well-marked period      in Sir Roderick
Murchison's active career.      Ever since he quitted the army,
he had been wholly unfettered        in his movements      by any
official  work beyond what he chose to undertake           in con
nexion with the different scientific bodies        which invited
him to conduct their affairs.       He had now, however, ap-

 preached      a  time when he once more placed           himself in
 subordination to Government control, and in that position
 he remained up to the time of his death.
      Sir Henry de la Beche, Director-General of the Geological
 Survey, after    a period of gradually increasing debility, died in
 the spring of 1855, to the deep regret of all who knew him,
 and bearing with him the respect of all that wide circle of
 geologists    in this country and abroad who could appreciate
 the solid and lasting services he had rendered to the cause
 of science.      Before  we pass on to the appointment of his
 successor, we may pause for a few moments to look at the
 organization      of the Survey, and    the nature     of the work
 which it was carrying on.
      As far back     as 1832, De la Beche had offered to supply
 data to the Board of Ordnance for colouring geologically the
 maps of Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset.            A   sum of £300
 in aid of this service was charged against the Ordnance Sur
 vey of Great Britain in that year, but he himself contributed
 the remainder and greater        portion of the expense.        From
 this modest beginning he gradually gained ground, and at
 last succeeded in getting his operations recognised          as  part
 of the work of the Ordnance Survey.          His staff of surveyors
 formed what was called the Ordnance          Geological Survey, of
 which he became director.          At first their work     consisted
  merely in placing upon the maps the relative areas of the
 various rocks.        As early, however,   as  1835 De la Beche
  conceived     the idea that the operations of his Survey might
 become     the nucleus round which       a  really national school
 of geological      and   mineralogical science   might grow, like
 the Ecoles des Mines of other countries.         He was, however,
 too sagacious      a   man  to go before   a  British   Minister of

State with so ambitious a scheme.                  He began in July 1835
by representing to the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr.
Spring Eice)1 the desirability of gathering together, in some
public place, specimens of all the economically valuable
mineral substances met with in the course of the Survey,
such     as  materials for making roads, buildings,                or public
works, useful metals, and, in short, all minerals having any
industrial importance.           Such collections, he suggested, would
be of great service        in embodying a large amount of informa
tion of great practical value, and not otherwise                  attainable.
They should be arranged,              he said,    with every reference to
instruction, and should be placed under the management of
the    Office   of Works.         These    plans received       a favourable
hearing from the Government of the time.                    They were fur
ther carried      out and improved under successive                Ministers,
from each of whom,             and specially from         Sir Eobert Peel,
came assistance and encouragement.2
      The first home for the incipient Museum was found in
a house belonging to the Crown                 in Craig's Court, Charing
Cross.      No sooner had the place been obtained                  than pre
sents of specimens          from the Cornish friends of Sir Henry
and the      Survey came pouring in in abundance.                     In  due

   * Sir Robert Peel took    a special interest in the formation and growth of
the establishment under De la Beche.         He himself drew up the Treasury
Minute dated 27th December 1844, transferring the Geological Survey from
the Board of Ordnance to the Office of Works, Woods, etc. In that minute
also the Geological Survey of Ireland, which had been begun by Captain
Portlock as part of the work of the Ordnance Department, and afterwards
discontinued, was re-established as a branch of the Survey under De la
Beche.     The Chief Commissioner at that time was Lord Lincoln (after
wards Duke of Newcastle), who likewise gave much time and thought to
the fostering of the museum and surveys. ID particular, he drew up a
full letter of instructions to De la Beche for the conduct of the various
services united under the guidance of the latter.

is55.]  HISTORY OF THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.                             179
 time, to make the collections available,        and to be alike useful
 to the public and the Government departments, there was
 added to the establishment        in 1839 a laboratory, under the
 charge of     Mr. Richard Phillips, an able chemist, and          a man
 whose incomparable         wit and humour are remembered with
 delight by his surviving contemporaries.              The rooms soon
 became      choked   up with contributions, and an adjoining
 house was secured.        Ere long this additional accommodation
 proved insufficient, and some of the collections were stowed
 away in Whitehall Yard.          At  last, when    in 1845 the Geolo
gical Survey was         transferred from the Ordnance           Depart
 ment to the Office of Woods and Forests, the Museum                    of
 Economic Geology         (so the  aspiring establishment was now
called), then under the supervision          of the Commissioners       of
 Public Works, had, through the liberality of the public
 and the judicious      management      of its guardians, so grown,
 and the need for far more ample             space became so press
ing, that the present building in Jermyn Street was autho
rized.1
   1 The following memorandum, addressed by the late amiable and ac
complished Lord Carlisle, who at the time was Chief Commissioner of
Woods and Forests, to Sir Charles Wood (now Lord Halifax), then Chan
cellor of the Exchequer, with the appended reply of the latter, has come
into my hands, and may be given here as having some interest in con
nexion with the founding of the Jermyn Street establishment :—
   " It has been settled that my department is to build a Museum of
Economic Geology. The rent of the building in Piccadilly, which the
public will have to pay to the Crown, is calculated at about £2000 a year.
There has been a plan for having shops in the lower storey, which might
bring in £750 a year ; but the conductor of the museum, Sir II. de la
Beche, and the economic Radicals, are vehement against said shops ; and
Hume says, if    I do not assure him that they are given np, he will this
session move an address to the Crown.      Will you let me throw over the
shops?"
   " If you wish me to denationalize to such an extent this sltopkeeping
nation, I cannot resist you.                                     C. W."

180             SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                 [was.
     The effective force of the Survey, at that time amounting
to only six assistant geologists, was now somewhat increased,
the   staff was re-organized,        and a branch was         established
for the     geological    investigation      of Ireland.      To aid the
Director-General        in the conduct of this augmented                 ser
vice two Directors were appointed, Mr.             A. C. Eamsay being
selected     for Great Britain,       and    Captain James, RE., for
Ireland.      Under each of these officers a small separate staff
of assistant geologists was placed, whose duties were to trace
geological     boundaries     on the maps, to prepare         sections, to
collect    information       regarding      the   geological    structure,
minerals, and fossils of the country, and to assist in pre
paring the maps, sections, and other publications in which
the work of the Survey was issued to the public.
     While this augmentation             took place     in the working
power of the Geological Survey, an extended scheme was
at the same time adopted, whereby the Museum should be
come a school       of applied science.         Besides    the collections,
now forming      a noble series   illustrative of the rocks, minerals,
and fossils of England, and the chemical laboratory,                 it  was
planned that a metallurgical laboratory should likewise be
 instituted.     Full  courses of lectures were to be organized on
 geology, mineralogy, mining, chemistry,             metallurgy, natural
 history, and physics,      so  that   a  thorough training might be
 had, not   in mining only, but in any branch of applied science
 which might be required.         A   room set apart,     in 1839, for the
 collection and preservation of mining plans, and miscellaneous
 information regarding mines, collieries, and quarries, had re
 ceived the name of the        Mining Record Office, and would now

General.       Hence, in the union of systematic              instruction,
with abundant opportunities for practical work in museum
and laboratories,       as  well  as in the field with the surveyors,
it   was    confidently believed        that the British " School        of
Mines and of Science           applied to the Arts" would be found
fully   as  well equipped,      and might be as successful,         as any
older school of the same kind abroad.
      The School      and Museum thus organized            were formally
opened by       H.RH. Prince Albert in November                1851.    As
Director- General of the whole establishment, it was the duty
of Sir Henry de la Beche to take the chair at the Council of
Professors, to see that the collections were properly looked
after and judiciously increased, to receive the reports of the
local directors, to examine, compare, and sanction for publica
tion the geological        maps, sections, and memoirs prepared by
the field- surveyors, and to visit when requisite any district           in
which difficulties might have presented              themselves      which
called for his supervision.           Moreover, when consulted by
various Departments of Government, the Director- General
was    expected      to  send    in reports upon the value of the
mineral products         of the colonies      and dependencies,      to re
commend        officers  to carry out geological        surveys in the
colonies, and to submit annually a report            of all his proceed
ings to the Department under which he was placed.1
   1 The first list of Professors was as follows :— President, Sir H. T. da
la Beche   ; Chemistry, Lyon Playfair ; Natural History, Edward Forbes ;
Mechanical Science, Robert Hunt ; Metallurgy, John Percy; Geology, A.
C. Ramsay ; Mining and Mineralogy, Warington W. Smyth.             By each
of these an introductory lecture was given at the opening of the school.

flecords of the School of Mines, vol. i. part i.
   In later years other names of note were gathered round him by the in
defatigable de la Beche, — Hofmann, Stokes, Henfrey, Hooker, Willis,
Huxley, all enlisted by him in the public service, either permanently or

     To direct these multifarious operations, and especially to
preside    over such a band of scientific men, and to control
their work, was an office of no small delicacy and respon
sibility.     Admirably had Sir Henry de la Beche discharged
his duties.      It  was his far-sighted shrewdness which created
the whole establishment,          and to his tact and good-humour
it owed not        a  little of its successful      progress, and of the
hearty esprit     de corps  which animated its staff.
     When this able geologist and excellent man died, the
growth and enlargement             of the services under his direc
tion led to some difficulty         as to the choice      of   a successor.
The recent stimulus given by the Great Exhibition of 1851
to   the action of Government .with                 regard    to scientific
instruction, made it desirable,        in the opinion of some well-
wishers to the cause of the higher and technical education
of the country, that more use should be made of the Geolo
gical Survey and Museum as a nucleus round which other
branches       of scientific   teaching    might be grouped.            That
definite action on       a large scale  would soon be taken in this
matter was indicated in the speech from the Throne at the
 beginning of the Session of 1853, when Her Majesty the
                                            " The advancement of the
 Queen announced to Parliament :
Fine Arts and of Practical Science will be readily recognised
by you      as  worthy the attention of a great and enlightened
for such time as enabled    them to give their assistance in some special in
quiry.
   The Geological Survey, under its two Directors, Mr. Ramsay (Great
Britain) and Mr. J. B. Jukes (appointed in 1850 for Ireland), included
some able and zealous assistants, among whom were the now well-known
names    of W. T. Aveline, H. W. Bristow, A. R. Selwyn.        In its palaeon
tologist, Edward Forbes, and its assistant palaeontologist, J. W. Salter, it
possessed two members, each foremost in his own branch of science.          In
its earlier years, Mr. (now Sir) W. E. Lugan had worked as a volunteer
under De la Beche.

nation.    I have  directed that   a comprehensive    scheme shall
be laid before you, having       in view the promotion of these
objects, towards   which    I  invite your aid and co-operation."
In   pursuance of this announcement       there was drawn up by
the Board of Trade, and sanctioned          by Parliament,    a plan
for the establishment of a Department of Science and             Art
under the Board of Trade, with temporary headquarters              in
Marlborough     House.      From    that centre   it was proposed
that    a great organization should ramify over the whole
country, having for its object the encouragement            and fos
tering of education in Science and      Art with   special reference
to industrial progress.     While leaving individual and private
exertion unimpeded,       the plan contemplated the purchase
and distribution, at    a moderate    price, of models,    diagrams,
and apparatus     for teaching,    the purchase    of examples    for
museums,     the loan of specimens      from the central museum
in London, and the obtaining of properly trained teachers
for such schools of science and art as each locality might
think fit to establish for itself.      These benefits were to be
imparted by a system in which every district and school in
the United Kingdom might participate.
      There already existed several independent institutions
maintained by Government, either wholly or in part, for scien
tific purposes.  These   it was now proposed to unite under the
new department.       Among them were the Geological Survey,
Museum of Practical (formerly Economic) Geology, and School
of Mines. In the ambitious programme of the department,
the school which had been established          by Sir Henry de la
Beche, for a specific and important branch of science-educa
tion, became the " Metropolitan School of Science applied to
Mining and the Arts," and was to form a sort of nucleus

round which it was intended that          a great   central establish
ment should grow, where every department            of science should
be taught that might be required for thorough practical
training in the industrial arts.
     The choice of      a successor    to  Sir Henry de la Beche
therefore    could not fail to be     a serious  difficulty to such of
the authorities who more especially interested themselves in
the development       of their comprehensive          scheme.     Their
views     are  well   expressed     in the following remarkable
document      by one of the most          far-seeing men       who     at
that time contemplated         the future     industrial progress      of
England :—

                                "  BUCKINGHAM PALACE, May 2, 1855.
     " It  is important that the opportunity afforded by the
appointment of      a new   Director of the Museum of Practical
Geology should not be lost for furthering the general scheme
for bringing science and art to bear upon the productive
industry of the country,       as recommended        by the Commis
sioners for the    Exhibition of 1851, in connexion with the
appropriation     of   their   surplus, and     as   approved    of   by
the Government.
     "
       According to this scheme, museums of science and art
 were to be formed on the ground purchased by the Commis
sioners    at Kensington,     the   main utility of which should
not consist     in their being     a mere    collection of curious or
interesting    objects,   but   as   serving for the       purposes    of
 National    Education    in illustrating     courses   of instructive
 lectures.

merge this       in a larger one,    so  Sir H. de la Beche cannot be
said to have extended the usefulness              of his department, but
has rather counteracted         the plans of the Commissioners by
confining his attention to simple geology.1
      " It becomes of the utmost importance that whoever
is    appointed      now     should     be    made     thoroughly       aware
of the views of Government, and accept                     the   office with
a    clear   understanding       that he       will  be   called upon to
   1 The tribute which the Prince bears to the indomitable energy and
consummate     tact of Sir Henry de la Beche is no more than just.          His
Boyal Highness, however, appears to have been misinformed as to the
real breadth of the deceased Director-General's views. He was perhaps the
most many-sided geologist of his day in England.        He had acquirements
in physics, chemistry, mineralogy, and petrography quite unusual among
his contemporaries. Moreover, he was an excellent linguist, and for years
carried on the foreign correspondence       of the Geological Society.      His
sketches of geological and pictorial scenes were singularly effective and
artistic, and to his taste and skill is due the style of section-drawing
employed by the Geological Survey.       So far from confining his attention to
simple geology, he had conceived a great plan for establishing in this country
a School of Mines at least as fully equipped as any on the Continent.      The
wide scope of this plan may be gathered from the mere list of eminent
men in various branches of science      whom he gathered round him (see p.
181, note).   It is probably true that he offered or gave no help to the
scheme for establishing a general school of Applied Science under the
Marlborough House officials. He knew that the school he had himself
founded supplied a real want in England, and that it could be successfully
carried on. He did not know that the time had yet come for the estab
lishment of a great general school, and though twenty years have passed
away since his death, the scheme for the equipment of one great Govern
ment School of Science in London has only been partially carried out. It
was no small part of his tact to be able to gauge exactly what he could
accomplish and to bend all his energies towards it. He felt sure that a
thoroughly furnished School of Mines was a thing of vast importance in
such a mining country as Britain, and that he could successfully launch it.
So far therefore from being really obstructive, he was in advance of his
time. To have planned and successfully founded the great Jermyn Street
School of Mines was of itself work enough for one man, yet it is only one
of the many claims which De la Beche has on the grateful recollection of
all lovers of science in this country.

in the light of        a  simple geologist,      but    as    at  the head

of science generally         as  applied to productive industry.
Besides    the collection    in Jermyn Street, which has already

      We are here only concerned with the negotiations for the
filling up of the vacancy in     so  far  as  they are connected with
the subject of this biography, and in this respect the story
can be perhaps best followed        in Murchison's own letters :—
      " 18th April 1855. — MY DEAU PHILLIPS, — I could
                                                                         say
nothing to your pregnant note          till now   ; for  it  was only last
evening (after post-time) that a resolve was come to on my
part, which,    if you  had hinted at it     a few days ago,       I should
have viewed you as charging me with folly as regarded my
health, happiness,      or peace of mind.         But the Eubicon, or
rather the Teme is passed,          as   far   as the    old Silurian is
concerned, and this is the tale.
      "
        When poor De la Beche was gone, very old and valued
geological   friends (not of the Survey) urged me to look to
the place as the man who, by his labours                in British fields,
and his application of his knowledge to maps, sections, and

books, was most entitled to the post, and who, from success
ful management of Societies, could best succeed in it.          But
I   peremptorily declined not only this appeal, but also a
gentle allusion of the President of the Board of Trade when
he sounded me    in limine.     At that   time my great fear was,
that geology would be submerged         in other affairs if a good
hammer-man      was not at the head of the whole. . . .
     " Who, then, was to be
                               (Geology and Palaeontology apart)
the rfyisseur?     A  split was to be deprecated       — two kings
would never answer, and confusion would arise.            Yesterday
sundry Professors, the four or five who are the oldest and most
influential, met together in Jermyn Street and unanimously
opined that   I was the only man who could keep the whole
thing together and make it work well.           This opinion they
conveyed to the authorities through Playfair, and the appeal
being made to me      in   so very flattering a way,    I could not
resist, particularly  as   I  saw that    I  should, by accepting,
prevent discord.     Whether the Government will offer         it to
 me is another question.
     " Notwithstanding your mot on the triple directorate,          I
view it simply   as the School    of British Geology and Mines.
The affiliated   sciences are    all subordinate    to that funda
 mental point.
     " If
          they name me, and should my health continue              as
 good as now, you know me well enough to be certain that             I
 will  do some good at all events, though perhaps            I  have
 offered to undertake what     I had better have left alone, as far
 as  my happiness is concerned.   — Yours     most truly,

ness      in adding your name to the list of good men who re
 commended            me to the Government to succeed poor De la
 Beche.          I would    rather have had your name than that of
 any living man, and it quite rejoiced me to see it.
       " The list when sent in to the Government was really
 most gratifying          to me, for it included the names of almost
 every man of real mark in various sciences, from the Presi
 dent of the Royal Society downwards, and                      so   your visit to
 the Geologicals         and Royals,     if it pro tanto injured your health,
 was of real service to your old friend.
       " But
                   though this potent list, backed          by the unanimous
 wish of the Professors in Jermyn Street (who did not sign,
 they being employe's of the Government), was sent in a week
  ago,     it   was only yesterday        that Lord Palmerston           sent for
                                                         '
  me    ;   and, after receiving a good cram               de rebus    geologids'
  said      he would beg the Queen              to appoint me, and would
  accompany          his letter to Her Majesty with the recommenda
  tions of my friends.             So old Fitton's scrawl and your name
  are now before         Her Majesty, and the thing may be considered
  done, though of course I can do nothing in Jermyn Street,
  until      I receive   due notification thereof."1
         In    a  letter to Phillips of the same date he writes            : —
         "  I   am in hopes (God willing) of being of some use, and
  more        particularly     in diffusing geological        knowledge more
  effectively through our upper classes, who are of all the com
  munity the worst informed in our lore.                     I will   back many
   a mechanic attending the evening                lectures   in Jermyn Street
      1 With reference       to this recommendatory memorial Professor Ramsay
   remarks: —       "I proposed to the Professors that Murchison should be.
   Director-General.       They agreed.    Mr. Cardwell was written to on the
   subject, and as he approved, Sir Roderick was then spoken to. The ap
                                                                  "               "

190                  SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                        [1955.
against most of our senators.                 Many many thanks for your
true friendliness.              Jukes writes to me from Ireland in                     de
light at the prospect of what was announced to him                                as the
wish of the good men in Jermyn Street.                              I   never would
have thought of           it,   unless unanimity existed.               The moment
my friends prevailed over my                     nolo episcopari,'          there was
                                             '
but one voice, and         I     am most grateful for          it
                                                                ;   indeed, I      value
that expression of good-will more than the place or any gift
of the Crown."
      It   was   a    somewhat hazardous          experiment for            a    man   in
his sixty-fourth           year, who for nearly forty years had been
free to go where           he pleased, and who had rejoiced to take
the full use of his freedom, to subject himself now to the
trammels of an office requiring for its effectual performance
constant        attendance and watchfulness.               He begins         as   might
have been expected of him.                 The very first day he discovers
that there       is   no proper general catalogue              of the contents         of
the museum, and he forthwith                 gives directions for the call
ing of     a   council of Professors to prepare            a   report on the sub
ject of    a    catalogue.       When he entered on his new office, he
daily recorded, in         a    sort of official journal, the items of busi
ness he had transacted,             — a   practice,    however,         which soon
fell into disuse.           From one of the early pages of his diary
an extract of more general interest may be taken                        :—

our desiderata, and some of our doings                     ;   particularly called

       "The Prince then explained all his views             as to the hope
 of realizing, at      a future day,  a Concentration      of all the chief
 scientific,    artistic, and manufactured        produce      in one great
building, and how the possibility of such an advance was
 stopped      by the want of money and the unwillingness                    of
 Government to spend in these warlike times                  :  suggested a
modified scheme for the erection of             a temporary building of
corrugated iron with glass, slightly raised            above the ground,
and warmed         by hot water, whereby specimens now spoiling
in damp places might be kept : l hoped that £2000 or
£3000 would be granted               for such     a  purpose      : regretted
that the frequent changes of Government brought new men
continually on the tapis, and nothing permanent was car
ried on.
      " He gave       a  pretty little lecture on the desirableness of
having at hand and united in the same suite of buildings
professors      who could illustrate        every   part of      a  porcelain
specimen,      e.g. :
                      —
         1.  As to the nature of the materials.
         2.  As to the chemical changes produced                by fire, and
                 mixture of ingredients.
         3.  As to the methods          of painting,      enamelling, and
                embossing.
         4.  As to archaeology, date,     etc.
H.E.H. then alluded to an influence now at work to have
the Royal        Academy transferred to the new building                    at
Burlington        House, and regretted         that the men of science
   1 This
            project points to the future buildings erected on the plan here
stated, and known popularly, from their site and shape, as " the Brompton
Boilers."    In due course, as the Prince hoped, they have given place to
the handsome buildings in which the treasures of the South Kensington
Museum are now housed.                                  '

should not be there.            I  replied that we men of science
should put our shoulders to the wheel, and endeavour to keep
                                                                             *
the Government to the proposed occupation by ourselves."
     A   natural consequence of the accession of official dignity
was an augmented display of hospitality at No.                16  Belgrave
Square.       Writing, for instance to Sedgwick, the new Direc
tor-General expresses himself thus          : —"    Besides the enclosed
'
  bow, tea, negus, ice, and turnouts,"         I  ask my special friends
who testified for me        as  fit to direct the Geological Survey
to eat whitebait with me at Greenwich                 on Wednesday the
20th.       I hope   you will be able to come."
     In   spite, however, of business and festivity, his first          trial
of official work seems to have pleased him, for after                 a  few
weeks     of experience he entered in his now irregularly kept
office-diary the following rather formidable syllabus of work
already accomplished : —
    " July 1§th. —
                        Nearly three months         have elapsed    since    I
began to methodize           and    record  my daily work.          I   soon
found this to be impracticable.             I have     worked here daily
from    1 1  to 4 and half-past      4, sometimes      from half- past     1 0
to 5, and even near to        6  o'clock.    I do    not find the work to
disagree     with   me.   On the contrary,       I  am    in better health
than when       I  began, notwithstanding         the excitement     of lec
turing to crowds         on the top of Malvern Hills,8 my great
Greenwich fete to forty savans,               and    all the dinners and

     "11. On entering office       I  made a vigorous     stand against
 a  Parliamentary document, drawn up by Playfair               as Secre
 tary of the Department at the Board of Trade, whereby
                           '                      '
 Mr. Cole was named          Inspector-General       of all schools and
 Museums, whether       in the metropolis or country.         I  insisted
 on   a special   exemption of        this establishment from such
 a rule, and  a paragraph       to that effect was accordingly         in
 serted.
     "12. Seeing the accumulation of volumes of the Survey
 publications,  I  have    already begun      to distribute the extra
 copies (preserving      always   a good reserve) to foreign bodies
 which will really appreciate them.            When the list is pro
perly prepared, such      a  distribution will be highly useful in
 making our services widely known, and their value recog
nised    throughout the world.          Hitherto   the results     of the
very valuable labours of my predecessor and his associates
have not been by any means sufficiently diffused.
     " These affairs, as above
                                     cursorily noted, to say nothing
of  a thousand   details, correspondences,      boards, council- meet
ings,   and so forth, have completely occupied             my first ten
weeks of office. — R.     I. M."
     Among the correspondences here referred           to, he still kept
up the old friendly one with Sedgwick, to whom, on the
30th of May, he writes as follows : —           I
                                              " am
                                                       sorry to hear of
your ailments.       I  trust that you are much too foreboding
respecting your duration of life.          You are no older than our
Prime Minister, who has to face angry Houses of Parliament
nightly, and is never in bed       till one or two   in the morning.
   "Your P.8. announcing your third fasciculus                or intro
duction, shows      that you are        as  active in mind      as  ever.
Quite agreeing with you that half-measures in arguments in

science are no measures,        I  would very much regret           if   you
fire any such Minie" rifle shots at your old friend as require
to be answered except in a perfectly friendly manner.
     "
        By the bye, you have no doubt heard of (if             I   did not
already tell you     of) the discoveries of fossils in our Durness
limestone      of Sutherland, by Peach.         He has corresponded
with me on the point, and has sent me some of the fossils.
I   have had them polished.          The forms (rude and           ill   pre
served as they are) look more         like Clymenice and Goniatites
than anything else (with corals) ; and if so, the calcareous
masses which we saw from Assynt to Durness, interstratified
in the quartz rock, are high in the Devonian                 !   I   would
like to hear what you say to this tclaircissement.                     I   see
great difficulty    in understanding it.
     "  If  the conglomerates     of the Ord of Caithness and Ben
 Bhragie, close to Dunrobin, are the equivalents of the West
Sutherland quartz rocks, they must also be           so  of the Scarabin
hills, which are in contact with the true Old Ked of the east
coast.      If, on the contrary, these crystalline rocks should
 prove altered equivalents of Silurian strata,        I  see nothing but
 what is rational
      " It is twenty-eight                since    we                 across
                                  years                 tramped
 Sutherland, and the going over of my well-kept journal (in
 which    I  have some of your writing and much of your mind)
 has been a source of great pleasure            to me, ruffled only by
 your announcement        of the forthcoming continuation of our
 disputation on things of which neither of us had an inkling
 in 1827."
      But besides reviving such pleasant memories, the dis
 covery of fossils    in these rocks of the far north awakened in
 the veteran geologist      a strong    desire   to revisit the ground,

 196           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                  [IKS.
 and the desire       soon passed into a settled           determination.
 Evidently    a most    important problem in British geology was
 to be worked out, and one, moreover, to which, by previous
 examination of the ground,          he perhaps       possessed     a clue.
 Accordingly he arranged to start once more for a survey of
 the rocks of the Highlands.           The British Association was
 to hold its meeting this year      in Glasgow, and he could com
 bine attendance there with his northern tour.                This excur
sion to the north-western headlands              of Scotland proved to
 be the  beginning of      a series  of Highland        tours, extending
 over a period of five years, during which Murchison, in con
cert with different fellow-labourers, accomplished                the last
great scientific achievement      of his life.
     On the 7th August, the day before setting out for the
north, the following entry occurs         in the office-diary : —
     " Last
             day in the office.   Before     I leave, I am   glad to have
made two good moves among,            I hope,    many others    :  the one
applying to my friend Lord Canning,               as  Governor- General
of India, and begging him to look to the geological structure
of India, and have surveyors           in all the Presidencies        ;  the
other to Sir W. Molesworth, the                 new Secretary      for the
Colonies,    urging     him to do the same in many of our
neglected Colonies.        The answers from both are favourable,
and   I have hopes of something        better.
     " On
            starting for the Highlands,           I  may fairly say that
the occupation       I   have  had   here     has    benefited    me,   and
realized   the    opinion of Cicero,       to which old Dr. Fowler,
of   Salisbury, adverted,    — ' Manent ingenia           senibus,    modo
                studia et industrial

1B55.]     SURVEY WORK AND VACATIONS.                      197
months of official duty.     From this time onward, though   it
may need only occasionally special    notice in our narrative,
the work of the Geological Survey continued to be      Murchi-
son's chief employment.      It did not by any means engross
all his time, for the vigour with which he had entered into
the duties of his office soon toned down.       He had leisure
for a summer ramble, and we now enter on the details of
the first of  a series  of such rambles   in his native High
lands.    He could likewise still devote himself to the in
terests of the Geographical Society, and take part, as of old,
in the business    of the Geological     But beneath all these
more   prominent    avocations  there  lay  a constant  under
current of official duty which, even when it might be merely
of a routine kind, necessarily demanded for its due perform
ance a good deal of time.

                     CHAPTER XXIII.
        THE GEOLOGICAL     CONQUEST    OF THE HIGHLANDS.
    IN the early days of geological        speculation,   it was a
favourite belief among the disciples of Werner             that the
primeval shoreless     ocean which     tumbled round the globe
held in its hot and fecund        waters    the substance     of all
rocks,  and that the earliest    of the deposits which settled
down on its floor were such        as  have received    the names
of gneiss    and schist.    The followers of Hutton, on the
other hand, maintained that these rocks do not exist now
in their original condition, that at first they were mere
ordinary sediment, like the mud, silt, and sand of the present
sea-bed,   and that they have      subsequently been squeezed,
hardened,    and  rendered   crystalline   by the action of the
earth's internal heat.    With the advance of years, the essen
tial truth of the Huttonian creed became clear.            All  over
the  world    proofs  were   obtained    that gneiss, schist,    and
similar rocks, instead of being necessarily the oldest forma
tions, belonged to many different geological    ages.   Sometimes
the  sedimentary deposits      of one period,    sometimes     those
of another, had come within the influence of underground
movement     and heat, with the result of assuming a more or
less perfectly crystalline character.     Hence, without    a careful

1885.]        PROBLEMS OF HIGHLAND GEOLOGY.                                    199
scrutiny of the surrounding region, it was scarcely possible
to decide         as     to the geological   date        of any mass of such
crystalline rocks.               Nevertheless,    the influence of the old
creed         continued to show itself.               Gneiss and schist, about
whose relative date nothing definite was known, were                          still
put down below the fossiliferous formations                       as   "primary"
rocks,        lying almost beyond the furthest limits of geological
history.
     No better illustration of this condition of things could
be furnished than that presented                  by the crystalline masses
which form the Highlands of Scotland.                        Looking back from
our present            knowledge to the state in which these rocks
were allowed to lie for more than                     half   a century,   it seems
as   if,      with   a   perverse   ingenuity, geologists        had refused to
examine them, although               all the while in possession of the
clew to their history.              The rocks still appeared in geological
maps and text-books as ancient formations lying beneath                        all
the fossiliferous systems, and even as                  " azoic," or earlier than
the introduction of            life into the earth.
         In    the earlier years       of this century, Macculloch            had
made some important observations                       on the geology      of that
wild mountainous region which stretches from the Kyles of
Skye northwards to Cape Wrath.                    He was sorely puzzled by
the red sandstones which rise into the huge terraced                       hills of
Applecross and Assynt.                By any one coming to them fresh
from an Old Red Sandstone                region, they would be set down
unhesitatingly           as   belonging to that geological system.            But
Macculloch, whose first belief was that such should be the
position assigned to them, found that they passed beneath

series.        Hence he classed them             as    primary red sandstones,

though how they came to be there, and what were their
equivalents elsewhere, he felt himself wholly at                         a loss  to
decide.     In   the course of his rambles               among       the   quartz-
rocks he had observed many curious tubular objects in those
rocks, and surmised that they had an organic origin.                        Fossils
         "                    "
in the primary rocks ! It could not be. By common con
sent the " primary rocks" were regarded as dating from a time
earlier than the appearance of life upon the globe — a time of
heat and turmoil, and chemical precipitation from a thermal
ocean, when no life was possible.                 Such being the prevalent
notions,    Macculloch's remarkable observations                    excited little
interest.     Probably he did not even himself perceive their
value and bearing.           And yet, regarding            them      in the light
            Worm-burrows in the Qtuuiz-rock of the North-west Highlands.
of what is now known of the geology of the Highlands, we
cannot but perceive that could any active geologist, not too
 enthralled by theory, have gone into that northern region
determined      to work out the whole problem, he might have
rendered a very great service to geology by introducing true
notions regarding        the origin and position of the so-called
metamorphic        rocks many years before they were otherwise
 slowly and painfully worked out.
     No such fortunate explorer, however, had sought these
wilds.     In  the year 1827, Sedgwick and Murchison paid the
 visit to them narrated in the eighth Chapter of this biography.
 But their minds were           so   full of Old Eed Sandstone at the
 time that they failed to realize the nature of the difficulties

which Macculloch had encountered.                They quietly set aside
his observations with the remark, that they thought it abso
lutely impossible to separate the red sandstone of Sutherland
from the admitted Old Red Sandstone of Caithness, and that
they must all be " classed with the older             secondary deposits
of England."         With equal curtness they dismiss his sup
                          "
posed fossil shells — we cannot regard them as organic."
      In the year 1840, B. J. H. Cunningham — a man too soon
lost to science —ventured once more into the fastnesses of
Sutherland, with the view of ascertaining               something   about
their geology.        Getting     away westward into the           rugged
ground of Assynt, he confirmed and extended the observa
tions of Macculloch.           In  a  singularly able Memoir, which
unfortunately, from the mode of its publication, has been
comparatively little known to geologists,1 he showed that
the red sandstones        lie upon an old gneiss, and pass under
quartz-rocks and limestones,            over which      comes an upper
gneiss.     He completely corroborated the remark of the earlier
geologist as to the organic nature of the bodies           in the quartz-
rock, and found them in abundance             in situ, though Sedgwick
and Murchison said they could pick them up only                  in loose
blocks of stone.        And we find him shrewdly remarking on
the fact, then new and unexpected,             that there    are gneisses
and mica-schists not of the oldest antiquity, but actually
later in origin than the creation of organized beings.                No
body seems to have thought             it a desirable   thing to find out
more about these organisms,            now proved to exist beneath a
great mass of the ancient crystalline rocks of the Highlands.
Nay, the very existence of such fossils seems to have passed

 out of sight, and for fifteen years later the gneisses and
 schists of Scotland continued to be classed with the primeval
 masses which were supposed to be earlier            in date than the
 first beginnings of life.
      How much longer the ignorance              and indifference      of
 Scottish geologists might have lasted         it may   be impossible
 to say, had not   a happy accident once more called attention
 to the forgotten fossils of Macculloch and Cunningham.               In
 the year 1854,   Mr. C. W. Peach, who had long been known
 as one   of the most keen-eyed collectors in Britain, and who,
 moreover,    added to his other powers an excellent knowledge
  of natural history,   so  that he knew the value and meaning
 of what he found, had occasion to leave Wick, where he
 was stationed   as one    of the officers of Customs,     and visit a
 wrecked ship on the coast of Sutherland.               Looking     over
 some of the weathered         blocks of the limestones    of Durness,
-he   found certain bodies which, though imperfect,           were un
 questionably shells.      These were sent by him to Murchison,
 who, as     we have     seen,   at  once perceived    the   important
  bearing which they might have in settling the             age  of the
 rocks of the Highlands.            At first they   were compared      to
  some Devonian forms, but, as the latter geologist           remarked
 at the time, this could hardly be their true position, unless
-Sedgwick     and he had made some egregious blunder            in their
 .sections of that north-west region of Scotland.            These two
  explorers had indeed been mistaken in their sections, but not
 quite   so   much   as   this identification     of the fossils with
 Devonian species would have shown.               They had correctly
 placed all the Highland crystalline rocks below the Old Red
  Sandstone.
      It was to clear up the question of the true horizon of the

is55.]            TARR AD ALE ONCE MORE.                         203
fossils that Murchison closed his diary at Jermyn Street and
set his face once more towards        the north.     He had not left
himself much time, for it was now the end of the first week
in August (1855), and the British Association was to meet
in Glasgow on the       1 2th of September, and he had promised
to be present.     But the point to be settled lay within such     a
narrow compass, that, with any tolerable weather, he might
reasonably hope to succeed, and to bring back the announce
ment of an important new step         in British geology.
      With Professor Nicol as his companion, Murchison sped
north by the Caledonian Canal to Inverness — not the
shortest route for the headlands       of the north-west of Suther
land, but one which gave him another peep at the scenes
of his infancy.       It  was a bright autumnal morning as they
skirted the green shores          of the Beauly     Firth.  The old
Tower of Fairburn caught the sunlight           as  they passed, and
Tarradale looked so quiet and peaceful, nestling down among
its old trees, that the former feeling of regret came back
again that it had been sold.         Time had been busy even in
that retired spot.      Among other changes, it was found that
      "         "
the mailers        or cottagers, who had formed so conspicuous
a feature   of the district in early days, were all gone.        The
little huts and rude stone walls had been cleared off to make
way for the large well-tilled fields, which now recalled the
advanced agriculture of the Lothians.
     From the thoughts which these changes suggested, the
transition was easy to those called up by the old burying-
ground of the Fairburn          family at Dingwall,     about which
Murchison     at once     proceeded   to inquire.     His uncle the
General had with pious care repaired              the family   tomb,
where, among other maternal ancestors, lay the Kory More or

Big Rory Mackenzie, before mentioned.              The effigy of that
stalwart Highlander, carved in stone, his prosaic descendant
now proceeded deliberately          to measure,     entering     in his
note-book,
             " 6 feet 4 inches."
     Amid storms of wind and rain congenial to that bois
terous climate, the travellers drove through Sutherland, and
at last broke ground in Assynt            Eight-and-twenty         years
had passed since that         stormy season        when the future
knights of Cambria and Siluria, then in the full vigour and
merriment of their early prime, boated and climbed through
these   northern wilds.       Murchison     had never been back
during the long interval.      But now, partly from the dreadful
weather,   and partly      from finding    so   many of his old ac
quaintances    gone to their rest,   Assynt wore to him       a gloomy
and depressing     aspect.    He writes, "   I  found the old house
at  Balnakill new roofing ; old Dunlop dead           ;  my kind old
friend, Anderson of Rispond, who sheltered Walter Scott                as
well  as Sedgwick and self, dead.       All   around gave note that
my day was fast coming, and that         I had    taken my farewell
look at the Whiten and Far-out Heads."                  Brighter skies
however,    eventually dispelled the gloom,          and he lived to
come back again, and yet again, to those headlands.
     The excursion was too brief to permit of much good
field-work being done in       so  rough a country.         In  spite of
the clear statements       of Cunningham, the travellers could
not shake off the old prejudice in favour of the Old Red
Sandstone age of the vast red conglomerates           and sandstones
of Assynt and Applecross.         They saw indeed that      a red con
glomerate and grit did lie between the quartz-rocks and the
older gneiss, and could not but admit that some at least of the
red rocks must be older than the quartz-rocks                and lime

 stones.      But the influence of an old and erroneous observa
 tion made in the tour in 1827 kept Murchison from under
 standing the full meaning of what he saw, and from drawing
 the natural inferences       from sections which he sketched cor
 rectly in his note-book.1         He still regarded it       as clear   that
 the stupendous       masses of sandstone in Gareloch and Apple-
 cross must       be   classed    with the Old Eed Sandstone,              so
 that   as  far as respected    any new light on the geology of the
 north-west of Scotland his excursion to Assynt left matters
 very much where they were.             He reiterated      his belief that
 the quartz-rocks, limestones, and over-lying gneiss and schist
 could not possibly belong          to the Old Eed Sandstone,             but
must be of much older, perhaps of Silurian, date.
      That the results of this tour were not very convincing
is further shown by the fact that Professor Nicol felt              so little
 impressed by Murchison's reasoning as to the high antiquity
 of these crystalline rocks, that he seriously suggested that
they might even prove to be of Carboniferous date.                      Evi
dently field-geology was at fault in the meantime, and the
first strong     ray of light would be thrown on the obscurity
of the whole question        by the discovery of fossils sufficiently
well marked to place their geological horizon beyond all
doubt.        This   discovery was        made     before  long by Mr.
Peach.
     The return journey included             a  visit to Wick and the
wonderful coast cliffs of the east of Caithness             ;  the granite

he saw in nature, Mnrchison    correctly represented in several sections the
unconformability of the quartz-rocks on the red sandstones.          Yet he
missed the meaning of this fundamental feature of the geology, and took
no notice of it at the time.   It was re-observed, and its value was fully
realized, next year by Sir Henry James and Professor Nicol, as will be
told in later pages.

spirited Duke and Duchess, and its reefs of Jurassic strata            ;
Ardross, and the Alness sections of the Old Red Sandstone
and other attractions,   which could receive but      a  rapid glance,
for the Association week was now close at hand.
     At the Glasgow meeting        of the British Association in
 1855 the    geologists   mustered     strongly.    Murchison      was
again chosen as President of Section C.           Sedgwick, shaking
off the thousand and one cares or ailments which usually
impeded his action, came up once more among his northern
brethren of the hammer.          He had just issued the Intro
duction to his Synopsis of British Palceozoic Fossils, in which
he had spoken of his former associate Murchison                with   a
vehemence of language very characteristic, but regretted             by
all who admired       and respected      both  disputants.    To any
reader who had no personal       knowledge of them, Sedgwick's
tirade must have seemed expressive          of bitter animosity and
estrangement.     Probably he was not unaware of this himself.
For when, after Murchison's communication on the Sutherland-
shire story, he rose to speak, and began by deliberately taking
off a thick heavy great-coat in which he had been sitting, he
noticed   that he had raised     a smile    in the audience, where
upon he instantly and in his happiest way exclaimed,             " Oh,
I 'm  not going to fight him  !
                                "
                                    The smile passed at once into
a good  laugh and general applause through the room.            There
had been some discussion on the true place of the crystal
line rocks of the Highlands         overlying those quartz-rocks
and limestones    of Sutherlandshire which had yielded fossils.
Hugh Miller, with his rough shepherd's plaid and his shaggy

sandy hair, talked as he wrote      in vigorous English, and with
his strong north-country accent maintained that the rocks in
 question were metamorphosed          portions of his own Old Red
 Sandstone.     Against this contention Murchison strongly pro
 tested, appealing to his companion Nicol, as well as his old-
 associate of 1827,    in support of the fundamental fact that
 whatever might      be the age  of the rocks, they were at least
 vastly older than the Old Red Sandstone.         Sedgwick, divested
 of his coat, plunged at once into the debate, and soon branched
 off into endless humorous episodes and digressions.           He had
 occasion, for instance,    to mention some natural section         of
 rocks much overgrown with wood, on which, abruptly stop
 ping his geological     disquisition, and    as  it were taking the
  audience into his confidence,                              "
                                    he quietly remarked,       By the
  way, ladies   and gentlemen, trees are a confounded         impedi
  ment to the progress of geological research."          He ended by
  taking    the same view     as  Murchison      with  regard   to the
  relative antiquity    of the limestones and the red conglo
  merates.     But it was clear that the rocks of the north-west
  of Scotland still presented      a very curious and interesting
  problem, which could not be solved without more and better
  fossils, and further extended examination of the ground.          To
  this renewed research Murchison resolved to devote himself.
       At this gathering of    the   British Association Professor
  Ramsay was able to announce the beginning and first year's
  progress of the Geological Survey       in Scotland.    He himself
  had started the work on the coast of East Lothian, and some
  advance    had been made     in tracing the areas of Old Red
  Sandstone,    Carboniferous and Silurian rocks, on the large
  six-inch Ordnance maps, which were exhibited in the Geolo
  gical Section.

       Another question              of considerable            interest   in Silurian
 geology arose at the meeting.                      From the moory uplands of
 Lanarkshire— the old haunts and hiding-places of the Cove
 nanters     — there had come, for the inspection of the learned,
 a series     of remarkable          fossils,    collected      in the course of his
        CRUSTACEANS AND Sni i.i.i OF THE UITKR SILURIAN       ROCKS OF LANARKSHIRE.

examination of these specimens                        showed       that they were          a
fine series of well-preserved lobster-like crustaceans,                             appa
rently identical with forms found in the Upper Silurian and

Lower Old Eed Sandstone.                                    If   it could           be shown that the
strata yielding                  them really belonged to the Upper Silurian,
and      if their position                 and their relations to other formations
could be fixed, then                   a    new and important step would be made
in establishing the Silurian system on the north of the Tweed.
As soon           as the meeting                     was over Murchison started for the
Lanarkshire ground, accompanied by his friend and colleague
Professor Ramsay.                          The general results of this rapid raid
were thus told to Professor Harkness                                       —

                                            the fossils    I will tell you
 more.      In  the meantime      I  have left Slimon the happiest
 man possible, and       I intend, D. V., to give      a  little introduc
 tion to the description of the wonderful geological parish of
 Lesmahagow,      and the merits of the poor but meritorious              Dr.
 Slimon, who,     if he had been rich enough to visit his patients
 on a horse, and had not travelled up the braes on foot,
 would never have made this excellent hit.                  So, what with
 my crystallized       Lower     Silurian1    fossils    in quartz -rock
 and    marble of the       Highlands,      and   the    true uppermost
 Silurians of the south of Scotland,         I  consider this     a   capital
 summer."
      And   a  very capital summer it proved to           be.    That bril
liant dash at the Lanarkshire ground brought to light for the
first time in Scotland the true base of the Old Red Sand
stone, and the true top of the Silurian           formations.        It thus
gave a new starting,point for the further investigation of the
geology of the country, and for the comparison                 of the rocks
of Scotland with those of England and Wales.                     Still more
important, however, was the step taken with regard to the
structure    of the north-west Highlands.            It   was the first of
a series   of excursions    which revealed the actual foundation
stones on which       all the geological formations of Britain have
been     built,  and brought      the so-called      azoic    schists    and
gneisses     of  Scotland into relation         with    the    fossiliferous
Silurian deposits of other regions.          The excursions, however,
were not continuously prosecuted in successive years.                  Mur-
chison had at once recognised the importance               of the subject.
   1 It had not yet been decisively proved that the fossils were Lower
Silurian, though the chances of their turning out to belong to that horizon
were very great, so great that MurchUon regarded the point as practically
settled.

But the materials, as we have   seen, did not at first exist for
the complete  solution of the problem.      Before   they were
obtained other questions arose, and the strong tide of life and
work in London swept him elsewhere       than to his beloved
Highlands.

                     CHAPTER XXIV.
              THE FOUNDATION-STONES     OF BRITAIN.
    FOR the sake     of continuous narration, we must now
depart from chronological order, and pass over an interval      of
more than two years, so as to follow without interruption
the steps   whereby the Highland       problem was gradually
worked out.
    As the summer of 1858 wore round, and London began to
empty,  it was time to prepare for the usual autumnal holiday.
During the years which had intervened since the ramble into
Sutherlandshire to   see the whereabouts    of the fossil-bearing
rocks of Durness, while Murchison was spending his vaca
tion on the Continent, Mr. Peach had returned to the High
land ground, and had found other and better fossils, which
placed beyond dispute the Lower      Silurian  age of the quartz-
rocks and limestones     of the north-west Highlands.       Other
observers had likewise been at work.        Professor Nlcol and
Colonel Sir Henry James (now the Director of the Ordnance
Survey), having independently traced the boundaries of the
formations for long distances, had shown by fresh proofs the
infraposition of the great red sandstones and conglomerates
to the quartz-rocks  ; discovering, at the same time, not only
that the quartz-rocks lay above the red sandstones, but that

  they did     so with a strong unconformability, there being thus
  a complete break and discordance          between the two forma
  tions.1 Mr.     Nicol had likewise traced the regular succession of
  quartz-rocks and limestones passing under the vast overlying
  mass of flaggy gneiss, which is the uppermost rock of the
  district.     Murchison   determined    to spend his autumn this
  year   in trying to make out more precisely the relations of
 these Highland rocks to each other and to the rest of the
 geology     of the country.      The Old Red Sandstone of those
 northern tracts had never been very satisfactorily put into
 order by any geologist, and as he had an offer of a place                in
 the steamer of the Commissioners          of Northern Lights on its
 annual voyage among the Orkney and Shetland Islands, where
 the Old Red Sandstone         is largely developed, he arranged to
 include these remote regions in his programme.                   He now
 never undertook any geological journey without             a companion.
 This year he chose Mr. Peach, whose keen eye and personal
 acquaintance      with  a good    deal of the ground to        be  visited
 would doubtless be of much service.
      In  the early part of the journey we find the two geologists,
 hammer       in hand, among the flagstone quarries of Thurso,
 gathering some of the fossil fishes    so characteristic of the rocks
 there, or in the shop of the baker,          botanist, geologist,      and
 poet, Robert     Dick, getting from him    a  sketch of the distribu
 tion of the rocks, which he graphically depicted with flour on
one of his own baking-boards.         Taking the packet from Thurso
for Stromness, they could        see — what    must strike the eye of
every     traveller to that hyperborean        tract — the contrast in

dated 26th July 1856.      Mr. Nicol's were made independently a little
later ID the same summer.

the    noble    bay.    On one side the dark solid flagstone       cliffs
of Holburn Head rise boldly out of the             sea, cut into square
masses by deep narrow clefts, into which the surge is ever
rolling, pierced too with sea-caves and fronted by square
gaunt buttress-like columns of the same dark stone, edged
here and there         with bright lichen, and sharply trenched
with lines of inky shadow.            On the opposite side the rocks
assume       a  warm rich tone of colour, which seems at first
more suggestive         of  a sunny Italian landscape      than of the
bleak sombre north.           Barred with lines of red and yellow,
 and varied blending tints of green and brown, the rocks rise
 in shattered ruinous cliffs high above the breakers, which in
 calm weather        play about     their base, and in storms cover
 them with sheets of foam.            The geologist who fixes well in
 his mind these two types of cliffs, and by visiting them and
 realizing on the spot the character of the rocks on which the
 contrast     depends, carries    with him the key to some of the
 most interesting geology farther north.
      It   was after having seen the rocks of each type             that
 Murchison        and    his  companion     turned towards      Orkney.
 Passing under the grand precipices of Hoy, they recognised
  the reappearance of the rocks of the east side of Thurso bay,
  and turning round the end of that island they found them
  selves,   in approaching Stromness, among the same flagstones
  as at   Holburn Head.        It was  from these flagstones that Hugh
  Miller had obtained the Asterolepis he      so graphically described,
  and on whose       anatomy he hung his disquisition against         the
   Vestiges   of Creation.    From quaint Norse-like Stromness the
  road leads by the Lake         of Stennis, which had likewise fur
  nished Miller with some apt analogies, past the ghost-like

Thurso, and which stretch through the islands              of Orkney.
But away     a few miles to the north-west, old Norna's preci
pices of the    Fitful Head looked out grandly upon the wide
Atlantic, and showed in their form and colour           a chnnge from
the type of rock so characteristic of the sea-coast of Caith

being for the definite       purpose    of visiting the lighthouses,
comparatively little scope was afforded to the hammermen.
They had     a chance    now and then of landing at the different
stations   touched     at on the way,       and for the   rest had    to
content themselves        with straining their eyes to make the
most of such geological indications as could be deciphered, by
means of field-glasses,     in the cliffs and shore-ledges      as they
passed along.       They saw and found enough,            however,     to
convince them that the Old Red Sandstone is prolonged into
the southern limb of the Shetland Islands.
      But in this pleasant        cruise,   where,   in spite of their
efforts, the geologists     found that science could play but a
subordinate     part, by far the most striking lesson learnt was
that taught by some of the little islets or skerries on the
east side of the group not far from Lerwick.             Even in such

 calm weather      as  that which the       Pharos' now enjoyed, the

 different during     a storm.     Placed among some of the most
 rapid and     conflicting    tideways,     and exposed    to the   un
 checked fury of the winds and waves, these islands furnish
 probably the most appalling proofs anywhere to be met with
 in the British     seas  of the destructive power of the ocean.

sea, are   driven over the rocks and skerries.            Blocks of rock,
many tons in weight, are thus actually quarried out of their
solid beds, at heights of sixty and seventy feet above high-
water mark, and driven along the rugged ground, grinding
and scoring the rocks over which they are borne.                   Piles of
huge angular blocks are thus accumulated                  so  high above
the common       limit of the waves, that         a believer in ancient
convulsions, like Murchison, might well have been pardoned
for citing them         as  evidence    of the far higher intensity
of former geological        operations.      Yet that geologist, under
the able guidance         of Mr. Thomas Stevenson,          the engineer,
who had given special attention to the subject, came away
thoroughly convinced that the apparent traces of primeval
havoc     were due to the present         action of the sea, and that
some portions of the ruin had been piled up only a winter
or two    before.1
      The limit of the cruise was fixed by the last lighthouse
to be visited — that on one of the             little islets in front of
the farthest       headland of Shetland.          This forms the most
northerly part of the British Isles.              Murchison had never
been so near the North Pole before, so he duly inscribed his
name     in the lighthouse books.           In  the adjacent     island of
 Unst he met with Mr. T. Edmonstone, and from him got
the story of his interview with the Duke                  of Wellington,
who on the occasion           of the Queen's        coronation received
the Shetlander kindly, took him to the                   coronation-ball,

geologists on the bleak headland of Cape Wrath.               From that
point, left once more to their own devices on the solid earth,
they came eastward         and southward, revisiting the old sec
tions of 1827,     as well    as those of 1855,      and making new
traverses, so as to get a clear       notion of the arrangement of
the rocks.      They found that order to be         as  recently stated
by Professor Nicol and Colonel James.               It  was now clear
that the thick masses of red sandstone,              in spite of their
usually gentle inclination, were older than the quartz-rocks
and limestones,     and that these in turn were older than the
schist and gneiss which, overlying them                and undulating
away towards the east, formed the greater part of the moun
 tains of Sutherland.        The fossils found by Mr. Peach had
not only shown the rocks to be Lower Silurian, but to pre
sent   a curious analogy to some portions of the correspond
ing series in North America.           In all,   nineteen     or twenty
species   of fossils had been found in the Sutherlandshire
 limestones and quartz -rocks, including seven cephalopods,
seven gasteropods, one brachiopod,         two annelides, two corals,

and probably a sponge.                 Now, of these species it was found
by Mr. Salter that five were certainly and three doubtfully
common         to the Lower          Silurian rocks of Canada                and   the
United States, while four might be called representatives                            of
American forms.
       Seeing, then, that the geological horizon of the fossiliferous
rocks could now be              so  satisfactorily fixed, with what series
elsewhere were the underlying red sandstones and conglome
rates to be compared              ?    Par down beneath the              base  of the

term Cambrian, there lie thick zones of red grits and con

be likened.          It  is true that in Wales no such break or dis
cordance occurs           between the Silurian             and Cambrian rocks.
The two series pass insensibly into each other.                            But then
in these northern mountains it was apparent from the fossil
evidence that the true base of the                     Silurian system did not
occur.       A    portion of the series, represented                  elsewhere     by
the     Lingula Flags, and perhaps by other subdivisions, was

there wanting, so that the marked unconformability between
the quartz-rocks and         the red sandstones         could be satis
factorily explained.        Murchison, therefore, proposed to class
as   Cambrian all the red sandstones and conglomerates lying
below the quartz-rocks and limestones of the north-west of
Scotland.
      But with what could he compare that dark gnarled gneiss
which comes out in those strange bare hummocky hills from
beneath the vast terraced          mountains of red sandstone,            so
utterly distinct from everything else         ?    Of its vast relative
antiquity there could be no doubt.             It  had been crumpled
and crystallized, and then battered             by the elements       long
before even       those venerable     red sandstones       were formed.
Hitherto the Cambrian rocks had been the oldest strata of
Britain, but now there seemed to be clear evidence of some
thing     older still — a    yet more ancient         foundation-stone
underlying      and    supporting the vast piles of rock which
form the mountains of the Highlands.               To this lowest rock
Murchison gave at first the name of the Fundamental Gneiss.
In later    years he classed     it with the Laurentian Gneiss of
Canada    —a    vast mass of crystalline rocks, which,         as far back
as 1846, had      been recognised      by Logan and his colleagues

oldest fossiliferous formations of the colony.1
      Starting, therefore, from the ancient platform of gneiss
found on the western          margin of Sutherland and Ross, he
traced     an   ascending     section    through     the    undoubtedly
Lower Silurian limestones           and the vast overlying schists

Jones, to be a foraminifer.   No organism of any kind bas yet been met
with in the fundamental gneiss of Scotland.

 border.      He argued that     as  this overlying metamorphosed
 series had Lower Silurian fossils at its base, and was covered
 by Old Eed Sandstone at its top, it could not be anything
 but Silurian.       And thus by one bold dash of the brush,
 bold, but justified      by careful and accurate      observation,  he
 wiped      out the old conventional mineralogical colouring,
 which dated from the time when gneiss, mica- schist,               and
 clay-slate were supposed         to be necessarily of higher an
 tiquity than any fossiliferous rocks, and substituted for it          a
 mode      of representation     whereby the     great   mass   of the
 Scottish Highlands was shown to consist of altered crystal
 line sandstones, shales, and other strata of Lower Silurian
 age.     No such rapid and extensive change had ever before
 been made      in the geological map of the British Isles.
        Working his way eastward across Sutherland and Caith
 ness, Murchison        struck the coast again at Langwell, near
 the     Ord.    There,    under the hospitable auspices        of the
 Speaker      and Lady      Charlotte    Denison, he     explored   the
 geology of the Scarabin       Hills.    Few tracts in Britain suffer
 more than the treeless moors         of Caithness from the biting
 and furious sea-blasts.      In   the teeth of one of these storms
 a  party started     on horseback,     with the geologist    at their
 head, to reach the crest of the only high ground              in that
 desolate     moorland.     But the weather proved too much for
 those     who had no enthusiasm for quartz-rock.              "When
 Miss     S. and the   Speaker were driven back," so wrote          the
 leader of the expedition,
                               " I insisted, like an ardent ci-devant
jeune     homme,    on continuing to face the storm, until, after
 climbing along the south face of the middle Scarabin, among
 the piles of loose quartz-rock, and leading our ponies, un

able to hear each other bawl for the roaring of the wind, we
went in spite of it to the north side of the third hill, pluck
ing cloud-berries in full ripe fruit.           They seem to like the
quartz and    a  full northern blast."
     But feats of this kind could not be           so  lightly performed
by   a veteran   of sixty-six     as  they had been one-and-thirty
years before, when Sedgwick and he scoured these same grey
bare hills.     The next day the indomitable geologist became
 a somewhat     despondent     invalid, chronicling the changes of
his pulse instead       of the strike and joints of the quartz-
 rock.
      During   the leisurely journey          southward by Dunrobin
 and   Dingwall to Inverness, and thence by Elgin and Aber
 deen   into Forfarshire, Murchison's chief employment, besides
 visiting old friends, consisted       in looking after every section
 of Old Eed Sandstone he could meet with.                He had resolved
 to attempt to get that system of rocks           in the north of Scot
 land into definite       order.     What measure of success he
 obtained    was    shown in the        elaborate    memoir       which    he
 afterwards laid before the Geological Society.1
      The visits he paid almost always combined             a  little, some
 times a good deal, of geology.          Thus when at Eossie Priory,
 the charming residence         of Lord Kinnaird in the Carse of
 Cowrie, he set out with       a party to    see the famous       sandstone
 of Dura Den, and compare it with the pale sandstones of
 Dunnet Head, Hoy, and other scenes of his recent tour in
 the north.     This sandstone has been long celebrated for the
 abundance of its fossil fishes.         In certain   layers of the rock,
 indeed, these relics lie so    thickly strewn on each other, and so
 entire, as to show that the animals must have met a sudden

  scales and bones had time to get loosened             and separated.
 With some labourers          to assist, the party set vigorously to
 work, to quarry out some samples of the ichthyic treasures
  of the place.      Murchison's account of the operation is            as
 follows  :— " After finding     a few remains and fragments, Lord
 Kinnaird's eye caught the end of         a fish.   On quarrying into
 the rock, after much perseverance the head and             a  consider
 able portion of a grand Holoptychius came forth, to the exu
 berant  joy of all concerned.        The dark and red tints of the
 scales and bones of this fine large fish shone out          in striking
 contrast to the white and yellow stone.            Grand   as was   this
 discovery,   it was clear that we were only on the threshold,
 and that by patience the whole fish might be extracted.               So
 thereon we went to lunch under the trees           —a    most pictur
 esque party, our noble host, having worked harder than the
 quarrymen,     in his shirt-sleeves, and Lady Kinnaird presiding
 with her attractive manners.           We carried off our trophies,
 hoping still for more, recrossed the Tay, and dined at eight
 at the  Priory — a very joyous party.         But our excellent and
 eloquent   explorer of Dura Den [Kev. Dr. Anderson of New-
 burgh] resolved to complete         our gratification.   Next morn
ing he went back by rail, and in the evening returned with
an immense booty, and all the remainder            of the huge fish in
a large   box completely covered up in wool              This day has
passed   in uniting the head with the remainder of the animal,
cleaning,   fixing, cementing,      and securing     the whole.     The
animal thus put together measures thirty-three or thirty-four
inches by thirteen      in width, and is thus considerably larger
than the Holoptychius nobilissimus which            I acquired for the
British Museum some years ago."

224            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                         [wee.
     From such pleasant and restful amusement the transition
was abrupt to the bustle and hubbub of the         British Associa
tion at Leeds.      A  custom unknown before had now crept
into the practice of the Association, viz., that the President
of each Section should open the business of the first day by
giving an address.       Murchison      accordingly, having been
chosen again to preside over the geographers,         had prepared
and now read a short discourse         on recent progress   in geo
graphy.     From this time onward to the end of his life, in
his double capacity of geologist and geographer, he frequently
filled at the meetings of the Association the chair either of
the Geological or Geographical Section, and furnished on each
 occasion  the now expected       introductory address.     Indeed,
if  we group    these discourses    with those more voluminous
essays read each year to the          Geographical Society at its
anniversary in May, we have material enough to form several
thick volumes, consisting entirely of addresses on the general
progress of research.
     But with such    a well-filled set of geological    note-books
it could not     be expected     that the President of the Geo
graphers should wholly forsake his old Section C.          He gave
his brethren of the hammer an outline of his recent doings
 in the North, more especially with reference to the grand
 revolution he proposed       to make    in the hitherto accepted
 geology   of the Highlands.        He had brought away in his
 travelling-bag some bones of the large Stagonolepis of Elgin,
 marked by Agassiz    as a fish, but which he shrewdly suspected
 to be reptilian.   In exhibiting    these, he renewed the expres
 sion of his conviction that in spite of the recognised reptilian
 grade of Telerpeton,    and possibly of some of its contem

poraries, the strata yielding their remains could not be sepa
rated from the Old Red Sandstone.1
      Though the main question          as to the order      of the rocks
seemed      to   have    been    now conclusively settled,           strong
opposition was offered          to Murchison's conclusion by his
fellow-traveller, Professor Nicol.          A  chief part of the reason
ing of the former geologist proceeded on the alleged fact that
the old gneiss of the west of Sutherlandshire lay deep beneath
and totally differed       from the later crystalline rocks or so-
called gneiss which spread            over   such wide spaces of the
Northern Highlands.           At first Mr. Nicol, following in this
matter the shrewd         observations     of Hay Cunningham, had
recognised     the distinction    in question.       But he afterwards
endeavoured to show that at every point where the
                                                                   "
                                                                      upper

gneiss      seemed to overlie the other rocks,         it was separated
from them by intrusive igneous rocks, and in truth was only
the true old gneiss brought up again by great upcast faults.
Murchison       felt confident    that he had made no mistake in
his sections.        Nevertheless,     as   he   had    not seen       some
localities and sections adduced by Professor Nicol, and                    as
the matter      in dispute was one of fundamental importance
in British geology      as well  as  in general questions relating to
the    history of metamorphic rocks, he determined                  in the
summer      of 1859 to make        a  new and final examination of
the Assynt and Durness ground, with the advantage of the
co-operation of the trained eye of his colleague, Professor
Ramsay.

who, after a successful        life abroad, had come back and re
purchased     the     lands of his ancestors, which he was now
about to reoccupy.          In his journal, Murchison      refers to this
event thus     : — " The gratification    I  experienced    was great    in
seeing    the     happy    disembarkation       of the rich man from
Java, with his wife, many children, a Malay woman, and all
sorts   of traps.       Not to be forgotten that thirty-two         years
ago Sedgwick and           I  danced   with our nailed shoes in the
halls of Loch Buy, then belonging to the old laird, who was
ruined.     Property regained by his eldest son. Guns saluting
— numerous         boats."
     Much of the ground to be geologized over in Sutherland-
shire was the same         as   that already well explored.       Map    in
hand, and tracing out          in detail the boundaries of the rocks
in some of the testing sections, the geologists               completely
 established     the truth of the arrangement        which Murchison
had adopted, and on the basis of which he proposed to class
 the great mass of the crystalline rocks of the Highlands                 as
 altered   strata of Lower Silurian        age.    The journal of these
 rambles, however,       wholly devoted to quartz-rock, limestone,
 Cambrian sandstone, fundamental gneiss, and other geologi
 cal matters, affords us no glimpses of its writer in any other
 capacity than       as an   enthusiastic hammerman,       up early and
 out late, very much pleased and elated               to find his main
 proposition      so   completely sustained     by his friend and com
 panion's critical examination.

there under the presidency              of the Prince Consort.
      In  obedience to a request of the Council, Murchison had
agreed to give          one of the evening               discourses       during the

not his mission.          At  the close of his address, some interest
was excited by a spectacle                unprecedented          in the annals of
the Association.          A   deputation from the Royal Society of
Edinburgh appeared on the platform, and, on the part of the
Society, presented to Murchison the first gold medal, founded
by Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane, for the encouragement
of science in Scotland.

      Another    noteworthy      incident    occurred     in connexion
 with the Aberdeen meeting.            Her Majesty the Queen, de
 sirous of showing her own personal interest            in the Associa
 tion, had invited its members to Balmoral, there to breakfast
 and witness some Highland games.             A  goodly number took
 advantage of the invitation, and duly appeared in the royal
 demesne, though a succession          of drenching showers rather
 tried their good-humour.       Of course Sir Koderick Murchison
 was not   likely to absent himself.         The games were in pro
 gress.   Her Majesty, well wrapt with shawls, kept her place
 in defiance of the weather, and the Prince Consort moved to
 and fro, saying a     kind word here and there to such of the
guests as he recognised.      A   slight buzz was heard at one part
of the grounds,     and   a knot of eager faces was seen to gather
round some central figure.      By and bye Sir Eoderick emerged,
and, obtaining audience         of the Queen,      announced     to her
Majesty that he had just received          a telegram     reporting the
discovery by Captain M'Clintock of the Franklin records
and log-book     !
     During the preparation of the memoirs             on the geology
of the north of Scotland for the Geological Society, and more
especially of the little sketch-map of the Highlands              which
accompanied      them, Murchison         saw   that to complete      his
work, and show its adaptation and extension to the rest of
the country, he ought to compare            the clear sections of the
Assynt country with others in more southern parts of the
Highlands.      If he could show        that the sequence     as  made
out in the north-west         should hold good        throughout the
rest of the Highland regions, he would not only confirm                it
but make     a great  forward step in explaining the structure of
a   wide and     still geologically almost unexplored region.

Accordingly, in the summer of 1860, he determined                   to put
this idea into practice.        His original plan was thus sketched
in a letter (18th July) to myself, then one of the field-
geologists of the Geological Survey in Scotland : —
      "
        Requiring some speedy change of air or absence from
over- excitement,       I  would have liked to have had             a  real
holiday in the         Pyrenees or elsewhere.           But seeing that
Eamsay and Jukes, my generals of division, are both abroad,
I have resolved     not to quit the British Isles.      I propose, there
fore, to get away     in the middle of next week, and to go to Scot
land.      Being there,  I consider it to be my duty to work out with
your assistance the problem of how far the order and classifi
cation which are clear and established in Sutherland and Ross
are applicable to the more southern parts of the Highlands.
      "  I  think, therefore, of taking you with me in the first
instance to      Jura  and the adjacent mainland, where zones of
quartz-rock and limestone abound, and which may prove to
be equivalents      of my Durness and Assynt Silurians.           Having
ascertained whether that zone subsides under micaceous flags
(as   I surmise), I will test     the same again between Balahulish
and Fort- William.          Having settled these points, and having
re-explored the heads of Loch Duich, Loch Alsh,               etc.,  I will
test    the thing again at the head           of Loch Maree (one of
Nicol's obstructive        cases),   and, having looked around that
tract,   will revisit Loch    Broom, where       the Eoss-shire succes
sion is    as clear as  that of Sutherland.       Finally, we will cross
to the Lewis, where        I wish to satisfy myself still more con
clusively     as to the fundamental       gneiss."
       This programme       was adhered to      in the main, but con
siderably extended.          By     a  series  of traverses   across   the
Highlands, an attempt was for the first time made to show

the general geological      structure of that region, starting from
the old gneiss, on the north-west side, and passing up to the
overlying Old Red Sandstone             on the south-east.         The  full
details   of this campaign      were afterwards            worked out in a
long conjoint memoir, read to the Geological Society.1
      The veteran geologist was now in his sixty-ninth year —
rather an advanced age for           a  return to the rough fare, and
still rougher ground and weather, to be looked for in the
remoter     parts of the Highlands.           But his enthusiasm         re
mained with seemingly no abatement                ;   his eye still kept its
wonderful quickness in detecting the really salient features
of the geological structure of        a  district   ;   his powers of walk
ing, though now of course manifestly on the wane, were                  still
equal to the accomplishment of a ten or twelve mile tramp,
while his general strength          and capacity for endurance con
tinued to show the singular vigour of constitution to which
through life he had owed         so much.       This, however, was his
last great expedition, and he felt at the time that it must be
so.    He knew of nothing else likely to tempt him into the
hardships of the field again, and          so at times        he put on an
extra stimulus to carry him bravely through fatigue                     and
discomfort,    which bade fair to land him at last at his goal —
the orderly grouping of the rocks of his own Highlands.
      Of personal     incident the tour furnished little.             Yet it
 brought out in strong          relief, and enabled           me to realize
 various features of Murchison's character, and to gather traits
 and anecdotes        which   have been       already woven        into this

 structure of a      hill   several  miles away, where       most   eyes
 would have detected nothing, but where, after             a good hard
climb, one found his conjecture to be true           ;  the pertinacity
with which, in spite of the attractions of Highland sport
and Highland hospitality, to both of which he yielded                 so
far, he yet held on his way       until he had accomplished his task.
     A   few of the incidents of the tour which impressed
themselves      on   my memory,        though of little note, may
perhaps     fitly find    a   place  here.   No one who has often
heard Sir Roderick Murchison address public meetings                 can
have    failed to notice how characteristically his Highland
blood would show itself.            He was proud of being a High
lander, and seldom lost a chance of proclaiming his nation
ality.    Back in that picturesque       region of Kintail and Loch-
alsh, where his forefathers         had lived, his patriotism glowed
again    with    renewed       ardour.     He revisited, with undi-
minished      interest    and pride, the      scenes   where Donald
Murchison had baffled the King's troops.               When we were

232          SIR RODERICK MURCHISOtf.                             [im
together   in Loch Duich, though no geological              necessity
called him, he must needs once more make           a  pilgrimage to
the   Bealloch of Kintail.       Standing on a rising knoll, his
left hand stuck into the arm-hole of his waistcoat,           and his
right holding    a stout  staff, with which he pointed out the
leading features of interest, historical or geological,      his face
would kindle with the old martial fire      as he  went over again
the events of "the'15."V      In the same spirit, he solicited and
obtained from the proprietor of the ground leave to choose a
site for a monument to commemorate         the deeds of his     illus
trious kinsman.       A bright autumnal afternoon was given to
that pious quest.       We went by boat, creeping in and out
 among the    islets and promontories      at the mouth of that
 wonderfully fine inlet, Loch Duich, and fixing at hist upon          a
 knoll of rock amid the heather and bracken, from which we
 could look over to Eilan Donan Castle, and away up to the
 mountains of Kintail and Glenelg on the one side, and over
 to the peaks and glens of Skye on the other — a site which
 the annual crowds of steamer-carried       tourists would be sure
 to see when the obelisk should be placed upon it.
      Again — the Murchison sept had not been all         as prosper
 ous in the world as the     Laird of Tarradale.     Some    of them
 still remained    in the original district in humble circum
 stances, but, with the genealogical    skill of true Highlanders,
 they could yet count their kinship          to the    geologist.     I
 remember, on one of our excursions,      we halted at some fern-
 thatched cabins, and were met by one or two plaided cottars,
 with whom     I left Murchison in talk.     I was   told afterwards
 that they were some of his distant relatives,          or clansmen,
 whom he always visited and assisted when he returned to
  that part of the country.

MM.]            TWO HIGHLAND SUNDAYS.                               233
    While still in this Ross-shire district, we attended the
English service in the parish church,         which, in spite of a
very rainy day, was crowded          by  a Gaelic congregation        of
some 500 people      in wet clothes, who gave       a good    illustra
tion of that loud and deep groaning during the sermon,
which is sometimes      so  marked in the churches of the north
west Highlands.         Murchison's face was       a   curious study
during the service.     Naturally reverent, and evidently with         a
strong desire to compose himself to the frame           of mind and
posture     of body proper to the       occasion,   he   yet wore a
droll expression of wonder       as he watched the gravity of the
hearers amid sounds        which, anywhere    else, he would have
supposed indicative      of the deepest anguish or pain.         When
the service was ended, and we were again in the pure air
outside, he drew a long breath,         and remarked      to me that
it was the last time he should ever enter            a   Presbyterian
church    !
     Next Sunday was       as fine as the   previous one had been
wet, and was very differently spent.        We had reached one of
the wildest tracts     of Western Ross-shire — the mountainous
and broken country between          Lochs Torridon      and Maree —
interesting in its singular scenery, and specially interesting
in its clear,   as well  as complicated,   geological   sections.     It
was one of the districts which Murchison had particularly
marked as     likely to test his views of the order of succession
among the rocks of the north-west Highlands.             The previous
day, unable to obtain any     kind of conveyance when we landed
from the small boat, which had brought us to the upper end
of Loch Torridon, we had crossed on foot from that fjord to
the   little inn of Kinlochewe, at the head of Loch Maree —
a tramp of twelve miles, which the veteran              accomplished

234              SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                                   [van.
easily.     Indeed,    so much        of geological   interest lay crowded
round us by the way, that the gleaming waters of Maree
seemed to come almost              too soon      in sight.       Next morning
ushered     in one of those days of which perhaps not more
than half    a dozen      fall within the life and experience of any
ordinary man.         Under a sky of deep clear blue, every peak
and crag even of the far mountains stood up sharply marked
by its light and shadow.                Not a branch of the grand old
pines, not a spray of the deep heather                     and autumn-tinted
bracken,     stirred in the quiet air.             Loch Maree, stretching
away for miles down the valley, lay without a ripple, save
what were made now and then by the active water-fowl,
and reflected      without        distortion      every    one   of the many
varieties of form and colour which diversify the sides of its
grand circuit      of mountains.           In    the midst of this general
calm, and as      if in   some vague way protesting against              it,   the
splintered crags and ruin-covered slopes, rose all around.                      It
was such     a   morning     as   calls up most strongly the desire for
solitude, and moves most deeply such sympathy                       as may be
in   a   man for the mingled beauty and grandeur,                  tenderness,
and power, by which nature appeals to what                        is   best and
noblest within him.
      We breakfasted, and at once separated.                     Sir Roderick
spent the day sauntering by the head of the Loch along the
base of the mountains on its eastern side, and sitting down
now and then to take              a   rough sketch of the strange and
picturesque mountain-outlines               of Ben Eay and the western
side of the valley.        For myself,   I      longed to be on the summit
of one of the far-gleaming peaks, and set off accordingly.
The fresh buoyant air of the mountains                ;    the huge masses of
red sandstone capped with white quartz,                   like sheets of peren

nial snow      ;   the depth of the glens, once filled with glaciers,
and still strewn with their moraines                   ; the ruggedness     and
dislocation of the slopes and cliffs             ; the solitude of the whole
scene, broken now and then by the bound of a group of red
deer startled from a favourite corrie, or by the                  whirr of the
snowy ptarmigan           ; the ever- widening panorama of mountain-
summit, gorge, glen,               and lake,    as   each higher peak       was
gained in succession            ;  and then, from the highest summit of
all, the vista of the blue Atlantic, with the faint, far hills of
the outer Hebrides, and the nearer and darker spires                          of
Skye, — all this, added to the absorbing interest of the geo
logy, filled up         a day      to the brim with that deep pleasure
which becomes            a   life-long    possession.     Night came down
when the inn at Kinlochewe                   still lay   a good    many miles
on the further           side     of a  tract of mingled mountain, glen,
river, and bog, through which lay no road.                      Fortunately, in
the end, the moon rose, and the inn was reached somewhere
near midnight.
      The delay in the return of his companion                   gave  Murchi-
SOD    not  a    little uneasiness.         As hour after hour passed, he
grew    so  impatient that he began to insist on some of the
people     at the    inn turning out with lanterns.                His remon
strances,      however,       met     with a sullen        indifference,   very
unlike the usual attentiveness              of the household.         It turned
out in the end that the want of sympathy sprang from a
                            " It was the Sabbath-day the gentleman
theological cause :                                           ;
shouldn't have gone to walk on the Lord's day."                       In  short,
the gentleman,          had he been lost, would have deserved his
fate, and would have furnished to the pulpits of the district
a  new and pregnant illustration               of the danger of Sabbath-
breaking     !

236            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                           [iseo.
     From these north-western tracts, where the chief geologi
cal task was to run the boundary lines, which had already
been well-defined     in Assynt, down through the mountains
of western Ross- shire to the Kyles of Skye, we struck south
wards and made        a  series of traverses     across the   central
Highlands.      The object of these further explorations was
to discover,  if  possible,  the structure  of the great Highland
region, by using the key which the north-western sections
furnished.    Nothing more was aimed at or could be attempted
than the ascertaining of the general          fact, that the meta-
morphic rocks of the Highlands, enormously thick             as  they
appear to be, have been so crumpled and folded that the same
zones reappear again and again      in successive great arches and
troughs.    And this was successfully accomplished.          Instead
of  a chaos  of dislocation and crystallization, these Highland
rocks really proved to have, on the whole, a very orderly
arrangement,     and could be recognised and traced, group          by
group, for wide spaces across the country.            This piece of
work formed the natural complement to what had already
been effected    in Sutherlandshire.     It  bore pregnantly, too,
not merely on local geological questions,        but on that wider
and difficult question,     the history  of metamorphism.         The
rocks of more than       half  a kingdom, which had previously
been mapped and described merely as so many mineralogical
 masses, covering certain spaces of country, and belonging to
 the so-called " primary series," were now found to be really
 the altered   equivalents of ordinary sedimentary        strata, re
 taining still abundant evidence of their origin, and, despite
 their severe alteration, capable of being traced and mapped
 in the same way    as  rocks which had not undergone any such
 change.


238             SIR RODERICK MURCHISOS.                              [iseo.
     Nevertheless,    though the general law of structure in the
Highlands came out with great precision               as  the result of
this autumn's work, the difficulties of detail were and could
not fail to be very great, and in many            cases,   with only a
limited time to wrestle with them, insuperable.              Murchison,
full of the grand truth which our sections had made evident,
refused to deal     with any of these, or contented himself with
a general invocation of gigantic fractures and reversals.                It
was vain to point out that any number of such disturbances
would not solve the problem, and that probably in the south
eastern Highlands the mineral character of the typical zones
of Assynt is replaced by something different, or at least that
higher zones come in there which do not appear to the
north-west.       He stuck to his leading principle, from which
no amount of contradictory detail would make him swerve.
And,   so   far  as  regarded   his object    at  the time, he was
doubtless     right.    I  find among      his notes      references     to
some     of these    attempts     on   my   part   to    persuade    him
that   everything      did   not    fit so  harmoniously into his
views    as  he wished and imagined.          Thus :— " Doubts and
difficulties of Geikie.     I see   nothing but what      I expected    in
approaching     the Grampian    jam"      Again, in the Blair Athole
district, where, with our limited time, and the puzzling char
acter of the sections,     I was   driven to despair, he records, —
" Poor Geikie is cracking his brains and exhausting his
energies in trying to coax these frightfully chaotic assem
blages into the order of the north-west.           Some day he may
accomplish it.        We shall     see  what he says of the chief
limestone of Cairnwell, and its relations to quartz -rock."
     But in spite of these unsolved difficulties which still
await the resolute and patient toil of         a geologist     furnished

with accurate topographical maps, the tour had been abun
dantly successful in its leading object.     The general structure
of the Highlands      could no longer be considered       doubtful
A   detailed narrative of the observations     was prepared, in the
form of    a conjoint memoir to the Geological Society.        As  a
 further result of this tour, the plan was conceived and soon
 put into execution,    of preparing a small geological map of
 Scotland, to embody, in a broad and generalized form, the
 new views of Highland        geology.    This little sketch-map
 was the first, and aa  yet the only one, in which the rocks of
 the country from bottom to top are treated         in rigid strati-
 graphical order, and delineated    so as to    show the structure
 of the country.
       With this Highland tour, and the preparation of the
 narrative of   it for the  memoir,   Murchison     closed the last
 great geological task of his life.    It was a worthy end to so
 long and active    a career.   Apart from its importance in a
 scientific point of view, there was     a fitness in the fact, that
 after wandering far and wide, and gaining distinction from
 the furthest confines     of Europe, he should return to his
 native Highlands and gather his last laurel from the rocks
 on which he was born.        Probably no aspect of the matter
 gave to himself more pleasure than this.

                      CHAPTER XXV.
                 OFFICIAL LIFE IN LONDON.
    WHEN the main interest of      a man's   life has lain in its
 external incident, and when chiefly through that outward
 work and movement      have his own character      and develop
 ment been shown, there     must needs come a time when,        as
the life grows   less and less eventful,  it presents fewer and
fewer   features  for a  biographical record.     The  man    may
have had no ever-advancing       inner life; or, at least, may
have kept   it so shrouded  within his own soul that even his
most intimate friends could not trace its workings and pro
gress.   He has lived, and moved, and had his being in the stir
and bustle of the world.      He has had perhaps    a great  work
to do, and has done it.    The ardour and enthusiasm        which
formerly braced him for effort, and brought freely into play
the varied feelings and faculties which went to make up his
character, have now mellowed down.        Such a one no longer
talks with hope and exultation of what he is going to do, but
rather dwells with complacency      and pride on what he has
done.    There may still   be, perhaps,  a great interest   about
him, but it is mainly retrospective.    The circumstances    pro
bably no longer exist around him to call out those qualities

18s6-ro.]        OFFICIAL LIFE IN LONDON.                          241
in him which made him different from his fellows, even if
his energies were equal to renewed exertion.              And hence,
perhaps,     in ordinary general company, or even in more quiet
and familiar converse, an observer may fail to detect those
qualities, may even rather fix upon others of          a less pleasing
kind, which, once overshadowed           by the nobler growth that
made the man what he was, have since sprung into undesir
able prominence.
     We have now arrived at this comparatively uneventful
period in Murchison's career.          Not that he grew less busy or
less devoted to the pursuits to which he had given so many
years      of energy    and   enthusiasm.     But he had achieved
the great work of his life.         His remaining years were per
haps even busier,        as they   certainly were fuller of distrac
tion and multitudinous           cares than any     of   those   which
preceded them.         But there no longer ran through them the
connecting thread of one central idea to be worked out, one
dominant task to be performed.            He gave himself up to the
calls of his official position     in London   ; and  in accepting its
dignity and honours he had to undertake            also its numerous
and often burdensome duties.
     In    the later years of his life, therefore, we see him        in
a capacity     different from that    in which he appeared during
any of the previous periods.          He had long held a prominent
place     in London society, but he never regarded the due
maintenance       of that position   as the chief function he had to
perform.       It  ranked,  in his estimation,    after his scientific
work.       Year after year he had fled from London life to renew
his labours in the field among his beloved rocks.              But the
claims of the metropolis had been fixing their hold more and
more firmly upon him.           His annual escape to the country

had been each year growing later, and his return to town
getting earlier.           The duties of the Jermyn Street establish
ment kept him indeed              in London during most of the summer.
In his last        ten or fifteen years, therefore, his work lay mainly
in London, —very miscellaneous work, and hardly capable of
any methodical record in these pages, but yet in many ways
helpful to the progress of science and the recognition of its
claims.
      It   is not however merely, or even chiefly, the want of
incident which makes this concluding portion of Murchison's
life more          difficult    of satisfactory    biographical treatment.
There is an almost total want in it of material of                 a personal
kind.       He kept no diary.              His letters, though probably
more numerous              than ever, treated almost wholly of scien
tific questions or matters of business, and give us but               a feeble
glimpse at the man himself.               We are thus thrown back upon
his public career, wherein the same qualities remained                     con
spicuous which had marked the previous and more strictly
scientific period of his life.            As one year passed very much
like another, we can no longer conveniently follow                  a chrono
logical order, but must be content to group, under separate
heads, the various kinds of activity by which this concluding
portion of the veteran's life was distinguished.
      Probably the most effective grouping                will   be into four
sections    :   — 1st,    Official work, either in connexion         with the
Geological Survey, or arising out of Murchison's position as
a   geologist.           2d,   Holiday-rambles,    when   he escaped from
London to the country or to the Continent.                       3d, The   chair
of the Geographical             Society, and the efforts he made, when
holding      it,   to further the progress of Geography,          and aid the
expeditions of travellers.              4<A,   The last touches to his geo

 logical work at home and abroad.        The present chapter      will
 be devoted to the first of these sections.
      So far as the Geological Survey was concerned, the duties
 of the Director-General were twofold.         He had to conduct
 the official  correspondence    and other office-work at    Jermyn
 Street, and he was expected, as occasion        might require, to
 visit his officers in the field, and confer with them in any
 matter requiring special consideration.       Murchison     did not
 carry into his task the undivided earnestness          and almost
 enthusiastic energy of De la Beche,          the founder of the
 Survey.      He joined the service at too advanced       a period  of
 life to make this possible.      Consequently, though he did       as
 much at Jermyn Street       as  could have been reasonably ex
 pected of him, he rather avoided      the more exacting       claims
 of the field-work.
      One question to which he devoted        a good deal    of time
 and thought was the increase of the force under            his com
 mand, with a view to greater expedition         in the surveying
 of the country.     With the advance of geological knowledge
 there had been a corresponding         progress   in the style of
 mapping,     especially in the direction   of far greater elaborr
 ation and      detail   In  former   years   geologists,   who set
to work to make        a geological  map, usually omitted notice
 of the superficial detritus, and contented       themselves     with
tracing, as well as they could, the boundaries       of the under
lying rocks.       But now the previously neglected           surface
deposits    received   a yearly increasing share of attention         ;
while, at the same time, greater perfection          and precision
appeared in the representation      of the more solid formations
lying underneath.        Hence geological    surveying became a
more and more laborious occupation, demanding           an increas

  ing measure of time, toil, and      skill     With this tendency, it
  was evident that the Geological Survey could not be expected
  to show much      increase  in its rate of progress.       On the con
  trary, that rate must necessarily      diminish, unless the work
  ing staff were increased.       To obtain from Parliament such
  an augmentation      of force as  would materially accelerate the
 progress was the task to which           the Director- General        now
 addressed himself.       In  Scotland   there had been for several
 years a force of only two surveyors.            So small a staff had
 been necessary at first, for the maps of the Ordnance            Survey,
 on which the work of the Geological Survey is traced, were
 not ready.     But this difficulty no longer existed to the same
 extent   ; maps    could now     be   had for     a great   part of the
 central counties,      and  every    year   largely added to their
 number.
      Reflecting on these matters, and, like            other   heads     of
 departments,     having   a wholesome      fear of sharp inquiry on
 the part of the House of Commons, the Director- General,                in
 1858, propounded      his views to Professor Ramsay, his second
in command      : — " Seeing   and believing that the time is fast
 approaching,     if not actually    come, when Scotland must be
put on the same footing (geologid)            as  Ireland — or    I   shall
never be forgiven       by my countrymen, — and knowing that
we ought absolutely to have at least the whole of our present
force of field-surveyors to do justice to England                and her
large unexplored and most valuable             regions,    I  have quite
made up my mind to ask for a considerable                increase of our
forces.
      " As  I am thoroughly convinced         that  a  very great addi
tion to the staff both of England and Scotland is desirable,
ao   it will  be my duty to recommend            such   in my ensuing

vss6-m.]INCREASE OF GEOLOGICAL SURVEYORS. 245
annual report.           If  this should not be granted, the Survey
will not       be   finished for fifty years.    ...   I am continually
upbraided with not bringing out the [map of the] metro
politan districts, and the publication of the Edinburgh sheet
before that of London           will add to the discontent.    It  is quite
certain that the Scotch members will clamour for more work,
and   if   I  reply that we have two men only for the
                                                                 '
                                                                   Land of
Cakes/ they will insist on justice equal to that afforded                to
Erin.    .  .  .  Being responsible      for the effecting of more in
my time          (seeing the vastly greater       amount   of [published
Ordnance]         maps) than could be done before,          I  cannot   sit
still on the old status."
     As the result of his efforts he succeeded in getting                 a
considerable        increase of force at this time.      The progress of
the Survey, accordingly,          continued to improve.       But though
the number of assistants was augmented, the annual amount
of country surveyed had not increased in the same proportion.
This   arose     partly from the much greater detail and perfection
which the method of surveying had reached, whereby,                      of
course, greater time was needed than before for the same area
of country, and partly from the inducements to the officers of
the Survey to quit their hard work and small pay for other and
more remunerative           appointments,    so that the service was de
prived of efficient surveyors, and necessarily lost some time in
training their successors.          In the latter part of the year 1866,
the Government of Lord Derby took into consideration                   the
whole question of the condition and progress of the Geological
Survey, and,        in concert with the Director-General, prepared
a scheme        for its re-organization and enlargement.            By the
new arrangement,            the staff in Great      Britain which had
hitherto been under the charge of Professor Kamsay,                      as

Local Director, was now divided into two parts, the 'larger
of which, for the survey of England and "Wales, remained
with him     as  its Director, while the remainder, for the survey
of Scotland,       was    placed   under the supervision of         a   new
Director,1     the    Irish branch remaining under its former
Director,    as before.      Each of the three branches received           a
great augmentation         to its staff, so that the total force of the
Survey in the United Kingdom was raised from                 37 to 75.
      In  the narrative of the history of the Geological. Survey
given in the twenty-second         chapter,  it has been shown that this
branch of the public service had been several times trans
ferred from one Government department                  to another    before
Sir Roderick Murchison was put at its head.                 Shortly after
his accession to office still another change was meditated.              At
that time,    as part of his office- work, he took great pains to com
bat a proposed transfer of the Geological Survey and Museum
of Practical Geology from the control of the Board of Trade,
under     which they had now thriven for some years, to the
Education Department of the Privy Council.                  Theoretically
there might be no objection to the change, but he saw, or
thought he saw, the advent of              a time    when the scientific
character      of the institutions       under his charge      would be
dealt with by men who had no knowledge                   of or sympathy
with science, and whose control would fetter the natural
and free development          alike of the Survey and of the School.
 He drew up        a lengthy document,        in the form of   a  letter to
 the President of the Board          of Trade, in which, after setting
forth the history of the Jermyn Street establishment               and the
    1
      Having for a number of years previously had the chief conduct of
 the Survey in Scotland under Professor Ramsay, I was named to the new
 post by the Director-General, and appointed in April 1807.

good work which            it had done and might yet do, he states
his fears in the following official form : —
    "
      Liberal as the Minister may be under whose control
the general education            of the nation may be placed, there is
little doubt that in this country the greater number of its
instructors will      be   drawn from among such of the graduates
of the ancient        Universities       as, both    by their training and
position, must be to        a great extent     disqualified from assigning
their due importance               to the practical branches    of science.
Such persons may be eminent                  in scholarship    and abstract
science and yet ignorant of the fact that the continued pros
perity of their country absolutely depends upon the diffusion
of scientific knowledge among its masses.                 They may, with
the most     sincere       and      earnest intention,    not only fail to
advance,    but even exercise            a   retarding influence     on such
diffusion, and may object to            a course    of study which,   as   now
pursued,    is irrespective         of religious teaching.      Experience
has shown in how sickly a manner practical science is allowed
to raise its head under the direction of those persons whose
pursuits are alien to        it,   whilst in every land where   it    has had
due support the greatest benefits have resulted.
      " Placed
                 as    the       Geological Survey and its affiliated
branches now are, in subordination to the Board of Trade,
they are continually aiding in the development of an amount
of mineral wealth far exceeding that of any other country,
and in this wholesome and important action the movements
of our body are not only unfettered, but are likely to receive
all that encouragement which seems alone to be wanted to
enable this establishment            to be eminently useful in instruct
ing that class of persons who will materially augment the
productive industry and trade of Great Britain."

248            SIR RODERICK MTJRCHISON.                         [ISM-JO.
     This letter, Murchison says, was lost in one or other of
the Departments into whose hands             it came,   so  that when
it was required to be printed,     in obedience to an order of the
House of Commons,         a copy   of it had to be obtained from
the letter-book of the Survey Office.          Such treatment of       it
did not indicate that it had had much weight,        so that he could
hardly be surprised      shortly afterwards     to find himself and
all his establishment    transferred bodily to the custody of the
Science     and  Art Department of the Privy Council                 He
continued up to the last to lament the change.               It  led, he
thought, to one of the very evils he had predicted, inasmuch
as  it placed him and all his Professors practically under the
supervision of men who had no knowledge             of, and   probably
as  little interest in, scientific progress.    But the change was,
after all, more apparent than real, and probably his strong
objection to   it was in good measure personal         Previously the
Director-General of the Geological Survey had reported direct
to a   Minister of State, now he would have to conduct his
 communications      through Mr. Henry Cole.
      Over and above the ordinary and daily routine belonging
to such an office, the position of Director-General               of the
 Geological   Survey necessarily involved an accession of those
 incidental duties and interruptions which every man in                  a
 public position must expect, and which,          as they often     con
 sume much valuable time, demand          the exercise of no small
 portion of good temper.       Without attending to the chrono
 logical order of the incidents, let us gather from his letters
 as characteristic  a picture as may be obtainable      of the hetero
geneous nature of these various occupations.
      Frequent communications       of an official kind passed be
tween     the Foreign and     Colonial   Offices and      the   Jermyn

U56-70.]       COLONIAL CORRESPONDENCE.                               249
Street establishment       relative to mining and cognate matters
abroad or     in the Colonies.       Now and then, indeed, the cor
respondence even became a friendly one between Murchison
and the Colonial Governors          or other authorities.      Thus with
Sir Henry Barkly he kept up an active correspondence re
garding the gold-diggings in Victoria, during which he saw
reason to modify, or almost to abandon, his dogma that deep
mining for gold in the solid rock can never be pursued to
profit.
     To the same correspondent           he writes on Colonial        de
fence    : —
     " I   am glad you approve of my resounding the tocsin as
to the defenceless       state of your noble Colonies.           The old
mother is so apt to fall asleep, and fancy that nothing can
ever befall her, that     it  has been a hard matter to rouse her to
call all her own sons at home to arm in her defence.                 Now
perhaps we are running into the other extreme              ;  and though
I   am delighted to see the martial spirit called up in the
Volunteer movement,           I confess, as one who disembarked         in
Portugal in 1808 alongside            of Sir A. Wellesley, and who
has thought much         upon his old profession       of arms,    I have
little reliance in any irregular, desultory, unconnected, and
ill-disciplined    aids.     I  adhere to the doctrine,      — 'Dieu   est
toujours avec les gros bataillons,' and          I  heartily wish the
Government had turned out 40,000 or 50,000 good militia
men."
     With Sir William Denison also, the Governor- General
of Australia, he exchanged occasional            letters     on Colonial
geology, and other subjects.         Thus to the latter correspondent
he writes : — " Your letter stimulating me to exertion                  in

Ministers were in an agony about their untoward Reform
Bill, and since then Sir Edward has been              so  unwell that         I
have as yet been unable to aid you.               When we look at the
splendid publications of the Yankees respecting the geology
and natural history of their several governments,               it is humi
liating to   be forced to confess       that Britain   does     so  little in
this line.    I  confess that    I see little prospect of inducing our
Government to undertake such             a scheme   for all our colonies,
though     I  have      hopes   that the     colonies  which specially
called for and paid their geologists and naturalists would be
assisted   in any publication by the Imperial Government.                . . .
     " Just  as   Trinidad paid half the salary, and the Imperial
Government the other half to the surveyors,              so the     Colonial
Government Office might be at half the expense of the pub
lications.     Now this is     a practical measure     as relates to one
colony at a time, and        in one region of the world       ;   but when
you talk of these geologists            coming    under my control          as
principal editor, you have no idea of the labour that this
 would entail."
     "...     You will perceive that            I appeal   in favour of
 a more efficient      maritime protection of our long and exposed
 sea-board.      It   is an old hobby of mine, and          I    cannot yet
 divest  myself of the apprehension             that we have been too
 heedless of the increase of power of our Gallican allies                   in
 waters    where     they have      neither colonies     nor commerce.

 an old geologist, who has many other duties          upon him, both
 scientific and official.
      " The last three
                          years of my life      (as regards   my own
 career as a geologist) have been chiefly spent          in preparing
and     working out    a new    classification   of the rocks of my
 native country, the Highlands of Scotland, and             I am now
endeavouring      to give the last touches to this labour of love
and hard work preparatory          to the meeting     of the British
Association at Aberdeen, at which          I shall have to hold forth
on the subject."
     But Murchison, though an indefatigable correspondent
with his friends and acquaintances, had lived too long apart
from the forms      and routine of official business to get very
readily into the ways and style usual in public departments.
His letters were apt sometimes to look like embryo lectures,
or even like bits of some of his presidential addresses.             It
was not encouraging        to him consequently       to receive three
lines of official acknowledgment         in answer to     a document
which perhaps covered        a good many foolscap pages.          Now
and then too, being on a personal          and friendly footing with
the heads of other public departments,            he would write to
them      on public   business,  but in such      a way    as to leave
them      in doubt whether he meant his communication to
have an official character.         Of all those with whom, by
virtue of his position in the Survey, he had to come into
frequent official relations,     there was none who used such
plain language to him and of him          as the  Comptroller of the
Stationery Office, the late        J.  R. M'Culloch.       That stern
guardian of the public        purse    had no sympathy, or even
patience,    for the Survey's    scientific publications, which, in
obedience     to Treasury orders, the Stationery Office had to

the Director-General, would be received by him with a gruff
— " Well,    some more of      Sir Eoderick's             trash !"      The
same caustic critic could be as sharp with his pen as with
his tongue.        Witness the following plain-spoken              but no
doubt well-timed and obviously sensible note             : —
    " MY      DEAR     SIR RODERICK, — I       received     your     letter,
marked
           '
             Confidential,' and      I  have done     what     I  thought
was   right under the circumstances.               Confidential letters
are very awkward things in matters of business.               The person
to whom they are addressed can't, and the person by whom
they are addressed won't, act upon them.              Hence they had
much better be withheld. —         I am most     truly yours,
                                             "  J. R    M'CULLOCH."
    The affairs of the Geographical Society occupied during
all this time     a  chief share of Murchison's time and thought.
Their interest and importance,           however,    demands      separate
treatment,    and they     will therefore be more particularly re
ferred to in a later chapter.         It  may be noticed       in passing
that besides the more distinctly geographical tasks or routine
duties   of the President of that Society,            Murchison        took
occasion    still,  as we have    seen   he used to do, to mingle as
much sociality and good-fellowship with the proceedings as
he found   it possible to introduce.       And the experience gained
in this way he would now and then offer to                  a friend who
had the same sort of task to perform.               Nobody in London
had had more experience than he in presiding over meetings,
whether dull and scientific, or lively and social,          so his advice

 is56-ro.]      A LESSON         IN PUBLIC          DINNERS.               253
  was a useful guidance.            The great Livingstone Festival of
  1858 was a good example            of his happy tact in this kind of
  duty.       Livingstone was about to start on             a new     mission
 of discovery, and it had been determined                   to give     him   a
 more thorough outfit.            Murchison took an active            interest
 in the preparations, and assisted in procuring              a  young assis
 tant      to   accompany      the   intrepid     explorer    as   geologist.1
 Escaping from these cares to the quiet of the country, he
 writes to Professor Phillips just before the anniversary meet
 ing of the Geological Society: — " nth February 1858. —                      I
 came here [Chertsey] to get my gullet into order, the severe
 changes of weather,          and my great exertions         in getting up
 and carrying through the Livingstone Festival, having done
 me up.        I  am now called up again to settle some dispute
 about the salary of one of L's followers.

 any of your precursors.2            With three such public men             as
 you have secured, you need give me little to do.
      " One
                 piece of advice      I seriously give you.         There   is
 nothing      so  fatal to a public dinner     (crede experto)    as a  pleni
 tude of toasts.         Ten should be the outside,          including the
 Eoyal and Loyal.           This was my number at the Livingstone
 Festival, and by my precision of firing,           i.e. never   losing time
and yet giving them time to breathe,              I got through before or
just at midnight.
   1 The assistant
                     eventually chosen was Mr. Richard Thornton, a student
of the Royal School of Mines, who afterwards died in Africa while serving
under the Baron von der Decken.
   2 Professor
                 Phillips had been chosen President of the Geological Society.
The preparations here mentioned refer to the anniversary dinner of the
Society, at which he was to preside.     Murchison's advice, and his allusion
to his own methods of procedure,     are very characteristic of him.

         In   the preparations            for the International               Exhibition of
 1862, Murchison, from his official position at                              Jermyn Street,
and       in connexion with the department of Science and Art,
necessarily            had his share.             He was chosen chairman of one
of the juries, and in that capacity had his hands for                                    a   time
kept pretty full of work.                       To his friend, Sir Henry Barkly,
he writes          :—
         " The Commissioners               of the International Exhibition of
1862 have applied to me to know                              if   it   will not   be possible
to test       in this [the Jermyn Street] establishment                              the eco
nomic value of the various coals of the British Colonies, of
which, in the event, the Governors                                would send specimens.

for the cost of the inquiry.                      We have no staff in this build
ing, nor any space for such an inquiry (on the great scale).
We must, in fact, have ground, set up large boilers, and
employ several chemists,                   etc.      Nor can      it    be done in   a   hurry,
if   a   really valuable              result    is    wanted.      ...   I    find that our
metallurgical Professors think we can sufficiently analyse the

       Geological surveys are all the fashion in New Zealand.
I  have already sent       out Dr. Hector to Otago on            a three
years' survey,    with   a good assistant, and     I  have no doubt
he   will   do capital work.        His portion of the labour in
defining the character of the upper region of the Saskat
chewan and the Rocky Mountains, also of British Columbia,
was admirably done.
     " I  have now an application from Wellington province for
another     surveyor.    In replying     thereto, and hunting out a
fit man,    I could not avoid the expression of my satisfaction
in reading two reports in the New Zealand              Gazette,   by the
Honourable L. C. Crawford,           on the geological    structure     of
the province of Wellington."
     "23d June 1862. — Here           I am again President of the
Geographers, my eighth year of office.           I presided   over 200
people at dinner      in Willis's Ball-room, and    as  I had   some of
the foreign chairmen      of classes in the International Exhibi
tion,  I   contrived to make the evening pass with liveliness
and point.       Gladstone    spoke admirably,     but they scarcely
noticed his speech, and omitted all my sayings and doings in
the Times.
     "I    have had, besides, very hard work          as  chairman      of
Class   L of the Exhibition.      With 2000 exhibitors in my class,
it  has been no small difficulty to adjudicate           witli fairness
 some 300 or 400 medals.         The weather has been positively
horrible, — wet and cold rains for ever, but to-day there seems
to be    a genial change.     It  is marvellous that the Exhibition
 should succeed     as well as  it  does, despite the  Palace shut up,
 the Court absent, and half of our cotton-mills closed."            ...

      Again, when the outcry arose regarding               the probable
 early exhaustion of coal in Britain, and           a Eoyal Commission
 was appointed         to  investigate   the subject,    Murchison     was
 nominated       a member     of the Commission,      and acted as chair
 man of two of the committees           into which the Commissioners
 subdivided their number for the purposes of the inquiry.
 In   the report     finally adopted and printed, the opinion was
 expressed that a productive coal-field probably exists             under
 the Chalk and other           Secondary    rocks   of the south-east of
England.         Against this statement Murchison strongly pro
tested, and his protest          was   appended     to the report.       He
believed that though Carboniferous             strata might be found at
no great depth, geological analogy was wholly adverse to the
idea of any productive coal-basin            ever being found in that
part of the country.          We shall probably have this question
settled at no distant date, when the present Wealden boring
shall be completed.
      As one of the Trustees of the British Museum, Murchison
took    a keen and active       interest in the management of that
great institution.         Thus he writes to Sir Philip Egerton        : —
"  I  regret much to say that the electors of the Trustees of
the British       Museum gave us yesterday not only            L— ,    but
also   W—    !   as  if it  were nothing but a receptacle for Whigs
and Tories     !    I had   written urgently to the Archbishop and
the Speaker,        and had recommended           Lyell and Darwin, or
either of them.         I  hear that the Archbishop proposed them
both, but was beaten."
     By way of illustration of some of the minor but often
useful and friendly          occupations     for which the Director-
General of the Geological Survey found time, reference may
be made in conclusion to the trouble he seemed to enjoy

in promoting              a    subscription-list       or testimonial for a poor
fellow- worker in science.                  Thus, in the winter of 1858-9,
Auguste Balmat, the prince of Alpine guides, under whose
tuition       it will     be remembered         that Murchisou         had done his
share of glacier work, came to London, and among those who
had profited            by his thoughtful and sagacious care the desire
arose to present him               with some mark of their gratitude and
esteem.1           A   small committee, with Murchison                 as one   of its
members,            was       formed    to carry out this       design.        To the
Master          of     Trinity Murchison           writes    about      the    matter
thus     :   — " I specially introduce            the name      of James Forbes
on the committee                 as    the leading man.         He indeed it was
who made Balmat what he                     is,   and most sincerely      is   Balmat
attached           to Forbes.           specially wish to consult him about
the testimonial,               and I I   know     it   will gratify Balmat that
his old master's taste has been displayed in the matter."
        To Forbes,            on the    same friendly       mission,    he says   :—
"                                                 He called on me yesterday,
    A. Balmat has just arrived.
and  I        found that the present which would most gratify him
would be           a   photographic apparatus, which he would employ
in delineating some of the striking physical features of the
Alpine regions."
        Besides        such miscellaneous          occupations,   Murchison       did
not forget             his old and favourite science.             But before we
trace the record of his last touches to Geology, we may turn
in the next chapter to                 see how the      holidays from his official
work in London were now spent.

                     CHAPTEE XXVI.
          SUMMER   HOLIDAYS OF A GOVERNMENT    OFFICAL.
     AFTER his accession to the office of Director-General of
the Geological Survey, Murchison never took any of the pro
longed continental journeys which had marked the previous
periods of his life.  There was still much to be done among
his own palaeozoic formations abroad, much which he might
yet accomplish himself.     But he now found it by no means
so easy to get  away  as it used to  be.  He succeeded indeed
in escaping from London for      a  month or more every year,
but he could not often go to France or Germany. The attrac
tions of the Highland    geology, as already narrated, carried
him north for several years, and he there worked out his
last important piece of field -geology.     But the Highland
labours were not continuously prosecuted in successive years.
In   the intervals he spent his holiday sometimes   in doing a
little home-geology in this country, sometimes in making a
bold dash once more into the rocks of the Continent.
     The home journeys were almost wholly geological, having
usually for their object the investigation of some point con
nected   with Siluria, including perhaps a week with the
British Association and visits to old friends in the country.

A     few of them were undertaken for the sake of seeing the
field-work      of the Geological Survey, and making the per
sonal acquaintance            of  the officers     under his command.
These took place shortly after his appointment as Director.
They were not repeated in later years.
       Thus, early in    July    1856, Murchiaon betook himself into
 Gloucestershire to          see   some of his      old Silurian     haunts.
 Mr. Eamsay joined him, and some time                        was   spent  by
them      among      the  Silurian and Oolitic rocks of the Tort-
worth district, where they enjoyed the hospitality of Lord
 Ducie, who accompanied              them    in their excursions.        The
journal of this time, wholly geological,             seems to have been
 kept chiefly with         a   view to the new edition of Siluria.
                                                      " We made various

 excursions       in . the range of the Lower Oolites, and were
 accompanied         by  a  very intelligent      person    who had been
 in business        in Cheltenham, and had quitted it for the
 hammer.         This, was Robert Etheridge.            Judging from his
 celerity, his quickness in finding shells and naming them,
 and    in drawing sections,       I  said to Eamsay,

 panied      by Lord Ducie, Ramsay,            and   Aveline (one of the
  senior officers of the Survey Staff), saw once more, and with
     1  Mr. Etheridge, whose merits were already known to Lord Ducie, had
  been   asked by his Lordship to meet the geologists at Tortworth.        He
  was   soon after appointed Assistant Naturalist to the Geological Survey ;
  subsequently, on the resignation of Mr. Salter, he became Palaeontologist,
  and since that time has gradually risen to hold a foremost place among
  the palaeontologists of this country.

     For many years the Geological Survey had been at work
in Ireland,     a considerable      tract in the south and south-west
of the island having been mapped and published.                        In bis
capacity     of Director-General,          Murcbison     arranged    to  visit
his Irish colleagues this autumn.               Hence, immediately after
the close of the Association-meeting, he started for                 Dublin,
whence,      after   some preliminary          inquiries   into office and
Museum work, and            a dinner or two at the Castle and else
where, he set out for the field to make              the acquaintance       of
his staff, and      see   for himself the nature of the ground, and
the condition and progress            of the mapping.          The weather,
however,      proved     most   unpropitious.        Storms of rain and
driving mist shrouded the hills and tore up the surfaces of
the streams and lakes into foam and spray.                    In the face   of
such obstacles        the Director forced his way southwards and
westwards,      taking Kilkenny and Limerick             on the way, into
the far promontories         of Kerry.        Porphyries, grits, Wenlock
fossils, Old Red Sandstone,            unconformabilities, and sections
innumerable,       contest    with the elements for prominence in
the    records     of   his journal.        It  was   pleasant    to  get   to
Muckross Abbey and enjoy a couple of days of rest. At that

                                     following note: — "He and I lodged to

The reflection of the groves of arbutus and banks of the
richest ferns in the pure and still waters of the stream,
which flowing from the upper to the middle lake, encompass
an isle, is quite marvellous.            Yet all these glorious glimpses
of nature have been brought out in full effect in water-
colours by Mrs. Herbert, whose              sketches of these scenes, as
well     as of the Alps and Italy, fully entitle her to be the lady
of such a paradise.           Her clear and decisive colouring, and

carried about the country, and he had now had enough of
the "roughing"          under which alone         Irish geology can be
properly worked out in the wilder regions.              So, bidding adieu
to  Killarney, and cutting short the rest of his programme of

in Ireland he was glad to find himself once more in Wales.

at once communicated            in   a  letter to Professor Ramsay,        as

slates.      Then there       are as good       Carboniferous Limestone
and Millstone-grits         as any in Scotia, but it is pitiable to         see
the miserable small packets            of broken culm at intervals of
scores of miles, which are dignified by the name of Coal-
measures.        Then as to mines          it is nil,   except what used to
be called the curse of the miner (pyrites).
       " Jukes is     a   fine energetic       fellow, and      I   made    the
acquaintance       of all his men (inspecting their work), who are
really good hard-working            youths,     who can stand a life         110
Englishman would tolerate.1 . . .
       " I am now convinced that we must have more work
men employed         in the English Survey, and specially in our
coal-districts, or some of these days we shall be blown up
by the Parliamentaries."          .  .  .
       No sooner had he got back to Montgomery and Shrop
 shire than he set to work at once upon his Silurian rocks,
 taking with him Richard Gibbs, the fossil-collector of the
 Survey, whose          sharp eye and stout             hammer could       turn
 fossils out of     a rock in which nobody else perhaps would
 have found anything.           Hence     a  postscript to the last quoted
 letter runs thus     : —
       "                      — Just

 see the   things in situ, for by persevering             I  got fossils all the
 way down to the Stiper Stones, and under them too.                         It  is
 a perfect    fossiliferous descending           series,     with   Oraptolites,
 Trildbites,   Orthoceratites, and Orthidcc, as well as Lingulce,
 both great and small, and is so irrevocably dovetailed                      into
 the series that no man alive can separate them in the field
 whatever Salter may do in his closet.                   I   shall now adhere,
with infinitely greater pertinacity than ever, to the original
 Silurian base, and standing on the Stiper Stones will defy
all the world."

there joined him as his companion, and they conjointly added
some new and interesting particulars to our knowledge of the
palaeozoic rocks of the north-west of England.                       When on
one of these excursions Murchison                   wrote some gossiping
letters to his friends Sir William               Denison and Sir Henry
Barkly, from which some extracts will take us best into the
current of his work and thoughts.

       To the former he writes (16th August 1863) :— " On a
 Sunday afternoon, when far away from the smoke and noise
 of the metropolis, in which      I have    been presiding, chattering,
 eating, and    drinking    for the last eight months           (barring  a
 little pheasant-shooting up to February last), here               I am in
 the middle of my Permian rocks           in Lancashire.   .  .  .
      " I tried hard before     I   left town to get some honours
 of the Crown from my good friend Lord Palmerston for
 the men    of the Nile, Speke and Grant, and though               I failed
 for the moment        I am sure the right thing must be dona
 (See the postscript to my Address.)
      " I never expected to see my country drifting             again into
 a  war for an idea.     We did so in the Crimean War, and               as
 Mr. Bull required to be         let  blood   after so  many years of
stagnation,    I  suppose that,    folly   as  it was, the thing was
inevitable.      But  as the  only result of that war was to raise
France egregiously, and above all in her maritime condition,
and almost to elevate her beyond us,            I could not have con
ceived that we should have been on the point of              still further
raising her and advancing her to the Ehine on account                    of
the Poles — a people who have never known, and                will   never
know, how to govern themselves.                Mr. Bull has strangely
changed from his old character if he thus Quixotizes.
      "
        We are all dead sick of the brutal American struggle.
I   have   always wished for the South, because they fought
like noble fellows for their independence."
      To Sir Henry Barkly : —
     " Our
             meeting at Newcastle [British Association] was               a
very good one.       I  was, of course, well satisfied, inasmuch         as
my section       of Geography and          Ethnology   was      the   most
popular by far of the divisions of our Parliament of Science.

      " I have  effected a considerable       change   in our geological
maps of England       in this recess.      There is always something
to be done, even at home       !     If you    look at any one of the
geological maps of England, including my own               little one, you
will    see  that in Westmoreland and Cumberland, all the
valley of the Eden, up to Carlisle and round into Lancashire,
by the coast of Whitehaven and Furness, is laid down                      as
New Red or Trias.         Now    I   have demonstrated,        in conjunc
tion with Mr. Binney and Professor Harkness, that all this
region    is Permian.      I have further shown, what these two
gentlemen      were   at first indisposed       to admit, that on the
western side of the Pennine chain the Permian group                     ex
hibits a large mass of sandstone, superior to the Magnesian
Limestone (near Bees Head), which is also an integral part
of the group, as in tracts of Germany (see SUuria).
      " Harkness and
                          myself also determined a fact of some
importance     to the amplification of my Permian group, viz.,
that the hematite       iron ore of Cumberland, which lies in
cavities of the Carboniferous Limestone, is               a   part of the
Rothliegende or Lower Permian.              This fact is quite new.
      " When    I                             I
                  look round the world cannot help saying how
grateful we ought to be who live at home and                 ease  in these
islands.     With such horrors         as are going     on   in America,
where the mob rules supreme, or where their President is as
odious a tyrant as imperial Rome could have produced,                  it is
wonderful that such men            as   Everett    and   Agassiz should
write to me from Boston        as   if  nothing were occurring that
would not soon pass away, and           as if  the great republic would

to the fact that at the meetings                   of that body Murchison
still continued to take          a       prominent and useful part.                     We
can hardly count them properly                 with his holiday, but coming
as   they did in the time during which he escaped from Lon
don life, they may be briefly noticed in this chapter.                                  His
geographical         ardour, which, as before remarked, led to the
creation of a special geographical                section at the Association
meetings,       eventually      made that section               one        of the most
popular of all.         He had       a    paternal interest in             it,   and used
in   a   half-jocular, half-serious style to boast of its attrac
tiveness, and of the way             in which
                                         had eclipsed the other

             in the shape of     a       Livingstone,   a    Speke, or           a   Baker,
he was sure to           fill his meeting-room              to overflowing, and
knowing this, he did his best, when in the chair, to secure
the attendance of some such explorer, or, failing him, of                                  as
many geographical            notables as he could induce to coma                        His
enthusiasm          in behalf of the geographical                    element         of the
British Association was never more ardent than on the occa
sion of the Newcastle meeting                     in 1863,          as   the following
extracts from his notes to Lady Murchisoii will show —                            :    -

1200 persons          in the Assembly Rooms, and he performed
twice    as   well   as he   did in London.        I        am anxious that you
should read the accounts                  given in the Newcastle Express,
which goes to-day, because every word                       I       said   is    well re

of England with Harkness, and on the reptiliferous sand
stones of Morayshire.               Yesterday    I proposed    we should meet
at Bath, and Lyell for President, and it was carried by                    a large
majority.

          Yesterday, also, they gave us            a dinner, at which        I  had

popularity."
       Before passing          from the      British Association we may
take some further extracts,                 showing the meeting           under     a
very different aspect.               In   the year    1864    it met at Bath,
under the presidency of Sir Charles Lyell, and with Mur
               1 A  favourite terrier of Lady Hutchison's   later years.

 chison   as   the  leader    of  the   geographers.    The  Geogra
 phical Section     mustered     strong,  especially in African tra
 vellers,  Livingstone, Burton, and Speke being there.            But
 before its close the meeting        was thrown into mourning by
 the   sudden    and   distressing    death   of one of these great
pioneers.      Murchison writes of the meeting and the tragedy
 thus: — " Livingstone was the greatest lion of the meeting,
 and was with his charming           girl Agnes staying in the same
 house with myself.        Speke   came in from a friend's house in
the neighbourhood        to reply to a paper by Captain Burton,
which he knew would be antagonistic.                That paper being
deferred,    he left our meeting       before two o'clock   and rode
back again to the country.          There, taking his gun to   kill  a
few partridges, and accompanied          by  a young friend, he met
with his death by incautiously pulling his gun at full cock
after him in getting over a stone wall
     "
       Livingstone and      I  went from Clifton into the heart of
East Somerset to attend the funeral.            It was indeed a very
touching     scene.   There were met together the great South
African explorer Livingstone, and Grant, the companion              of
Speke, with myself, the historian and profound admirer and
friend of these noble fellows.         The funeral procession, with
all of us on foot, proceeded from the pretty little parsonage
of his brother,      the   Eev. B. Speke.        The country people
lined the roadside       and hedges as we moved down to the
little church, and then Grant placed an immortelle on the
coffin of his leader."
     The event is again touched upon in a letter to Sir Wil
liam Denison : — " Since I received your letter of the 29th
July,   I have been going through a good deal of purgatorial
business    for the British Association.           My Section E,    or

Geography and Ethnology,           was   eminently successful,         al
though our proceedings          were necessarily    clouded      by the
catastrophe    of poor Speke's death.
      " I  have suggested     the erection  of  a monument         to his
memory,      and hope we may get enough to have an obelisk
or something       appropriate raised.     I  attended      his funeral,
and     it  was a very touching scene to see all the country
folks out and the         poor   father weeping      as    he  followed
the coffin     of his daring and intrepid        son    to   the   grave.
Grant, his companion, came from the Highlands expressly for
the purpose.       These explorers have done so much honour to
the    Indian army that     I  hope their companions       in arms   will
respond to my call (see my letter, Times, 27th September)."
      The home holidays were sometimes given to amusements
not by any means scientific.          For example, in the autumn
of 1858, he paid     a visit to Lord Derby, and there saw English
statesmen in a light quite new to him.           From the full notes
which he made of this visit, he evidently considered                   its
details worthy of preservation.           The Social Science Con
gress, with Lord Brougham at its head, had met at Liverpool,
and after its sittings, some of its members              were     invited
by the Tory Premier to Kuowsley,             where    also Murchison
arrived about the same time,           and found, that among the
                " Lord and         John Russell, with their daugh
guests were                  Lady
ters, and Lord Carlisle, both of them        Whig statesmen, who
 have been spouting the whole week on social               science with
 Brougham and his allies at Liverpool,            forming now part
 of  a  happy family with Derby and Walpole of the present
 Government."
       After dinner the party, sixteen in number, set to at high
                                    " The
jinks in the drawing room.                 games began by a name

less one,   in which we all stood round in a circle holding our
hands on a white band — Lord Derby beginning as the unfor
tunate man in the middle, whose play it is to hit the first
person's hand he can, to avoid which the hands of the com
pany are kept in perpetual motion on the band.                   For the
first few rounds    I observed   that the statesmen were oftenest
in the ring    ; but the old geologist, and every one, had his
turn, though      I think Lord John was most frequently in.
This was really     as good exercise as a       Highland reel"
      The next game consisted in sitting back to back, getting
 up  as music began, walking round and round the chairs, and
 dropping into the nearest one when the piano ceased, there
 being always one chair removed at each round.               Then came
 the time-honoured
                       " Post," when,     as each one chose    his town,
 the geologist, fresh from the wilds of Assynt, took             Inchna-
 damff, the name of his inn            there.     "The master of the
jinks," he says, "seemed particularly anxious to nail old
 Inchnadamff, for the post went oftenest              there,  though in
 reality it only    goes  twice   a   week    !  At first  I got off by
 quiet boggling,     but on another       occasion, when rushing,        I
 was caught.       Much fun."
      " What   a lesson do these    frolics read to those who think
 that political strife is not compatible          with real bonhommie
 and private friendship      !   How would foreigners above all
 stare   at seeing these gambols        of a 'happy family'       ! How
 impossible to realize in France           a game     in which Guizot
 and    Walewski,     Lamartine      and    Persigny,    should all    be

  originally   been designed    for Highland        geology,    was pre

and perhaps     being somewhat       depressed   in spirits, he gave
up his plan for doing more geology, and took instead to the
very different and rather mournful         occupation of revisiting
the scenes of his boyhood        and youth.      At Edinburgh the
recollections of sixty years back came fresh upon him — the
recruiting party, the balls and dinners, the bright young
faces which once captivated the heart of the fledgling en
sign.   Older still were the reminiscences         of his mother's
care.   To the last he cherished       her memory     as one   of the
most precious possessions of life.       With pious steps he now
seeks out the places to which she took him when a boy, but
finds them  so changed as to be      hardly recognisable   — Fisher-
row, Lasswade,     Rosslyn, Peebles, all grown and modernized.
He makes a pilgrimage to Dryburgh, to the tomb of his
friend Lockhart, who, though two years his junior, had pre
deceased him.       At Raby    Castle, once the headquarters         of
fox-hunting, he finds the old Duke, his former sporting
chief, in enfeebled, age     At Rokeby his       quondam host had
given place to    a younger squire, and other changes had fol

      The foreign tours undertaken by Murchison during the
last fifteen years of his life had mainly for their object the
recruiting of his health by rest and change.                 But in most
cases the very sight of the old rocks among which he had
once worked so hard was enough to re-invigorate him, so that,
though he came to them somewhat of an invalid, he quitted
them with renewed vigour of body and buoyancy of mind.
      A   tempting prospect      opened    in the summer of 1857.
Having       seen the succession       of palaeozoic rocks in Europe,
the author of The      Silurian System was naturally desirous to
examine personally the remarkable development                of the same
rocks    in North America, where they had been            so successfully
worked out by Hall, Logan, and others.              There was to be      a
great congress of scientific men at Montreal, and the learned
Societies     of this country were invited to send delegates to
 that meeting.       Murchison wished to go as the representative
 of the Geological Society.         He had even decided his plans,
 when they were peremptorily broken up by his medical
 adviser.1
       Nevertheless an autumn tour of some kind was essential,
 and though he had to content himself           with a less ambitious
 programme,        he determined      to go abroad       and  set before
 himself    a  task which would give point and interest to his
 travel.     In  the end he arranged a ramble          through some of
    1 The Geological Society of London having resolved to send a delegate
 to the gathering at Montreal, Professor Ramsay was first proposed on the
 supposition that Murchison would not go.     When it was found that the
 latter did wish to undertake the journey the arrangement was changed.
 Mr. Ramsay writes :— " Murchison consulted Sir Henry Holland in the
 hall of the Athensum when we were together. Sir Henry looked into
 his eyes, and at the white ring that encircled the iris, and said he must
 not go to America."   The first choice was therefore adhered to, and Mr.
 Ramsay was selected, and went accordingly.

Russian tour.           The plan adopted was thus described                     :   —
     " 30th   July      1857. — MY DEAR        M. BARRANDE, —After having
arranged         everything for      a voyage to Canada              and the United
States, commencing                with   the    great          meeting   of savans at
Montreal,         I    have      changed       my        plans,    seeing    that       my
doctor rather prescribed for me rest, and the quiet amuse

graphers,        Director of the Geological Survey,                      or Trustee      of
the British Museum, etc., and now having printed my anni

on Sunday night, 2d August, for Antwerp.
     " Thence     I      shall ramble on towards the Thiiringerwald,
and establish           myself there for ten days at the baths of
Liebenstein,          of which I    am very fond          ;    because one can get
there pure and cold water, perfect shade, and capital Permian
rocks.       So write me      a   note to say  ifI        shall find you at Prague

     His companion        in this tour was Mr. T. Rupert Jones,
Assistant Secretary of the Geological Society — a name now
familiar wherever palaeontology has made its way.                 Keeping
in view the examination of the sections and fossils of the
Permian rocks     as   their main business, the travellers passed
over a large area of the Continent.             For after ascending the
Rhine, and lingering at Liebenstein and Prague, they went
on to Vienna, and then, wheeling round by Breslau, struck
north for Berlin.       Thereafter   a pleasant      time was passed in
the   Harz, whence         a   leisurely    progress     by Oassel     and
Frankfurt    took them        to   Bonn in time         for the     annual
gathering of the German Naturforscher.                 Lastly, making     a
run into the Lower Rhine province, they turned their faces
homeward,     and got back        to   England after an absence of
about two months.
    The journal of the tour is         as  usual almost wholly geolo
gical, and its scientific details have been already published.
From its pages, and          from the      letters   of the time, some
extracts of a more generally interesting nature may here be
culled.
    At Liebenstein        a   courtly     and   flattering    letter from
Humboldt was found by Murchison awaiting his arrival, in
which, among other phrases, the writer stated his opinion
that " celui qui de tous les ge"ologues vivans a embrasse" la
plus vaste sphere des connaissances prdcises sur la structure
de notre    planete,     c'est   Sir Roderick Murchison.             C'est
1'opinion  que   je proclame."          And the courtier conveyed
further   a hope     that    the   geologist    would visit Potsdam.

This in due course Murchison did, paying his respects once
more to the      King, and spending hours in multifarious gossip
with Humboldt.          Among other remarks of the learned Prus
sian, the journal records that he

alluding to his present onerous position, in standing between
the     King, with his decorations and pensions, and a large
host of correspondents,         he assured me that the mere postage
of his 2500 letters per annum now came to £150, which,                        as
he said, would educate two youths.                Some of the letters he
had to answer were most absurd.                Thus he brought out one
from a      M — , which in       about  thirty pages endeavoured to
show that all the Bible could be explained by certain figures
— 6600 — and was full of Greek and other quotations                      ; also
letters    from    pious young ladies, who sought to have the
privilege of closing his eyes when he died.                 He spoke of his
manifestly decaying          strength.     Though he could          stand for
                                                              '

 14th of this month       I  shall be eighty-eight.'

 years, not long before his death, Eumboldt,   in writing to Murchison, spoke
 of De Beaumont thus : — " Klie de Beaumont fait le Kepler sans decouvrir

of selecting the next place of meeting.            Emms on the Weser,
Carlsruhe,      and Diisseldorf competed.           Noggerath made             a
series of jokes and puns with his arch gravity and stento
rian lungs      ;   one of which was about the division of Ger
many   being        no longer that of North         and South,         but,   as
Leopold von Buch had termed             it,   the land where they        drink
wine out of small glasses, and where they drink                    it   out of
large ones.         Another was that in speaking of an individual
he called him Schmidt, and being corrected                  by being told
that Schwarz was the man's name, he roared out,                    '

smaller glasses of wine, and said they were now united, and
one Vaterland,        in drinking their good old beverage of              beer.
This hit was immensely applauded, and warmed the cockles
of their German         hearts, and specially of Naturforscher and
medical men who drank nothing else.                 The palaver ended

  can hold a gallon of beer and          will make    a  popular President.
  Then came the dinner at one o'clock.               I dined   at our hotel,
  the Star, where about          150 to 200 sat down         —Dechen, De
  "Verneuil, Abich, Koksharoff, Hermann von Meyer, and a fair
  sprinkling of good geologists.             This lasted two hours and      a
  half.

                  followed an excursion          to Rolandseck, to       hear
  Noggerath     give a discourse       on the chief volcano         of Roder
  Berg, about one and a half mile inland from the Rhine.                 The
 old cock led the motley group of ladies and gentlemen, and
 very few geologists, — in all         a mass     of about 300 to 400, —
 through the woods, slopes, open fields,           etc., and then stepping
                       '
 across, he said,        We must mark the potatoes before we get
 at the cutlets ;' and he took us across the crater, about three
 quarters of a mile        in diameter, and explained to us how the
 wind must have blown from                  north to south      during the
 eruption,     of which there were evidences              in the fact that
 lapilli and     scoriae    twice alternated      with loess and Rhine
pebbles.
      " We descended
                              after sunset, and walked         a   mile and
more to the other station, where, after waiting three quarters
of an hour, De Verneuil, Daubrde, Jones, and myself, jump
ing into     a first-class    carriage   coupt, escaped, and thus pre
served ourselves         for the rewards of the evening, all dead

very much to my own satisfaction,             ...    I have thus got all
the German Permian          in my pocket.        Feeling that much is
to be done    in the English Permian,          I intend to go  down for
a week to    look again at several sections, which, in the north
of England, have been laid open by railroad cuttings.                  .  . .
You will much oblige me if you will send me your opinion,
and a hint or two as to the spots where                I am  most    likely
to see clear data.      . .  .
       " Our old friend
                          Noggerath played his part stoutly and
heartily, and    as   our dear old friend Dechen received every
evening at supper, and De Beaumont               and De Verneuil came
from Paris, with Deville, Hubert, Daubre"e,              and the French
geologists,   I enjoyed the meeting         much.      Dechen and your
old allies begged me to convey to you their kindest remem
brances.
       " De
            Beaumont      spoke to me about the vacancy             in the
Institute caused by the death of Buckland, and then                  I told
him of the melancholy addition to the            list of poor Conybeare.
'
  One of the vacancies,' he said, ' we must of course           fill up in
our list of correspondents,        and   it is my intention to propose
 Professor Sedgwick, who        will, I hope, be unanimously elected.'
 I told him   that  I  had already conveyed my sentiments on the
 question being put to me by a mutual friend, and that there
could be no hesitation in bringing you in before any of our
English contemporaries,         and that according        to your merits
you ought to have preceded          me.

     About three weeks later, having meanwhile carried out
his   intention of visiting the north of England, he again
reports to the same friend : —     I
                                  " returned from

skirmish on Monday night, having explored             many of your
old beats, and,  I  am happy to say, with a sincere admiration
of your old and most excellent memoir.          Your letter was a
full proof to me that your memory was anything but an
'
   old rotten fishing-net,' for  I  never received      from you or
from any one a more clear synopsis         of all that constituted
truly the British Permian.       ...    I  zigzagged      across most
of your old sections, and admired them       all"
      Occasionally the   Director-General      did     not wait       till
 autumn for his holiday, but would escape about Easter for
 a week or two into France, not, of course, to do any field-
work, but to have a geological        gossip    with De Verneuil,
 ]£lie de Beaumont, and other old friends.          In  the spring     of
  1860 he paid a short  visit of this kind to Paris.       Sauntering
 through the boulevards, and contrasting       them and the open
 gardens with the narrow ill-paved streets of 181      4, he could not
refrain from admitting that the Emperor Napoleon, whom he
 never could forgive for provoking the war with Eussia, had at
least done good to Paris.   At  the same time he drew a contrast
between what was possible      in France and in England. " We
 free and insolent islanders," he remarked,           "can never by
any possibility    have really fine public buildings, or           well-
 regulated and attractive public places, because the hand
 and mind of an autocrat        of taste are wanting.          Yet we
 have one public garden as fine as,    if not finer than, anything
 in the world, and that is Kew.       And why     ?  simply because
 my friend Hooker is really autocrat there, and, doing every
thing he wishes, is no more stinted in money grants than

duction at this critical juncture, when many other causes of
irritation exist, serves to fan a warlike flame.                               The country
is essentially          money-making and prosperous                      ;   but   so   dislikes
the       war now,         that when the Emperor started for Italy
every one was against his going to fight for such canaille.
'
    But,'    said my          friend,    '

          The two friends and fellow-travellers, quitting politics
    with the gaieties and discussions of Paris, made their way
    to the district of Amiens and Abbeville, which had recently
    come so prominently before the world in connexion with
    the   question       of the antiquity of the human race.                               They
    looked at the gravel, saw the way the flint tools lay                                  in    it,
    and visited M. Boucher de Perthes,                         who,          in his old age,
    suddenly found             himself and            his museum              famous.           De
    Verneuil then returned               to Paris, while his companion                          got
    back to London.
          The summer of 1862 proved to be                      a    trying one to many
    of those who had duties in connexion with the International
    Exhibition.          Murchison in the end precipitately fled from
    London, and took refuge                        at some Bohemian baths, from
    which        he    sent   the following            account      of himself to Sir
    William Denison —         :

misfortune           to       be the    Chairman        of Class         No. I. of the
International Exhibition, and had, with my jurors, to arbitrate
among          nearly 3000 exhibitors.                     Moreover, they would
insist in my re-occupying the presidential chair of the
Geographical              (vice    Lord Ashburton), and what with other
occupations           of various sorts, and loads                  of dinners, public
and private,          I was       somewhat used up.
      " Here        I have        been drinking and toddling about among
Austrians, Prussians, Poles, Hungarians, and a few of our
own countrymen and women for the last five weeks.                                           Now

about         to    take      my hammer         in hand, and revisit, for the
third time, the magnificent Silurian basin around Prague,
which has been admirably laid open by a new railroad from
Pilsen to that city.

there underlie all the fossiliferous                   strata.         (This     is   quite new

     " Here, embosomed in pine forests, we have splendid
large crystalline granite,       through which the gaseous and
saline waters, with     iron (the remnant         of  a former    intense
volcanic energy), bubble up. Certainly there is no watering-
place better calculated      to suit a variety of persons            amid
these several wells,     each     of which differs from the neigh
bouring sources by containing more or less of salt, iron, and
carbonic acid gas.     We are all obliged to use the carriage of
the apostles, and there are many miles               of shrubby walks
all odoriferous of pines.        Whilst  I  write,   I go  from time to
time to my window to mark the sad progress of a fire in                    a
village some six miles off,        as seen   in the undulating lower
country.     This is the second village burnt down since                   I
came here.
     " We have    a pleasant     English circle, which Lord Clyde
was to have joined last week, but his companion, my old
friend Count Strzelecki, came without him, and is in the
same house with me.        .  .  .  When   I  came, and     for my first
fortnight, the best of the Austrian Generals,                Feld-Zeug-
Meister von      Benedek     was     here;    he who      smashed       the
Piedmontese    army at Solferino, and was called back from
his pursuit to break his heart by the hurried peace which
his young Emperor made with the crafty Louis Napoleon.
Benedek    is quite confident        that the French would have
been brilliantly   beaten  if   the war had gone on.         He utterly
denies that the fortresses       in the Quadrilateral were unpro-
visioned and unprepared, and he smiles at the idea of long
shots of artillery    deciding great general         actions.    I   once
heard the great Wellington say the same thing.                 Benedek
commands     the Austrian army        in Italy, nearly all of whom,
with himself, are Hungarians.          There is no doubt that it is

  at Count Flahaut's table          in London, that it was the finest
 army in Europe,         though      it had been ill- commanded.             If
 they have another burst when commanded by Benedek,                        the
 results    will be very different.1

          By the death of an old aunt,         I have    become the holder
 of rupee bonds, and,        as  they give me      a good interest,     I shall
 hold on,     as such as   Elgin and yourself        are our guarantors     in
 India.      Pray make some new geological                   or  geographical
 observations.       I cannot     solve   your meteorological         guesses,
 but    I  am always much          interested    in your descriptions        of
 what you      see or know.       I shall  be at my post         in six weeks
 for the opening of the Royal School of Mines, for that is the
 new title of the     Jermyn Street       locale,  including the Geologi
 cal Survey, Museum of Practical Geology, Mining Record
 Office, etc. etc. — Yours sincerely,             ROD.    I.  MURCHISON."
       Of the subsequent ramble into Bavaria, and thence west
 ward through France,        little need be said here.          The renovated
 geologist felt that he must be busy among the rocks again.
 But though this desire returned with much of its former
 fervour, it was not seconded, as it used to be, by the same
 indomitable activity of body.              Besides,     he had not come
 prepared for any really serious work, so that his geologizing
 was, to use a phrase of his own, more

judgments in his note-book very much in the same style                      as

      They certainly were different, the difference being sadly against poor
 Benedek in the Austro-Prussian campaign of 1866.

it in   1814, when all the choicest pictures                    of Italy were in    it,

assemblage      is such   !   The whole history of art from the
earliest efforts   of the Egyptians to the renaissance            of the
past centuries, and thence to the present day, is all before
you.     I  see  that the French folks set some value on Eos-
alba's pictures     in their own national collection, and hence
I shall now esteem my          own more."
      To interrupt for a little our narrative of holiday tours
abroad,    it may be mentioned         that an unfortunate relapse,
caught somehow         in the homeward journey from this excur
 sion, went far to undo the refitting which the               Marienbad
 waters were believed        to have effected    ; and thus, when the
 geologist   landed    in England again, he passed at once into
 the hands of Dr. Bence Jones.           Late in the autumn        he had
 usually never found any medical treatment                better than      a
 gun in a good pheasant cover        ;   and having several standing
 invitations, he proceeded to avail himself of them.
      Proceeding    first to Lord Palmerston's,        he writes, — " At
 Broadlands     I enjoyed some shooting with the dear Viscount
 and fine old Admiral Bowles.          As we went into the wood a
 cock-pheasant crossed me, and down fell two              !  Palmerston
 was delighted with the shot of the old geologist.             A    second
 bird happened to be crossing which            I did not  see.  . .  .   We
 had some pleasant visitors.         Among others, Henry Bulwer
 arrived with Turks         and long pipes, etc.     ; was amusing by
 flights, important, mysterious, and
                                           — disappeared."
      Lady Murchison, not in very good health, had remained
  at Brighton while her husband made his round of visits.                He
 was suddenly summoned to the coast again by a very serious

 and what at one time seemed             likely to prove fatal illness.
 Among his papers there            occurs a loose sheet, with         some
reflections     written during the suspense, and showing the
tender and grateful feelings with which he regarded her                 : —
      "Clermont, Norfolk, Nov.         5th,  1 P.M.,   1862.— Alas! the
telegram     received     calls  me to my dear wife's sick-bed at
Brighton, and here        I  am fast bound for three or four hours
for the want of any railway train, and doubting whether                     I
shall catch the Brighton train at night!                 What    a  painful
state of suspense, and what a journey                I  have before me       !
What a happy retrospect, and what a sad prospect !

angel for forty-six years.         She first imbued me        with   a love
of science, and weaned me from some follies of the world.
She accompanied        me    in the three or four first years of my
geological     career by land and by water           ; she   sketched     for
me,    collected   fossils for me, and       encouraged      me onwards.
Even when        I was working at my         Silurian System, twenty
years and upwards after our marriage, she was often by my
side, and from those days to these, when unable, from feeble
health,    to accompany        me,  she has been my best adviser,
and my infinite solace when           I returned    to my own fireside.
Her goodness, her deep          sense  of religion, and her practical
benevolence,      devoid of all cant and profession,           have often
made me reflect with sincere sorrow on my unworthiness of
her goodness, —on my vanity and love of the world and its
pleasures, as contrasted with her humility and true Christian
piety.

                     CHAPTER XXVII.
                THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.
     IN the course of the previous chapters the rise and
growth of the Geographical Society have already been inci
dentally dwelt upon.       We have seen how, from its beginning
onwards, Murchison had identified himself with that Society,
and how, in his later years, it had gradually so engrossed
his time and thoughts, that his old love, geology, could no
longer boast an undivided empire          over him.     In  watching
his career, too, it is to be noticed that much       as he  liked the
publicity    and display of a Society      so  rapidly growing in
popularity, the constantly pressing demands which its official
and routine work made upon him proved to be more                 than
at his now advanced       age he   thought he could satisfactorily
fulfil    Hence after, among other services, procuring for the
Society a royal charter of incorporation, and greatly aug
menting its membership,        influence, and wealth,    he  in 1859
resigned    the chair to Lord Ashburton, though with the          full
intention of remaining at the Council-board, and continuing
to give advice, and,   if need be, active assistanca
     Lord Ashburton's failing health, however,       made    Murchi-
son's retirement more nominal than        real   The ex-President
had   still to carry on a very large share of the Presidential

 MB.]        THE GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.                           291
 work of the Society, which, with its now world-wide corre
 spondence    and connexions,    was growing every year heavier.
At   the last moment,   too, when the     May anniversary of 1861
was    approaching,   Lord Ashburton,       suddenly called away
from London by illness in his family, left the preparation
of the annual Address as an additional load to " the         willing
horse."     Hence, in     1863,   after  a  brief  nominal   retire
 ment, Murchison, at the       entreaty   of his colleagues,   once
more took the chair,     and held    it up to the last  year of his
life.  It was during this later period that he kept the Society
most prominently before the world, and came himself to be
so widely known to the general public for his keen interest
in geographical     research, and     in the fate of geographical
explorers.     Some   more detailed notice of this part of his
career may therefore    fitly find a place here.
      Upwards of thirty years had passed since that committee
of the Raleigh Travellers' Club met out of which the Geo
graphical Society took its rise.      During that interval, though
there had been no adventurous          voyages  of discovery, after
the Drake and the Raleigh type, far more had been done to
extend our knowledge of the geography of the globe thaa
during any previous period of similar length.            With this
progress    of research   the   Geographical Society had       been
honourably associated.       Some    of its members    had distin
guished themselves     as bold and successful explorers    ;  but  it
sought    to reward and encourage        every  intrepid traveller,
whether belonging to its ranks or not, and eagerly embraced
the opportunity of publishing in its Journal, and in this way
making     widely known, the        narrative of his discoveries.
Having been     so long and   so  intimately associated with the
work of the Society, Murchison naturally felt and expressed

292           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                      [isei-ro.
a  just pride in the services   which it had been enabled        to
render to geographical   research.     Looking back through the
lifetime of more than     a  human generation,   — over  the vast
additions which had in that time been made to our acquaint
ance with the surface of the globe, — he could point to not a
few which had been achieved by members            of the Society,
or by others who owed some at least of their success to the
stimulus and assistance      which    the  Society had given to
them.     He could further boast that the evening       meetings,
discussions,  and publications    of the Society had been the
means    of first making known to the general         public    the
nature and value of such discoveries.
     There were three regions in particular, the exploration
of which had been watched by Murchison and his associates
with keen interest, — the   interior of Australia, the interior of
Africa, and the lands and    seas  lying round the North Pole.
     With regard to Australia, Murchison, when President of
the Society, as far back     as  1844, had earnestly    urged the
formation of settlements      on  the northern shores     of that
great continent.     He had reiterated     this advice in 1857,
pointing out how great would be the advantages,          commer
cially and politically, to have possession of the noble bays
and harbours of that coast -line, and concluding his appeal
with these words :— " Let us trust that if such a consumma
tion [a settlement   in North Australia] be obtained, the pro
posers   of it may not be forgotten, and that it may be
remembered      that the North Australian        expedition, now
happily completed under direction of Her Majesty's Govern
ment, was a child of the Royal Geographical Society."          The
indomitable courage of Macdouall Stuart in forcing his way

1s61-70.]         AUSTRALIAN EXPLORATION.                                    293
 across the continent, eventually brought about the establish
 ment of the settlement             so   earnestly desired, — "an object
 which," Murchison remarked, " has long been a dream of my
 own, and which        I rejoice   to see thus realized       in my lifetime."1
     Besides       the  references      in the formal anniversary Ad
 dresses, the President          showed      in other ways         a keen    and
 kindly interest in the colonies and their future,                     as well as
 in the exploration of new territory.                  At his    suggestion the
 Society gave       a gold medal to the family of one of the Aus
tralian explorers         who had lost his life in the attempt                 to
 recross     the continent.        Alluding to this he writes to Sir
 Henry Barkly: —
     "  I  told you in my last that              I  thought     it probable we
should grant one of our gold medals to the family of Burke,
and    I  am happy to announce to you that at our last meeting
of Council the award was made               as    I  anticipated,    and on my
own proposition, strengthened,             as   it  was, by your favourable
opinion.       It  is our business to recompense the daring (albeit
rash) adventurer        who is the first to accomplish an arduous
task which others have failed to carry out.                    We also give to
the good and intrepid          King      a gold watch,       with an inscrip
tion.      The Duke of Newcastle has promised to receive these
donations on the 26th."          .  . .
     Again,
                " I   am    so  deeply embarked             in the Australian
discoveries, that       I  intend to open the Geographical session,

the Royal Society of your flourishing colony, and see what a
new world is being called into existence                  by the talent and
energy     of our countrymen.              William Merivale has done
good service       in smothering that grovelling and unworthy
sentiment of a few doctrinaires               as to the      inutility of our
colonies.      I  am furious when          I read     their cold and heart
less    reasoning,     and   I   shall take       good     care to    show    at
our evening        affairs  how warmly the Australian                 colonists
support the mother country, and sympathize with it."
      It  was not therefore        the mere spirit of curiosity which
 prompted     his strong desire to       see   Australia more thoroughly
 explored.       He regarded the vast island             as a boundless    field
 for relieving the over-peopled             mother country, and looked
 forward to       a   time   when,      before     the energy       of British
 colonists,   all minor difficulties would disappear, and every
 fertile tract of land, every good natural harbour, would be
 made     available     as a   starting-point        for fresh enterprise     in
 the endeavour        to connect     the material riches         of Australia
 with the wealthy marts of the Eastern hemisphere.1                     Among
 the names of naturalists, politicians, poets, and other celebri
 ties given by the explorers of Australia to the mountains,
  rivers, or other features of the land, that of Murchison occurs
  in different and far separated .regions.                  Here it is a wide
  county, there a bold mountain range or                a broad   river, which
  perpetuates the name          of the geographer who took             so active
  an interest    in the opening up of the country.
       African exploration had engaged in a special measure the
  attention and        fostering care of the Geographical Society.
   In every volume of the         Journal there had been papers upon
                                1

 that subject, and in later years these papers, embracing the
 discoveries      of Livingstone,  Burton, Speke, Grant,        Baker,
 Du      Chaillu,    Von der Decken, Baikie, and         others,   had
 acquired     an increasing,  and indeed absorbing    interest.      It
 was true that      in most cases the full and detailed narratives
 of discovery appeared in the form of volumes        of travel, pub
 lished independently by the explorers themselves.            But the
 first sketch of what had been explored often came to the
 public through the Society, and when the travellers returned
 to this country,      it was naturally at the Society's meetings
 that they first presented themselves publicly to their fellow-
 countrymen.         They were sure to meet there with       a  hearty
 welcome, and a general        appreciation of their    courage and
 endurance     in extending the progress of geography.
      But it was not merely by empty compliment, or even by
medals     and votes of thanks that the Geographical Society
testified    its zeal for exploration.      Thanks   to    the   great
increase    of its membership,    it possessed an annual income
out of which         it could make grants    to aid either its own
associates,     or   others  who were struggling to enlarge        the
boundaries      of knowledge.    Considerable  sums  of money had
in this way at different times been expended to assist dis
covery in all parts of the globe.          But besides what the
Society itself contributed, Government had on two occasions,
in 1856 and again in 1860, intrusted the Society with the
expenditure of sums of £1000          and £2500, to assist     in the
exploration       of East Africa.      With the conception        and
execution of the later journeys of Livingstone, therefore, the
Geographical Society was intimately associated, sharing in
the honour of having assisted and encouraged            the greatest
of modern explorers.

$96            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                           [isei-ro.
     In all this work Murchison, whether         as  President, or as
a  Member of Council of the Society, took a leading part.
He sought to make the travellers his personal friends, and in
many helpful ways showed his kindly feelings towards them.
We have already seen how he exerted himself in the organ
izing of the Livingstone        festival.   When     a   long interval
had elapsed without tidings from the traveller on the Zam
besi, he sustained the hopes of his countrymen,         and refused to
listen to any doubt     as to  Livingstone's safety.       In  due time
his friend returned again to this country, after the successful
survey of the Zambesi region.          Murchison then proposed to
the Council to send him out once more          as leader    of a well-
considered     expedition to ascertain     the   true    watershed      of
Central Africa.      In announcing      to his brother geographers
the final adoption    of this proposal, and the early departure
of    the  great   traveller on this enterprise,       the President
sketched     the  general   plan which had been drawn up for
the exploration of the region         between    the Lakes Nyassa,
 Tanganyika, and Victoria Nyanza, and the settlement of that
 earliest  of geographical    problems — the true sources of the
 Nile.
      This was Livingstone's     last expedition.      It  is still fresh
 in the recollection of every one how heartily the President
 of the Geographical Society identified himself with the sub
 sequent progress of that prince of explorers.          The names of
 Livingstone and Murchison came naturally together to men's
lips, and it almost seemed now and then        as if people imagined
 that the fate of the traveller depended on the heroic firmness
 with which his safety was maintained at home by his friend.
 It will  not soon be forgotten that when, after many months,
 no news arrived from the traveller, and when a report arose

isO-70.] HIS    STRUGGLE FOR LIVINGSTONE.                      297
of his death, Murchison threw himself with the whole energy
of his nature into the task of convincing his countrymen that
Livingstone was     safe, and   successfully prosecuting  his task.
In  the early part of 1867    in particular much public anxiety
existed regarding the fate of the    African explorer.    Circum
stantial intelligence of his death arrived and obtained gene
ral belief.    Murchison, however, by speeches at the Geo
graphical Society, and letters to the newspapers, sought in
every way to discredit this report and to maintain his faith
in the skill, good fortune, and admirable constitution of
his friend.    He succeeded at last in inducing the Govern
ment to send out a boat-expedition to the           head of Lake
Nyassa to investigate the story of the Johanna men.         While
warning his countrymen that even a year might pass with
out further intelligence, he indulged     in  a jubilant anticipa
tion of Livingstone's return.       In  due time the expedition
sent home satisfactory evidence of the falsehood of the report,
while letters from the missionary himself eventually offered
still more welcome proof of the soundness of Murchison's
judgment in the matter.          But again long months passed
away, bringing     no   tidings from the     traveller, and again
popular rumour began to pass stories of his death.             The
champion at home would listen to none of these, but main
tained that he had either struck westwards, following the
supposed    drainage   of the Lake Tanganyika, and would in
due time appear on the      Atlantic coast, or that he had traced
the country northwards from that lake to Baker's            Albert
Nyanza, and would first be heard of on his triumphant way
down the Nile, having at last solved the problem            of the
sources of that great river.
     Looking back upon his scientific career when not far from

its close, Murchison         found no part of it which brought more
pleasing recollections than the support which he had given
to African      explorers    —Speke,      Grant, Baker, and notably to
Livingstone.

                                                                       per
tinacity with which           I  have upheld my confidence          in the
ultimate success of the last named of these brave men.                   In
fact  it was the confidence         I  placed   in the undying vigour of
my dear friend Livingstone, which has sustained                  me  in the
hope that     I   might live to enjoy the supreme delight of wel
coming him back to his country."                But that consummation
was not to be.          He himself was gathered to his rest just
six days before Stanley brought news and relief to the for
lorn traveller        on   the   banks of Lake Tanganyika.             And
Livingstone, while still in pursuit of his quest, and within
ten months of his death, learned in the heart of Africa the
                                                                " Received
tidings which he thus chronicled in his journal             :
a note from Oswell, written              in April last, containing the
sad intelligence of        Sir Roderick's departure from among us.
Alas   !  alas  !  this is the only time in my life           I  have ever
felt inclined to use the word, and it bespeaks a sore heart.

loved me more than           I  deserved   :  he looks down on me      still
I  must feel resigned to the loss by the Divine                  will ; but
still I  regret and mourn."
     Another proof of its zeal for the exploration and develop
ment of the interior of Africa, was furnished by the Society
in 1864, when it offered to embark £1000 in aiding such an
examination of the White Nile                as would lead to a commer
cial intercourse        between     Egypt and the countries of the
equatorial kings visited by Speke and Grant.                 That project
had to be suspended            chiefly on account of political causes.

But the idea was afterwards             carried    out  in another       way,
and on a grand scale, by the Egyptian              expedition under Sir
Samuel Baker.
     From an early time the subject               of Arctic exploration
had possessed a       kind of fascination for English sailors.            We
have already       in the course of this narrative watched the
departure of      Franklin and his companions               on their disas
trous voyage.        The good hope with which Murchison bade
them God-speed had slowly died away.                  In  the same spirit
with which he in later years espoused the cause of Living
stone he continued to hope when almost everybody else had
ceased to do so.        In his   address of 1857 to the Geographical
Society,    he returned,       but with mournful         feelings,     to the
sad though        stirring    story of    Arctic search.         He clung
to the hope that         still in some less savage inlet         a   handful

missing ships, even though reliable information had been
obtained     as  to   where     the next efforts      could probably be
successfully     made.1       He now appealed to his countrymen
for their generous sympathy towards              Lady Franklin.          That
noble-hearted      woman       and devoted    wife, undaunted by the

out the exploration of the unvisited tracts wherein we have
every reason to believe the ships were finally encompassed,
every     British seaman will bless the relict of the great ex
plorer, who has thus striven to honour the memory of her
husband and his brave companions.
     "
         My earnest hope is that this expedition of Lady
Franklin may afford clear proofs that her husband's party
came down with a boat to the mouth of the Back                         Eiver in
the spring of 1850, as reported on Esquimaux                     evidence   by
Dr. Eae, and thus demonstrate that which                  I  have contended
for, in common with             Sir Francis Beaufort, Captain Wash
ington, and some Arctic authorities, that Franklin, who in
his previous explorations had trended                 the American coast
fiom the Back River westward to Barrow Point, was really
the discoverer of the north-west passage."1
    The hope thus generously expressed was duly realized
when, in 1859,        M'Cliutock brought back the records of the
lost expedition, which showed that before he had succumbed
to his fate,    Franklin had really boated from               sea to sea, and

had thus effected that passage which for centuries had been
the dream of navigators.
      The vast expenditure of life and treasure which Britain
had made      in quest of the North-west Passage, and the use-
lessness of that passage when at last discovered, had not by
any means extinguished the thirst after Polar adventure.
 For some time indeed little had been done in Arctic re
 search.     In    1867, however,   the subject  began  to receive
 renewed    attention.     No one now sought to encourage any
 further exploration of this commercially impracticable North
 west passage.       But it was contended that the North Pole
 might be reached, and that much interesting and important
 geographical     work remained to be done in that region.    The
 desirability of renewed exploration had been pressed upon
 the Government by the         British Association and the Geo
 graphical Society, but without success.         The geographical
 authorities were far from being agreed          as to the proper
 avenue by which the attempt to reach the Pole should be
 made.     Four routes had been advocated.          One by Spitz-
 bergen, one by the north-east coast of Greenland,         one by
 Behring's Straits, recommended by French geographers, and
 one   by Smith's Sound,       which     was warmly espoused     in
 England.       This want of agreement among those who had
 given special attention to the subject       seemed to furnish a
 ready justification of the unwillingness of the      Admiralty to
 re- engage,   in the meantime, in   a task where already so many
 precious   lives and   so much valuable property had been lost.
 Murchison,      in successive   addresses   to the Geographical
 Society, dwelt emphatically on the importance of taking action
 in this matter, showing what Swedes and Germans had done,
 and how much might now be accomplished               with the in

creased    knowledge and improved appliances                which could
be brought to bear upon the question.                He took occasion,
likewise, to point out the desirability of further Antarctic
exploration, especially with a view to fixing stations                 for
observing the transit      of Venus in the year 1874.
      How these geographical        efforts appeared       in the Presi
dent's correspondence,      may be illustrated       by a letter to Sir
William Denison : —
     " llth June       1865. — MY    DEAR      SIB WILLIAM, —      I   am
ashamed of my        laxity  as a correspondent,      but truly   if  you
lived in this world of London, and were in             as   many whirl
pools   of employment       as  I am, you would admit that,          with
the best intentions,     I cannot do justice to my own desire to
endeavour to reciprocate       in some measure the kindness you
show to me, and the interesting communications you send
to me.    Now that     I have  a Sunday evening free (and having
already written a dozen of notes),      I find time (my anniversary
Address having gone finally to press) to write a few lines,
which, after all, may be of very little interest to you.

siderable    impulse, the good Fellows over whom               I preside

desire to work the old mill-horse          to death, so     I am  in for
another   year— all rules being broken.            The past year has
been productive of good discoveries,         so  I took  it upon  me to

     In  these final efforts of his life, though not immediately
successful,     Murchison deserves the praise of having clearly
foreseen that the      British Government could not much longer
refuse again to co-operate      in the great work of Polar discovery.
                                                         '              '

expedition of 1875 in search of a passage to the North Pole.
Had he survived          so  long he would have seen reason to
modify his opinion that the love of adventure had died out
of the British navy, for his friends at the Admiralty could
then have assured          him that the vessels         selected  for the
North Polar quest might have been manned with officers,                   so

     Though not a politician, and, as appears from this passage, abstaining
from interfering in Parliamentary contests, Murchison at times could
break through this habit and become for the nonce a keen partisan.         I
remember being with him on the afternoon of the day when Mr. J. S. Mill
lost his seat for Westminster.    I was at once eagerly questioned by my
friend as to the last news from the polling-booths, and on my remarking
that Mr. Mill bade fair to be defeated, he rubbed his hands with great
              " I was out

him. I would walk the shoes off my old feet to have the fellow turned
out after his infamous conduct towards Governor Eyre in the matter of
the Jamaica insurrection."

services      to Geography        in connexion      with the Geographical
Society could be given than in the words of Sir Bartle
Frere, who succeeded him in the Presidential                       Chair, and
who, in conveying the medal awarded to him by the Council,
                                 "
spoke of him thus : — It is no exaggeration to say that
during the past thirty years no geographical                    expedition of
any consequence            has    been    undertaken in our own or,             I
believe       I   might say, in any other country, without some
previous reference to him for advice and suggestion, often
entailing laborious research and correspondence."1
     In    passing      from the Geographical Society we may take
notice of one feature of the anniversary Addresses on which
Murchison           always laid great stress — the obituaries of             de
 ceased members.            These afforded      an opportunity, of which
 he   never       failed to avail himself, to sketch the services
 and   good        qualities of old scientific friends and              compa
 nions.       Most     of his compeers in the Geological Society
 were     likewise       enrolled    among    the    geographers.         Hence
 year by year he had occasion                to pronounce       an eloge over
 the grave of one after              another   of the early magnates in
 geology.          At  one time     it is the genial Buckland to whose
 memory he has to pay a kindly tribute, remembering                          not
 only the lasting services of that able man to science, but
 the many kindnesses             which he had himself received, and
 not least among these, the friendly guidance which led him
 to the banks of the Wye                 in 1831, and indirectly to the
 Silurian       System     and     his after    fame.     Again     he has     to
 chronicle the quenching of another of the lights under which
 geology in its early days spread and prospered                 in England —

when he first began to study            it,   the author of the Silurian
System was indebted to no one more deeply than to this able
observer   and admirable          writer.         Conybeare        and   Phillips'
Geology    of   England   and Wales had been,                 as    he said, his
scientific Bible.    From his earliest geological paper onwards,
the influence of that book may be traced                 in all his geological
writings. These obligations he gratefully acknowledged.                        At
another anniversary, when death had been busy among the
leaders of science, and especially               among the President's own
circle of friends, he had to record the loss of Eobert Brown, to
whom he was sincerely attached               ;   Alexander von Humboldt,
from whom he had received               so    many proofs of respect and
esteem, and to whose            assistance        and stimulation        he now
gratefully recounted          his obligations      ;    Hallam, one of the
most welcome guests at his gatherings                  of scientific, literary,
and artistic friends      ;    the Archduke            John of Austria, the
frank, open Styrian           prince,   with whom he had been                   so
delighted among the valleys of the eastern Alps.

                     CHAPTER XXVIII.
                  THE LAST GEOLOGICAL       TOUCHES.
    DURING      that closing period    of Hurchison's    life which
embraced the years subsequent          to his appointment to the
Geological Survey,       and   of the events of which some       ac
count has been given in the previous five chapters, geology
had evidently no longer undisturbed sway over his thoughts
and actions.      Nevertheless,    amid   the increasing exactions
of official life, and in spite of the ever-growing demands of
the Geographical Society, he found opportunity every now
and then to strike back again        into the geological pathway,
and to link himself with the onward progress of his younger
contemporaries.       It was during this period that he achieved
his success in working out the problem of the Highland
geology.      During this time, too, he made those excursions
in Bohemia       and elsewhere    on the Continent, as well as    in
the north of England, which enabled him to place the Per
mian rocks of Germany and Britain in            a more satisfactory
arrangement       and   parallelism.   But besides    these contri
butions, which arose directly out of field-work and gave the
results of his own observations         on the ground, there were
others which      dealt not so much      with his own labours     as

     308            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.                            [ISS7-70.
    with those of his friends and fellow-workers              in geology —
    digests    of the progress     of research       among   the palaeozoic
    rocks,   criticisms of contemporary         opinion regarding        ques
    tions of theoretical import, and more or less vigorous                 pro
    tests against     the spread of what he considered to be rank
   heresy from the orthodox geological           creed.
         Though many of these writings may have no special
   importance       in themselves,    they were the last efforts of a
   man who has left his mark deeply upon the literature of
   geology, and as such seem worthy of notice here.               It  is pro
   posed therefore       to devote this chapter to a brief notice of
   them, placing them in such lights as may best reflect                    the
  character of the man, and connecting             them at the same time
  with the general onward march of the science.
         Of all the pieces of scientific work now to be referred to,
  the successive       editions of Siluria deserve the first place.
  We      have    already    seen  how     that     volume was      at    first
  elaborated, partly in the field among the rocks, and partly                in
  the library in the midst of memoirs and notices on palaeozoic
 rocks      contributed by geologists        all over the world.          The
  subsequent       editions involved      labour      of the   same kind.
 A     few extracts from the geologist's         letters  will best illus
 trate     the desultory way      in which this literary work was
 carried on     : —
        "February     21, 1857.—   MY   DEAR    M. BARRANDE, — On the
 20th of this month         I  received    for you, at the anniversary
 meeting      of the Geological      Society,     the Wollaston      medal,
 which had been adjudicated            to you by the Council of that
 body, for your works on the Silurian basin of Bohemia, which
justly raised you to       so eminent    a place among the geologists
and palaeontologists of Europe, and have (as               I  wrote   down

 of your contemporaries.'            .  .  .
      "
         I wish       I  could report to you that            I  had made much
 progress     in the second edition of Siluria, but my public
 business, and the numerous                calls on my time for transacting
 the    new duties of President of the Royal Geographical
 Society (now one of the most popular Societies in the metro
 polis), have sadly retarded              me, and a few chapters          only are
 printed.      These       early chapters, however, are the difficulties,
 for they are much improved and altered.                 .   In    the first place,
 by revisiting           my old typical          region of Siluria,        I   have
 strengthened         my base      so    essentially,  that it stands firmer
 than ever.     .   .  .
      " The next
                          important new feature is the separation in
 North and South Wales of the Llandeilo from an overlying
 formation,     which is my original Caradoc.              .  .  .
     "  In  order to remove            all ambiguity,      I   have placed      the
 zones with Pentameri, of various species, and                     Atrypa hemi-
sphcerica, as of intermediate character,                 terming the         strata
'
  Llandovery Rocks,'            the lower      half of which is intimately
 connected with the true Lower Silurian by numerous                           fossil
species, and the uppermost                or thinner part, containing         Pen-
tamerus cblongus, with the Upper Silurian                       through certain
species.1

     Originally, as we have seen, Murchison had no breaks in any part of
his Silurian series, from the base of the Llandeilo to the top of the Lud-
low rocks.     It was sadly against his inclination that he was driven to
admit that, in this respect, his series was not the unbroken whole which
he had represented it to be.          Sedgwick was the first to point out the
great unconformability at the base of the Upper Silurian ; and the Geolo
gical Survey, especially Mr. Ramsay, its director, and Mr. Aveline, after
wards traced other breaks.

Government surveyors            as   Upper Caradoc, in North Wales,
are rather the base of the Wenlock                 formation in a sandy
or gritty state with         associated      slates, but these are local
varieties."1
     " Poor Dumont has                                               He was a

clear-sighted     field geologist,       and an admirable lithologist
and     mineralogist.      If   he had       been    earlier    imbued with
a true veneration for organic             remains, he would have been
one of the first men of our age, or rather                    nulli   secundus.
The Belgians know how to honour their eminent country
men.      When     will any     geologist of Britain       be put into the
grave with so much pomp and circumstance                     as our departed
friend — three battalions,           with   archbishops,       senators,   pro
fessors, scholars, all vying with each other?"
     To Professor Eamsay he writes : —
        I
     " have had a
                          long letter from Oldham,                thanking me
twice over for my warm intercession                   with Lord Canning,
which has, he says, been the cause of the grand augmentation
and indeed of the real setting              up of the Geological Survey
of India.      They are now endowed, and are to have library,
laboratory-rooms, and         a museum      — in   short, a   Jermyn Street      :
I  would add, and with the unspeakable                 advantage of being
                   '
unfettered by        My Lords      '. . . .
      " I am   like you,   '

tiful garden, whilst      I  am re-writing and improving the first
 chapters of    Siluria."
     But the absorption referred to in the last sentence suffered
   1 He contended that these breaks were local, because they did not
 occur in other countries. But that between Lower and Upper Silurian is
 not a mere local or British phenomenon.        The Geological Survey at first
accepted his classification, and put the Pentamerus beds in the Caradoc
series.   The error had been corrected some years before the date of the
 above letter.

—"At       night went to the annual ball at East Grinstead.
Danced     a quadrille with Mrs. Mortimer West, and       a tempe'te
with the youngest        Miss Stirling,   Lady Caroline's lovely
daughter, and a reel with Lady Arabella.          Pretty well for a
chicken of 1792, who had been geologizing          all day.    Came
back in a storm to Buckhurst."
      Here is his report at a later time to his old friend Sir
 Philip Egerton :— " Siluria will be out in a fortnight, with
nearly 200 new figures of species in woodcuts, new tables,
 coloured lithograph of Assynt, and all sorts of novelties, and
much additional matter.
     " On
            Wednesday next     I throw off No.  2 of my N. High
land and Orcadian      contributions, and on 15th December the
 Old Eed of Elgin comes off, followed by Huxley's description
 of the wonderful reptile Stagonolepis Robertsoni, which must
have been many feet in length, and had a swinging tail.           The
 singular big cast which     I brought away in my portmanteau
and showed you at Leeds, which         I told old Duff seemed to
me vertebral, has, after being talked of as a Cephalopod, been
proved to be the tail of Stagonolepis.        We have lots of his
footprints.    Huxley makes him      a Thecodont.
     "  I am getting a charter for the Geographers, and going to
Lord Derby for apartments         to contain both the Geological
and Geographical       Societies  at Burlington   House, so as to
constitute   there an Institute of Science."
     When at last the edition of Siluria referred to in the fore
going extract was published at the beginning of 1859 a copy
was    duly sent to Sedgwick.        That old comrade had ex
pressed himself very strongly, in his Synopsis         of Palaeozoic
Fossils, regarding the standing subject of controversy.        Since
the appearance,     in 1855, of the strongly worded, but some

what tedious, introduction to that publication, in spite of
Murchison's efforts, it was impossible to conceal the fact
that the difference        remained    no longer a mere scientific
one, but had descended, as such             differences  almost    inevi
tably do at last, into personal           estrangement.      He got no
acknowledgment         of the book, nor of the letter written " in
his old fashion," which was judged by himself and a common
friend to be best.        After waiting     a week   he sent a note to
the   Master of Trinity, with the half-hinted hope that the
latter might be able to send some good news, yet with the
expressed fear that Sedgwick's          silence   was intentional, and
would be lasting.        The letter to the Woodwardian Professor
was as follows     : —
     "Jany.   20th, 1859.—      MY DEAR SEDGWICK, — I have sent
a copy    of my new edition of Siluria for your acceptance,
earnestly hoping that the passages relating to yourself in the
Preface, p.   viii, and the alteration of       a phrase or  two in the
body of the work, may remove from your mind the impres
sion produced by the perusal of the first edition.
     " Time rolls
                      on, and as we passed many a happy day
 together,  I  trust that you will have some gratification in
 turning to these pages, particularly those relating to the
 Highlands of Scotland.          Little did we think, when we first
 united the yellow and white sandstones of Elgin with the
 Old Eed, that those beds would be found to contain such
 reptiles as the Telerpeton and Stagonolepis !
     "
       Clinging to the hope that the only bitter sorrow            I  have
 experienced     in my scientific life may pass away, and that
 your old friendly       feelings  towards me may          return,   I  am

1837-70.]            LETTER TO SEDGWICK.                                313
      A   reply to this letter was written from Dent, and begin
ning with " Dear Sir Eoderick," contained a mere acceptance
of the gift (which was still lying at Cambridge), without an
allusion to the hope of pacification.              It was afterwards tied
up with some other correspondence,              and marked on the back
"Sedgwick's        last letter.      How different       from the     'Dear
Murchison'        of former days     !"
     Two years afterwards Murchison renewed the attempt to
re-open friendly intercourse            with his former comrade.          In
the    May of      1861     he received     the degree of      LLD.    from
Cambridge.          Many      a pleasant     and many a sad memory
were awakened          by the visit.       Some of these found expres
sion   in the following letter : —

me to assure you that          I  have at this moment           as strong    a
regard for you as ever, and that although                  I  yesterday   re
ceived an honour which you had                secured for me at the in
stallation of Prince Albert,         if the  University law would have
permitted,      I consider this, and       all worldly distinctions that
might be bestowed on me,                as  nothing, in my estimation,
compared with         one kind      letter from yourself, in your old

gave an opening address, the feeble character of which                               is   pro

looked on as the most hearty and generous of beings should

he said,   '
             I   had gathered    all the cream of our churning in
the rocks of Wales.'       ...   I  wish to avoid,  as far as possible,
another public demonstration          like that which took place at
Manchester,       and which really vexed me beyond measure."
     Sedgwick,      stung   to the quick by what he thought to
have been unfair treatment            on the part of his old com
panion Murchison, for which he called in vain for apology
and retractation, withdrew from all further intercourse             with
him and from the Geological Society.           On two occasions only
did he afterwards         write to his friend, the last time being
when the cords          of sympathy and        affection   were   loosed
within him at the sight of that friend bowed down with
sorrow by the death of his wife.
      The last edition of Siluria was published in the autumn
of 1867.        If  we compare     it with the first edition of the
work we      see  how much progress had been made in palteozoic
geology during the interval of thirteen years.            Among other
 changes, the Laurentian system had been established.                The
 Cambrian,     which had been purposely omitted from special
 description in the first edition, now receives recognition in
the limited sense        in which the term was used by the Geo
 logical Survey;       the   physical break     between     Lower and
 Upper    Silurian     contended     for by Sedgwick is now ad
 mitted,  and a zone of passage between             the two    series is
 described     under the name of "Llandovery             rocks."     The
 important discovery        that the rocks of the Scottish High
 lands, formerly thought to be of an origin anterior to the
 existence     of life upon the globe, consisted really of altered
 Lower Silurian rocks, is pointedly dwelt upon.              Great   im
 provements       and additions are introduced into those portions

of the book treating of organic remains.            Especial attention
is likewise given      to the foreign      equivalents   of the British
formations, and thus the book is made truly an indispensable
handbook     to all geologists who     are intent upon deciphering
the history of the       oldest    fossiliferous rocks.      No better
evidence of the practical      utility of the work could have been
given than the fact that, in spite of its technical character,
its total want of literary attractiveness, and its high price,
four editions were called for in thirteen years.
     Quitting his own special domain            of palaeozoic geology,
Murchison      in his later years       took considerable      pains to
reiterate   his faith in    a former greater intensity of Nature's
operations, and     to oppose the doctrines         of the opposite or
uniformitarian      school.    His opinions on this subject          are
strongly expressed in the closing pages of the last edition
of Siluria.     He used often to announce them from the chair
of the Geographical Society, but the greatest vigour of lan
guage was reserved        for his private correspondence.         Some
illustrations of his opposition may be given here.
     For some years there had been growing among the
 younger   and more active geologists         of Britain   a conviction
that the old doctrine of Hutton           as to the   origin of valleys
 by the erosive action of running water — a doctrine which, in
 spite of the admirable confirmation of            it adduced by Mr.
 Scrope   from    Central     France,    had   never   been   generally
 adopted — was substantially        true.     Foremost among those
 who maintained this view, and enforced             it by  cogent argu
 ment and illustration, were the Directors of the Geological
 Surveys of Great Britain and Ireland — Ramsay and               Jukes.
 The former, moreover, started and worked out the remarkable
 idea that besides the excavation of valleys by river-action

 and the slow washing of the land by rain, there has been an
 extensive       erosion    of hollows and basins by glacier-ice, and
 that to this process we must attribute the great predomin
 ance of rock -basin lakes             scattered over       those tracts of the
 northern hemisphere              which     can be shown to have             been
 buried under land-ice.               As may be supposed, the President
 of the Geographical Society regarded these doctrines                     as rank
 heresy, not to say sheer nonsense.                 He opposed them chiefly
 in his addresses to that Society             ;  but his opposition, though
 vigorous enough in its language, dealt more                   in strong denial
 and protest,        with the citation of the crowd of geological
 authorities who sided with him, than in serious argument.1
 The force of evidence had constrained                    him to yield some
what of the old exclusiveness                   with which he had fought
 for his icebergs,         but having given up some points,                   and
 consented        to admit the         power     of glaciers     to polish    and
score the face of a country, and to pile up huge moraine-
mounds,        he felt himself free to set his foot down firmly
and refuse to go a step further in the way of excavation,
as    his friends, the " ice-men," would have had him.
       In  science, as in all other matters of human thought and
progress,      it is not given to many men to retain complete
possession       of their youthfulness and pliability of mind up
to the end of a long life.              The ardent spirits of one genera
tion are apt to become in the next what their successors
    1 In one of these Addresses he gave great prominence        to the question of
glacier-erosion,    especially in reference to  Professor  Ramsay's  then recently
broached doctrine. Not content with the publicity given by the Journal
of the Geographical Society, he extracted that portion of his Address, and
circulated it far and wide among the geologists of Europe and America.
Professor Ramsay's reply in the Philosophical Magazine (October 1864)
was valuable as a protest against the attempt or tendency to crush oppo
sition by weight of authority.

                                     "
stoutly for the integrity of Old Greywacke," and refused to
countenance        any of the New Lights, Murchison,             as we have
seen, enjoyed some quiet fun at his expense, and laughed at
his stubborn adherence to the "antiquas                  vias."      But the
 whirligig     of time    brings in his revenges.             It   was    now
Murchison's own turn to protest                  vehemently against          the
spread of notions which, nevertheless,             in spite of his opposi
tion, were every year steadily gaining ground.                      So much
did he take to heart the backsliding of the younger school
from what he thought the true faith, that besides taking the
pains to circulate his protest among scientific men all over
the world, he could hardly refrain in his letters to old friends
from finding some excuse to introduce the subject.                         The
 subjoined letter to Sir William Denison (6th October 1864)
 may serve as an instance         :—
      " In my anniversary Address            to the Geographical Society
you would        see the pains     I    have taken to moderate the ice
 men, who       would excavate          all the rock basins by glaciers
 eating    their way into solid rocks.              I  have    printed this
                                                                           '

 geological times than        in the present or Man period           ;  and as

the hot Bath water flows,       I said  I  was happy to receive that
indication of the right view, and that            I  should in future
range my friend       Sir Charles along with myself among the
'
  convulsionists.'
     " And
              again,   I entirely disagree with him when he ad
verts    with triumph to the discovery of animal life in the
old Laurentian rocks of North             America, that this is any
                                    '
indication that we have here          no trace of a beginning."     On
the contrary, the only animal which has been found, being a
zoophyte, adds nothing and changes nothing               in the general
argument      founded    on the    indisputable facts recorded      all
over the world, viz., that there has been a progression              of
creation from the lowest grades of animal life up to man.
     " It  is mere special pleading to sound a trumpet of glori
                                                     '
fication over the demolition of the word               Azoic.'  When
ever   I  used that word     I specially guarded it by saying that
although     as yet  nothing like animal life had been found in
the very lowest known rocks, yet the discovery of Fucoids
and Zoophytes        might be found, and       if so   would not alter
one   jot the order of successive and rising creations.
     " As to
                your view concerning the desiccation of countries
by the destruction of forests           I  entirely agree with you,
and    on this head Colenso        is certainly weak and wrong.
Nothing can be more demonstrative            to that effect than  Cyril
 Graham's description of the numerous ruined cities close to
each other     in the Hauran, where now there is not a drop of
water,     and nothing     to   sustain human life.          The same
phenomena        is now being worked out on a gigantic scale in
the    great   and recently highly       cultivated    and productive
region east of Palestine,        as vouched     for by the Eev. Mr.
Tristram, who has just returned from these parts.              He gave

in the valley of the Jordan, and has completely swept away
the delusion under which we all laboured, through the inac
curate accounts of travellers, that the great depression was on

both sides of the valley consist of regularly stratified lime

ficulties without end in the satisfactory arrangement of the
governments         and peoples of    Italy under one head, and now
the play is beginning.            Well may the brave Piedmontese
be crestfallen       and indignant when they see that, after losing
Savoy and the key to           Italy in the Alps, they are doubly
taxed      and    Turin is no longer a capital.    The Tuscans, who
never would or could fight — so all the old French ofiicers
have told me — are for a while to be flattered           into the idea
of their city being          the   capital.   But  this is all fudge,
for in reality the people who cry 'Italia una' wish for
Eorne.        Then again the Neapolitans are full of discontent
at not having their city            now what it was for       so   many
centuries, and the Pope           will blow up many    a conflagration
before he is driven out of the Eternal City.              I have    lived
much in Italy and Sicily, and, though              I  should be very
happy to         see  the dream     of poets and the English        press
 realized,     I  feel convinced     that the elements of discord       so
 abound that unity        will not last now any more than in ages
gone by. — Ever yours sincerely,               EOD. I. MURCHISON."

                  CRITICISM ON MR. DARWIN.                               321
     In   no part of his career did Murchison show his shrewd
commonTsense more than           in the way he usually avoided any
public expression of his opinion on questions in science which
he had not specially studied, or which lay wholly outside                   of
his own circle of inquiry.           Few, indeed, can exactly gauge
their own capacity and qualifications             so as to    know exactly
how far they may safely advance                 in any given direction.
Murchison's natural caution, however, made his slips of this
kind comparatively few.             For example,         he entertained      a
very strong        repugnance    to the    views promulgated in the
great work of        Darwin on the Origin of           Species,  and he be
lieved firmly that the geological evidence of the older forma
 tions lent no support to these             views.      But he took care
not to proclaim his opposition             from the house-tops, and
indeed     honestly confessed himself not qualified by know
ledge and experience           to discuss biological subjects.           His
sentiments,       however, used to be pretty freely expressed              in
conversation        and  in letters to his friends.         A   few extracts
will   show the       kind of argumentation which he thought               so
formidable to the Evolutionists.
     To Professor Harkness he says           : — " If you    read the work
of Darwin        on the Origin    of  Species,   which has given us an
earthquake        shock, you    will easily     see   that in reality my
geological      postulates, if  not upset, destroy his whole theory.
He will have no creation — no signs of a beginning — millions
of living things before the lowest Silurian               — no    succession
of creatures from lower to higher, but a mere transmutation
from a monad to a man.              His assumption         of the position
of the Lyellian theory, that causation never was more intense
than   it  is now, and that former great disruptions (faults) were
all removed by the denudation of               ages, is so gratuitous, and

  322           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
 BO   entirely antagonistic to my creed, that        I   deny all his
 inductions, and am still      as  firm a believer    as ever    that a
 monkey and      a man are  distinct species, and not connected by
 any links, — i.e. are distinct creations.      The believers in a
 lower, and a lower still, have never answered,           and cannot
 answer, the fact that the rich marine Lower Silurian             fauna
 is invertebrate,    and that the     Cambrian rocks of Ireland,
 Wales, Shropshire, and the north-west of Scotland, though
less altered than the Lower Silurian, have afforded            nothing
 distinct which is higher than an Oldhamia or a worm."
      Again, in a more forcible style, he remarks to Sir Wil
 liam Denison :— " I am a geologist of the school of Buck-
 land, Sedgwick, De la Beche, Greenough,        and    I  may add, of
 myself.    I flatter myself that   I have seen as much of nature
iu her old moods       as  any living man, and      I   fearlessly  say
that our geological record       does not afford    one scintilla     of
evidence to support Darwin's theory."
      " Eecently we have had the
                                        grandest trumpeting about
the    discovery of the Eozoon Canadense in the Laurentian
rocks    below all Cambrian.       And what does it amount to          ?
Why, simply that the lowest imaginable order of zoophyte is
found in the lowest discoverable        rock.  It  changes nothing.
We are just where we wera              Simply the lowest created
things are found in a stage lower.         This only confirms       the
doctrine of a commencement            with the lowest grades of
creation,   and a succession   in after ages to higher and higher
types of life successively.     As for the transmutation of types,
I   look upon it    as  simply an ingenious piece of sceptical
puzzling without the least basis."
      The curious confusion of thought here, regarding the
bearing of the grade of the older palaeozoic fauna upon             the
doctrine of evolution, re-appears      in other letters.     It would

                   ON SIR CHARLES LYELL.                              323
 seem as    if  the Silurian    geologist had been so long battling
 against the favourite uniformitarian doctrines of           Sir Charles
Lyell, in the organic        as  well   as the inorganic history of the
world, that he could not quite realize the complete change
of position which the author of the Principles of                 Geology
took up after the new era of thought marked by and con
sequent upon the appearance of Darwin's work.
     The publication of Ly ell's Antiquity of Man drew forth
in the same way these private but strong expressions                    of
dissent    from that part of the work which treated of the
origin of species.      In  regard to the question of the antiquity
of the human race Murchison had no strong prejudice, and
was    willing to accept the new doctrines            as established   on
fair evidence.       To the author of the work he acknowledged
as  follows the receipt of the presentation copy : —
     " I have to thank
                            you for your very acceptable present
of your new work on the Antiquity of Man.                   Who would
have thought when we began to write as geologists that any
one could have in our lifetime reached             such conclusions as
those which you have deduced             ?   You have indeed taken a
fine bold course and         have opened       out a grand   and broad
field of inquiry.       I  am thankful for a slight move on your
part towards occasional          paroxysms,     and  as  we   all admit
slow accumulations        as  well   as   imperceptible elevations     we
may be all brought into harmony.                  There are of course
some points on which          I  still hold to my old opinions, par
ticularly   as to the    impossibility of referring all the water-
worn    de"bris  of the low country of the Pays de Vaud to the
ancient glacier which came out of the narrow gorge of the
Rhone.      But these have little to do with your main argu
ment."
    It   might not be supposed from this note that its writer

  had    anything to complain of personally in the contents                  of
  the rolume           he had   received.    But in writing to another
  friend he lets out the secret of his heart           :

      In   a later letter to the illustrious         author of the        An

recognition of his own labours in the department of qua

quietly buried out of sight in those ponderous tombs.
      The irritation which the author of the Silurian System
felt at any proposed alteration of his classification                  of the
geological     formations,    and the efforts he made to adopt the
inevitable changes with           as  little damage       as possible  to the
original nomenclature,         have already appeared           in the course
of the preceding chapters.            A  proposal, renewed       in Germany,
to adopt the term Dyas instead                of Permian,1      was  in itself
rather of      a    retrograde    character,     as   it rested upon mere
mineral grouping, which, after all, was only local.                  The pro
gress of geology had abundantly shown that names founded
only on the character         and arrangement          of sedimentary rocks
were apt to become singularly inappropriate when applied to
the equivalents of the same rocks                 in other regions.     Mur-
chison's protest against         the projected       change appeared duly
in print   ;  but the warmth of his indignation could, of course,
only find vent in talk or correspondence                   with his friends.
Take the following as an example               : —
      " MY DEAR BARKNESS, —
                                      My good friend Dr. Geinitz, has,

substitute for Permian.            Taking     it from Marcou, who         had

palffiozoic, the other mesozoic),          still proposes the name       as a
substitute for Permian,            because, forsooth,        in the limited
tracts    of Germany which he knows, the Rothliegende and

      It   was not always, however, from abroad that opposition
to the views of the Director- General arose.                                     In   matters of
theoretical import, such                        as the        origin of valleys and lake-
basins, there could hardly be any violent collision                                   with him,
for though he held tolerably strong                                 convictions on such
questions,          they belonged                to   a   branch of geology which he
had not made specially his own                            ;   so that, as he said        himself,
his views might be set aside without impugning the value
of those positive data in geology which he had done so
much to establish.1                         But he could not            be    expected     to re

   tive data on which he most prided himself were attacked.
   Hence, when      in 1867 his own colleague, the late Mr.             J. B.
  Jukes, Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland, began
  to    throw    doubts    on   the received       classification    of   the
  Devonian rocks, he watched          the progress      of the discussion
  with keen interest, but, partly from          a   wish not to let open
  disagreement      appear   too strongly between         himself and his
  officers, kept as well out       of it himself      as might    be.    Mr.
  Jukes contended, in direct opposition to Murchison's long
  accepted conclusion, that the Old Red Sandstone                could not
  be classed with the Devonian slates and limestones without
  a  violation of all the rules and logic which govern our geo
 logical nomenclature.          He maintained that the Old Red
  Sandstone      was   something    altogether different        from and
 older than the Devonian rocks, and that the latter must be
 ranged with the great masses of slate and grit which under
 lie the Mountain Limestone in Ireland, and form the base
 of the Carboniferous system.
       It  may be imagined how much Murchison would take
 this proposed       reform   to heart.    Honestly       and  firmly be
 lieving that his colleague was making an egregious blunder
in    venting such       a heterodox    notion, he urged him very
warmly to recede from the untenable               position.     In letters
to other      friends he spoke in      a compassionate        way of the
wilful waywardness         of his subordinate,      who seemed to him
bent on becoming a geological felo de          se.
      But the bold and skilful Director of the Irish Geological
Survey knew what he was doing.                 He could not believe,
nor even understand, that any one could possibly be offended
by an attempt        on his part to correct what his experience
had taught him to be error.          And   so,  holding clearly to his

328           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
purpose,   and battling stoutly for the change which he pro
posed to make, he soon after sank under the insidious and
rapidly advancing malady which carried him off.
    It is not necesssary for the purposes of the present bio
graphy to enter into the details of this new Devonian battle,
for during his lifetime Jukes had in this question few allies       ;
and Murchison, who survived him, did not imagine that the
contest would ever again be seriously renewed.           But they
who have given most attention to this part of geology           will
probably most readily admit that, whether in the way of
contest or not, the question        must be re-opened,    that the
accepted    classification of the rocks of Devonshire is far
from being satisfactory,     and that    Jukes did a great sendee
by boldly attacking it and bringing to bear upon          it all his
long experience in the south of Ireland, which gave him an
advantage possessed at the time by hardly any one else.
     Among the deaths by which the ranks of the geologists
of Britain have in recent years been thinned, none came           as
a heavier blow than that of      J.  Beete Jukes.    In the prime
of his life, with no common         bodily vigour, with a capacity
for field-geology second to that of no one in this country,
and with a ready power of felicitous exposition, he seemed
to be a man on whom much of the future progress of the
science among     us would depend.        But it was not only, or
perhaps even mainly, for his rare scientific qualities that his
death was mourned.        His qualities of heart were rarer still
A   more joyous, generous,     kindly spirit lived not among us.
In  the heartiness    and  hilarity with which he threw himself
into whatever he had to do, he preserved        almost the fresh
ness of boyhood.        Before  the appearance of his fatal para
lytic affection   there   could be no lack of solid talk and

playful sallies in any company where his broad burly frame
appeared, and his own deep ringing laugh would soon be the
loudest there.    But with this playfulness there was ever the
earnestness    of a man who knew that he had a work to do
in this world which required of him his whole energy and
thought.     He had no tolerance      for pretence    of any kind,
showing his impatience sometimes in a way which led those
who did not know him to form most mistaken judgments
regarding him.      But they who enjoyed his acquaintance, and
felt the frank impulsiveness and downright honesty of all
that he did and said,     will for many     a year lament his loss,
for they never found in his craft a better workman nor in
their own circles a truer friend.
    This rather desultory retrospect of the geological topics
which occupied     Murchison's time and thoughts in his last
years, may perhaps suffice to bring before the reader their
somewhat     miscellaneous    character,   as  well as the tenacity
with which his opinions regarding them were held by the
geologist,   and  the   vigorous style of defence and        protest
which he used on their behalf.           It may now be appropri
ately closed by a reference to some of the later honours of
his life.     On the 19th of February          1864 the  Geological
 Society awarded     to him its Wollaston       medal    At first it
may seem strange       that this honour, which had been well
earned at least a quarter of a century back,           should have
been so long deferred.      But for the long period of two-and-
thirty years he had never ceased to be a member of the
 Council of the Society, and,     as such,    could not receive the
medal      It was  now the accident of his retirement from the
 Council   as one   of its senior members         that enabled   the
 Society to present him with its highest distinction.         Three

330          SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
circumstances   lent an interest to the ceremony.          He could
not but recall the time, more than forty years back, when
Dr. Wollaston, whose medal he now received, welcomed him
with friendly words and wise advice into the scientific circles
of London.     Again, by a curious coincidence, the President
of the Society from whose hands he received the medal was
none other than his old friend and colleague, Professor             A.
C.   Eamsay, who, in bestowing the           honour, said, — "Per
haps on this occasion      I  may be pardoned     for recalling the
memory of a time      I  well remember, when, of all the geolo
gists  of weight, you, sir, were the first who held out the
hand of fellowship to me         as a young man, when four-and
twenty years ago     I  was struggling to enter      into the ranks
of geologists."    Moreover, the day fixed for the ceremony
chanced   to be Murchison's       seventy- second birthday.       We
can hardly imagine a conjunction of coincidences         more fitted
to make a man ponder        deeply on the irrevocable     certainties
of his past, and the unknown possibilities of his future.
     From his own Sovereign,        too, he received    in his later
years some marks of distinction          which he greatly prized.
Having been made in 1863 a Knight Commander of the
Bath, he was in the year 1866 raised to the dignity of a
Baronet.    Nor were similar tokens of recognition wanting
from abroad.      Other European sovereigns         conferred   titles
upon him.     The Emperor of Russia, son of his old patron
Nicholas I., sent him    a  friendly and flattering message, with
a gold snuff-box set with diamonds        ; and having already re
ceived the  Prix Cuvier, Murchison, on the death of Faraday,
was chosen to   fill the vacancy in the list of the eight foreign
members    of the Academy of Sciences          in the Institute     of
France.

                     CHAPTER XXIX.
                           THE CLOSE.
      FOR many years Lady Murchison's health continued to
be delicate.    Now and then,   as above narrated,    she seemed
almost at the point of death, while, even when comparatively
well, her condition rendered     great care necessary.      It was
under such trying circumstances        that she had striven for
many years to do her part in the social gatherings           which
made her house    in Belgrave Square one of the chief scientific
centres of London.     At last  she died on the 9th February
1869.     Bound to her by a tender attachment,        and by the
respect which her many excellencies of character never failed
to inspire, Murchison acknowledged       to the last his gratitude
to her as the real source of  all his scientific work and fame.
A   long union of mutual help and sympathy was now severed,
and he stood alone in the world, wifeless and childless.        At
first the blow seemed to have fallen    so  heavily as to  parade
him, but he quickly rallied.       One of his first efforts    was
to pen the following    sketch of his wife, which, though its
details have already been, for the most part, given in these
chapters   at greater length, shows    at least the writer's deep
affection and gratitude to his life -long companion     : —

332           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
     "March   3, 1869.   — MY    DEAR GEIKIE, — .      . . I will give you
a few words upon my beloved            wife's    influence over me for
whatever good     I  may have done      in the walks of science.         In
the year 1815, the battle of Waterloo             having submerged all
my ambition,      as  well    as  that of the great Napoleon, and
seeing no
            '
              avenir,'   I  fell in love with Charlotte Hugonin,
and married her when           I was but twenty-three,           she being
three   and a half years older than myself.                Her father, the
old General of the 4th Dragoons, was a remarkably intelli
gent man, and a fair astronomer          ;   her mother a most skilful
florist and botanist,    so  that their only daughter was brought
up under the most auspicious circumstances.                    She was     a
good sketcher of scenery, having been taught by the famous
Paul Sandby.      . .  . Passing our first winter            in Hants,     I
naturally profited much by the instructions of herself and
parents in all natural- history subjects, and we then prepared
ourselves for a foreign tour in France, the Alps, and                 Italy,
which we undertook in the spring of 1816.                    I was   then a
prodigious walker, and more than once did on foot distances
in one day which occupied Swiss horses and carriages two
days,   my wife (when practicable) accompanying me on
horseback, and always making me recognise                   the numerous
wild- flowers peculiar to certain rocks, altitudes, and moun
tains.   Passing the winter at Genoa (1816-1817),               we became
together good     Italian scholars, and acquainted with all the
fine art of that noble      city.    In    the spring we travelled to
Rome, and were so enchanted that we stayed on                 till the 29th
June, a most imprudent act, by which my wife, who had been
riding late in the Borghese            Gardens,      caught a malarian
fever, by which     I  very nearly lost her, and the malady hung
 about her through her long life.             We passed the summer at

           LADY MURCHISON'S INFLUENCE.                                 333
Naples, where she made numerous              coloured      sketches,   and
where    we enjoyed     the charming society          of that capital in
those days, and     all the enchanting scenery of the environs.
    " In our journey     homewards    we visited every remarkable
object, and of all the sights, pictures, and statues         I have  note
 books full, for all that time   I was   a  virtuoso and dilettante.
    "
      Beaching England in 1818,       1  took to    a  country residence
in the house of my wife's grandfather, recently deceased —
the old General who led the 4th Dragoons in one day from
 Canterbury to the Borough of London, and dispersed the
mob in the      evening,  —a   service   which George          the   Third
always spoke of with admiration and gratitude.                I then gave
myself up recklessly but jovially to         a    fox-hunting life.      It
was during the years       1818-22 (three     in the north country,
and   two seasons at Melton         Mowbray) that my wife was
always striving to interest me in something more intellectual
than the chase, and began to teach herself mineralogy and
conchology.      Just   at that time (1823),       I  happened to meet
Sir Humphry Davy at Mr. Morritt's of Rokeby, the eminent
scholar,  and    friend of   Walter Scott       ;  and    Sir Humphry,
seeing how my wife was          striving     to lead      me into    other
paths, gave me words of encouragement,              which, coming from
so good a man, flattered     me, and led me to try and acquire
some knowledge of science.          He saw that          as a sportsman
I had   a quick and clear eye for a country, and that with
most mountain forms and features          I  was already acquainted,
and so he stimulated me to sell my horses, settle                  for the
winter in London,        and  attend    the chemical         and   mining
lectures of the Royal Institution.
    " Thus my fate was decided.        My first burst of enthusiasm
when    I got my lessons from       Buckland, Greenough,           Fitton,

  Warburton, Webster, and others, was unbounded,                   and   I was
  then, to the great delight of my wife, another man.
       "
          Immediately    I had acquired this taste my wife and self
  resolved to explore for ourselves           (1825)    the whole southern
  coast of England, from the          Isle of Wight inclusive, where
  all our home phenomena were repeated, to Land's End.                     For
  this purpose      I  had a nice    little pair of horses, a light car
  riage, and     with saddles strapped behind to use the nags for
  riding when at any centre of attraction.               At  some places we
  examined the cliffs in boats, she never failing to make good
  sketches.      When we reached Lyme-Eegis, she being rather
  fatigued,   I left  her to recruit there and amuse herself, and
  become a good practical fossilist, by working with the cele
  brated    Mary Anning of that place, and trudging with her
  (pattens    on their   feet) along     the shore     ;  and thus my first
  collection was much enriched.
       " The
               year 1826 was very dear to me, for then it was that
  my good wife accompanied           me to the Yorkshire          coast, and
  made many a sketch of         cliff and fossil for me, and thence
 travelled with me to Brora, and various parts of the He
 brides.      There also we had our little horses          ;  and many were
 the rides she took in Skye and many other places, where
 wheels could not go.        Then    it    was, too, that she found the
 Ammonites       Murchisonice,   and many         other fossils,    first de
 scribed by Sowerby.
      " When we were boating          it   along the shores of     Arran in
 1826, old Ronald        Macalister, the guide of Jameson, who,
with a little boy to help, was our only boatman, got quite

           with   his too frequent drams,            and    as  I was    thus
obliged to row back most of the way from Loch Eanza to
Brodick, he amused my poor wife much when, sitting coiled
up in the bow, he kept saying,           '
                                            Noo,  I 'm   the Laird.'

for a violent fever caught at Frejus, in the south of France,
when walking with Lyell
     " To
           go on narrating, even in this superficial way, all her
adventures     with me — all the happy hours we have spent to
gether at the tables of Cuvier, Brongniart, and many eminent
men     of France, Italy, and Germany, is impracticable in a
hurried letter, in scribbling off which all the deepest wells
 of my heart are opened out.
     "In   1830 she explored a large portion of Germany, and
the  Austrian and Tyrolese Alps, with me, and was with me
at Vienna when George the Fourth died, and when we dined
with Lord Cowley, at whose table Prince Metternich was
quite pleased with her conversation.             The Archduke John
of Austria     (a  highly intellectual man) was also her great
admirer.
     "Need     I   say that   in originating and completing the
Silurian    classification, from     1830    to 1838,  she was very
frequently at my side.
     " Then as
                  years rolled on, and she became more infirm,
she necessarily      could not encounter       long journeys, and to
bivouac with me in Eussia and Siberia was out of the ques
tion  ;  but the intense interest she took in my exploration
of these regions is best told in her affectionate and dear
letters to me, which        I  cherish,  and which buoyed      me up
through all my difficulties         and   illnesses in the hope     of
rejoining her.
    " Still           that though she was unequal to        a Russian
             feeling
campaign      she was equal to one      in the Alps and Italy, she
again set out with me       in 1847, when, making the round of
Germany, we were          together    at the    last meeting   of the
Scienziati Italian!     at Venice, where all the leading men of

 science    paid her the most              marked    attention, including
 Leopold von Buch, Robert Brown, Carl Ritter, etc.
      " After this my younger friends came upon the scenes of
life.    You     as  well  as    any one know how much my good,
generous,      and   kind wife did, when other physical powers
 failed, to cheer and encourage all those who were striving to
 advance natural knowledge.             — Yours ever sincerely,

      " P.S. —   I  may tell you that when the Prince Consort,
 many years       ago, called    in Belgrave Square to       see  my great
Russian vase, which my wife was showing to him before                     I
could get to the spot (for            I was in my dressing-gown), H. R.

It  would appear that our gracious Queen has always recol
lected    this fact, for not only             on  all occasions   has Her
Majesty been most attentive and kind, but on this last
melancholy occasion she has specially condoled with me in
most touching terms.               Among great people the Queen          of
Holland      and Comte        de Paris have       also sympathized    with
me, and     I   have    at least      150 letters  of condolence, some of
them     beautifully     expressed.        Those   of yourself and your
good Surveyors shall           all be bound up with those of other
friends in the album of souvenirs of Lady M."
      Of all the letters of sympathy which Murchison                   re
ceived at this time, that which probably touched                 him most
was one from Sedgwick.                For years past there had been no
intercourse      between     them.       Murchison     had  given up the
attempt     to conciliate his friend, but never ceased to deplore
their estrangement.          Only about a month before Lady Mur-
chison's    death    letters   had passed between         them relative to
                                    '         '
a copy   of  a new    edition of Siluria        which had been presented

braced that occasion once more to try to heal the breach
but in vain.       The hand of death, however, now touched                 a
chord   in Sedgwick's       heart which for many a year his old
friend had sought in vain to reach.            The sight of that former
friend and comrade bowed by the deepest sorrow of                  a man's
life, and the recollection      of the kindly ways of her who was
gone, broke      down   all barriers, leaving his manly piety and
generous feelings to gush forth in the following letter — fitting
conclusion     to the intercourse    which had brightened         so many
years of their lives, and had linked the names of Sedgwick
and    Murchison     so   honourably together         in the history of
science  :—

     "DEAR SIR RODERICK MURCHISON, — I did not wish to
intrude myself on your sorrows too            soon.    Indeed, such has
been my life of solitude for the last two months, that                  in
cidents of the greatest interest to my heart have more than
once passed away for a         full week or ten days before their
report reached me.        You will,   I know, believe     me when    I say
that the first news of your beloved wife's death filled me with
very deep sorrow.         For many many years Lady Murchison
was one of the dearest of those friends whose society formed
the best charms        of my life.     How often was       I  her guest    !
How often have       I   experienced    her   kind welcome, and been
cheered and strengthened          by it  !   In joy or in     sorrow she
was my     kind and honoured lady friend.
     "And     have   I  forgot   those    bright and, to me, thrice
happy days when       she and   you were my guests at Cambridge           ?
The present has comparatively little for me now.                  Hope    I
have for the future, and      I  trust that God will give it to me

  in the last hours of this world's life whenever                  they may
  come.       But an old man necessarily has his thoughts carried
  to the past.      But, oh  ! how many of the dearest and sweetest
  remembrances         of my life are now blended with clouds of
  sorrow    !    It   must be    so.     It is nature's    own   lawX May
  God teach you to bear your sorrow like a man.                     Of this  I
  have no fear      ; but more than this, may His grace be given
 you to bear it like a Christian.                This sustaining power is
  His precious gift, and it must be humbly sought for, by pros
 tration of heart, while under God's afflicting hand.                May He
 give you the comfort of Christian hope                 ; compared with     it
 all other comfort vanishes            into mid-air.      And if it indeed
 be given you, sorrow          will lose its bitterness, and even be
 tempered with joy.
 \j " I     was much      affected, and grateful too, when on Friday
 last   I received     what  I thought a letter      from Frank Buckland
 containing his biographical notice of Lady Murchison.                      I
 immediately wrote to thank him for it.                   But last night, on
 looking at the envelope,            I  found from the crest and your
 name on one comer of              it that    the  'Souvenirs'    had come
 from yourself, and now          I   send you the thanks of an honest
 heart     for this great kindness.             May God bless you and
 restore you to comfort        !
      "  If I   live four weeks more         I  shall finish my 84th year.
 For more than six months                I  have been lame       from some
 chronic affection of the tendon and integuments                  of my left
knee.      I can    bear no walking exercise, though          I hobble on a
stick    as  far  as  my museum.          For two months     I have greatly
suffered from a combined attack of gout and bronchitis.                 The
gouty diathesis        remains, but the bronchitis has given way,
leaving, however, behind            it a painful affection of my eyes,

can safely undertake      the journey.      I   generally dictate my
long letters to my servant, but in writing this letter of sym
pathy, addressed to you      in your hours of sorrow,      I could not
find in my heart to use the pen of an amanuensis.
      " My                                  I

      She could have been no ordinary woman whose memory
drew such an encomium from such             a man.      Her influence
upon the career of her husband was not her only title to the
grateful recollection of lovers of science.          To the courteous
bearing     of a  cultivated woman        she added       a brightness
of conversation,    an intelligence, and a range of knowledge
which gave her     a  peculiar charm, and enabled her to please
people    of the most varied tastes and acquirements.1                 To
her presence the success of her husband's              social gather
ings was largely due, and there can be        little doubt that these
gatherings, by commingling students of science with states
men and politicians, men of letters and men of rank, helped
to give science and its cultivators     a better    hold on the sym
pathy and good-will of the rest of society.
      Though Murchison       came to   Jermyn Street as of old,
and wrote letters      or transacted    other business      there, and
though he soon renewed his energy at the Geographical
Society,   he did not seem ever really to recover from                the
shock of his wife's death.       In these public matters, as well
as   in the socialities  of private life, he appeared, indeed, to
   1 Alexander von Humboldt used to describe her as " la spirituelle Lady
Murchison."

    340          SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
    mingle  as much as ever.      But though Lady Murchison had
    been more    or less an invalid       for some years,    she   could
    share up to the last      in her husband's     cares and interests.
    Her death broke up therefore           the  daily intercourse    and
   habits of more than half a century.          From such a blow       it
    was hardly to be expected that he should wholly rally.
        Of the incidents in Sir Eoderick's life after this event
    no special mention need be made.            They continued     to be
   much what they had been for some years before.                Among
   them however there is one which remains to be noticed, as
   the last effort made     in his lifetime for the advancement of
   the science to which he had given his unremitting energies,
   and from which     in return he had reaped so large a measure
   of renown — the founding of a Professorship of Geology in
   the   University   of Edinburgh,         When, on the death         of
   Edward     Forbes,   the    Chair   of Natural     History   became
   vacant   in that University,       the   Crown, in whose       hands
   the patronage    lay, having regard to the enormous strides
   made by the various sciences which had been taught under
   that title, anticipated      the   probable   necessity   of   divid
   ing the Chair into at least two.         Various movements were
   subsequently   made to induce       the Government to carry out
   this idea and make the subject of Geology and Mineralogy
   the business   of a new and distinct Professorship.            Mur
   chison had taken a part      in the negotiations which, however,
   proved unsuccessful
\]     In  the summer     of 1869 he went north for the last time
   to Scotland to get a   little rest, and once more to breathe the
   air of his native Highlands.          The time of his arrival in
   Edinburgh happened to coincide with the graduation day at
   the close of the summer session of the University.             With

         CHAIR OF GEOLOGY AT EDINBURGH.                              341
some difficulty he was persuaded            to remain     for the  cere
mony, and to receive himself on that occasion the degree               of
LL.DX It      so chanced   that the announcement        of  a  memorial
Fellowship for the encouragement           of Geology and Palaeon
tology, recently instituted in the University by the friends
of the late Dr. Hugh Falconer, was made at the same time.
In    a short speech on the occasion      he by a slip of the tongue
alluded to the Chair of Geology which had just been made,
but instantly correcting himself, he added that he hoped
there would before long be a Chair too.             The way in which
this was said seemed to indicate that he already meditated
founding the Chair himself.
       In the summer     of the following year, Professor Allman,
who had succeeded Forbes, resigned his appointment, making
the Natural       History Chair once more vacant.            Murchison
then determined to carry into effect in his lifetime          a proposal
which he had already provided for in his will.              He applied
to the Government to divide that Chair into one of Natural
 History or Zoology, and one of Geology and Mineralogy, and
offered to provide more than        half (£6000) of the endowment
of the new Professorship.            Eventually    this proposal     was
accepted, and on 10th         March     1871   a  Royal warrant was
 issued founding the Chair and appointing the Professor.1
       It was the first Professorship which had been founded
in any Scottish University for the special teaching of Geo
logy, and there was a peculiar fitness            in the fact that it
should have been founded by one who had himself done                   so
much for Scottish geology.          In his  remembrance, he wished
    I Sir Roderick had at different times during the previous ten years
 spoken to myself about the desirability of getting this Professorship
 established in Edinburgh.  At his request the presentation was now given
 to me.

fessorship."
      Before the negotiations    connected     with this matter were
brought to     a close, the veteran   geologist,  still vigorous alike
in mind and in body, was struck down by paralysis.                  On
the morning of 21st November 1870, while dressing, he had
a shock which deprived him of the use of his left side.             For
a time his life was in some danger, but            in a few weeks he
so   far rallied  as to be able to be wheeled        into his library.
As his speech had only been slightly affected, and               as he
seemed for a while to be regaining the use of his disabled
left hand, he spoke in a cheerful way of his probable recovery.
 Hence he continued to take a lively interest in current affairs,
dictated    his correspondence,     saw his old friends when they
 came to inquire for him, and was taken out almost daily              in
 his carriage.      In  the spring of 1871 he prepared         his last
 Anniversary Address to the Geographical Society, dictating
 it to his nephew.        He knew it would be his last, for even
 should he recover from the attack, he felt that he could never
 again take the same active part        in life.   He had been alto
 gether fifteen years President of the Society, had given six
 teen anniversary discourses,       and had seen its membership
 increased     from 600, when he was first called to preside,
  to   the  large    number of    2400.       He now resigned        the
  Chair,   and    with    an expression    of pride in the      success
  which had      attended    his efforts  to promote      the  Society's
 interests, handed      the seals of office to his successor.      As a
  recognition of his services, both to the Society itself and to
  the cause of Geography all over the world, his associates gave
  him the Founder's medal
       This and other tokens of esteem and grateful recollec

tion cheered the invalid.     Unable to walk or stand, he could
no longer resume his place at the School of Mines, or at any
of the many meetings where he used to be            so constant  an
attendant.      But driving about in London, receiving visits
from his more intimate friends, and reading,          as he did,   a
good deal, he by no means         felt himself cut off from all
interest and participation in what was going on in the world.
Throughout the summer          he continued     in this condition,
making no visible progress      towards    convalescence, but yet
retaining   so   much vivacity, and looking       so  well, that  it
seemed as    if  he might yet live for some time to come.        He
carried  on his correspondence,      usually by the help of an
amanuensis,     but sometimes with his own hand, down to the
month of August.        Some   of his letters to myself, written
even as late as the early part of that month, though not suit
able for quotation here, show     little change in the keenness
of his interest in the progress of geology,         of the British
Association, of the School of Mines, the Geological Survey,
and other matters with which he had long been so closely
connected.
    The malady, however, made great progress in the autumn.
He had repeatedly expressed a wish to         see me,   and at the
end of September     I rejoined him.    The lapse of a few weeks
had produced      a marked and sad change.        His speech had
become so affected that even his nephew, who assiduously
watched    him daily, could not make out what he said.          His
face brightened with the old friendly smile as      I sat down be
side him for the last time.     There was something       which he
wished to say, but he tried in vain to express it in words.
He then had recourse to the pencil, which for a week or
two had served to make his wants known to those about

344            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
him.     But the fingers could no longer form any intelligible
writing.     His eyes filled with tears, and he sank back into
his chair.
     The end, now plainly near, though sad, could not but be
welcome.       He had never all his life been given to speaking
on religious subjects,     but he seemed to enjoy the Psalms
and other passages of Scripture as read to him.          His nephew
asked him     if he felt perfectly happy, and received in return
a smile     and an affirmative    pressure  of the hand.       In the
middle of October,       in the course of his usual drive, he
caught cold.     An attack of bronchitis followed,     under which,
on the 22d of the month, after a lapse of only three days,
he quietly and almost imperceptibly passed away.
     On the 27th October the remains of the old soldier and
geologist were laid beside those of his wife       in the Brompton
Cemetery.        A goodly company of mourners         followed them
to   the   grave,  including   representatives    from the varied
circles   of life and activity where       he   had   moved    for so
many years, and from which his presence would long be
missed.      The Queen and the Prince of Wales testified their
respect by sending their carriages       to join the funeral pro
cession.     Among those who walked bareheaded behind the
bier the most conspicuous         form  was    that of the     Prime
Minister, Mr. Gladstone.        And thus, amid the deep regrets
of his personal friends, and with the respect and          esteem   of
every rank and condition of men, the earth closed upon             all
that was mortal of Roderick Impey Murchison.
     Here the task of the biographer might fitly end.             Yet

              CHARACTER OF HIS WORK.                            345
not without reluctance can he lay down the pea           For many
months it has seemed to him       as if he had been   living again
with the friend whose life and work he has been tracing, and
from whom the completion of these pages brings         as it were a
final and irrevocable parting. Here then at the close he would
ask what that friend was, and what he did, that his death
should have called forth     so general   an expression   of regret.
Looking back upon the foregoing narrative, we can perceive
that the services by which Murchison earned the esteem and
grateful recollection of his fellow-men were twofold.         There
was first the value of his scientific work, and secondly, the
influence of his personal character.
     1. It is probably still too soon to attempt an estimate
of the actual and lasting contributions made by Murchison
to science.     But  as  to the general    nature and tendency of
his work there can be little diversity of opinion.          He was
not gifted with the philosophic spirit which evolves broad
laws and principles in science.      He had hardly any imagina
tive power.      He wanted therefore the genius for dealing
with questions     of theory, even when they had reference to
branches of science the detailed facts of which were familiar
to him.     The kind of opposition he offered to the views of
the evolutionists, and to the doctrines of those who gain
said his own favourite faith    in former convulsions of nature,
showing    as  it did a warmth of antagonism rather than an
aptitude for coherent and logical argument, may be cited          as
evidence   of this natural incapacity     as well as  of the want
of early training in habits of accurate scientific reasoning.
     But though his name may never be inscribed among
those of the recognised      magnates    in science who are both
consummate      observers and philosophic     reasoners, and who

 J46           SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
 mould the character       of science   for their own and future
 times, he   will ever hold a high place among the pioneers
 by whose patient and sagacious          power of gathering        and
 marshalling facts new kingdoms of knowledge are added to
 the intellectual   domain     of man.     He was not a profound
thinker, but his contemporaries        could hardly find a clearer,
 more keen- eyed, and careful observer.         He had the shrewd
 ness,   too, to know wherein his        strength   lay.    Hence he
 seldom ventured beyond the domain of fact where              his first
 successes were won, and        in which throughout his long life
 he worked so hard and so       well
     In that    domain    he had few equals.        The patient in
dustry and untiring perseverance with which year after year
he returned to the attack of the old grauwacke           rocks of his
 Silurian region form a lesson of hope and encouragement
 to all students   who seek to advance       our knowledge of the
earth.     His Silurian System, in its original elaboration, and
in its subsequent extension to the rocks of other countries,
may be taken as the type of his scientific work, as             it cer
tainly constitutes     the ground on which his name         will most
securely rest.    Theories    and speculations     which now seem
firmly established may eventually be swept away before the
onward     march of research, but such solid contributions of
fact   as  the details   of the Silurian System will remain as
part of the common stock of knowledge out of which new
theories    and  speculations    will be   evolved.     That   system
embodied     the results of such patient toil as enables a tra
veller to bring   a new   and unexplored country to the know
ledge of the rest of the world.       Murchison's labours among
the older rocks stood indeed to geology           in  a  relation not
unlike that which his friend Livingstone's work in Africa

                     HIS PERSONAL FIGURE.                                347
 bore to geography.          Round these rocks there had gathered
 some share of the mystery and fable             which hung over the
 heart     of Africa.      And he dispelled it not by intuitive
 genius, but by plodding and conscientious               toil, directed   by
 no    common       sagacity,   and    sustained   by an indomitable
 courage.      For this service his name will be held in lasting
 and honoured remembrance.
      It  was in the province of palaeozoic geology that           Murchi-
 son exerted his chief influence upon the progress of science.
 But,    as we    have   seen,   there were    other    spheres of work
 wherein he did good service, though its value may be even less
 easily appraised.       No man could be        so long and     so  actively
 concerned in the direction         of some of the leading scientific
 Societies     of his day without materially affecting the ad
 vancement        of the studies      to which    these Societies      were
 devoted.      To none of its founders         and promoters,       for ex
 ample, did the       British Association owe more than to him.
 His work, too, at the Geographical Society,                  was   directly
 related    to some of the best achievements              of modern geo
 graphy.       But in this and similar cases his scientific endow
ments were probably less concerned than his personal char
acter, to which we may now, and lastly, turn.
     2.   A  man's face and figure afford usually a good indica
tion of the general           calibre of the      spirit    which    lodges
beneath      them.     The picture which rises to the mind when
one thinks       of Murchison       is that of   a  tall, wiry, muscular
frame, which       still kept its erectness even under the burden
of almost       fourscore    years.     It seemed the type of body
for an active        geologist    who had to win his reputation
by dint of hard climbing and walking almost                    as much    as
by mental power.          It  was moreover     united in his case with

348            SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
a certain    pomp    or dignity of manner       which at one time
recalled   the   military   training of the Peninsular       days, at
another the formal courtesy of the well-bred gentleman of a
bygone    generation.     No learned     body or business    meeting
or anniversary dinner could well be presided            over by one
who possessed in a greater degree the preliminary and often
very useful advantage         of  a  commanding presence.         The
dignity, however, was blended          with a courtesy and kindli
ness of manner       which usually conciliated even those who
might have been most disposed to object to any assump
tion, or appearance of assumption, of authority on his side.
So    he moved among his fellows as a leader under whom,
in the conduct       of affairs, his comrades, even when con
fessedly his own superiors        in mental power and scientific
achievement, gladly, and indeed         instinctively, ranged them
selves.
     Fortunately     his  social position and wealth were such
as   to give him the     full use of these personal advantages.
Like Sir Joseph        Banks, he made his house          in Belgrave
Square     one of the     centres    where   the  most   truly repre
sentative    gatherings    of men could be met         with.     Min
isters   of State, men of rank, of science, of literature, of
art,   and   of travel   mingled there      together,  and came     to
see and    know each other.         And yet in the midst of this
general     intercourse   Murchison      never   lost  sight   of  his
scientific position.     His guests, too, though they saw him to
be a man of the world, were           in various indirect ways re
minded that he took a pride in his science.                It may be
hardly possible to estimate the value of this influence.           But
assuredly among the causes which have helped, during the
 last thirty years, to give science and its votaries a firmer

              HIS PERSONAL CHARACTER,                             349
hold upon society,      and   especially    the  higher classes of
society,   we must count     as  by no means unimportant the
liberal way in which Murchison            displayed his excellent
social qualities.
      But above and beyond this mere external aptitude for a
place of eminence, Murchison        had many higher claims to
such    a position.   Foremost we should place his vigorous
energy,    his unwearied and almost        restless   activity.   He
seemed     never to be without     a definite    and well-planned
task.    When hia hands were fullest of his own work, he
appeared     to have almost    unlimited time for assisting       the
labours of others,     and   co-operating with        them    for the
general advancement      of knowledge.        That he could do this
in   so great   a degree arose not only from his capacity for
work, but from a certain method and orderliness              of mind
which characterized     him in every period and phase of his
life.   The spirit which led him in early days to tabulate the
deeds and fate of his respective      hunters was the very same
which guided him through the labyrinths of grauwacke, and
prompted his exertions for the welfare of the Geographical
Society.     Men could not but respect one who, while doing
so  much honest independent work himself, was ever ready
to take his place with others in efforts for the general good.
      Another leading feature of his character, and an element
which     largely aided   his   success,    was   shrewd     common
sense and knowledge of the world.              We   see  this feature
conspicuously manifested      in all his scientific undertakings,
where he derived more help from         it than   some of his con
temporaries    did from undoubted genius.         He never allowed
himself to be led astray        from the track which he was
patiently and ploddingly following by any will-o'-the-wisp

 350          SIR RODERICK MURCHISON.
in the shape of speculation      or theory   ;  nor in the manage
ment    of affairs  did he bind himself to lofty and impracti
 cable  principles.   He took men and things           as  he found
them, and tried to work upon them by firmness             or conces
sion, as seemed most       likely to aid his object.       Now and
then, when provoked by opposition,        he manifested     a certain
 impatience,  and even imperiousness       of manner, which pro
 voked rather than conciliated.        Nevertheless, in the tact
 which enables    a man to manage     his fellows successfully    for
many years, he had few rivals.        He showed it in the conduct
of the various learned Societies of whose governing bodies he
was a member.       But nowhere did he display it more con
spicuously than in the way in which he gained from different
Ministries a recognition of the claims of scientific discovery.
Probably no man had       so  much influence with the Govern
ments of his day, and no man more honourably, persistently,
and courageously     used it.
     There was still another characteristic       which secured to
Murchison the esteem       as  well as the respect   of his fellow-
men — his    thorough     kindliness    and    goodness    of heart.
Separate instances of this have been given         in the foregoing
narrative, but it was       a feature   which    showed    itself all
through his life.     Many a humble fellow-worker in science
did he encourage       and   materially assist.      When he had
given the right hand of friendship to     a man he     stuck to him,
even in the face of baseness and ingratitude.         The devotion,
indeed, with which he espoused the cause of a friend, had, at
times,   something   altogether   chivalrous about it.      Of this,
the instance which     will naturally rise to most men's minds
is his hearty and energetic devotion to Livingstone, whose
interests he so entirely identified with his own.

                                VALE!                               351
     With the recollection of these features which go to make
up tha picture of what Murchison was, there must needs
mingle some slight remembrance          of his foibles of character.
But if this narrative of his life has been             as  faithful  as
its writer has wished that it should          be, these     superficial
weaknesses have       already appeared and need not be touched
on here.       Eather let us carry with us through the rest
of life the lessons which the other and dominant features of
his character and work may teach —his persevering industry,
his readiness to be helpful, his loyalty to     a friend, and, above
all, his life-long and entire devotion to the advancement of
knowledge.       It will,  perhaps, be many a day before another
man arises to      fill  among    us the   honourable and useful
place   from which        we   shall long miss     the    presence    of
Eoderick Impey Murchison.
