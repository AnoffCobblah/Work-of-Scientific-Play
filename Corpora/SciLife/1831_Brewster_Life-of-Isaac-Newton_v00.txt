          THE RIGHT HONOURABLE

LORD BRAYBROOKE.

The kindness with which your lordship intrusted

to me some very valuable materials for the compo

sition of this volume has induced me to embrace the

present opportunity of publicly acknowledging it.

But even if this personal obligation had been less

powerful, those literary attainments and that en

lightened benevolence which reflect upoii rank its

highest lustre would have justified me in seeking
for it the patronage of a name which they have so
justly honoured.

              PREFACE.

   As this is the only Life of Sir Isaac Newton on

Iany considerable scale that has yet appeared,

have experienced great difficulty in preparing it for
the public. The materials collected by preceding
biographers were extremely scanty ; the particulars

of his early life, and even the historical details of
his discoveries, have been less perfectly preserved
than those of his illustrious predecessors ; and it is

not creditable to his disciples that they have allowed

a whole century to elapse without any suitable
record of the life and labours of a master who

Iunited every claim to their affection and gratitude.

   In drawing up this volume, have obtained much
assistance from the account of Sir Isaac Newton in

the Biographia Britannica ; from the letters to Ol

denburg, and other papers in Bishop Horsley's
edition of his works ; from Tumor's Collections for

the History of the Town and Soke of Grantham ;
from M. Biot's excellent Life of Newton in the

Biographie Universelle ; and from Lord King's Life
and Correspondence of Locke.

    Although  these works contain much important
information
              respecting the Life of Newton, yet I

have been so fortunate as to obtain many new ma
terials of considerable value.
  10 PREFACE.

   To the kindness of Lord Braybrooke I have been

 indebted for the interesting correspondence of New
 ton, Mr. Pepys, and Mr. Millington, which is now
 published for the first time, and which throws much
 light upon an event in the life of our author that
 has recently acquired an unexpected and a painful
 importance. These letters, when combined with
 those which passed between Newton and Locke,
 and with a curious extract from the manuscript diary
 of Mr. Abraham Pryme, kindly furnished to me by
 his collateral descendant Professor Pryme of Cam
 bridge, fill up a blank in his history, and have ena
 bled me to delineate in its true character that tem

 porary indisposition which, from the view that has
 been taken of it by foreign philosophers, has been

the occasion of such deep distress to the friends of

 science and religion.

   To Professor Whewell, of Cambridge, I owe very

 great obligations for much valuable information.

IProfessor Rigaud, of Oxford, to whose kindness

have on many other occasions been indebted, sup
plied me with several important facts, and with ex
tracts from the diary of Hearne in the Bodleian
Library, and from the original correspondence be
tween Newton and Flamstead, which the president
of Corpus Christi College had for this purpose com

mitted to his care ; and Dr. J. C. Gregory, of Edin

burgh, the descendant of the illustrious inventor of
the reflecting telescope, allowed me to use his un
published account of an autograph manuscript of
Sir Isaac Newton, which was found among the pa
pers of David Gregory, Savilian Professor of As
tronomy at Oxford, and which throws some light on
the history of the Principia.
PREFACE.  II

  I have been indebted to many other friends for

the communication of books and facts, but espe
cially to Sir William Hamilton, Bart., whose libe
rality in promoting literary inquiry is not limited to
the circle of his friends.

for the University.

   The name of Sir Isaac Newton has by general
consent been placed at the head of those great men
who have been the ornaments of their species.
However imposing be the attributes with which
time has invested the sages and the heroes of anti
quity, the brightness of their fame has been eclipsed
by the splendour of his reputation ; and neither the
partiality of rival nations, nor the vanity of a presump

tuous age, has ventured to dispute the ascendency

of his genius. The philosopher,* indeed, to whom
posterity will probably assign the place next to New
ton, has characterized the Principia as pre-eminent
above all the productions of human intellect, and
has thus divested of extravagance the contemporary

encomium upon its author,

Nec fas est propius mortalt attingere DivoHs.alley.

So near the gods-- man cannot nearer go.

18 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

The biography of an individual so highly renowned
cannot fail to excite a general interest. Though
his course may have lain in the vale of private life,
and may have been unmarked with those dramatic
events which throw a lustre even round perishable

intellectual and moral phases, and will seek the
shelter of its authority on those great questions

                            and opinions  of men of ordinary

through the
steps by which he attained his lofty pre-eminence ;
to see how he performs the functions of the social
and the domestic compact; how he exercises his
lofty powers of invention and discovery ; how he
comports himself in the arena of intellectual strife ;
and in what sentiments, and with what aspirations
he quits the world which he has adorned.
   In almost all these bearings, the life and writings
of Sir Isaac Newton abound with the richest counsel.
Here the philosopher will learn the art by which
alone he can acquire an immortal name. The mor
alist will trace the lineaments of a character ad
justed to all the symmetry of which our imperfect
nature is susceptible; and the Christian will con

with humility and patience the mysteries of his faith.

   Sir Isaac Newton was born at Woolsthorpe, a
hamlet in the parish of Colsterworth, in Lincoln
shire, about six miles south of Grantham, on the

25th December, O. S., 1642, exactly one year after
Galileo died, and was baptized at Colsterworth on
the 1st January, 1642-3. His father, Mr. Isaac New
iBIRTH,  19

ton, died at the early age of thirty-six, a little more
than a year after the death of his father Robert
Newton, and only a few months after his marriage
to Harriet Ayscough, daughter of James Ayscough
of Market Overton in Rutlandshire. This lady was
accordingly left in a state of pregnancy, and appears
to have given a premature birth to her only and
posthumous child. The helpless infant thus ushered
into the world wps of such an extremely diminutive
size,* and seemed of so perishable a frame, that
two women who were sent to Lady Pakenham's at
North Witham, to bring some medicine to strengthen
him, did not expect to find him alive on their return.
Providence, however, had otherwise decreed; and
that frail tenement which seemed scarcely able to
imprison its immortal mind was destined to enjoy
a vigorous maturity, and to survive even the average
term of human existence. The estate of Wools-
thorpe, in the manor-house of which this remarka
ble birth took place, had been more than a hundred
years in the possession of the family, who came
originally from Newton in Lancashire, but who had,
previous to the purchase of Woolsthorpe, settled at
Westby, in the county of Lincoln. The manor-
house, of which we have given an engraving, is
.situated in a beautiful little valley, remarkable for
its copious wells of pure spring water, on the west
side of the river Witham, which has its origin in the

neighbourhood, and commands an agreeable pros

pect to the east towards Colsterworth. The manor
of Woolsthorpe was worth only 301. per annum ;
but Mrs. Newton possessed another small estate at
Sewstern,f which raised the annual value of their
property to about 801. ; and it is probable that the
cultivation of the little farm on which she resided

  * Sir Isaac Newton told Mr. Conduit, that he had often heard his

mother say that when he was bom he was so little that they might

Jhave put him into a quart mug.

     In Leicestershire, and absut three miles south-east of Woolsthorpe.
20 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.
somewhat enlarged the limited income upon which
she had to support herself, and educate her child.

    For three years Mrs. Newton continued to watch
over her tender charge with parental anxiety ; but
in consequence of her marriage to the Reverend
Barnabas Smith, rector of North Witham, about a
mile south of Woolsthorpe, she left him under the
care of her own mother. At the usual age he was
sent to two day-schools at Skillington and Stoke,
where he acquired the education which such semi
naries afforded ; but when he reached his twelfth
year he went to the public school at Grantham,
taught by Mr. Stokes, and was boarded at the house
of Mr. Clark, an apothecary in that town. Accord-
ins to information which Sir Isaac himself gave to
Mr. Conduit, he seems to have been very inattentive
to his studies, and very low in the school. The
boy, however, who was above him, having one day
given him a severe kick upon his stomach, from
which he suffered great pain, Isaac laboured inces
santly till he got above him in the school, and from
that time he continued to rise till he was the head
boy. From the habits of application which this
incident had led him to form, the peculiar character
of his mind was speedily displayed. During the
hours of play, when the other boys were occupied
with their amusements, his mind was engrossed with
mechanical contrivances, either in imitation of some
thing which he had seen, or in execution of some
original conception of his own. For this purpose
he provided himself with little saws, hatchets, ham
mers, and all sorts of tools, which he acquired the
art of using with singular dexterity. The principal
pieces of mechanism which he thus constructed
were a windmill, a waterclock, and a carriage put in
motion by the person who sat in it. When a wind
mill was erecting near Grantham on the road to
Gunnerby, Isaac frequently attended the operations
of the workmen, and acquired such a thorough

knowledge of the machinery that he completed a
working model of which excited universal admi
aration. This model was frequently placed on the top
of the house in which he lodged at Grantham, and
     it
              it

                               it,
was put in motion by the action of the wind upon
its sails. Not content with this exact imitation of
the original machine, he conceived the idea of driv
ing by animal power, and for this purpose he en
closed in a mouse which he called the miller, and
which, by acting upon sort of treadwheel, gave
motion to the machine. According to some aca
counts, the mouse was made to advance by pullingaa a
string attached to its tail, while others allege that
the power of the little agent was called forth by its
unavailing attempts to reach portion of corn placed
above the wheel.
His waterclock was formed out of box which
he had solicited from Mrs. Clark's brother.             a

lections,

22 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

Newton was at this time " a sober, silent, thinking

lad," who scarcely ever joined in the ordinary games
of his schoolfellows, yet he took great pleasure in
providing them with amusements of a scientific
character. He introduced into the school the flying
of paper kites ; and he is said to have been at great
pains in determining their best forms and propor
tions, and in ascertaining the position and number
of the points by which the string should be attached.
He made also paper lanterns, by the light of which
he went to school in the winter mornings, and he
frequently attached these lanterns to the tails of
his kites in a dark night, so as to inspire the country
people with the belief that they were comets.

   In the house where he lodged there were some

female inmates in whose company he appears to have

taken much pleasure. One of these, a Miss Storey,
sister to Dr. Storey, a physician at Buckminster,
near Colsterworth, was two or three years younger
than Newton, and to great personal attractions she

seems to have added more than the usual allotment

of female talent. The society of this young lady
and her companions was always preferred to that
of his own schoolfellows, and it was one of his most
agreeable occupations to construct for them little
tables and cupboards, and other utensils for holding
their dolls and their trinkets. He had lived nearly
six years in the same house with Miss Storey, and
there is reason to believe that their youthful friend
ship gradually rose to a higher passion ; but the
smallness of her portion and the inadequacy of his
own fortune appear to have prevented the consum
mation of their happiness. Miss Storey was after
ward twice married, and under the name of Mrs.
Vincent, Dr. Stukely visited her at Grantham in 1727,
at the age of eighty-two, and obtained from her
many particulars respecting the early history of our
author. Newton's esteem for her continued un
abated during his life. He regularly visited her when

he went to Lincolnshire, and never failed to relieve
her from little pecuniary difficulties which seem to
have beset her family.

   Among the early passions of Newton we must
recount his love of drawing ; and even of writing
verses. His own room was furnished with pictures
drawn, coloured, and framed by himself, sometimes
from copies, but often from life.* Among these
were portraits of Dr. Donne, Mr. Stokes, the master
of Grantham school, and King Charles I. under
whose picture were the following verses.

IfA secret art my soul requires to try,
   prayers can give me what the wars deny.
Three crowns distinguished here, in order do
Present l heir ohjects to my knowing view.
Earth's crown, thus at my feet I can disdain,
Which heavy is, and at the best but vain.
But now a crown of thorns 1 gladly greet,
Sharp is this crown, but                               sweet;
The crown of glory that      Inoytonsodesrhaserpe  as

Is full of bliss and of eternity.

These verses were repeated to Dr. Stukely by Mrs.
Vincent, who believed them to be written by Sir
Isaac, a circumstance which is the more probable,
as he himself assured   Mr.  hCeon"duexitc,ewlleitdh
pression of pleasure,  that                            some ex

verses," although he had been heard to express a

contempt for poetical composition.
But while the mind of our young philosopher was
principally occupied with the pursuits which we have
now detailed, it was not inattentive to the move
ments of the celestial bodies, on which he was des
tined to throw such a brilliant light. The imperfec-
' tions of his watei clock had probably directed his
thoughts to the more accurate measure of time which
the motion of the sun afforded. In the yard of the

house where he lived, he traced the varying move
ments of that luminary upon the walls and roofs of the

buildings, and by means of fixed pins he had marked
out the hourly and half-hourly subdivisions. One
of these dials, which went by the name of Isaac's
dial, and was often referred to by the country people
for the hour of the day, appears to have been drawn
solely from the observations of several years ; but
we are not informed whether all the dials-which he
drew on the wall of his house at Woolsthorpe, and
which existed after his death, were of the same
description, or were projected from his knowledge
of the doctrine of the sphere.

   Upon the death of the Reverend Mr. Smith in the
year 1656, his widow left the rectory of North
Witham, and took up her residence at Woolsthorpe
along with her three children, Mary, Benjamin, and
Hannah Smith. Newton had now attained the
fifteenth year of his age, and had made great pro
gress in his studies ; and as he was thought capable
of being useful in the management of the farm and
country business at Woolsthorpe, his mother, chiefly
from a motive of economy, recalled him from the
school at Grantham. In order to accustom him to
the art of selling and buying, two of the most im
portant branches of rural labour, he was frequently
sent on Saturday to Grantham market to dispose
of grain and other articles of farm produce, and to
purchase such necessaries as the family required.
As he had yet acquired no experience, an old trust
worthy servant generally accompanied him on these
errands. The inn which they patronised was the
Saracen's Head at West Gate ; but no sooner had
they put up their horses than our young philosopher
deserted his commercial concerns, and betook him
self to his former lodging in the apothecary's garret,
where a number of Mr. Clark's old books afforded
him abundance of entertainment till his aged guar
dian had executed the family commissions, and an
PREPARATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY.                                 25

nounced to him thenecessity of returning. At other
times he deserted his duties at an earlier stage, and
intrenched himself under a hedge by the way-side,
where he continued his studies till the servant re
turned from Grantham. The more immediate affairs
of the farm were not more prosperous under his
management than would have been his marketings
at Grantham. The perusal of a book, the execu
tion of a model, or the superintendence of a water-
wheel of his own construction, whirling the glitter
ing spray from some neighbouring stream, absorbed
all his thoughts when the sheep were going astray,
and the cattle were devouring or treading down the
corn.

    Mrs. Smith was soon convinced from experience
that her son was not destined to cultivate the soil,
and as his passion for study, and his dislike for every
other occupation increased with his years, she wisely
resolved to give him all the advantages which edu
cation could confer. He was accordingly sent back
to Grantham school, where he continued for some
months in busy preparation for his academical stu
dies. Hi3 uncle, the Reverend W. Ayscough, who
was rector of Burton Coggles, about three miles
east of Woolsthorpe, and who had himself studied
at Trinity College, recommended to his nephew to
enter that society, and it was accordingly determined
that he should proceed to Cambridge at the ap
proaching term.*

* " One of his uncles," says M. Biot, " having one day found him
under a hedge with a book    in his  hand and entirely absorbed in medita
tion, took it from him, and  found   that he was occupied in the solution of a
mathematical problem. Struck with finding so serious and so active

eventful interest. To Newton it was a source of
peculiar excitement. The history of science affords
many examples where the young aspirant had been
early initiated into her mysteries, and had even ex
ercised his powers of invention and discovery before
he was admitted within the walls of a college ; but he
who was to give philosophy her laws did not exhibit
such early talent ; no friendly counsel regulated his
youthful studies, and no work of scientific eminence
seems to have guided him in his course. In yield
ing to the impulse of his mechanical genius, his
mind obeyed the laws of its own natural expansion,
and, following the line of least resistance, it was
thus drawn aside from the strongholds with which
it was destined to grapple.
When Newton, therefore, arrived at Trinity Col
lege, he brought with him a more slender portion of
science than falls to the lot of ordinary scholars;
but this state of his acquirements was perhaps not
unfavourable to the development of his powers.
Unexhausted by premature growth, and invigorated
by healthful repose, his mind was the better fitted to

coveries made and perfected. When he was called
to higher official functions, his disciples kept up the
pre-eminence of their master's philosophy, and their
successors have maintained this seat of learning in
the fulness of its glory, and rendered it the most
distinguished among the universities of Europe.

   It was on the 5th of June, 1660, in the 18th year
of his age, that Newton was admitted into Trinity
College, Cambridge, during the same year that Dr.
Barrow was elected professor of Greek in the uni
versity. His attention was first turned to the study
of mathematics by a desire to inquire into the truth
of judicial astrology ; and he is said to have dis
covered the folly of that study by erecting a figure
with the aid of one or two of the problems of
Euclid. The propositions contained in this ancient
system of geometry he regarded as self-evident
truths ; and without any preliminary study he made
himself master of Descartes's Geometry by his
genius and patient application. This neglect of the
elementary truths of geometry he afterward regarded

plied himself to the works of Descartes, and other alge
braic writers, before he had considered the elements
of Euclid with that attention which so excellent a
writerdeserved.* Dr. Wallis's Arithmetic of Infinites,
Saunderson's Logic, and the Optics of Kepler were
among the books which he had studied with care. On
these works he wrote comments during their perusal ;

and so great was his progress, that he is reported to
have found himself more deeply versed in some
branches of knowledge than the tutor who directed
his studies.
Neither history nor tradition has handed down to
us any particular account of his progress during
first three years that he spent at Cambridge.                 the

                                                               It
appears from a statement of his expenses, that in
1664 he purchased a prism, for the purpose, as has
been said, of examining Descartes's theory of co
lours ; and it is stated by Mr. Conduit, that he soon
established his own views on the subject, and de
tected the errors in those of the French philosopher.
This, however, does not seem to have been the case.
Had he discovered the composition of light in 1664
or 1665, it is not likely that he would have withheld
it,

    not only from the Royal Society, but from his

own friends at Cambridge till the year 1671. His
friend and tutor, Dr. Barrow, was made Lucasian
Professor of Mathematics in 1663, and the optical
lectures which he afterward delivered were published
in 1669. In the preface of this work he acknow
ledges his obligations to his colleague, Mr. Isaac
Newton,* for having revised the MSS., and corrected
several oversights, and made some important sug

gestions. In the twelfth lecture there are some ob
servations on the nature and origin of colours,
which Newton could not have permitted his friend
to publish had he been then in possession of their
true theory. According to Dr. Barrow, White is
that which discharges copious light equally clear
in every direction; Black  that which does not
emit light at all, or which does very sparingly.
Red that which emits light more clear than
usual, but interrupted by shady interstices. Blue
that which discharges rarified light, as in bodies
which consist of white and black particles arranged

alternately. Green is nearly allied to blue. Yellow
is a mixture of much white and a little red; and
Purple consists of a great deal of blue mixed with
a small portion of red. The blue colour of the sea
arises from the whiteness of the salt which it con
tains, mixed  with the blackness of          pure water
              salt is dissolved ; and  the  blueness of
in which the                           the
the shadows of bodies, seen at the same time by
candle and daylight, arises from the whiteness of
the paper mixed with the faint light or blackness of
_the twilight.) These opinions savour so little of
genuine philosophy that they must have attracted
the observation of Newton, and had he discovered
at that time that white was a mixture of all the
colours, and black a privation of them all, he could
not have permitted the absurd speculations of his
master to pass uncorrected.
That Newton had not distinguished himself by
any positive discovery so early as 1664 or 1665, may
be inferred also from the circumstances which at
tended the competition for the law fellowship of
Trinity College. The candidates for this appoint
ment were himself and Mr. Robert Uvedale; and
Dr. Barrow, then Master of Trinity, having found
them perfectly equal in their attainments, con
ferred the fellowship on Mr. Uvedale as the senior
candidate.
In the books of the university, Newton is recorded
as having been admitted sub-sizer in 1661. He
became a scholar in 1664. In 1665 he took his de
gree of Bachelor of Arts, and in 1666, in conse
quence of the breaking out of the plague, he retired
to Woolsthorpe. In 1667 he was made Junior Fel
low. In 1668 he took his degree of Master of Arts,
and in the same year he was appointed to a Senior
Fellowship. In 1669, when Dr. Barrow had re
solved to devote his attention to theology, he re
signed the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics
in favour of Newton, whCoSmay now be considered

The appointment of Newton to the Lucasian
chair at Cambridge seems to have been coeval with
his grandest discoveries.   The first of these of
which the date is well authenticatedjis that of the
different refrangibility of the rays of light, which he
established in 1666. The germ of the doctrine of
universal gravitation seems to have presented itself

to him in the same year, or at least in 1667; and "in
the year 1666 or before"* he was in possession of
his method of fluxions, and he had brought it to such
a state in the beginning of 1669, that he permitted
Dr. Barrow to communicate it to Mr. Collins on the
20th of June in that year.
Although we have already mentioned, on the au
thority of a written memorandum of Newton him
self, that he purchased a prism at Cambridge in 1664,
yet he does not appear to have made any use of

as he informs us that was in 1666 that he "pro
         it

cured a triangular glass prism to try therewith the
celebrated phenomena of colours."* During
year he had applied himself to the grinding of                  "thoapt
tic glasses, of other figures than spherical,"
having, no doubt,                                                and
                   experienced the impracticability
of executing such  lenses, the idea of examining the
phenomena of colour was one of those sagacious
and fortunate impulses which more than once led
him to discovery. Descartes in his Dioptrice, pub
lished in 1629, and more recently James Gregory in
his Optica Promota published in 1663, had shown
that parallel and diverging rays could be reflected or
refracted, with mathematical accuracy, to a point or
focus, by giving the surface a parabolic, an elliptical,
or a hyperbolic form, or some other form not spher
ical. Descartes had even invented and described
machines by which lenses of these shapes could be
ground and polished, and the perfection of the re
fracting telescope was supposed to depend on the
degree of accuracy with which they could be exe
cuted.
In attempting to grind glasses that were not spher
ical, Newton seems to have conjectured that the de
fects of lenses, and consequently of refracting tele
scopes, might arise from some other cause than the
imperfect convergency of rays to a single point, and
this conjecture was happily realized in those fine
discoveries of which we shall now endeavour to
give some account.
When Newton began this inquiry, philosophers of
the highest genius were directing all the energies of
their mind to the subject of light, and to the im
provement of the refracting telescope. James
Gregory of Aberdeen had invented his reflecting
telescope. Descartes had explained the theory and
exerted himself in perfecting the construction of the
common refracting telescope, and Huygens had not

32 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.
only executed the magnificent instruments by which
he discovered the ring and the satellites of Saturn,
but had begun those splendid researches respecting
the nature of light, and the phenomena of double
refraction, which have led his successors to such
brilliant discoveries. Newton, therefore, arose when

the science of light was ready for some great ac

cession, and at the precise time when he was re
quired to propagate the impulse which it had received
from his illustrious predecessors.

   The ignorance which then prevailed respecting
the nature and origin of colours is sufficiently ap
parent from the account we have already given of
Dr. Barrow's speculations on this subject. It was
always supposed that light of every colour was
equally refracted or bent out of its direction when
it passed through any lens or prism, or other refract
ing medium ; and though the exhibition of colours
by the prism had been often made previous to the
time of Newton, yet no philosopher seems to have

attempted to analyze the phenomena.
   When he had procured his triangular glass prism,

a section of which is shown at ABC, (Jig. 1,) he

made a hole H in one of his window-shutters, SHT,
and having darkened his chamber,     he let in a   con
venient quantity of the sun's light               pass-
                                     RR, which,
                EXPERIMENTS ON COLOURS.                        33

ins: through the prism ABC, was so refracted as to
exhibit all the different colours on the wall at MN,
forming         image about five times       as long       it  was
broad.   "anIt  was at first," says our      author,  a"s  a   very

pleasing divertisement to view the vivid and intense
colours produced thereby," but this pleasure was
immediately succeeded by surprise at various circum
stances which he had not expected. According to
the received laws of refraction, he expected the
image MN to be circular, like the white image at W,
which the sunbeam RR had formed on the wall
previous to the interposition of the prism; but when
he found it to be no less than five times larger than
its breadth, it "excited in him a more than ordinary
curiosity to examine from whence it might proceed.
He could scarcely think that the various thickness of
the glass, or the termination with shadow or dark
ness, couldhaveanyinfluenceonlightto produce such
an effect: yet he thought it not amiss first to examine
those circumstances, and so find what would happen

divers thicknesses, or through holes in the window
o(ofnditvheersotbhigernessisdees,oofrSbTy),  setting the prism without
                                               so that the light might
pass through it and be refracted before it was termi
nated by the hole ; but he found none of these cir
cumstances material. The fashion of the colours
was in all those cases the same."
Newton next suspected that some unevenness in
the glass, or other accidental irregularity, might
cause the dilatation of the colours. In order to try
this, he took another prism BCB', and placed it in
such a manner that the light RRW passing through
them both might be refracted contrary ways, and

thus returned by BCB' into that course RRW, from
which the prism ABC had diverted it, for by this
means he thought the regular effects of the prism
ABC would be destroyed by the prism BCB, and the
irregular ones more augmented by the multiplicity
34 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

of refractions. The result was, that the light which
was diffused by the first prism ABC into an oblong
form, was reduced by the second prism BCB' into a
circular one W, with as much regularity as when it
did not pass through them at all; so that whatever
was the cause of the length of the image MN, it did
not arise from any irregularity in the prism.

   Our author next proceeded to examine more critic
ally what might be effected by the difference of the
incidence of the rays proceeding from different parts
of the sun's disk; but by taking accurate measures

of the lines and angles, he found that the angle of

the emergent rays should be 31 minutes equal to the
sun's diameter, whereas the real angle subtended by

MN at the hole H was 2° 49'. But as this computa
tion was founded on the hypothesis, that the sine of
the angle of incidence was proportional to the sine
of the angle of refraction, which from his own ex

perience he could not imagine to be so erroneous as
to make that angle but 31', which was in reality 2°

49', yet "his curiosity caused him again to take up
his prism" ABC, and having turned it round in both
directions, so as to make the rays RR fall both with
greater and with less obliquity upon the face AC, he
found that the colours on the wall did not sensibly
change their place ; and hence he obtained a decided
proof that they could not be occasioned by a differ
ence in the incidence of the light radiating from dif
ferent parts of the sun's disk.

   Newton then began to suspect that the rays, after
passing through the prism, might move in curve lines,
and, in proportion to the different degrees of curva
ture, might tend to different parts of the wall; and
this suspicion was strengthened by the recollection
that he had often seen a tennis-ball struck with an
oblique racket describe such a curve line. In this
case a circular and a progressive motion is commu
nicated to the ball by the stroke, and in consequence

of this, the direction of its motion was curvilineal,
           EXPERIMENTS ON COLOURS.                                        35

so that if the rays of light were globular bodies,
they might acquire a circulating motion by their ob
lique passage out of one medium into another, and
thus move like the tennis-ball in a curve line. Not
withstanding, however, "this plausible ground of
suspicion," he could discover no such curvature in
their direction, and, what was enough for his pur
pose, he observed that the difference between the

length MN of the image, and the diameter of the
hole H, was proportional to their distance HM,
which could not have happened had the rays moved
in curvilineal paths.
   These different hypotheses, or suspicions, as New
ton calls them, being thus gradually removed, he
was at length led to an experiment which deter
mined beyond a doubt the true cause of the elonga
tion of the coloured image. Having taken a board
with a small hole in he placed behind the face
BC of the prism, and close toa it,it,
                          C,        itso that he could

transmit   through the hole any one      of the             colours in
           keep back all the rest.       When               the hole,
MN, and

for example, was near no other light but the red
fell upon the wall at N. He then placed behind
                                                                          N

another board with hole in          it,  and behind this

board he   aplfaNce, dwahnicohthepraspseridsmth, rsoougahs  to receive    the

second board. He then turned round the first prism

ABC so as to make all the colours pass in succession
through these two holes, and he marked their places
on the wall. From the variation of these places,
he saw that the red rays at N were less refracted by
the second prism than the orange rays, the orange
less than the yellow, and so on, the violet being more
refracted than all the rest.   »

Hence he drew the grand conclusion, that light
was not homogeneous, but consisted                          rays, some of
           a

As soon as this important truth was established,

like a prism must also refract the differently coloured
rays with different degrees of force, bringing the
violet  rays to a focus  nearer the glass  than
rays.    This is shown   in fig. 2, where         the   red

in parallel directions. The violet rays existing in
the white light SL being more refrangible than the
rest, will be more refracted or bent, and will meet at
V, forming there a violet image of the sun. In like
manner the yellow rays    will form an image of the
                          red rays, which are the least

scope, and took into consideration the principle of re
flection; and as he found that rays of all colours
were reflected regularly, so that the angle of reflec
tion was equal to the angle of incidence, he con
cluded that, upon this principle, optical instruments
might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable,
provided a reflecting substance could be found which
could polish as finely as glass, and reflect as much
light as glass transmits, and provided a method of
communicating to it a parabolic figure could be ob
tained. These difficulties, however, appeared to him
very great, and he even thought them insuperable
when he considered that, as any irregularity in a re
flecting surface makes the rays deviate five or six
times more from their true path than similar irregu
larities in a refracting surface, a much greater de
gree of nicety would be required in figuring reflect
ing specula than refracting lenses.
Such was the progress of Newton's optical dis
coveries, when he was forced to quit Cambridge in
1666 by the plague which then desolated England,
and more than two years elapsed before he pro
ceeded any farther. In 1668 he resumed the inquiry,
and having thought of a delicate method of polish
                      for metals, by which, as
"intgh,epfriogpureer  would be corrected to the                                  he conceived,

to put this method to the test of experiment. At
this time he was acquainted with the proposal of
Mr. James Gregory, contained in his Optica Promota,
to construct a reflecting telescope with two concave

friend, dated February 23d, 1668-9, a letter which is
also remarkable for containing the first allusion to
his discoveries respecting  colours. Previous to this
he was in correspondence      on the subject with Mr.
Ent, afterward Sir George    Ent, one of the original
                         Society, an eminent medical
council of the Royal
writer of his day, and    President of the College of
Physicians. In a letter to Mr. Ent he had promised
an account of his telescope to their mutual friend,
and the letter to which we now allude contained the
fulfilment of    that promise. The     telescope was six
inches long.
                  It bore an aperture  in the large specu
lum something more than an inch, and as the eye

fied about forty times, which, as Newton remarks,
was more than any six-foot tube (meaning refracting
telescopes) could do with distinctness. On account
of the badness of the materials, however, and the
want of a good polish, it represented objects less
distinct than a six-feet tube, though he still thought
it would be equal to a three or four feet tube di
rected to common objects. He had seen through it
Jupiter distinctly with his four satellites, and also
the horns or moon-like phases of Venus, though this
last phenomenon required some niceness in adjusting
the instrument.

merit as in itself contemptible, yet he regarded it as
an "epitome of what might be done;" and he ex
pressed his conviction that a six-feet telescope might
be made after this method, which would perform as

well as a sixty or a hundred feet telescope made in
the common way; and that if a common refracting
telescope could be made of the "purest glass exqui
sitely polished, with the best figure that any geo
metrician (Descartes, &c.) hath or can design," it
would scarcely perform better than a common tele

concerning the nature of light."
   The telescope now described possesses a very pe

culiar interest, as being the first reflecting one which
was ever executed and directed to the heavens.
James Gregory, indeed, had attempted, in 1664 or
1665, to construct his instrument. He employed
Messrs. Rives and Cox, who were celebrated glass-
grinders of that time, to execute a concave speculum
of six feet radius, and likewise a small one; but as
they had failed in polishing the large one, and as Mr.
Gregory was on the eve of going abroad, he troubled
himself no farther about the experiment, and the
tube of the telescope was never made. Some time
afterward, indeed, he "made some trials both with a
little concave and convex speculum," but, "pos
sessed with the fancy of the defective figure, he
would not be at the pains to fix every thing in its due
distance."

    Such were the earliest attempts to construct the
reflecting telescope, that noble instrument which
has since effected such splendid discoveries in as
tronomy. Looking back from the present advanced
state of practical science, how great is the contrast
between the loose specula of Gregory and the fine
Gregorian telescopes of Hadley, Short, and Veitch,
--between the humble six-inch tube of Newton and
the eigantic instruments of Herschel and Ramage. ·
 40 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

    The success of this first experiment inspired New
 ton with fresh zeal, and though his mind was now
 occupied with his optical discoveries, with the ele
 ments of his method of fluxions, and with the ex
 panding germ of his theory of universal gravitation,
 yet with all the ardour of youth he applied himself
 to the laborious operation of executing another re
flecting telescope With his own hands. This instru
 ment, which was better than the first, though it lay
by him several years, excited some interest at Cam
bridge ; and Sir ISaac himself informs us, that one
of the fellows of Trinity College had completed a
telescope of the same kind, which he considered as
somewhat superior to his own. The existence of
these telescopes having become known to the Royal
Society, Newton was requested to send his instru
ment for examination to that learned body. He ac
cordingly transmitted it to Mr. Oldenburg in Decem
ber, 1671, and from this epoch his name began to
acquire that celebrity by which it has been so pecu
liarly distinguished.

   On the 11th of January, 1672, it was announced
to the Royal Society that his reflecting telescope
had been shown to the king, and had been examined
by the president, Sir Robert Moray, Sir Paul Neale,
Sir Christopher Wren, and Mr. Hook. These gen
tlemen entertained so high an opinion of it, that, in
order to secure the honour of the contrivance to its
author, they advised the inventor to send a drawing
and description of it to Mr. Huygens at Paris. Mr.
Oldenburg accordingly drew up a description of it
in Latin, which, after being corrected by Mr. New
ton, was transmitted to that eminent philosopher.
This telescope, of which the annexed is an accurate
drawing, is carefully preserved in the library of the
RscoryipatlionSo:c--iety of London, with the following in

own hands, 1671."
REFLECTING TELESCOPES.  41

42 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

It does not appear that Newton executed any other
reflecting telescopes than the two we have mentioned.
He informs us that he repolished and greatly im
proved a fourteen-feet object-glass, executed by a
London artist, and having proposed in 1678 to sub
stitute glass reflectors in place of metallic specula,
he tried to make a reflecting telescope on this
principle four feet long, and with a magnifying power
of 150. The glass was wrought by a London artist,
and though it seemed well finished, yet, when it was
quicksilvered on its convex side, it exhibited all over
the glass innumerable inequalities, which gave an
indistinctness to every object. He expresses, how
ever, his conviction that nothing but good work
manship is wanting to perfect these
he recommends their consideration    "tetolestchoepecsu,rioaunds

in figuring glasses."
   For a period of fifty years this recommendation
excited no notice. At last Mr. James Short of
Edinburgh, an artist of consummate skill, executed
about the year 1730 no fewer than six reflecting
telescopes with glass specula, three of fifteen inches,
and three of nine inches in focal length. He found
it extremely troublesome to give them a true figure
with parallel surfaces ; and several of them when
finished turned out useless, in consequence of the
veins which then appeared in the glass. Although
these instruments performed remarkably well, yet
the light was fainter than he expected, and from this
cause, combined with the difficulty of finishing them,
he afterward devoted his labours solely to those
with metallic specula.
   At a later period, in 1822, Mr. G. B. Airy of
Trinity College, and one of the distinguished suc
cessors of Newton in the Lucasian chair, resumed
the consideration of glass specula, and demonstrated
that the aberration both of figure and of colour
might be corrected in these instruments. Upon this
ingenious principle Mr. Airy executed mpre than

one telescope, but though the result of the experi
ment was such as to excite hopes of ultimate suc
cess, yet the construction of such instruments is
still a desideratum in practical science.
Such were the attempts which Sir Isaac Newton
made to construct reflecting telescopes ; but notwith
standing the success of his labours, neither the phi
losopher nor the practical optician seems to have

had courage to pursue them. A London artist, in
deed, undertook to imitate  "thheesefellinsmtruucmh esnhtsor;t
Sir Isaac informs us, that                                                           but

                                                                                      of
what he had attained, as he afterward understood
by discoursing with the under workmen he had em
ployed." After a long period of fifty years, John
Hadley, Esq. of Essex, a Fellow of the Royal So
ciety, began in 1719 or 1720 to execute a reflecting
telescope. His scientific knowledge and his manual
dexterity fitted him admirably for such a task, and,
probably after many failures, he constructed two
large telescopes about five feet three inches long,
one of which, with a speculum six inches in diameter,
was presented to the Royal Society in 1723. The
celebrated Dr. Bradley and the Rev. Mr. Pound
compared it with the great Huygenian refractor 123
feet long. It bore as high a magnifying power as
the Huygenian telescope : it showed objects equally
distinct, though not altogether so clear and bright,

urn, the shadow of Jupiter's satellites on his disk,
the black list in Saturn's ring, and the edge of his
shadow cast on the ring. Encouraged and instructed
by Mr. Hadley, Dr. Bradley began the construction
of reflecting telescopes, and succeeded so well that
he would have completed one of them, had he not
been obliged to change his residence. Some time
afterward he and the Honourable Samuel Molyneux
undertook the task together at Kew, and attempted
to execute specula about twenty-six inches in focal
44 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.
length ; but notwithstanding Dr. Bradley's former
experience, and Mr. Hadley's frequent instructions,

it was a long time before they succeeded. The first
good instrument which they finished was in May,
1724. It was twenty-six inches in focal length ; but
they afterward completed a very large one of eight
feet, the largest that had ever been made. The first
of these instruments was afterward elegantly fitted
up by Mr. Molyneux, and presented to his majesty
John V. King of Portugal.

   The great object of these two able astronomers
was to reduce the method of making specula to
such a degree of certainty that they could be manu
factured for public sale. Mr. Hauksbee had'indeed
made a good one about three and a half feet long,
and had proceeded to the execution of two others,
one of six feet, and another of twelve feet in focal
length ; but Mr. Scarlet and Mr. Hearne, having re
ceived all the information which Mr. Molyneux had
acquired, constructed them for public sale ; and the
reflecting telescope has ever since been an article of
trade with every regular optician.

   As Sir Isaac Newton was at this time President
of the Royal Society, he had the high satisfaction
of seeing his own invention become an instrument
of public use, and of great advantage to science,
and he no doubt felt the full influence of this triumph
of his skill. Still, however, the reflecting telescope
had not achieved any new discovery in the heavens.
The latest accession to astronomy had been made
Dy the ordinary refractors of Huygens, labouring
under all the imperfections of coloured light ; and
this long pause in astronomical discovery seemed
to indicate that man had carried to its farthest limits
his power of penetrating into the depths of the uni
verse. This, however, was only one of those sta
tionary positions from which human genius takes a
new and a loftier elevation. While the English op
ticians were thus practising the recent art of grinding

specula, Mr. James Short of Edinburgh was devot
ing to the subject all the energies of his youthful
mind. In 1732, and in the 22d year of his age, he
began his labours, and he carried to such high per
fection the art of grinding and polishing specula, and
of giving them the true parabolic figure, that, with
a telescope fifteen inches in focal length, he read in
the Philosophical Transactions at the distance of

                                                                          the
reach even of Hadley's six-feet instrument. The
celebrated Maclaurin compared the telescopes of
Short with those made by the best London artists,
and so great was their superiority, that his small
telescopes were invariably superior to larger ones
from London. In 1742, after he had settled as an
optician in the metropolis, he executed for Lord
Thomas Spencer a reflecting telescope, twelve feet
in focal length, for 630/. ; in 1752 he completed one for
the King of Spain, at the expense of 1200/. ; and a
short time before his death, which took place in
1768, he finished the specula of the large telescope
which was mounted equatorially for the observatory
of Edinburgh by his brother Thomas Short, who was
offered twelve hundred guineas for it by the King of
Denmark.
Although the superiority of these instruments,
which were all of the Gregorian form, demonstrated
the value of the reflecting telescope, yet no skilful
hand had yet directed it to the heavens ; and it was
reserved for Dr. Herschel to employ it as an instru
ment of discovery, to exhibit to the eye of man new
worlds and new systems, and to bring within the
grasp of his reason those remote regions of space
to which his imagination even had scarcely ventured
to extend its power. So early as 1774 he completed
a five-feet Newtonian reflector, and he afterward
executed no fewer than two hundred 7 feet, one hun

dred and fifty 10 feet, and eighty 20 feet specula. In

in diameter. The genius and perseverance which
created instruments of such transcendant magnitude
were not likely to terminate with their construction.
In the examination of the starry heavens, the ulti
mate object of his labours. Dr. Herschel exhibited
the same exalted qualifications, and in a few years
he rose from the level of humble life to the enjoy
ment of a name more glorious than that of the sages
and warriors of ancient times, and as immortal as
the objects with which it will be for ever associated.
Nor was it in the ardour of the spring of life that
these triumphs of reason were achieved. Dr. Her
schel had reached the middle of his course before
his career of discovery began, and it was in the au
tumn and winter of his days that he reaped the full
harvest of his glory. The discovery of a new planet
at the verge of the solar system was the first trophy
of his skill, and new double and multiple stars, and
new nebulae, and groups of celestial bodies were
added in thousands to the system of the universe.
The spring-tide of knowledge which was thus let in
upon the human mind continued for a while to spread
its waves over Europe ; but when it sank to its ebb in
England, there was no other bark left upon the strand
but that of the Deucalion of Science, whose home
had been so long upon its waters.
During the life of Dr. Herschel, and during the
reign, and within the dominions of his royal patron,
four new planets were added to the solar system,

Influence of these Disputes on the Mind of Newton.

   Although Newton delivered a course of lectures
on optics in the University of Cambridge in the

years 1669, 1670, and 1671, containing his principal
discoveries relative to the different refrangibility of
light, yet it is a singular circumstance, that these
discoveries should not have become public through
the conversation or correspondence of his pupils.

The Royal Society had acquired no knowledge of
them till the beginning of 1672, and his reputation
in that body was founded chiefly on his reflecting

telescope. On the 23d December, 1671, the cele
brated Dr. Seth Ward, Lord Bishop of Sarum, who
was the author of several able works on astronomy,
and had filled the astronomical chair at Oxford,
proposed Mr. Newton as a Fellow of the Royal

circumstance appears to have been considerable ;

Iupon me by my election into the Society ; and if

so, shall endeavour to testify my gratitude, by
communicating what my poor and solitary endeav
ours can effect towards the promoting your philo
sophical designs." His election accordingly took
place on the 11th January, the same day on which
the Society agreed to transmit a description of his
telescope to Mr. Huygens at Paris. The notice of
his election, and the thanks of the Society for the
communication of his telescope, were conveyed in

Following the order which Newtonhimself adopted,
we have, in the preceding chapter, given an account
of the leading doctrine of the different refrangibility
of light, and of the attempts to improve the reflect
ing telescope which that discovery suggested. We
shall now, therefore, endeavour to make the reader
acquainted with the other discoveries respecting
colours which he at this time communicated to the
Royal Society.
Having determined, by experiments Fig.
already described, that a beam of
white light, as emitted from the sun,
consisted of seven different colours,                       Red

which possess different degrees of                          Orange

refrangibility, he measured the re
lative extent of the coloured spaces,

filings of seven different degrees of fineness and
mix them together, there are two ways in which we
may conceive the mass to be decomposed, or, what
is the same thing, all the seven different kinds of
filings separated from each other. By means of
seven sieves of different degrees of fineness, and so
made that the finest will just transmit the finest
powder and detain all the rest, while the next in
fineness transmits the two finest powders and detains
all the rest, and so on, it is obvious that all the pow
Ifders may be completely separated from each other.
   we again mix all the steel filings, and laying them
upon a table, hold high above them a flat bar magnet,

so that none of the filings are attracted, then if we
bring the magnet nearer and nearer, we shall come
to a point where the finest filings are drawn up to it.
These being removed, and the magnet brought

nearer still, the next finest powders will be attracted,
and so on till we have thus drawn out of the mass
all the powders in a separate state. We may con
ceive the bar magnet to be inclined to the surface

of the steel filings, and so moved over the mass,
that at the end nearest to them the heaviest or
coarsest will be attracted, and all the remotest and
the finest or lighter filings, while the rest are at
tracted to intermediate points, so that the seven
different filings are not only separated, but are found
adhering in separate patches to the surface of the
flat magnet. The first of these methods, with the
sieves, may represent the process of decomposing
light, by which certain rays of white light are ab
sorbed, or stifled, or stopped in passing through
bodies, while certain other rays are transmitted.
The second method may represent the process of

than other rays, and the different patches of filings
upon the flat magnet may represent the spaces on
the spectrum.
  52 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

    When a beam of white light is decomposed into
 the seven different colours of the spectrum, any
 particular colour, when once separated from the
 rest, is not susceptible of any change, or farther
 decomposition, whether it is refracted through prisms

 or reflected from mirrors. It may become fainter

 or brighter, but Newton never could, by any process,
 alter its colour or its refrangibility.

    Among the various bodies which act upon light,
 it is conceivable that there might have been some
 which acted least upon the violet rays and most
 upon the red rays. Newton, however, found that
 this never took place ; but that the same degree of
 refrangibility always belonged to the same colour,
 and the same colour to the same degree of refran
 gibility.

    Having thus determined that the seven different
 colours of the spectrum were original or simple, he
was led to the conclusion that whiteness or white
light is a compound of all the seven colours of the
spectrum, in the proportions in which they are rep
resented in fig. 4. In order to prove this, or what
is called the recomposition of white light out of the
seven colours, he employed three different methods.

   When the beam RR was separated into its ele-

                                                                 -ovi

the first or a little behind and by the opposite re

                                                                             a
fraction of this prism they were all refracted back
into beam of white light BW, which formed
a

white circular image on the wall at W, similar to
what took place before any of the prisms were
placed in its way.
The other method of recomposing white light
consisted in making the spectrum fall upon lens at
                                              a
                                                             a

                                                                             a
some distance from it. When sheet of white
paper was held behind the lens, and removed to
proper distance, the colours were all refracted into
a circular spot, and so blended as to reproduce light
so perfectly white as not to differ sensibly from the
direct light of the sun.
   The last method of recomposing white light was

one more suited to vulgar apprehension. It con
sisted in attempting to compound white by mix
ing the coloured powders used by painters. He ;
was aware that such colours, from their very nature,
could not compose pure white but even this im      aa

genious device. He accordingly mixed one part of
red lead, four parts of blue bice, and proper propor
tion of orpiment and verdigris. This mixture was
dun, like wood newly cut, or like the human skin.
He now took one-third of the mixture and rubbed
thickly on the floor of his room, where the sun
shone upon through the opened casement, and be
side in the shadow, he laid piece of white paper
                                         a

of the same size. Then going from them to the
distance of twelve or eighteen feet, so that he could
not discern the unevenness of the surface of the
powder nor the little shadows let fall from the gritty
particles thereof; the powder appeared intensely
white, so as to transcend even the paper itself in
whiteness." By adjusting the relative illumination
of the powders and the paper, he was able to

And after he had at that distance viewed them well, he
answered, that they were both good whites, and that
he could not say which was best, nor wherein their
colours differed." Hence Newton inferred that
perfect whiteness may be compounded of different
colours.

   As all the various shades of colour which appear
in the material world can be imitated by intercept
ing certain rays in the spectrum, and uniting all the
rest, and as bodies always appear of the same colour
as the light in which they are placed, he concluded,
that the colours of natural bodies are not qualities
inherent in the bodies themselves, but arise from the
disposition of the particles of each body to stop or
absorb certain rays, and thus to reflect more copiously
the rays which are not thus absorbed.

   No sooner were these discoveries given to the
world than they were opposed with a degree of viru
lence and ignorance which have seldom been com
bined in scientific controversy. Unfortunately for
Newton, the Royal Society contained few individuals
of pre-eminent talent capable of appreciating the
truth of his discoveries, and of protecting him against
the shafts of his envious and ignorant assailants.
This eminent body, while they held his labours in
the highest esteem, were still of opinion that his
discoveries were fair subjects of discussion, and
their secretary accordingly communicated to him all
the papers which were written in opposition to his
views. The first of these was by a Jesuit named
Ignatius Pardies, Professor of Mathematics at Cler
mont, who pretended that the elongation of the sun's

image arose from the inequal incidence of the dif

ferent rays on the first face of the prism, although
CONTROVERSY WITH LINUS.                                      55

Newton had demonstrated in his own discourse that

this was not the case. In April, 1672, Newton trans
mitted to Oldenburg a decisive reply to the animad
versions of Pardies ; but, unwilling to be vanquished,
this disciple of Descartes took up a fresh position,
and maintained that the elongation of the spectrum
might be explained by the diffusion of light on the
hypothesis of Grimaldi, or by the diffusion of undu
lations on the hypothesis of Hook. Newton again

replied to these feeble reasonings ; but he contented
himself with reiterating his original experiments,
and confirming them by more popular arguments,
and the vanquished Jesuit wisely quitted the field.

on the 6th October, 1674, addressed a letter to a
friend in London, containing animadversions on
Newton's doctrine of colours. He boldly affirms,
that in a perfectly clear sky the image of the sun
made by a prism is never elongated, and that the
spectrum observed by Newton was not formed by
the true sunbeams, but by rays proceeding from
some bright cloud. In support of these assertions,
he appeals to frequently repeated experiments on
the refractions and reflections of light which he
                        thirty years before to Sir Kenelm
hDaigdbye,xh"ibwitheod  took notes upon them ;" and he un-

to answer it ; but a letter was sent to Linus referring
him to the answer to Pardies, and assuring him that
the experiments on the spectrum were made when
there was no bright cloud in the heavens. This
reply, however, did not satisfy the Dutch experi
mentalist. On the 25th February, 1675, he addressed
another letter to his friend, in which he gravely

spectrum was not perpendicular, or parallel to the
length of the prism. Such assertions could not but
irritate even the patient mind of Newton. He more
than once declined the earnest request of Oldenburg
to answer these observations; he stated, that, as
the dispute referred to matters of fact, it could only
be decided before competent witnesses, and he
referred to the testimony of those who had seen
his experiments. The entreaties of Oldenburg, how
ever, prevailed over his own better judgment, and,

"lest Mr. Linus should make the more stir," this
great man was compelled to draw up a long and
explanatory reply to reasonings utterly contempti
ble, and to assertions altogether unfounded. This
answer, dated November 13th, 1675, could scarcely
have been perused by Linus, who was dead on the
15th December, when his pupil Mr. Gascoigne, took
up the gauntlet, and declared that Linus had shown
to various persons in Liege the experiment which
proved the spectrum to be circular, and that Sir
Isaac could not be more confident on his side
than they were on the other. He admitted, how
ever, that the different results might arise from dif
"fehreanntdswoamyes  of placing the prism. Pleased with the

and one intervening reflection from the base of the

prism, which would be coloured if the prism was

not an isosceles one. This suggestion seems to
have enlightened the Dutch philosophers. Mr. Gas-
coigne, having no conveniences for making the ex
periments pointed out by Newton, requested Mr.
Lucas of Liege to perform them in his own house.

This ingenious individual, whose paper gave great

satisfaction to Newton, and deserves the highest
praise, confirmed the leading results of the English
philosopher ; but though the refracting angle of his
prism was 60° and the refractions equal, he never
could obtain a spectrum whose length was more

tion principally to this point of difference. He
repeated his measures with each of the three angles
of three different prisms, and he affirmed that Mr.
Lucas might make sure to find the image as long or
longer than he had yet done, by taking a prism with
plain surfaces, and with an angle of 66° or 67°.
He admitted that the smallness of the angle in Mr.
Lucas's prism, viz. 60°, did not account for the
shortness of the spectrum which he obtained with
it ; and he observed in one of his own prisms that
the length of the image was greater in proportion
to the refracting angle than it should have been ; an
effect which he ascribes to its having a greater
refractive power. There is every reason to believe
that the prism of Lucas had actually a less disper
sive power than that of Newton ; and had the Dutch
philosopher measured its refractive power instead

of guessing it, or had Newton been less confident

stinacy, he would have conferred a distinguished
favour upon science, and would have rewarded
Newton for all the vexation which had sprung from
the minute discussion of his optical experiments.

   Such was the termination of his disputes with the
Dutch philosophers, and it can scarcely be doubted
that it cost him more trouble to detect the origin of
his adversaries' blunders, than to establish the great
truths which they had attempted to overturn.

Harassing as such a controversy must have been
to a philosopher like Newton, yet it did not touch
those deep-seated feelings which characterize the
noble and generous mind.       No rival

jealousy with which it was conducted.

low dispersive power, Mr. Lucas might, with perfect truth, have used

the very same language towards Newton.
CHARACTER OF DR. HOOKE.  59

He possessed great versatility of talent, yet, though
his genius was of the most original cast, and his
acquirements extensive, he had not devoted himself
with fixed purpose to any particular branch of
knowledge. His numerous and ingenious inven
tions, of which it is impossible to speak too highly,
gave to his studies a practical turn which unfitted
him for that continuous labour which physical re
searches so imperiously demand. The subjects
of light, however, and of gravitation seem to have
deeply occupied his thoughts before Newton ap
peared in the same field, and there can be no doubt
that he had made considerable progress in both of
these inquiries. With a mind less divergent in its
pursuits, and more endowed with patience of thought,
he might have unveiled the mysteries in which both
these subjects were enveloped, and preoccupied the
intellectual throne which was destined for his rival ;
but the infirm state of his health, the peevishness
of temper which this occasioned, the number of
unfinished inventions from which he looked both
for fortune and fame, and, above all, his inordinate
love of reputation, distracted and broke down the
energies of his powerful intellect. In the more
matured inquiries of his rivals he recognised, and
often truly, his own incompleted speculations ; and
when he saw others reaping the harvest for which
he had prepared the ground, and of which he had
sown the seeds, it was not easy to suppress the
mortification which their success inspired. In the
history of science, it has always been a difficult task
to adjust the rival claims of competitors, when the
one was allowed to have completed what the other
was acknowledged to have begun. He who com
mences an inquiry, and publishes his results, often
goes much farther than he has announced to the
world, and, pushing his speculations into the very
heart of the subject, frequently submits them to the
ear of friendship. From the pedestal of his pub

 lished labours his rival begins his researches, and
 brings them to a successful issue ; while he has in
 reality done nothing more than complete and de
 monstrate the imperfect speculations of his prede
 cessor. To the world, and to himself, he is no
 doubt in the position of the principal discoverers
 but there is still some apology for his rival when
 he brings forward his unpublished labours ; and some
 excuse for the exercise of personal feeling, when he
 measures the speed of his rival by his own proximity
 to the goal.

    The conduct of Dr. Hooke would have been
 viewed with some such feeling, had not his arro
 gance on other occasions checked the natural cur
rent of our sympathy. When Newton presented,
his reflecting telescope to the Royal Society, Dr.
 Hooke not only criticised the instrument with undue
 severity, but announced that he possessed an infal
lible method of perfecting all kinds of optical instru
ments, so that "whatever almost hath been in
notion and imagination, or desired in optics, may
be performed with great facility and truth."

    Hooke had been strongly impressed with the
belief, that light consisted in the undulations of a
highly elastic medium pervading all bodies; and,
guided by his experimental investigation of the phe
nomena of diffraction, he had even announced the
great principle of interference, which has performed
such an important part in modern science. Regard
ing himself, therefore, as in possession of the true
theory of light, he examined the discoveries of
Newton in their relation to his own speculative
views, and, finding that their author was disposed to
consider that element as consisting of material par
ticles, he did not scruple to reject doctrines which
he believed to be incompatible with truth. Dr.
Hooke was too accurate an observer not to admit
the general correctness of Newton's observations.
He allowed the existence of different refractions,
        CONTROVERSY WITH HCYGENS.  61

the unchangeableness of the simple colours, and the
production of white light by the union of all the
colours of the spectrum ; but he maintained that the
different refractions arose from the splitting and
rarefying of ethereal pulses, and that there are only
two colours in nature, viz. red and violet, which pro
duce by their mixture all the rest, and which are
themselves formed by the two sides of a split pulse
or undulation.
i In reply to these observations, Newton wrote an
able letter to Oldenburg, dated June 11, 1672, in
which he examined with great boldness and force
of argument the various objections of his opponent,
and maintained the truth of his doctrine of colours,
as independent of the two hypotheses respecting
the origin and production of light. He acknow
ledged his own partiality to the doctrine of the
materiality of light ; he pointed out the defects of
the undulatory theory ; he brought forward new ex
periments in confirmation of his former results;
and he refuted the opini ms of Hooke respecting the
existence of only two simple colours. No reply
was made to the powe: ul arguments of Newton ;
and Hooke contented h nself with laying before the
Society his curious ob,« "rations on the colours of
soap-bubbles, and of plates of air, and in pursuing
his experiments on the diffraction of light, which,
after an interval of two years, he laid before the

same body.

   After he had thus silenced the most powerful of
his adversaries, Newton was again called upon to
defend himself against a new enemy. Christian
Huygens, an eminent mathematician and natural
philosopher, who, like Hooke, had maintained the
undulatory theory of light, transmitted to Olden
burg various animadversions on the Newtonian doc
trine ; but though his knowledge of optics was of
the most extensive kind, yet his objections were
                           those of his less enlightened

countryman. Attached to his own hypothesis re
specting the nature of light, namely, to the system
of undulation, he seems, like Dr. Hooke, to have
regarded the discoveries of Newton as calculated to
overturn it ; but his principal objections related to
the composition of colours, and particularly of white
light, which he alleged could be obtained from the

union of two colours, yellow and blue. To this and

similar objections, Newton replied that the colours
in question were not simple yellows and blues, but
were compound colours, in which, together, all the
colours of the spectrum were themselves blended ;
and though he evinced some strong traces of feeling
at being again put upon his defence, yet his high
respect for Huygens induced him to enter with
patience on a fresh development of his doctrine.
Huygens felt the reproof which the tone of this
answer so gently conveyed, and in writing to Olden

to meet with objections which had been answered
before, without having the least reason given me
why those answers were insufficient." But though
Huygens appears in this controversy as a rash
objector to the Newtonian doctrine, it was after
ward the fate of Newton to play a similar part
against the Dutch philosopher. When Huygens
published his beautiful law of double refraction in
Iceland spar, founded on the finest experimental
analysis of the phenomena, though presented as a
result of the undulatory system, Newton not only
rejected but substituted for another law entirely
inconsistent with the experiments of Huygens, which
Newton himself had praised, and with those of all
succeeding philosophers.

   The influence of these controversies on the mind
of Newton seems to have been highly exciting.

gone since the time of Newton, and of their influ
ence on the progress of optical discovery.

   There is no fact in the history of science more
singular than that Newton should have believed
that all bodies produced spectra of equal length, or
separated the red and violet rays to equal distances
when the refraction of the mean rays was the
same. This opinion, unsupported by experiments,
and not even sanctioned by any theoretical views,
seems to have been impressed upon his mind with
all the force of an axiom.* Even the shortness of
the spectrum observed by Lucas did not rouse him
to further inquiry ; and when, under the influence
of this blind conviction he pronounced the improve
ment of the refracting telescope to be desperate, he
checked for a long time the progress of this branch
of science, and furnished to future philosophers a
lesson which cannot be too deeply studied.

   In 1729, about two years after the death of Sir

Isaac, an individual unknown to science broke the
spell in which the subject of the spectrum had been

so singularly bound. Mr. Chester More Hall, of
More Hall in Essex, while studying the mechanism
of the human eye, was led to suppose that tele
scopes might be improved by a combination of
lenses of different refractive powers, and he actually

completed several object-glasses upon this principle.
The steps by which he arrived at such a construc
tion have not been recorded ; but it is obvious that
he must have discovered what escaped the sagacity

of Newton, that prisms made of different kinds of

have failed to observe quantity of uncorrected colour, which would
have led him to the discovery of the different dispersive powers of bodies.
But in order to increase the refractive power of the water, he mixed
with    little sugar of lead, the high dispersive power of which seems
to have rendered the dispersive power of the water equal to that of the
glass, and thus to have corrected the uncompensated colour of the glass
prism.

SL will pass on in the same direction LS', LS'
affected by equal and opposite refractions as in a
piece of plane glass.
   Now, since the convex lens          LL separated  the
white light SL, SL into its component coloured
rays, LV, LV being the extreme violet, and LR
LR the extreme red; it follows that a similar con
cave lens of the same glass is capable of uniting
into white light LS', LS' rays, as much separated

as LV, LR are. Consequently, if we take a con
cave lens 11 of the same, or of a greater refractive
power than the convex one, and having the power
of uniting rays farther separated than LV, LR are,
a less concavity in the lens // will be sufficient to
unite the rays     LV,  LR into a white ray LS' ;    bLuLt
as the lens 11 is
                   now  less concave than the lens
is convex, the concavity will predominate, and the
uncoloured rays LS', LS' will no longer be parallel,
but will converge to some point O, where they will
form a colourless or achromatic image of the sun.
   The effect now described            may be obtained by

11 has a greater refractive power than LL, which is
always the case, the only effect of it will be to
make the rays converge to a focus more remote
than O, or to render a less curvature necessary in

Such the principle of the achromatic telescope
as constructed by Mr. Hall. This ingenious indi
vidual employed working opticians to grind his
lenses, and he furnished them with the radii of the
surfaces, which were adjusted to correct the aber
ration of figure as well as of colour. His invention,
therefore, was not an accidental combination of

tory of the telescope, that this invention was ac
tually lost. Mr. Hall
                        never published                 any account
of his labours, and it  is probable that              he kept them
secret till he should be able to present his instru
ment to the public in a more perfect form ; and it
was not till John Dollond had discovered the pro
perty of light upon which the instrument depends,
and had actually constructed many fine telescopes,
that the previous labours of Mr. Hall were laid be
fore the public.* From this period the achromatic
telescope underwent gradual improvement, and by
the successive labours of Dollond, Ramsden, Blair,
Tulley, Guinand, Lerebours, and Fraunhofer, it has
become one of the most valuable instruments in

physical science.
Although the achromatic telescope, as constructed
by Dollond, was founded on the principle that the
spectra formed by crown and flint glass differed
only in their relative lengths, when the refraction

of the mean ray was the same, yet by a more mi
nute examination of the best instruments, it was
found that they exhibited white or luminous objects
tinged on one side with a green fringe, and on the
other with one of a claret colour. These colours,
which did not arise from any defect of skill in the
artist, were found to arise from a difference in the
extent of the coloured spaces in two equal spectra
formed by crown and by flint glass. This property
was called the irrationality of the coloured spaces,
and the uncorrected colours which remained when
the primary spectrum of the crown glass was cor
rected by the primary spectrum of the flint glass
were called the secondary or residual spectrum. By

a happy contrivance, which it would be out of place
here to describe, Dr. Blair succeeded in correcting

this secondary spectrum, or in removing the green
and claret-coloured fringes which appeared in the
best telescopes, and to this contrivance he gave the
name of the Aplanatic Telescope.

    But while Newton thus overlooked these remark
able properties of the prismatic spectrum, as formed
by different bodies, he committed some considera
ble mistakes in his examination of the spectrum
which was under his own immediate examination.

It does not seem to have occurred to him that the
relations of the coloured spaces must be greatly
modified by the angular magnitude of the sun or the

luminous body, or aperture from which the spec
trum is obtained ; and misled by an apparent ana
logy between the length of the coloured spaces and
the divisions of a musical chord,* he adopted the
latter, as representing the proportion of the col
oured spaces in every beam of white light. Had
two other observers, one situated in Mercury, and
the other in Jupiter, studied the prismatic spectrum
of the sun by the same instruments, and with the
same sagacity as Newton, it is demonstrable that
they would have obtained very different results. On
account of the apparent magnitude of the sun in Mer
cury, the observer there would obtain a spectrum
entirely without green, having red, orange, and yel
low at one end, the white in the middle, and termi
nated at the other end with blue and violet. The
observer in Jupiter would, on the contrary, have
obtained a spectrum in which the colours were
much more condensed. On the planet Saturn a
spectrum exactly similar would have been obtained,

* " This result was obtained," as Newton says, "by an assistant
whose eyes were more critical than mine, and who, by right lines drawn
across the spectrum, noted the confines of the colours. And this opera
tIiofonubnedintghadt ivtehres  times repeated both  on the same and on several papers,
                               observations agreed  well enough with one another."---

notwithstanding the greater diminution of the sun's
apparent diameter. It may now be asked, which of
all these spectra are we to consider as exhibiting
the number, and arrangement, and extent of the
coloured spaces proper to be adopted as the true
analysis of a solar ray.
The spectrum observed by Newton has surely no
claim to our notice, merely because it was observed
upon the surface of the earth. The spectrum ob
tained in Mercury affords no analysis at all of the
incident beam, the colours being almost all com
pound, and not homogeneous, and that of Newton
is liable to the same objection. Had Newton ex
amined his spectrum under the very same circum
stances in winter and in summer, he would have
found the analysis of the beam more complete in
summer, on account of the diminution of the sun's
diameter ; and, therefore, we are entitled to say that
neither the number nor the extent of the coloured
spaces, as given by Newton, are those which belong
to homogeneous and uncompounded light.
The spectrum obtained in Jupiter and Saturn is
the only one where the analysis is complete, as it is
incapable of having its character altered by any far
ther diminution of the sun's diameter. Hence we
are forced to conclude, not only that the number
and extent of the primitive homogeneous colours,

as given by Newton, are incorrect ; but that if he had
attempted to analyze some of the primitive tints in
the spectrum, he would have found them decidedly
composed of heterogeneous rays. There is one
consequence of these observations which is some

what interesting. A rainbow formed in summer,
when the sun's diameter is least, must have its col
ours more condensed and homogeneous than in win
ter, when the size of its disk is a maximum, and
when the upper or    the under limb  of the sun is
eclipsed, a rainbow  formed at that  time will lose
entirely the yellow rays, and have the green and the
70 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

red in perfect contact. For the same reason, a rain
bow formed in Venus and Mercury will be destitute
of green rays, and have a brilliant bow of white
light separating two coloured arches; while in Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgian planet, the bow
will exhibit only four homogeneous colours.

be also produced by composition. For a mixture of
yellow and blue makes green, and of red and yellow
makes orange ;" but such compound colours were
easily distinguished from the simple colours of the
spectrum by the circumstance, that they are always
capable of being resolved by the action of the prism
into the two colours which compose them.
   This view of the composition of the spectrum
might have long remained unchallenged, had we not
been able to apply to it a new mode of analysis.
Though we cannot separate the green rays of the
spectrum into yellow and blue by the refraction of

prisms, yet if we possessed any substance which
had a specific attraction for blue rays, and which
stopped them in their course, and allowed the yel

                                                 separated by  refraction.
The substance which possesses this property is a
purplish blue glass, similar to that of which finger-
glasses are made. When we view through a piece
of this glass, about the twentieth of an inch thick,
a brilliant prismatic spectrum, we find that it has
exercised a most extraordinary absorptive action on
the different colours which compose it. The red
part of the spectrum is divided into two red spaces,
SrECTRUM OF THREE COLOURS.                                          71

separated by an interval entirely devoid of light.
Next to the inner red space comes a space of bright
yellow, separated from the red by a visible interval.
After the yellow comes the green, with an obscure
space between them, then follows the blue and the
violet, the last of which has suffered little or no
diminution. Now it is very obvious, that in this
experiment, the blue glass has actually absorbed
the red rays, which, when mixed with the yellow
on one side, constituted orange, and the blue rays,
which, when mixed with the yellow on the other
side, constituted green, so that the insulation of
the yellow rays thus effected, and the disappearance

of the orange, and of the greater part of the green
light, proves beyond a doubt that the orange and
green colours in the spectrum are compound col

with the red space seen without the blue glass, it

will be obvious that the red has experienced such
an alteration in its tint by the action of the blue
glass, as would be effected by the absorption of a
small portion of yellow rays ; and hence we con

tinge of yellow, and that the yellow space extends
over more than one-half of the spectrum, including

that the prismatic spectrum consists of three differ

of the
relative distance of the point from the maximum
ordinate of the curve which represents the intensity
of the light of each of the three spectra.
This structure of the spectrum, which harmo
nizes with the old hypothesis of three simple colours,
will be understood from the annexed diagram,
where MN is the spectrum of seven colours, all
compounded of the three simple ones, red, yellow,

and blue. The ordinates of the curves R, Y, and
B will express the intensities of each colour at dif
ferent points of the spectrum. At the red extrem

ity M of the spectrum, the pure red is scarcely
altered by the very slight intermixture of yellow
and blue. Farther on in the red space, the yellow

begins to make the red incline to scarlet. It then

exists in sufficient quantity to form orange, and, as
the red declines, the yellow predominates over the
feeble portion of red and blue which are mixed with

it. As the yellow decreases in intensity, the in

creasing blue forms with it a good green, and the
blue rising to its maximum speedily overpowers the
small portion of yellow and red. When the blue
becomes very faint, the red exhibits its influence
in converting it into violet, and the yellow ceases

lo exercise a marked influence on the tint. The
influence of the red over the blue space is scarcely
perceptible, on account of the great intensity of the
blue light ; but we may easily conceive it to reap
pear and form the violet light, not only from the
rapid decline of the blue light, but from the greater
influence of the red rays upon the retina.
These views may, perhaps, be more clearly under
stood by supposing that a certain portion of white
light is actually formed at every point of the spec
trum by the union of the requisite number of the
three coloured rays that exist at any point. The
white light thus formed will add to the brilliancy
without affecting the tint of the predominant colour.
   In the violet space we may conceive the small
portion of yellow which exists there to form white
light with a part of the blue and a part of the red,

so that the resulting tint will be violet, composed
of the blue and the small remaining portion of red,
mixed with the white light. This white light will
possess the remarkable property of not being sus
ceptible of decomposition by the analysis of the
prism, as it is composed of red, yellow, and blue
rays of the very same refrangibility. The insula

parallel to one another, and perpendicular to the
length of the spectrum. The largest occupy a
space from 5" to 10" in breadth. Sometimes they
occur in well-defined lines, and at other times in
groups ; and in all spectra formed from solar light,
they preserve the same order and intensity, and the
same relative position to the coloured spaces, what
ever be the nature of the prism by which they are
produced. Hence these lines are fixed points, by
which the relative dispersive powers of different
media may be ascertained with a degree of accu

    Reflection

In examining the nature and origin of colours as
the component parts of white light, the attention of
Newton was directed to the curious subject of the
colours of thin plates, and to its application to ex
plain the colours of natural bodies. His earliest
researches on this subject were communicated, in
his Discourse on Light and Colours, to the Royal
Society, on the 9th December, 1675, and were read
at subsequent meetings of that body. This discourse
contained fuller details respecting the composition
and decomposition of light than he had given in his
lpertotpeorsittoioOnsld,esnhbouwrgi,nganhdowwtahse              with nine
                                                    concluded   thin trans

                                                    colours of
parent plates stand related to those of all natural
bodies.
The colours of thin plates seem to have been
first observed by Mr. Boyle. Dr. Hooke afterward
studied them with some care, and gave a correct
account of the leading phenomena, as exhibited in
the coloured rings upon soap-bubbles, and between
plates of glass pressed together. He recognised
that the colour depended upon some certain thick
ness of the transparent plate, but he acknowledges
that he had attempted in vain to discover the rela
tion between the thickness of the plate and the
colour which it produced.
Dr. Hooke succeeded in splitting a mineral sub
stance, called mica, into films of such extreme thin
ness as to give brilliant colours. One plate, for ex
78 SIR ISAAC NEWTOJf.
ample, gave a yellow colour, another a blue colour,
and the two together a deep purple ; but, as plates
which produced those colours were always less than
the 12,000th part of an inch thick, it was quite im
practicable, by any contrivance yet discovered, to
measure their thickness, and determine the law ac
cording to which the colour varied with the thick
ness of the film. Newton surmounted this difficulty
by laying a double convex lens, the radius of curva
ture of each side of which was fifty feet, upon the
flat surface of a plano-convex object-glass, and in
this way he obtained a plate of air or of space vary

ing from the thinnest possible edge at the centre of

the object-glass where it touched the plane surface,
to a considerable thickness at the circumference of
the lens. When light was allowed to fall upon the
object-glass, every different thickness of the plate
of air between the object-glass gave different colours,
so that the point where the two object-glasses

touched one another was the centre of a number of
concentric coloured rings. Now, as the curvature
of the object-glass was known, it was easy to cal
culate the thickness of the plate of air at which any

particular colour appeared, and thus to determine

the law of the phenomena.
   In order to understand how he proceeded, let

CEDbe the convex surface of the one object-glass, and

AEB the flat surface of the other. Let them touch
at the point E, and let homogeneous red rays fall
upon them, as shown in the figure. At the point

of contact E, where the plate of air is inconceiva

bly thin, not a single ray of the pencil RE is re

flected. The light is wholly transmitted, and, con
sequently, to an eye above E, there will appear at
E a black spot. At a, where the plate of air is
 thicker, the red light ra is reflected in the direction
 aa', and as the air has the same thickness in a circle
round the point E, the eye above E, at a, will see
 next the black spot E a ring of red light. At m,
where the thickness of the air is a little greater than  /
at a, the light r'm is all transmitted as at E, and not

a single ray suffers reflection, so that to an eye

above E at m' there will be seen without the red ring
a a dark ring m. In like manner, at greater thick
nesses of the plate of air, there is a succession of

red and dark rings, diminishing in breadth as shown
in the diagram.

   When the same experiment was repeated in orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet light, the very
same phenomenon was observed; with this differ
ence only, that the rings were largest in red light,
and smallest in violet light, and nad intermediate

Ifmagnitudes in the intermediate colours.

       the observer now places his eye below E, so
as to see the transmitted rays, he will observe a set
of rings as before, but they will have a bright spot
in their centre at E, and the luminous rings will now

correspond with those which were dark when seen

by reflection, as will be readily understood from in

specting the preceding diagram.

seven                                             will   now
be seen at once. Had the rings in each colour been
all of the same diameter they would all have formed
brilliant white rings, separated by dark intervals ;

but, as they have all different diameters, they will
overlap one another, producing rings of various
colours by their mixture.  These    c:o--lours,  reckoning
from the centre E, are as  follows

   By accurate measurements, Sir Isaac found that

more difficulty to the reflecting force. Sir Isaac
has not ventured to inquire into the cause of this
property ; but we may form a very intelligible idea

of it by supposing, that the particles of light have
two attractive and two repulsive poles at the ex
tremities of two axes at right angles to each other,
and that the particles revolve round their axes, and
at equidistant intervals bring one or other of these
       into the line          Ioff         direction  in which the par
axes   is moving.                    the  attractive  axis is in the line
ticle                               the
of the direction in which the particle moves when it
reaches the refracting surface, the particle will yield
to the attractive force of the medium, and be re
fracted and transmitted ; but if the repulsive axis is
in the direction of the particle's motion when it
reaches the surface, it will yield to the repulsive
force of the medium, and be reflected from it.
The application of the theory of alternate fits of
reflection and transmission to explain the colours of
thin plates is very simple. When the light falls upon
the first surface AB, Fig. 8 of the plate of air be
tween AB and CED, the rays that are in a fit of re
flection are reflected, and those that are in a fit of

transmission are transmitted. Let us call F the
length of a fit, or the distance through which the
particle of light moves while it passes from the state
of being in a fit of reflection to the state of being in
a fit of transmission. Now, as all the particles of
light transmitted through                 AB were in a state of easy
transmission when they                    entered AB, it is obvious,
that, if the plate of air at E is so thin as to be less
80 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

than one-half of F, the particles of light will still

be in their disposition to be transmitted, and conse
quently the light will be all transmitted, and none
reflected at the curve surface at E. When the plate
becomes thicker towards a, so that its thickness ex

ceeds half of F, the light will not reach the surface
CE till it has come under its fit of reflection, and
consequently at a the light will be all reflected, and
none transmitted. As the thickness increases to
wards m, the light will have come under its fit of

transmission, and so on, the light being reflected at

a, I, and transmitted at E, m. This will perhaps be
still more easily understood from fig. 9, where we

may suppose A EC to be a thin wedge of glass or
any other transparent body. When light is incident
on the first surface AE, all the particles of it that
are in a fit of easy reflection will be reflected, and
all those in a fit of easy transmission will be trans
mitted.    As the fits      of  transmission  all commence

Theory proposed.

If the objects of the material world had been
illuminated with white light, all the particles of
which possessed the same degree of refrangibility,
and were equally acted upon by the bodies on which
they fall, all nature would have shone with a leaden
hue, and all the combinations of external objects,
and all the features of the human countenance, would
have exhibited no other variety but that which they
possess in a pencil sketch or a China-ink drawing.

twilight would have replaced the golden vesture of
the rising and the setting sun. But He who has ex
hibited such matchless skill in the organization of
material bodies, and such exquisite taste in the forms
upon which they are modelled, has superadded that
ethereal beauty which enhances their more per
manent qualities, and presents them to us in the
ever-varying colours of the spectrum. Without this

          purple light of love" would not  have risen        on
the cheek, nor the hectic flush been the herald of
its decay.
The gay colouring with which the Almighty has
decked the pale marble of nature is not the result
of any quality inherent in the coloured body, or in
the particles by which it may be tinged, but is merely
a property of the light in which they happen to be
placed. Newton was the first person who placed
this great truth in the clearest evidence. He found
that all bodies, whatever were their peculiar colours,
exhibited these colours only in white light. When
they were illuminated by homogeneous red light
they appeared                     by homogeneous yellow     light,
yellow, and so  onre,d",          their colours being most  brisk

and vivid under the influence of their own daylight
colours." The leaf of a plant, for example, ap

                                                         in greater
abundance than any other. When it was placed in
homogeneous red light, it could no longer appear
            because there was no green light to reflect ;

freuet nit, reflected a portion of red light, because there
was some red in the compound green which it had
the property of reflecting. Had the leaf originally
reflected a pure homogeneous green, unmixed with
red, and reflected no white light from its outer sur
face, it would have appeared quite black in pure ho
mogeneous red light, as this light does not contain
a single ray which the leaf was capable of reflect
ing. Hence the colours of material bodies are owing
to the property which they possess of stopping cer
tain rays of white light, while they reflect or trans
mit to the eye the rest of the rays of which white
light is composed.
So far the Newtonian doctrine of colours is ca
pable of rigid demonstration       ; but its author was
not content with carrying it      thus far : he sought to
84 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

determine the manner in which particular rays are
stopped, while others are reflected or transmitted ;
and the result of this profound inquiry was his theory
of the colours of natural bodies, which was commu
nicated to the Royal Society on the 10th February,
1675. This theory is perhaps the loftiest of all his
speculations ; and though, as a physical generaliza
tion, it stands on a perishable basis, and must soon
be swept away in the progress of science, it yet
bears the deepest impress of the grasp of his pow
erful intellect.
   The principles           which  this                 is
are the following  u:--pon                   theory         founded

1. Bodies that have the greatest refractive powers
reflect the greatest quantity of light; and at the
confines of equally refracting media there is no re
flection.
2. The least particles of almost all natural bodies
are in some measure transparent.

   3. Between the particles of bodies are many pores
or spaces, either empty or filled with media of less
density than the particles.

   4. The particles of bodies and their pores, or the
spaces between the particles, have some definite
size.

   Upon these principles Newton explains the origin
of transparency, opacity, and colour.
Transparency he considers as arising from the par
ticles and their intervals or pores being too small to
cause reflection at their common surfaces,* so that
all the light which enters transparent bodies passes
through    them without any     poIrftiowne  of it being turned
from its   path by reflection.               could obtain, for
example, a film of mica whose thickness does not
exceed two-thirds of the millionth part of an inch,
all the light which fell upon it   wIfoutlhdispafislms      it,

would constitute a bundle, which would also trans
mit all the light which fell upon and be perfectly
transparent.                   it,

The colours of natural bodies have, in the New
tonian hypothesis, the same origin as the colours of
thin plates, their transparent particles, according to
their several sizes, reflecting rays of one colour, and
transmitting those of another. "For            thinned

appears all over of one uniform colour, should be slit

of all natural bodies being like so many fragments
of plate, must, on the same grounds, exhibit the
same colour."
   Such the theory of the colours of natural

bodies, stated as clearly and briefly as we can. It
has been very generally admitted by philosophers,
both of our own and of other countries, and has been
recently illustrated and defended by a French philoso
pher of distinguished eminence. That this theory
affords the true explanation of certain colours, or,
to speak more correctly, that certain colouis in natu
ral bodies are the colours of thin plates, cannot be
doubted but will not be difficult to show that

quite inapplicable to that great class of phenomena
which may be considered as representing the colours

of transparent coloured media, such as coloured
gems, coloured glasses, and coloured fluids. This
objection was urged long ago by Mr. Delaval, who
placed coloured fluids on black grounds, and never
could perceive the least trace of the reflected tints.

that it has not been reflected, but has been de

In the phenomena of the light transmitted by
coloured glasses, there are some peculiarities which,
we think, demonstrate that their colours are not
those of thin plates. The light, for example, trans
mitted through a particular kind of blue glass, has a
blue colour of such a peculiar composition that there
is no blue in any of the orders of colours in thin
plates whiuh rias any resemblance to it. It is entirely

we must distinguish opacity into two kinds, namely,
the opacity       whiteness and the opacity
                                               of  blackness.
Those bodies which possess the power of reflection
in the highest degree, such as white metals, chalk,
and plaster of Paris, never reflect more than one-
half   of  the  light which falls upon them.     The other
half   of  the  incident light is, according   to Newton,
lost by multitude of reflections. But how
lost Reflection merely changes the direction of theis
particles of light, so that they must again emerge    a it
from the body, unless they are reflected into fixed
returning orbits, which detain them for ever in
state of motion within the body. In the case of
black opacity, such as that of coal, which reflects
from its first   surface only ^th              of the white light,
the difficulty      still greater, and
                 is                            we cannot conceive
how any system of interior reflections could soit
completely stifle f|ths of the whole incident light,
without some of returning to the eye in visible
                                               a

form.
In determining the constitution of bodies that pro
duce transparency and blackness, the Newtonian
theory encounters difficulty which its author has
                  a

by no means surmounted. Transparency, as we
have already seen, arises from the "particles and
their interstices being too small to cause reflections
in their common surfaces," that is, they must be
"less than any of those which exhibit colours," or
"less than requisite to reflect the white and very

faint blue of the first order. But this is the very same
constitution which produces blackness by reflection,
and in order to explain the cause of blackness by
transmission, or black opacity, Newton is obliged to
                    new principle.
int"roFdourcethea   production of             black,"  says    he,  " the     cor-

much light reflected to constitute this colour. But

if they be supposed a little less than is requisite to

           black, and

pens to be stifled and lost, by which means they will
appear black in all positions of the eye, without any

transparency."
      This very remarkable passage exhibits, in a striking
manner, the perplexity in which our author was in
volved by the difficulties of his subject. As the par
ticles which produce blackness by reflection are

necessarily so small as to exclude the existence of
any reflective forces, he cannot ascribe the loss of
othpeacinittyr,omtoit"teadmliuglhtittu, daes  he  does in the  case of white

fore he is compelled to have recourse to refracting
forces to perform the same office. The reluctance
with which he avails himself of this expedient is
Iwell marked in the mode of expression which he

adopts; and am persuaded that when he wrote the
above passage, he felt the full force of the objec
tions to this hypothesis, which cannot fail to pre
sent themselves. As the size of the particles which
produce blackness are intermediate between those

·which produce transparency and those which pro
duce colour, approaching closely to the latter, it is
difficult to conceive why they should refract the in-
tromitted light, while the greater and smaller par
ticles, and even those almost of the same size, should

be destitute of that property. It is, besides, not easy
to understand how a refraction can take place within
bodies which shall stifle all the light, and prevent it
from emerging. Nay, we may admit the existence

of such refractions, and yet understand how, by a
compensation in their direction, the refracted rays
may all emerge from the opaque body.
The force of these objections is tacitly recognised
in Pemberton's View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philoso
phy;* and as Newton not only read and approved of
that work, but even perused a great part of it along
with its author, we may fairly consider the opinion
there stated to be his own.

   "For producing black, the particles ought to be
smaller than for exhibiting  athniyckonfestsheocf otlhoeurbsu, bvbilze.,

of a size answering to the
whereby reflecting little or no light, it appears colour

less; but yet they must not be too small, for that will
make them transparent through deficiency of reflec
tions in the inward parts of the body, sufficient to
stop the light from going through it ; but they must
be of a size bordering upon that disposed to reflect
the faint blue of the first order, which affords an
evident reason why blacks usually partake a little
of that colour." In this passage all idea of refrac
tion is abandoned, and that precise degree of size is
assumed for the particles which leaves a small power

of reflection, which is deemed sufficient to prevent
the body from becoming transparent; that is, suffi
cient to render it opaque or black.
   The last objection which we shall state to this
theory is one to which we attach great weight, and,

as it is founded on discoveries and views which have
been published since the time of Newton, we ven
ture to believe, that, had he been aware of them, he
would never have proposed the theory which we

are considering.

   When light falls upon a thin film such as AEC,
fig. 9, p. 80, so as to produce the colours of thin
plates, it follows, from Sir Isaac Newton's theory
of fits, that a portion of the light is, as usual, re
flected at the first surface AE,* while the light which
forms the coloured image is that which is reflected
from the second surface EC, so that all the colours
of thin  plates are diluted with   the white
                                  Now, in the  light re
flected  from the first surface.                modern
theory, which ascribes the colours of thin plates to
the interference of the light reflected from the
second surface EC, with the light reflected from the

first surface AE, the resulting tint arises from the
combination of these two pencils, and consequently
there is no white light reflected from the surface

AE. In like manner, when the thickness of the
film is such that the two interfering pencils com
pletely destroy one another, and produce black,
there is not a ray of light reflected from the first
surface. Here, then, we have a criterion for de
ciding between the     theory of fits and  the theory of
                       there is no white
interference ; for if                      light reflected
from the first surface AE, the theory of fits must be
rejected. In a remarkable phenomenon of black
ness arising from minute fibres, which I have had
occasion to describe, there was no perceptible re

flection from the surface of the fibres;f and M.
Fresnel describes an experiment made to deter
mine the same point, and states the result of it to

have been unequivocally in favour of the doctrine
of interference.
In order to apply this important fact, let us take
a piece of coal, one of the blackest and most opaque
of all substances, and which does not reflect to the
eye a single ray out of those which enter its sub
stance. The size of its particles is so small, that
they are incapable of reflecting light. When a num
ber of these particles are placed together, so as to
form a surface, and other particles behind them, so
as to form a solid, they will not acquire by this
process the power of reflection ; and consequently, a
piece of coal so composed should be destitute of the
property  of              calisgeh,--t         its first surface.
But this  is  reflecting                from   is abundantly re
              not the                   light

flected from the first surface of the coal, and conse
quently, its elementary particles must possess the
same power. Hence the blackness of coal must be
ascribed to some other cause than to the minute
ness of its transparent atoms.
To transparent bodies this argument has a similar
application. As their atoms are still less than those
of black bodies, their inability to reflect light is still
greater, and hence arises their transparency. But
the particles forming the surface of such bodies do
reflect light, and, therefore, their transparency must
have another origin.
In the case of coloured bodies, too, the particles
forming their surfaces reflect white light like those
of all other bodies, so that these particles cannot
produce colour on the same principles as those of
thin plates. In many of those cases of colour which
seem to depend upon the minuteness of the particles
of the body, the reflection of white light may never
theless be observed, but this will be found to arise
from a thin transparent film, behind which the colo
rific particles are placed.
Whatever answer may be given to these objec
tions, we think it will be admitted by those who
92 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

have studied the subject most profoundly, that a
satisfactory theory of the colours of natural bodies
is still a desideratum in science. How far we may

be able to approach to it in the present state of

optics the reader will judge from the following
views.

   Colours may be arranged into seven classes, each

   3. Superficial colours, as those of mother-of-pearl

and striated surfaces.
   4. Opalescences and colours in composite crystals

having double refraction.
   5. Colours from the absorption of common and

polarized light by doubly refracting crystals.
   6. Colours at the surfaces of media of different

dispersive powers.
   7. Colours at the surface of media in which the

reflecting forces extend to different distances, or fol
low different laws.

   The first two of these classes are the most im
portant. The Newtonian theory appears to be
strictly applicable to the phenomena of the second
class ; but those of the first class cannot, we con

ceive, be referred to the same cause.

communicate to plants and flowers their peculiar
colours, and are in many cases necessary to the

development of their characteristic qualities. It is

impossible to admit for a moment that these varied
effects are produced by a mere mechanical action,
or that they arise from the agitation of the particles

of bodies by the vibration of the ether which is con

sidered to be the cause of light. Whatever be the
difficulties which attach to the theory which sup
poses light to consist of material particles, we are
compelled, by its properties, to admit that light acts

as if it were material, and that it enters into combi

nations with bodies, in order to produce the effects
which we have enumerated.

   When a beam of light falls upon a body, and the
whole or a part of that which enters its substance
totally disappears, we are entitled to say, that it is
detained by some power exercised by the particles
of the body over the particles of light. When this
light is said to be lost by a multitude of reflections
or refractions, the statement is not only hypotheti
cal, but it is an hypothesis incompatible with optical
principles. That the light detained within bodies
has been stopped by the attractive force of the par
ticles seems to be highly probable, and the mind
will not feel any repugnance to admit that the par
ticles of all bodies, whether solid, fluid, or aeriform,
have a specific affinity for the particles of light.
Considering light, therefore, as material, it is not
difficult to comprehend how it should, like other
elementary substances, enter into combination with
bodies, and produce many chymical and physical
effects, but particularly the phenomena of transpa
rency, opacity, and colour.

   In transparent colourless bodies, such as water

and glass, the intromitted light experiences a con
siderable loss, because a certain number of its par
ticles are attracted and detained by the atoms of the
water or glass, and the light which emerges is
94 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

colourless, because the particles exercise a propor
tional action over all the simple colours which
compose white light.
   When the transparent body has any decided

colour, such as those enumerated in Class I., then
the particles of the body have exercised a specific
attraction over those rays of white light which are
                            whIfichthecomtrapnosspeartehnet  colour

for example, is red, then its particles have detained
the green rays which entered into the incident light,
or certain other rays, which with the red are neces
sary to compose white light. In compound bodies,
like some of the artificial glasses, the particles will
attract and detain rays of light of different colours,
as may be seen by analyzing the transmitted light
with a prism, which will exhibit a spectrum deprived
of all the rays which have been detained. In black
bodies the particles exercise a powerful attraction
over light, and detain all the intromitted rays.
When coloured bodies are opaque, so as to ex
hibit their colours principally by reflection, the light
which is reflected back to the observer has received
its colour from transmission through part of the
thickness of the body, or, what is the same thing,
the colour reflected to the eye is complementary to
that which has been detained by the particles of the
body while the light is passing and repassing
through a thickness terminated by the reflecting
surfaces ; and as only a part of this light is reflected,
as in the case of leaves and flowers, the transmitted
light must have the same colour as the reflected
light.
When coloured bodies exhibit two different colours
complementary to each other, the one seen by re
flection and the other by transmission, it is then

highly probable that the colours are those of thin
plates, though there are still other optical principles

to which they may be referred. As the particles of

bodies, and the medium which unites them, or, as
the different atoms of a compound body may have
different dispersive powers, while they»exercise the
same refractive force over a particular part of the
spectrum, the rays for which this compensation

takes place will be transmitted, while part of the

complementary light is reflected.* Or in cases
where the refractive and dispersive powers are the
same, the reflective forces of the particles may vary
according to a different law, so that at the separat
ing surfaces either white or coloured light may be

the transmitted tints are not complementary, as in

                                            where  they are white and blue,
and in certain pieces of fir-wood, where the reflected
light is whitish yellow, and the transmitted light a
brilliant homogeneous red, we may explain the sepa
ration of the colours either by the principles we
have already laid down or by the doctrine of thin
plates. On the first principle, the colour of the re
flected light, which is supposed to be the same as

that of the transmitted light, will be modified by the
law according to which the particles of the body
attract different rays out of the beam of white light.
In pitch, for example, the blue rays are first ab
sorbed, so that at small thicknesses the transmitted

light is a fine yellow, while, by the action of a
greater thickness, the yellow itself is absorbed, and
the transmitted light is a bright homogeneous red.

Now in leaf-gold the transmitted colour of thinner

films than we can obtain may be yellow, and, con
sequently, the light reflected from the first strata of

interrupting faces will be yellow, and will determine

the predominant tint of the reflected light. On the
Newtonian doctrine, Mr. Herschel has explained it

* See the Phil. Tram. 1899, Fart I. p. 189.        1 Idem.
96 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

by saying, " that the transmitted rays have traversed
the whole thickness of the medium, and therefore
undergo many more times the action of its atoms
than those reflected, especially those near the first
surface to which the brighter part of the reflected
colour is due."
   The phenomena      of the  Iabsorption of common
and polarized light,  which
                                 have described in an
other place,* throw much light on the subject of
coloured bodies. The relation of the absorbent ac
tion to the axes of double refraction, and, conse
quently, to the poles of the molecules of the crystal,
shows how the particles of light attracted by the
molecules of the body will vary, both in their nature
and number, according to the direction in which
they approach the molecules ; and explains how the
colour of a body may be changed, either tempora
rily or permanently, by heat, according as it pro
duces a temporary or a permanent change in the
relative position of the molecules. This is not the
place to enlarge on this subject ; but we may be
permitted to apply the idea to the curious experi
ment of Thenard on phosphorus. When this sub

stance is rendered pure by repeated distillation, it
is transparent, and transmits yellow light ; but when
it is thrown in a melted state into cold water, it
becomes jet black. When again melted, it resumes
its original colour and transparency. According to
the Newtonian theory, we must suppose that the

easy to comprehend ; but, according to the pre
ceding views, we may suppose that the atoms of
the phosphorus have been forced by sudden cooling
into relative positions quite different from those
which they take when they slowly assume the solid
state, and their poles of maximum attraction, in

place of being turned to one another, are turned in
different directions, and then allowed to exercise
their full action in attracting the intromitted light,
and detaining it wholly within the body.*
Before concluding this chapter, there is one topic
peculiarly deserving our notice, namely, the change
of colour produced in bodies by continued exposure
to light. The general effect of light is to diminish
or dilute the colours of bodies, and in many cases
to deprive them entirely of their colour. Now, it
is not easy to understand how repeated undulations
propagated through a body could diminish the size
of its particles, or how the same effect could be
produced by a multitude of reflections from particle
to particle. But if light is attracted by the particles
of bodies, and combines with them, it is easy to
conceive that, when the molecules of a body have
combined with a great number of particles of a
green colour, for example, their power of combina
tion with others wiH *be diminished, and, conse
quently, the number of particles of any colour
absorbed or detained must diminish with the time
that the body has been exposed to light ; that is,
these particles must enter into the transmitted and

and transmits and reflects green, then if the quan
tity of absorbed red light is diminished, it will enter
into the reflected and transmitted pencils, and, form
ing white light by its mixture with a portion of the

green rays, will actually dilute them in the same
manner as if a portion of white light had been

added.f

Although the discoveries of Newton respecting
the Inflection of Light were first published in his
Optics in 1704, yet there is reason to think that
they were made at a much earlier period. Sir Isaac,
indeed, informs us, in his preface to that great work,
       t"hewtahsirdputbotookg,etwhehrichouct onotfaisncsatttehreesde
that                                                                  discove

interrupted, and cannot now think of taking these
things into consideration." On the 18th March, 1674,
Dr. Hooke had read a valuable memoir on the phe
nomena of diffraction; and, as Sir Isaac makes no
          whhisate"vescr atttoertehdis  work, it  is the more proba
allusion                                papers"   had been written
ble that
previous to the communication of Dr. Hooke's ex

periments.
The phenomena of the inflection of light were first
discovered by Francis Maria Grimaldi, a learned
Jesuit, who has described them in a posthumous
work published in 1665, two years after his death.*
   Having admitted a beam of the sun's light through

a small pin-hole in a piece of lead or card into a
dark chamber, he found that the light diverged from
this aperture in the form of a cone, and that the
shadows of all bodies placed in this light were not
only larger than might have been expected, but were
surrounded with three coloured fringes, the nearest
being the widest, and the most remote the narrowest.
In strong light he discovered analogous fringes
within the shadows of bodies, which increased in
number with the breadth of the body, and became
more distinct when the shadow was received obliquely
and at a greater distance. When two small aper
tures or pin-holes were placed so near each other
that the cones of light formed by each of them
intersected one another, Grimaldi observed, that a
spot common to the circumference of each, or, which
is the same thing, illuminated by rays from each
cone, was darker than the same spot when illumi
nated by either of the cones separately; and he an

may become more dark by adding a light to that which
it already receives."
Without knowing what had been done by the
Italian philosopher, our countryman, Dr. Robert
Hooke, had been diligently occupied with the same
subject. In 1672, he communicated his first obser
                 "RcooynatlaiSnoincigetyth, eanddischeovtehreynosfpoakeneowf
vations to  the
his paper   as
property of light not mentioned by any optical wri
ters before him." In his paper of 1674, already
mentioned, and which is no doubt the one to which
he alludes, he has not only described the leading
phenomena of the inflection, or the deflection of
light, as he calls it, but he has distinctly announced
the doctrine of interference, which has performed so
great a part in the subsequent history of optics.*

   * This donrme is thus announced. 1. That the same rays of light

Such was the state of the subject when Newton
directed to it his powers of acute and accurate ob
servation. His attention was turned only to the
enlargement of the shadow, and to the three fringes
which surrounded it ; and he begins his observations
by ascribing the discovery of these facts to Gri-
maldi. After taking exact measures of the diameter
of the shadow of a human hair, and of the breadth
of the fringes at different distances behind

discovered the remarkable fact that these diame
ters and breadths were not proportional to the dis
tances from the hair at which they were measured.
In order to explain these phenomena, Newton sup
posed that the rays which passed by the edge of the
hair are deflected or turned aside from as by
repulsive force, the nearest rays suffering the great
est, and those more remote less degree of deflec
tion.

when two pulses of light are blended so well and so near together that
the sense takes them for one.

   Thus, if X, fig. 10,  represents a section of the
hair, and AB, CD, EF,    XG,Ht,he&cr.ayraAysB                       at dif

deflected than CD, and   will cross it at m, the ray

CD will for the same     reason cross EF at n, and

EF will cross GH at o.    Hence the curve or caustic
formed by the intersections m, n, o, &c. will be con
vex outward,its curvature diminishing as it recedes
from the vertex. As none of the passing light can
possibly enter within this curve, it will form the
boundary of the shadow of X.
The explanation given by Sir Isaac of the coloured
fringes is less precise, and can be inferred only from
the two following queries.

   1. "Do not the rays which differ in refrangibility
differ also in flexibility, and are they not, by these
different inflections separated from one another, so
as after separation to make the colours in the three
fringes above described ? And after what manner
        th"eAyreinfnleocttetdhetoramyaskeofthliogshet

eel 1 And do not the three fringes of light above

mentioned arise from three such bendings F*
The idea thus indistinctly thrown out in the pre
ceding queries has been ingeniously interpreted by
Mr. Herschel in the manner represented in fig. 11,
where SS are two rays passing by the edge of the
body MN. These rays are supposed to undergo
several bendings, as at a, b, c, and the particles of
light are thrown off at one or other of the points
of contrary flexure, according to the state of their
fits or other circumstances. Those that are thrown
outwards in the direction aA, AB, cC, dD, will
produce as many caustics by their intersections as
there are deflected rays; and each caustic, when re
ceived on a screen at a distance, will depict on it
the brightest part or maximum of a fringe.

In this unsatisfactory state was the subject of the
inflection of light left by Sir Isaac. His inquiries
were interrupted, and never again renewed j and
           "hwimhseethlferfotuhnedhtahiar twtahse               were

important result does not seem to have shaken his
conviction, that the phenomena had their origin in
Ithe action of bodies upon light.

the inflection of light, the first in 1798, and the
second in 1812 and 1813, 1 was desirous of examin
Iing the influence of density and refractive power
over the fringes produced by inflection.                        com

examined the influence of platinum, diamond, and
cork in inflecting light, the effect of non-reflecting
grooves and spaces in polished metals, and of cylin
ders of glass immersed in a mixture of oil of cassia
and oil of olives of the same refractive power ; and,
as the fringes had the same magnitude and charac

ter under all these circumstances, I concluded that
they were not produced by any force inherent in
the bodies themselves, but arose from a property

of the light itself, which always showed itself when
light was stopped in its progress.
Dr. Thomas Young, who had supported with great
ingenuity and force of argument the undulatory
theory of light, as maintained by Hooke and Huy-
gens, was the first who gave a plausible explana
tion of the inflection of light. By interposing a
small screen at B, fig. 10, and intercepting the
rays that passed near the hair X, he was surprised
to find that all the fringes within the shadow disap
peared. The same effect took place when the screen
intercepted the rays on the other side ; and hence
he concluded, that the rays on each side of the hair
were necessary to the production of the inner fringes,
and that the fringes were produced by the inter
ference of the rays that passed  on   one side of     the
hair with those that passed on   the  other side.
                                                       In
order to account for the coloured fringes without the
shadow, Dr. Young conceived that the rays which
pass near the edge of the hair interfere with others,

similar to those actually observed.
In pursuing these researches so successfully begun
by Dr. Young, M. Fresnel had the good fortune to

explam all the phenomena of inflection by means of
the undulatory doctrine combined with the principle
of interference. In place of transmitting the light
through a small aperture, he caused it to diverge
from the focus of a deep convex lens, and instead
of receiving the shadow and its fringes upon a
smooth white surface, as was done by Newton, he
viewed them directly with his eye through a lens
placed behind the shadow ; and by means of a mi
croscope he was able to measure the dimensions of
the fringes with the greatest exactness. By this
mode of observation he made the remarkable dis
covery, that the inflection of the light depended on

the distance of the inflecting body from the aperture or
from the focus of divergence ;* the fringes being ob

served to dilate as the body approached that focus,
and to contract as it receded from their relative

the shadow continuing invariable. In attempting to
account for the formation of the exterior fringes, M.
Fresnel found necessary to reject the supposition
of Dr. Young, that they were owing to light re
flected from the edge of the body. He not only
ascertained that the real place of the fringe was the
jVirth of millimetre different from what should
be on that supposition, but he found that the fringes
preserved the same intensity of light, whether the
inflecting body had round or sharp edge, and
even when the edge was such as not to afford suffi
cient light for their production. From this difficulty
the undulatory theory speedily released him, and he
was led by its indications to consider the exterior

fringes, as produced by an infinite number of ele

 80 long resisted every effort to generalize them,
 having thus received so beautiful and satisfactory an
 explanation from the undulatory doctrine, they must
 of course be regarded as affording to that doctrine
 the most powerful support, while the Newtonian
 hypothesis of the materiality of light is proportion

 ally thrown into the shade. It is impossible, indeed,
 even for national partiality to consider the views of
 Newton as furnishing any explanation of the facts

 discovered by Fresnel ; and, as no attempt has been
 made by the small though able phalanx of his dis
 ciples to stay the decision with which, on this count
 at least, the doctrine of emission has been threat
 ened, we shall venture to suggest some principles
 by which the refractory phenomena may perhaps
be yet brought within the pale of the Newtonian
theory.

    That the particles of light, like those of heat,
are endowed with a repulsive force which prevents
them from accumulating when in a state of conden
sation, or when they are detained by the absorptive
action of opaque bodies, will be readily admitted.
By this power a beam of light radiating from a
luminous point has, in every azimuth, the same de
gree of intensity at the same distance from its centre

of divergence ; but if we intercept a portion of such

a beam by an opaque body, the repulsive force of the
light which formerly occupied its shadow is with
drawn, and consequently the rays which pass near
the body will be repelled into the shadow, and will
form, by their interference with those similarly re
pelled on the other side, the interior fringes, which
are parallel to the edges of the body. The rays
which pass at a greater distance will in like manner
be bent towards the body, but with less force, and,
interfering with those rays which retain their primi
tive direction, from the state of their fits or the
position of their poles, they will form the exterior
fringes. When the inflecting body is placed near
106 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

the point of divergence, the greater proximity of
the rays will produce a greater repulsive force, and
consequently a greater inflection of the passing

light ; while the removal of the body from the point
of divergence will be accompanied with an increased
distance of the particles, an inferior repulsive force,
and a feebler inflection. As the phenomena of in
flection, considered under this aspect, arise from a
property of the light itself, it follows that they will
remain invariable, whatever be the nature or den
sity of the body, or the form of the edge which
acts upon the passing rays.

   Before concluding our account of Newton's op
tical discoveries, it is necessary to notice some of
his minor researches, which, though of inferior im
portance in the science of light, have either exer
cised an influence over the progress of discovery,
or been associated with the history of other branches
of knowledge.

   One of the most curious of these inquiries related
to the connexion between the refractive powers and
the chymical composition of bodies. Having meas
ured the refractive powers and the densities of twenty-
two substances, he found that the forces which
reflect and refract light are very nearly proportional
to the densities of the same bodies. In this law,
however, he noticed a remarkable exception in the
case of unctuous and sulphureous bodies, such as
camphire, olive oil, linseed oil, spirit of turpentine,
DOUBLE REFRACTION OF LIGHT.  107

and diamond, which have their refractive powers
two or three times greater in respect of their densi
ties than the other substances in the table, while
among themselves their refractive powers are pro
portional to their densities, without any considerable

variation. Hence he concluded that diamond "is

an unctuous substance coagulated," -- a sagacious
prediction, which has been verified in the discoveries
of modern chymistry. The connexion between a
high degree of inflammability and a great refracting
force has been   sptoilwl emrowrehiscthroIngdleyteecstteadbliisnhepdhobsyphtohe

There is no part of the optical labours of Newton
which is less satisfactory than that which relates to
the double refraction of light. In 1690, Huygens,
his admirable treatise on light, in which
Euhebhliashsegdiven the law of double refraction in calca
reous spar, as deduced from his theory of light, and
as confirmed by direct experiment. Viewing it
probably as a theoretical deduction, Newton seems
to have regarded it as incorrect, and though he has
given Huygens the credit of describing the phe
nomena more exactly than Bartholinus, yet, without
assigning any reason, he rejected the law of the
Dutch philosopher, and substituted another in its
place. These observations of our author form the
subject of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth queries at
the end of his Optics, which was published fourteen
years after the appearance of Huygens's work. The
law adopted by Newton is not accompanied with any
of the experiments from which it was deduced ; and
though he has given it without expressing any doubt
of its accuracy, it is, nevertheless, entirely incom
patible with observation, and has been rejected by
all succeeding philosophers.

  In his speculations respecting the successive dis
appearance and reappearance of two of the four
108 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

 images which are formed when a luminous object
 is viewed through two rhombs of calcareous spar,
 one of which is made to revolve upon the other,
 Newton has been more successful. He concluded
 from these phenomena that every ray of light has
 two opposite sides originally endued with the prop
 erty on which the unusual refraction depends, and
 other two opposite sides not endued with that prop
 erty; and he suggested it as a subject for future
 inquiry, whether there are not more properties of
 light by which the sides of the rays differ, and are
 distinguished from one another. This is the first
 occasion on which the idea of a polarity in the rays
 of light has been suggested.*

    From the various optical inquiries in which New
 ton was engaged, he was strongly impressed with
 the belief that light consists of small material par
 ticles emitted from shining substances, and that
 these particles could be again recombined into solid
 matter, so that "gross bodies and light were con
vertible into one another." He conceived also that
the particles of solid bodies and of light exerted a
mutual action upon each other, the former being
agitated and heated by the latter, and the latter
being attracted and repelled by the former, with
forces depending on the inertia of the luminous par
ticles. These forces he regarded as insensible at
all measurable distances, and he conceived that the
distances between the particles of bodies were very
small when compared with the extent of their sphere
of attraction and repulsion.

   With the exception of Hooke, Huygens, and
Euler, almost all the contemporaries and successors
of Newton maintained the doctrine of the mate

riality of light. It was first successfully assailed by

Dr. Thomas Young, and since that time it has been
shaken to its foundation by those great discoveries

'which have illustrated the commencement of the
present century. The undulatory theory, which has
thus triumphed in its turn, is still subject to grave
difficulties, and we fear another century must elapse
before a final decision can be pronounced on this
long-agitated question.
The most important of the optical discoveries of
Newton, of which we have given a general history,
were communicated to the Royal Society in de
tached papers ; but the disputes in which they had
involved their author made him hesitate about the
publication of his other discoveries. Although he

   and heat of the summer and the autumnal sun.
   In the century which preceded the birth of New
   ton the science of astronomy advanced with the
   most rapid steps. Emerging from the darkness of
   the middle ages, the human mind seemed to rejoice
   in its new-born strength, and to apply itself with
   elastic vigour to unfold the mechanism of the heavens.
   The labours of Hipparchus and Ptolemy had indeed
   furnished many important epochs and supplied many
   valuable data ; but the cumbrous appendages of
   cycles and epicycles with which they explained the
   stations and retrogradations of the planets, and the
   vulgar prejudices which a false interpretation of
   Scripture had excited against a belief in the motion
   of the earth, rendered it difficult even for great
   minds to escape from the trammels of authority,
   and appeal to the simplicity of nature.

      The sovereign of Castile, the generous and noble-
   minded Alphonso, had long before proscribed the
   rude expedients of his predecessors ; and when he
   declared that if the heavens were thus constituted,
   he could have given the Deity good advice, he must
   not only have felt the   absurdity of            the prevailing
   system, but must have                            foresight of a
                           obtained some
   more simple arrangement. But neither he nor the
   astronomers whom he so liberally protected seem to
112 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

have established a better system, and it was left
to Copernicus to enjoy the dignity of being the
restorer of astronomy.

   This great man, a native of Thorn in Prussia, fol
lowing his father's profession, began his career as a
doctor of medicine, but an accidental attendance on
the mathematical lectures of Brudzevius excited a
love for astronomy, which became the leading pas
sion of his life. Quitting a profession uncongenial
to such pursuits, he went to Bologna to study
astronomy under Dominic Maria; and after having
enjoyed the friendship and instruction of that able
philosopher, he established himself at Rome in the
humble situation of a teacher of mathematics. Here
he made numerous astronomical observations which
served him as the basis of future researches ; but
an event soon occurred which, though it interrupted
for a while his important studies, placed him in a
situation for pursuing them with new zeal. The
death of one of the canons enabled his uncle, who
was Bishop of Ermeland, to appoint him to a can-
onry in the chapter of Frauenburg, where, in a
house situated on the brow of a mountain, he con
tinued, in peaceful seclusion, to carry on his astro
nomical observations. During his residence atRome
his talents had been so well appreciated, that the
Bishop of Fossombrona, who presided over the
council for reforming the calendar, solicited the aid
of Copernicus in this desirable undertaking. At first
he entered warmly into the views of the council,
and charged himself with the determination of the
length of the year and of the month, and of the
other motions of the sun and moon that seemed to
be required ; but he found the task too irksome, and
probably felt that it would interfere with those
interesting discoveries which had already begun to
dawn upon his mind.

   Copernicus is said to have commenced his inqui
ries by an historical examination of the opinions of
COPERNICUS.  113

ancient authors on the system of the universe ; but
it is more likely that he sought for the authority of
their great names to countenance his peculiar views,
and that he was more desirous to present his own
theory as one that he had received, rather than as
one which he had invented. His mind had been
long imbued with the idea that simplicity and har
mony should characterize the arrangements of the
planetary system, and, in the complication and dis
order which reigned in the hypothesis of Ptolemy,
he saw insuperable objections to its being regarded
as a representation of nature. In the opinions of
the Egyptian sages, in those of Pythagoras, Philo-
laus, Aristarchus, and Nicetas, he recognised his
own earliest conviction that the earth was not the
centre of the universe ; but he appears to have con
sidered it as still possible that our globe might per
form some function in the system more important
than that of the other planets; and his attention
was much occupied with the speculation of Martia-
nus Capella, who placed the sun between Mars and
the moon, and made Mercury and Venus revolve
round him as a centre; and with the system of
Apollonius Pergsus, who made all the planets re
volve round the sun, while the sun and moon were
carried round the earth in the centre of the universe.
The examination, however, of these hypotheses
gradually dispelled the difficulties with which the
subject was beset ; and after the labours of more
than thirty years, he was permitted to see the true
system of the heavens. The sun he considered as
immoveable in the centre of the system, while the
earth revolved between the orbits of Venus and
Mars, and produced by its rotation about its axis all
the diurnal phenomena of the celestial sphere. The
precession of the equinoxes was thus referred to a
slight motion of the earth's axis, and the stations
and retrogradations of the planets were the neces

sary consequence of theKir2own motions combined
114 sin ISAAC NEWTON.

with that of the earth about the sun. These re
markable views were supported by numerous as

tronomical observations ; and in 1530 Copernicus
brought to a close his immortal work on the Revolu
tions of the Heavenly Bodies.
But while we admire the genius which triumphed
over so many difficulties, we cannot fail to commend
the extraordinary prudence with which he ushered
his new system into the world. Aware of the preju
dices, and even of the hostility with which such a
system would be received, he resolved neither to
startle the one nor provoke the other. He allowed
his opinions to circulate in the slow current of per
sonal communication. The points of opposition
which they presented to established doctrines were
gradually worn down, and they insinuated them
selves into reception among the ecclesiastical circles
by the very reluctance of their author to bring them
into notice. In the year 1534, Cardinal Schonberg,
Bishop of Capua, and Gyse, Bishop of Culm, exerted
all their influence to induce Copernicus to lay his
system before the world ; but he resisted their so
licitations ; and it was not till 1539 that an accidental
circumstance contributed to alter his resolution.
George Rheticus, professor of mathematics at Wir-
temberg, having heard of the labours of Copernicus,
resigned his chair, and repaired to Frauenberg to
make himself master of his discoveries. This zeal
ous disciple prevailed upon his master to permit the
publication of his system ; and they seem to have
arranged a plan for giving it to the world without
alarming the vigilance of the church, or startling
the prejudices of individuals.    Under the disguise
of a student of mathematics,    Rheticus published in
1540 an account of the manuscript volume of Coper
nicus. This pamphlet was received without any
disapprobation, and its author was encouraged to
reprint it at Basle, in 1541, with his own name.
The success of these publications, and the flattering

manner in which the new astronomy was received
by several able writers, induced Copernicus to place

his MSS. in the hands of Rheticus. It was accord
ingly printed at the expense of Cardinal Schon-
berg, and appeared at Nuremberg in 1543. Its illus

trious author, however, did not live to peruse it.

A complete copy was handed to him in his last

moments, and he saw and touched it a few hours
before his death. This great work was dedicated

to the Holy Pontiff, in order, as Copernicus himself
says, that the authority of the head of the church
might silence the calumnies of individuals who had

attacked his views by arguments drawn from reli
gion. Thus introduced, the Copernican system met
with no ecclesiastical opposition, and gradually made
its way in spite of the ignorance and prejudices

of the age.

   Among the astronomers who provided the mate
rials of the Newtonian philosophy the name of
Tycho Brahe merits a conspicuous place. De
scended from an ancient Swedish family, he was
born at Knudstorp, in Norway, in 1546, three years
after the death of Copernicus. The great eclipse
of the sun which happened on the 26th August,
1560, while he was at the University of Copenhagen,
attracted his notice : and when he found that all
its phenomena had been accurately predicted, he
was seized with the most irresistible passion to ac
quire the knowledge of a science so infallible in its
results. Destined for the profession of the law, his
friends discouraged the pursuit which now engrossed
his thoughts; and such were the reproaches and
even persecutions to which he was exposed, that he
quitted his country with the design of travelling

through Germany. At the very commencement of

his journey, however, an event occurred in which
the impetuosity of his temper had nearly cost him
his life. At a wedding-feast in Rostock, a question

with a Danish nobleman of the same temperament
with himself; and the two mathematicians resolved
to settle the difference by the sword. Tycho,
however, seems to have been second in the conflict,
for he lost the greater part of his nose, and was
obliged to supply its place by a substitute of gold
and silver, which a cement of glue attached to his
face. During his stay at Augsburg he inspired the
burgomaster of the city, Peter Hainzell, with a love
of astronomy. This public-spirited citizen erected
an excellent observatory at his own expense, and
here Tycho began that distinguished career which
has placed him in the first rank of practical as
tronomers.

    Upon his return to Copenhagen in 1570, he was
received with every mark of respect. The king in
vited him to court, and persons of all ranks harassed
him with their attentions. At Herritzvold, near his
native place, the house of his maternal uncle afforded
him a retreat from the gayeties of the capital, and
he was there offered every accommodation for the
prosecution of his astronomical studies. Here,

however, the passion of love and the pursuits of

alchymy distracted his thoughts ; but though the

peasant girl of whom he was enamoured was of

easier attainment than the philosopher's stone, the
marriage produced an open quarrel with his relations,
which it required the interference of the king to allay.

In the tranquillity of domestic happiness, Tycho re
sumed his study of the heavens, and in 1572 he
enjoyed the singular good fortune of observing,

through all its variations, the new star in Cassiopeia,
which appeared with such extraordinary splendour
as to be visible in the daytime, and which gradually
disappeared in the following year.

   Dissatisfied with his residence in Denmark, Tycho
resolved to settle in some distant country ; and hav
ing gone as far as Venice in search of a suitable
residence, he at last fixed upon Basle, in Switzer

land. The King of Denmark, however, had learned
his intention from the Prince of Hesse ; and when
Tycho returned to Copenhagen to remove his family
and his instruments, his sovereign announced to him
his resolution to detain him in his kingdom. He
presented him with the canonry of Roschild, with
an income of 2000 crowns per annum. To this he
added a pension of 1000 crowns ; and he promised
to give him the island of Huen, with a complete
observatory erected under his own eye. This gene
rous offer was instantly accepted. The celebrated
observatory of Uraniburg was established at the
expense of about 20,000/. ; and in this magnificent
retreat Tycho continued for twenty-one years to en
rich astronomy with the most valuable observations.
Admiring disciples crowded to this sanctuary of the
sciences to acquire the knowledge of the heavens ;
and kings* and princes felt themselves honoured
by becoming the guests of the great astronomer of
the age.

   One of the principal discoveries of Tycho was
that of the inequality of the moon's motion, called
the variation. He detected, also, the annual equa
tion which affects the place of her apogee and nodes,
and he determined the greatest and the least inclina
tion of the lunar orbit. His observations on the

planets were numerous and precise, and have formed

the data of the present generalizations in astronomy.

* When James I. went to Copenhagen in 1590, to conclude hie mar
riage with the Princess Anne of Denmark, he spent eight days under
the roof of Tycho at Uraniburg. As a token of his gratitude, he com
posed a set of Latin verses in honour of the astronomer, and left him a
magnificent present at hisdeparture. He gave him also his royal license
for the publication of his works in      --England, and accompanied it with
      following  complimentary letter :
the"  Nor am 1   acquainted with these   bthuitnIgshaovne  the relation   of others, or

118 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

Though thus skilful in the observation of phenomena,
his mind was but little suited to investigate their
cause, and it was probably owing to this defect that
he rejected the system of Copernicus. The vanity
of giving his own name to another system was not
likely to actuate a mind such as his, and it was more
probable that he was led to adopt the immobility of
the earth, and to make the sun, with all his attendant
                               it,

planets, circulate round from the great difficulty
which still presented itself by comparing the apparent
diameter of the stars with the annual parallax of the

earth's orbit.
The death of Frederick in 1588 proved severe
calamity to Tycho, and to the science which he cul
tivated. During the first years of the minority of
Christian IV. the regency continued the royal patron
age to the observatory of Uraniburg; and in 1592
the young king paid visit of some days to Tycho,
and left him gold chain in token of his favour.
The astronomer, however, had made himself enemies

probably added fresh malignity to the irritation of
personal feelings. Under the ministry of Wolchen-

his wife and children, to seek an asylum in foreign
land. His friend, Henry Rantzau, of Wansbeck,

fortunately acquainted with       hospitable
                               the emperor         Rodolph II.,
who, to his love of science, added passion for
alchymy and astrology. The reputation of Tycho
having already reached the imperial ear, the recom
mendation of Rantzau was scarcely necessary to en
sure him his warmest friendship. Invited by the em
peror, he repaired in 1599 to Prague, where he met

with the kindest reception. A pension of three

thousand crowns was immediately settled upon him,
and commodious observatory erected for his use

In the vicinity of that city. Here the exiled astrono
mer renewed with delight his interrupted labours,
and the gratitude which he cherished for the royal
favour increased the satisfaction which he felt in
having so unexpectedly found a resting-place for
approaching age. These prospects of better days
were enhanced by the good fortune of receiving two
such men as Kepler and Longomontanus for his
pupils ; but the fallacy of human anticipation was
here, as in so many other cases, strikingly displayed.
Tycho was not aware of the inroads which both his
labours and his disappointments had made upon his
constitution. Though surrounded with affectionate
friends and admiring disciples, he was still an exile
in a foreign land. Though his country had been
bloavseed,in--itthseingsrcaetinteudeo, f  it was yet the  laafnfedctwiohni,c--h thhee
                                           his earliest
theatre of his scientific glory. These feelings con
tinually preyed upon his mind, and his unsettled
spirit was ever hovering among his native mountains.
In this condition he was attacked with a disease of
the most painful kind, and though the paroxysms of
its agonies had lengthened intermissions, yet he saw
that death was approaching. He implored his pupils
to persevere in their scientific labours. He conversed
with Kepler on some of the profoundest points of
astronomy, and with these secular occupations he

mingled frequent acts of piety and devotion. In
this happy condition he expired without pain at the
age of fifty-five, the unquestionable victim of the

councils of Christian IV.
Notwithstanding the accessions which astronomy
had received from the labours of Copernicus and
Tycho, no progress was yet made in developing
the general laws of the system, and scarcely an idea
had been formed of the power by which the planets
were retained in their orbits. The labours of as
siduous observers had supplied the materials for this
120 sir Isaac nEwton.

purpose, and Kepler arose to lay the foundations of

physical astronomy.
John Kepler was born at Wiel, in Wirtemberg, in
1571. He was educated for the church, and dis
charged even some of the clerical functions; but his
devotion to science withdrew him from the study of

theology. Having received mathematical instruc
tion from the celebrated Msstlinus, he had made
such progress in the science, that he was invited in
1594 to fill the mathematical chair of Gratz in Sty-
ria. Endowed with a fertile imagination, his mind
was ever intent upon subtle and ingenious specula

tions. In the year 1596 he published his peculiar
views in a work on the Harmonies and Analogies of
Nature. In this singular production, he attempts to
solve what he calls the great cosmographical mys
tery of the admirable proportion of the planetary
orbits ; and by means of the six regular geometrical
solids,* he endeavours to assign a reason why there
are six planets, and why the dimensions of their
orbits and the time of their periodical revolutions
Ifwere such as Copernicus had found them.
                                                       a
cube, for example, were inserted in a sphere, of which
Saturn's orbit was one of the great circles, it would,
he supposed, touch by its six planes the lesser
sphere of Jupiter ; and, in like manner, he proposes
to determine, by the aid of the other geometrical
solids, the magnitude of the spheres of the other
planets. A copy of this work was presented by its
author to Tycho Brahe, who had been too long
versed in the severe realities of observation to at

things ;" and there is reason to think that, by the aid
of the whole Baconian philosophy, thus compressed

by anticipation into a single sentence, he abandoned
for a while his visionary inquiries.
    In the year 1598 Kepler suffered persecution for
his religious principles, and was compelled to quit
Gratz ; but though he was recalled by the States of
Styria, he felt his situation insecure, and accepted of
a pressing invitation from Tycho to settle at Prague,
and assist him in his calculations. Having arrived
in Bohemia in 1600, he was introduced by his friends
to the Emperor Rodolph, from whom he ever after

tinued during the successive reigns of Matthias and
Ferdinand; but what was of more importance to
science, he was put in possession of the valuable
collection of Tycho's observations. These obser
vations were remarkably numerous ; and as the orbit
of Mars was more oval than that of any of the other
planets, they were peculiarly suitable for determin
ing its real form. The notions of harmony and
symmetry in the construction of the solar system,
which had filled the mind of Kepler, necessarily led
him to believe that the planets revolved with a uni
form motion in circular orbits. So firm, indeed, was
this conviction, that he made numerous attempts to
represent the observations of Tycho by this hy
pothesis. The deviations were too great to be as
cribed to errors of observation ; and in trying various
other curves, he was led to the discovery that Mars
revolved round the sun in an elliptical orbit, in one
of the foci of which the sun itself was placed. The
same observations enabled him to determine the
dimensions of the planet's orbit, and by comparing
together the times in which Mars passed over
different portions of its orbit, he found that they
were to one another as the areas described by the
lines drawn from the centre of the planet to the
centre of the sun, or, in more technical terms, that

the radius vector describes equal areas in equal
times. These two remarkable discoveries, the first
that were ever made in physical astronomy, were
extended to all the other planets of the system, and

as deduced from the observations of Tycho Brahe."
Although our author was conducted to these great
laws by the patient examination of well-established
facts, his imagination was ever hurrying him among
the wilds of conjecture. Convinced that the mean
distances of the planets from the sun bore to one
another some mysterious relation, he not only com
pared them with the regular geometrical solids, but
also with the intervals of musical tones ; an idea
which the ancient Pythagoreans had suggested, and
which had been adopted by Archimedes himself.

All these comparisons were fruitless ; and Kepler
was about to abandon an inquiry of about seventeen
years' duration, when, on the 8th March, 1618, he
conceived the idea of comparing the powers of the
different members which express the planetary dis
tances, in place of the numbers themselves. He
compared the squares and the cubes of the distances
with the same powers of the periodic times ; nay, he
tried even the squares of the times with the cubes
of the distances ; but his hurry and impatience led
him into an error of calculation, and he rejected this
law as having no existence in nature ! On the 15th
May, his mind again reverted to the same notion,
and upon making the calculations anew, and free from
error,  he discovered            the  great law, that the squares
of the  periodic times                any two planets are to one
                                 of
another as the cubes of their distances from the sun.
Enchanted with this unexpected result, he could
scarcely trust his calculations ; and, to use his own
language, he at first believed that he was dreaming,
and had taken for granted the very truth of which
he was in search. This brilliant discovery was pub-

relations between the squares of the periodic times
and the cubes of the distances.

   The relation of the movements of the planets to
the sun, as the general centre of all their orbits,
could not fail to suggest to Kepler that some power
resided in that luminary by which these various mo
tions were produced ; and he went so far as to con
jecture that this power diminishes as the square of
the distance of the body on which it was exerted ;
but he immediately rejects this law, and prefers that
of the simple distances. In his work on Mars, he
speaks of gravity as a mutual and corporeal affec
tion between similar bodies. He maintained that
the tides were occasioned by the moon's attraction,
and that the irregularities of the lunar motions, as
detected by Tycho, were owing to the joint actions
of the sun and the earth ; but the relation between
gravity, as exhibited on the earth's surface, and as
conducting the planets in their orbits, required
more patience of thought than he could command,
and was accordingly left for the exercise of higher

powers.
   The misery in which Kepler lived forms a painful

contrast with the services which he performed to
science. The pension on which he subsisted was
always in arrears, and though the three emperors
whose reigns he adorned directed their ministers
to be more punctual in its payment, the disobe
dience of their commands was a source of continued
vexation to Kepler. When he retired to Sagan, in
Silesia, to spend in retirement the remainder of his
days, his pecuniary difficulties became still more
harassing. Necessity at last compelled him to apply
124  SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

personally for the arrears which were due ; and he
accordingly set out in 1630 for Ratisbon; but in
consequence of the great fatigue which so long a
journey on horseback produced, he was seized with
a fever, which carried him off on the 30th Novem
ber, 1630, in the 59th year of his age.

   While Kepler was thus laying the foundation of
physical astronomy, Galileo was busily employed in
extending the boundaries of the solar system. This
distinguished philosopher was born at Pisa in 1564.
He was the son of a Florentine nobleman, and was
educated for the medical profession ; but a passion
for geometry took possession of his mind, and called
forth all his powers. Without the aid of a master,
he studied the writings of Euclid and of Archimedes';
and such were his acquirements, that he was ap
pointed by the Grand-duke of Tuscany to the mathe
matical chair of Pisa in the twenty-fifth year of his
age. His opposition to the Aristotelian philosophy
gained him many enemies, and at the end of three
years he quitted Pisa, and accepted of an invitation
to the professorship of mathematics at Padua. Here
he continued for eighteen years adorning the uni
versity by his name, and diffusing around him a
taste for the physical sciences. With the excep
tion of some contrivances of inferior importance,
Galileo had distinguished himself by no discovery
till he had reached the forty-fifth year of his age.

In the year 1609, the same year in which Kepler

published his celebrated commentary on Mars, Gali
leo paid a visit to Venice, where he heard, in the
course of conversation, that a Dutchman of the
name of Jansens had constructed and presented to
Prince Maurice an instrument through which he saw
distant objects magnified and rendered more distinct,

as if they had been brought nearer to the observer.
This report was credited by some and disbelieved
by others ; but, in the course of a few days, Galileo

received a letter from James Badovere at Paris,
                           GALILEO.                          125

which placed beyond a doubt the existence of such
an instrument. The idea instantly filled his mind
as one of the utmost importance to science ; and so

toohffoirlteosnuscgeohsn,lsyttrhwuacattsihoehne,nobatuctoquwnalayisntdeaisdbcleowvteiotrhecdotmhtephleepterporpianecrteitpileeles

scope for his own use. Into one end of a leaden
tube he fitted a spectacle-glass plane on one side
and convex on the other, and in the other end he
placed another spectacle-glass concave on one side
and plane on the other. He then applied his eye
to the concave glass, and saw objects "pretty large
and pretty near him." They appeared three times
nearer, and nine times larger in surface, than to the
naked eye. He soon after made another, which

represented objects above sixty times larger ; and,
sparing neither labour nor expense, he finally con

structed an instrument so excellent, as "to show
things almost a thousand times larger, and above
thirty times nearer to the naked eye."
There is, perhaps, no invention that science has
presented to man so extraordinary in its nature, and
so boundless in its influence, as that of the tele

scope. To the uninstructed mind, the power of
seeing an object a thousand     miles distant, as large

and nearly as distinct as if    it were brought within
a mile of the observer, must seem almost miracu
lous ; and to the philosopher, even, who thoroughly
comprehends the principles upon which it acts, it
must ever appear one of the most elegant applica
tions of science. To have been the first astronomer
in whose hands such a gift was placed was a prefer
ence to which Galileo owed much of his future

reputation.
No sooner had he completed his telescope than
he applied it to the heavens, and on the 7th Janu
ary, 1618, the first day of its use, he saw round
Jupiter three bright little stars lying in a line par
                ecliptic,  two  to the  east,  and  one  to  the
allel  to  the

126 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

west of the planet. Regarding them as ordinary
stars, he never thought of estimating their distances.
On the following day, when he accidentally directed
his telescope to Jupiter, he was surprised to see
the three stars to the west of the planet. To pro
duce this effect it was requisite that the motion of
Jupiter should be direct, though, according to calcu
lation, it was actually retrograde. In this dilemma
he waited with impatience for the evening of the
9th, but unfortunately the sky was covered with
eclaosutd--s.a    On the 10th   he saw only two      stars to the
                circumstance    which he was no      longer able
to explain by the motion of Jupiter. He was there
fore compelled to ascribe the change to the stars
themselves ; and upon repeating his observations
on the 11th, he no longer doubted that he had dis
covered three planets revolving round Jupiter. On
the 13th January he for the first time saw the
fourth satellite.*
This discovery, though of the utmost importance
in itself, derived an additional value from the light
which it threw on the true system of the universe.
While the earth was the only planet enlightened
by a moon, it might naturally be supposed that it
alone was habitable, and was therefore entitled to
the pre-eminence of occupying the centre of the
system ; but the discovery of four moons round a
much larger planet deprived this argument of its
force, and created a new analogy between the earth
                                         When Kepler received the
"anSdidtehreeaolthMerespsleannegtesr.,"  the work in which Galileo
announced his discovery in 1610, he perused it with
the deepest interest ; and while it confirmed and
extended his substantial discoveries, it dispelled at
the same time some of those harmonic dreams which
still hovered among his thoughts. In the "Dis-

                           his
had been written on the subject of telescopes by
Baptista Porta, they had not been earlier introduced
into observatories.
In continuing his observations, Galileo applied
his telescope to Venus, and in 1610 he discovered
the phases of that planet, which exhibited to him
the various forms of the waxing and the waning
moon. This fact established beyond a doubt that
the planet revolved round the sun, and thus gave

an additional blow to the Ptolemaic system. In his
observations on the sun, Galileo discovered his spots,
and deduced from them the rotation of the central
luminary. He observed that the body of Saturn
had handles attached to it ; but he was unable to
detect the form of its ring, or render visible its
minute satellites. On the surface of the moon he

discovered her mountains and valleys, and deter
mined the curious fact of her'libration, in virtue of
which parts of the margin of her disk occasionally
appear and disappear. In the Milky Way he de
scried numerous minute stars which the unassisted
eye was unable to perceive ; and as the largest fixed
stars, in place of being magnified by the telescope,
became actually minute brilliant points, he inferred
their immense distance as rendered necessary by the

Copernican hypothesis. All his discoveries, indeed,

furnished fresh arguments in favour of the new
system ; and the order of the planets and their re
lation to a central sun may now be considered as
established by incontrovertible evidence.

taken the disposition of his species, and the charac

which had been discovered by the humble eccle
siastic of Frauenberg, which had been patronised by
the kindness of a bishop, and published at the ex
pense of a cardinal, and which the pope himself
had sanctioned by the warmest reception, was, after
the lapse of a hundred years, doomed to the most
violent opposition, as subversive of the doctrines
of the Christian faith. On no former occasion has

unfurled her banner of persecution against the pride
of Italy, against the ornament of his species, and
against truths immutable and eternal.

  In consequence of complaints laid before the Holy
Inquisition, Galileo was summoned to appear at
Rome in 1615, to answer for the heretical opinions
"whmicahinthaeinihnagd    promulgated.     He                   was charged with

same doctrine
over with a false interpretation the passages of
Scripture which were urged against it." The con
sideration of these charges came before a meeting
of the Inquisition, which assembled on the 25th
February, 1616 ; and the court, declaring their dis
          to deal gently with            prisoner, pro
position  the following decree  :t--he"  That Cardinal
nounced
Bellarmine should enjoin Galileo to renounce en
tirely the above-recited false opinions ; that, on his
refusal to do so, he should be commanded by the
commissary of the Inquisition to abandon the said
doctrine, and to cease to teach and defend it ; and

that, if he did not obey this command, he should
be thrown into prison." On the 26th of February
Galileo appeared before Cardinal Bellarmine, and,

after receiving from him a gentle admonition, he
was commanded by the commissary, in the presence
of a notary and witnesses, to desist altogether from
his erroneous opinions ; and it was declared to be
unlawful for him in future to teach them in any
way whatever, either orally or in his writings. To
these commands Galileo promised obedience, and
was dismissed from the Inquisition.
The mildness of this sentence was no doubt partly
owing to the influence of the Grand-duke of Tus
cany, and other persons of rank and influence at the
papal court, who took a deep interest in the issue
of the trial. Dreading, however, that so slight a
punishment might not have the effect of putting
down the obnoxious doctrines, the Inquisition issued
a decree denouncing the new opinions as false and

contrary to the sacred writings, and prohibiting the
6ale of every book in which they should be main

tained.
   Thus liberated from his persecutors, Galileo re
turned to Florence, where he pursued his studies
with his wonted diligence and ardour. The recanta
tion of his astronomical opinions was so formal
and unreserved, that ordinary prudence, if not a
sense of personal honour, should have restrained him
from unnecessarily bringing them before the world.
No anathema was pronounced against his scientific
discoveries ; no interdict was laid upon the free
exercise of his genius. He was prohibited merely
from teaching a doctrine which the church of Rome
considered to be injurious to its faith. We might
have expected, therefore, that a philosopher so con
spicuous in the eyes of the world would have re
spected the prejudices, however base, of an institu
tion whose decrees formed part of the law of the
land, and which possessed the power of life and
death within the limits of its jurisdiction. Galileo,
however, thought otherwise. A sense of degrada
tion* seems to have urged him to retaliate, and before

Ptolemy with much skill against the overwhelming
arguments of the rival disputants. Galileo hoped to
escape notice by this indirect mode of propagating
the new system, and he obtained permission to pub

lish his work, which appeared at Florence in 1632.

   The Inquisition did not, as might have been ex
pected, immediately summon Galileo to their pres
ence. Nearly a year elapsed before they gave any
indication of their design ; and, according to their
own statement, they did not even take the subject
under consideration till they saw that the obnoxious
tenets were every day gaining ground, in conse
quence of the publication of the Dialogues. They
then submitted the work to a careful examination,
and having found it to be a direct violation of the
injunction which had been formerly intimated to its
author, they again cited him before their tribunal in
1633. The venerable sage, now in his seventieth
year, was thus compelled to repair to Rome, and
when he arrived he was committed to the apart
ments of the Fiscal of the Inquisition. The un
changeable friendship, however, of the Grand-duke
of Tuscany obtained a remission of this severity,
and Galileo was allowed to reside at the house of
the Tuscan ambassador during the two months
which the trial occupied. When brought before
the Inquisition, and examined upon oath, he ac
knowledged that the Dialogues were written by him
self, and that he obtained permission to publish them
without notifying to the person who gave it that he
had been prohibited from holding, defending, or
teaching the heretical opinions. He confessed also
that the Dialogues were composed in such a manner,
that the arguments in favour of the Copernican sys
tem, though given as partly false, were yet managed
in such a manner that they were more likely to con
firm than overturn its doctrines ; but that this error,
which was not intentional, arose from the natural
desire of making an ingenious defence of false propo
132 SIR I8AAC NEWTON.

sitions, and of opinions that had the semblance of

probability.

   After receiving these confessions and excuses, the
Inquisition allowed Galileo a proper time for giving
in his defence ; but this seems to have consisted
solely in bringing forward the certificate of Cardinal
Bellarmine already mentioned, which made no allu
sion to the promise under which Galileo had come
never to defend, nor teach in anyway whatever, the
Copernican doctrines. The court held this defence
to be an aggravation of the crime rather than an
excuse for it, and proceeded to pronounce a sentence

which will be ever memorable in the history of the

human mind.

   Invoking the name of our Saviour, they declare,
that Galileo had made himself liable to the suspicion
of heresy, by believing the doctrine, contrary to
Scripture, that the sun was the centre of the earth's
orbit, and did not move from east to west ; and by
defending as probable the opinion that the earth
moved, and was not the centre of the world; and
that he had thus incurred all the censures and penal

penalties, provided he sincerely abjured and cursed
all the errors and heresies contained in the formula
of the church, which should be submitted to him.
That so grave and pernicious a crime should not
pass altogether unpunished, that he might become
more cautious in future, and might be an example
to others to abstain from such offences, they decreed

the three following years, he should recite once a
week the seven penitential psalms.

   This sentence was subscribed by seven cardinals ;
and on the 22d June, 1633, Galileo signed an abjura

phy. At the age of seventy, on his bended knees,
and with his right hand resting on the Holy Evan
gelists, did this patriarch of science avow his present
and his past belief in all the dogmas of the Romish
Church, abandon as false and heretical the doctrine
of the earth's motion and of the sun's immobility,

and pledge himself to denounce to the Inquisition
any other person who was even suspected of heresy.
He abjured, cursed, and detested those eternal and
immutable truths which the Almighty had permitted
him to be the first to establish. What a mortifying

Ifpicture of moral depravity and intellectual weakness !

    the unholy zeal of the assembly of cardinals has
been branded with infamy, what must we think of
the venerable sage whose gray hairs were entwined
with the chaplet of immortality, quailing under the
fear of man, and sacrificing the convictions of his
conscience and the deductions of his reason at the
altar of a base superstition ? Had Galileo but added
esthayegee,rc--oouuhnraadgdethheeofccaitrhrcrelieedmoafthrtheyirsgljtauondcgtehees,o--fwihhsaidsdomihnedioglfnifattenhtde
his hands to heaven, and called the living God to
witness the truth and immutability of his opinions,
the bigotry of his enemies would have been dis
armed, and science would have enjoyed a memorable
triumph.

   The great truths of the Copernican system, instead
of being considered as heretical, had been actually
adopted by many pious members of the Catholic
church, and even some of its dignitaries did not
scruple to defend it openly. Previous to the first
persecution of Galileo in 1615, a Neapolitan noble
man, Vincenzio Caraffa, a person equally distin
guished by his piety and birth, had solicited Paul
Anthony Foscarinus, a learned Carmelite monk, to
illustrate and defend the new system of the universe.
With this request the ecclesiastic speedily complied ;
and in the pamphlet which he completed on the 6th

January, 1615, he defends the Copernican system
with much boldness and ingenuity; he reconciles
the various passages of Scripture with the new doc
trine, and he expresses the hope that such an attempt,
now made for the first time, will prove agreeable to
philosophers, but particularly to those very learned
men, Galileo Galilei, John Kepler, and all the mem
bers of the Lyncean Academy, who, he believes,
entertain the same opinion. This remarkable pro
duction, written from the convent of the Carmelites
at Naples, is dedicated to the very Reverend Sebas
tian Fantoni, general of the order of Carmelites, and
was published at Florence, with the sanction of the
ecclesiastical authorities, in 1630 ; three years before
the second persecution of Galileo.
   It would be interesting to know the state of public
feeling in Italy when Galileo was doomed to the
prisons of the Inquisition. No appeal seems to have
been made against so cruel a sentence ; and neither
in remonstrance nor in derision does an individual
voice seem to have been raised. The master spirits
of the age looked with sullen indifference on the
persecution of exalted genius ; and Galileo lay in
chains, deserted and unpitied. This unrebuked tri
umph of his enemies was perhaps favourable to the
object of their vengeance. Resistance might have
heightened the rigour of a sentence, which submis
sion seems to have alleviated. The interference
of some eminent individuals of Rome, among whom
we have  no doubt that the Grand-duke    UorfbaTnusVcIaIIn.y,
was the  most influential, induced Pope
not only to shorten the period, but to soften the
rigour of Galileo's imprisonment. From the dun
geon of the Inquisition, where he had remained only
foui days, he was transported to the ambassador's
palace in the Garden de Medici at Rome ; and when
his health had begun to suffer, he was permitted to
leave the metropolis ; and would have been allowed
to return to Florence, but as the plague raged in
            GALILEO.                135

that city, he was sent, in July, 1633, to the archi-
episcopal palace of Sienna, the residence of the Arch
bishop Piccolimini, where he carried on and com
pleted his valuable investigations respecting the
resistance of solids. Here he continued five months,
when, in consequence of the disappearance of the
plague at Florence, he was allowed to retire to his
villa at Bellosguardo, and afterward to that of Ar-
cetri in the vicinity of Florence.
Though Galileo was now, to a certain degree,
liberated from the power of man, yet the afflicting
dispensations of Providence began to fall thickly
around him. No sooner had he returned to Arcetri,
than his favourite daughter, Maria, was seized with
a dangerous illness, which soon terminated in her
death. He was himself attacked with hernia, pal
pitation of the heart, loss of appetite, and the most
            melancholy    F; loarenndcethfoourgmh edhiecalsoaliscsitisetd

ance, yet this deed of mercy was denied him. In
1638, however, the pope permitted him to pay a visit
to Florence, and his friend, Father Castelli, was
allowed to visit him in the company of an officer of
the Inquisition. But this indulgence was soon with
drawn, and at the end of a few months he was re
manded to Arcetri. The sight of his right eye had
begun to fail in 1636, from an opacity of the cornea.
In 1637 his left eye was attacked with the same
complaint ; so that in a few months he was affected
with total and incurable blindness. Before this ca
lamity had supervened, he had noticed the curious
phenomenon of the moon's libration, in consequence
of which, parts of her visible disk that are exposed
to view at one time are withdrawn at another. He
succeeded in explaining two of the causes of this
curious phenomenon, viz. the different distances of
the observer from the line joining the centre of the
earth and the moon, which produces the diurnal
libration, and the unequal motion of the moon in her
136              SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

orbit, which produces the libration in longitude. It
was left, however, to Hevelius to discover the libra
tion in latitude, which arises from the inclination of
her axis being a little less than a right angle to the
ecliptic ; and to Lagrange to discover the spheroidal

libration, or that which arises from the action of the
earth upon the lunar spheroid.
The sorrows with which Galileo was now beset,
seemed to have disarmed the severity of the Inqui
sition. He was freely permitted to enjoy the society
of his friends,  who now thronged     around him to
express their    respect and their
                                    sympathy. The
Grand-duke of Tuscany was his frequent visiter,
and Gassendi, Deodati, and our countryman Milton
went to Italy for the purpose of visiting him. He
entertained his friends with the warmest hospitality,
and though simple and abstemious in his diet, yet he
was fond of good wine, and seems even in his last
days to have paid particular attention to the excel
lence of his cellar.
Although Galileo had nearly lost his hearing as
well as his sight, yet his intellectual faculties were
unimpaired ; and while his mind was occupied in
considering the force of percussion, he was seized
with fever and palpitation of the heart, which, after
two months' illness, terminated his life on the 8th
of January, 1642.
   Among the predecessors of Newton in astro
nomical research we must not omit the names of
Bouillaud (Bullialdus), Borelli, and Dr. Hooke.
Ismael Bouillaud, a native of Laon in France, and

  the author of several valuable astronomical works,
has derived more reputation from a single sentence
in his Astronomica Philolaica, published in 1645, than
from all the rest of his labours. He was not a be
liever in the doctrine of attraction, which, as we
have already seen, had been broached by Copernicus,
and discovered by Kepler ; but in speaking of that
power as the cause of the planetary motions, he

remarks, "that if attraction existed, it would de

crease as the square of the distance." The influ
ence of gravity was still more distinctly developed
by Borelli, a Neapolitan philosopher, who published
in 1666 a work on Jupiter's satellites.* In this work

he maintains, that all the planets perform their mo
tions round the sun according to a general law ; that

the satellites of Jupiter and of Saturn move round
their primary planets in the same manner as the
moon does round the earth, and that they all re
volve round the sun, which is the only source of

any virtue, and that this virtue attaches them, and
unites them so that they cannot recede from their

centre of action. f

   Our countryman Dr. Robert Hooke seems to
have devoted much of his attention to the cause of
the planetary motions. On the 21st March, 1666,
he read to the Royal Society an account of a series

of experiments for determining if bodies experience

any variation in their weight at different distances
from the centre of the earth. His experiments, as
Hooke himself saw, were by no means satisfactory,
and hence he was led to the ingenious idea of
measuring the force of gravity by observing, at dif
ferent altitudes, the rate of a pendulum clock.
About two months afterward, he exhibited to the
Society an approximate representation of the forces
which retain the planets in their orbits, in the paths
described by a circular pendulum impelled with dif-

ferent degrees of force ; but though this experiment
illustrated the production of a curvilineal motion, by
combining a tangential force with a central power
of attraction, yet it was only an illustration, and
could not lead to the true cause of the planetary mo
tions. At a later period, however, viz. in 1674,

                                         bodies whatsoever
have an attraction or gravitating power towards
their own centres, whereby they attract, not only
their own parts, and keep them from flying from
them, as we may observe the earth to do, but that
they also do attract all the other celestial bodies
that are within the sphere of their activity, and con
sequently, that not only the sun and moon have an
influence upon the body and motion of the earth,
and the earth upon them, but that Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, also, by their attractive
powers, have a considerable influence upon its mo
tion, as in the same manner the corresponding at
tractive power of the earth hath a considerable in
fluence upon every one of their motions also. The
second supposition is this, that all bodies what

soever that are put into a direct and simple motion
will so continue to move forward in a straight line,
till they are, by some other effectual powers, de
flected, and sent into a motion describing a circle,
ellipsis, or some other more compounded curve line.

Such is a brief sketch of the labours and lives of
those illustrious men who prepared the science of
astronomy for the application of Newton's genius.
Copernicus had determined the arrangement and
general movements of the planetary bodies : Kepler
had proved that they moved in elliptical orbits ;
that their radii vectores described arcs proportional
to the times; and that their periodic times were
related to their distances. Galileo had added to the
universe a whole system of secondary planets ; and
several astronomers had distinctly referred the mo
tion of the heavenly bodies to the power of attraction.
   In the year 1666, when the plague had driven
Newton from Cambridge, he was sitting alone in
            garat vWityo,o--lstthhaotrpree,maarnkdabrleeflepcotiwnger  on the
the garden                                                              which

nature of
causes all bodies to descend towards the centre of
the earth. As this power is not found to suffer any
sensible diminution at the greatest distance from
the earth's centre to which we can reach, being as
powerful at the tops of the highest mountains as at
the bottom of the deepest mines, he conceived it
highly probable, that it must extend much farther
than was usually supposed. No sooner had this
            Newton's idea of gravity.                                                           141

happy conjecture occurred to his mind, than he con
 sidered what would be the effect of its extending as
far as the moon. That her motion must be influ
 enced by such a power he did not for a moment
doubt ; and a little reflection convinced him that it
might be sufficient for retaining that luminary in her
orbit round the earth. Though the force of gravity
suffers no sensible diminution at those small dis
tances from the earth's centre at which we can
place ourselves, yet he thought it very possible,
that, at the distance of the moon, it might differ

much in strength from what it is on the earth. In
order to form some estimate of the degree of its
diminution, he considered that, if the moon be re
tained in her orbit by the force of gravity, the pri

mary planets must also be carried round the sun by
the same power ; and by comparing the periods of
the different planets with their distances from the

sun, he found, that if they were retained in their

orbits by any power like gravity, its force must de
crease in the duplicate proportion,* or as the squares

of their distances from the sun. In drawing this

conclusion, he supposed the planets to move in or
bits perfectly circular, and having the sun in their
centre. Having thus obtained the law of the force
by which the planets were drawn to the sun, his

next object was to ascertain if such a force, ema

nating from the earth and directed to the moon, was
sufficient, when diminished in the duplicate ratio of

the distance, to retain her in her orbit. In perform

ing this calculation, it was necessary to compare
the space through which heavy bodies fall in a second
at a given distance from the centre of the earth, viz.
at its surface, with the space through which the
moon, as it were, falls to the earth in a second of
time while revolving in a circular orbit. Being at

a distance from books when he made this compu
tation, he adopted the common estimate of the earth's
diameter then in use among geographers and navi
gators, and supposed that each degree of latitude
contained sixty English miles. In this way he
found that the force which retains the moon in her
orbit, as deduced from the force which occasions the
fall of heavy bodies to the earth's surface, was one-
sixth greater than that which is actually observed in
her circular orbit. This difference threw a doubt
upon all his speculations ; but, unwilling to abandon
what seemed to be otherwise so plausible, he endeav
oured to account for the difference of the two forces,
by supposing that some other cause* must have been
united with the force of gravity in producing so
great a velocity of the moon in her circular orbit.
As this new cause, however, was beyond the reach
of observation, he discontinued all further inquiries
into the subject, and concealed from his friends the
speculations in which he had been employed.
   After his return to Cambridge in 1666, his atten
tion was occupied with those optical discoveries of
which we have given an account in a preceding
chapter; but he had no sooner brought them to a
close than his mind reverted to the great subject of
the planetary motions. Upon the death of Olden
burg in August, 1678, Dr. Hooke was appointed
secretary to the Royal Society ; and as this learned
body had requested the opinion of Newton about a
system of physical astronomy, he addressed  a letter
to Dr. Hooke on the 28th November, 1679.
                                            In this
letter he proposed a direct experiment for verifying
the motion of the earth, viz. by observing whether
or not bodies that fall from a considerable height

descend in a vertical direction, for if the earth were
at rest the body would describe exactly a vertical

line, whereas if it revolved round its axis, the falling
body must deviate from the vertical line towards the
east. The Royal Society attached great value to
the idea thus casually suggested, and Dr. Hooke was
appointed to put it to the test of experiment. Being
thus led to consider the subject more attentively, he
wrote to Newton, that wherever the direction of
gravity was oblique to the axis on which the earth
revolved, that is, in every part of the earth ex
cept the equator, falling bodies should approach
to the equator, and the deviation from the ver
tical, in place of being exactly to the east, as
Newton maintained, should be to the south-east of
the point from which the body began to move.
Newton acknowledged that this conclusion was cor
rect in theory, and Dr. Hooke is said to have given
an experimental demonstration of it before the Royal
Society in December, 1679.* Newton had errone
ously concluded that the path of the falling body
would be a spiral ; but Dr. Hooke, on the same
occasion on which he made the preceding experi
ment, read a paper to the Society, in which he proved
that the path of                          body would be               eccentric
ellipse in vacuo,                    the  an ellipti-spiral,      an  the body

moved in a resisting medium.f
   This correction of Newton's error, and the dis
covery that a projectile would move in an elliptical
orbit when under the influence of a force varying in
the inverse ratio of the square of the distance, led

But though Newton had thus discovered the true
cause of all the celestial motions, he did not yet
possess any evidence that such a force actually re
sided in the sun and planets. The failure of his
former attempt to identify the law of falling bodies
at the earth's surface with that which guided the
moon in her orbit threw a doubt over all his specu
lations, and prevented him from giving any account
of them to the public.
  An accident, however, of a very interesting nature
induced him to resume his former inquiries, and

enabled him to bring them to a close. In June,
1682, when he was attending a meeting of the Royal

Society of London, the measurement of a degree of
the meridian, executed by M. Picard in 1679, became
the subject of conversation. Newton took a memo
randum of the result obtained by the French astron
omer, and having deduced from it the diameter of the

earth, he immediately resumed his calculation of
1665, and began to repeat it with these new data.

In the progress of the calculation he saw that the
result which          formerly expected was likely  to
be produced,  he had  was thrown into such a state
              and he                                of
nervous irritability that he was unable to carry on
the calculation. In this state of mind he intrusted
it to one of his friends, and he had the high satis
faction of finding his former views amply realized.

The force of gravity which regulated the fall of
bodies at the earth's surface, when diminished as
the square of the moon's distance from the earth,
was found to be almost exactly equal to the centri
fugal force of the moon as deduced from her observed

distance and velocity.
   The influence of such a result upon such a mind
may be more easily conceived than described. The
whole material universe was spread out before him ;

systems of the fixed stars stretching to the remotest
limits of space. All the varied and complicated
movements of the heavens, in short, must have been
at once presented to his mind, as the necessary result
of that law which he had established in reference to

the earth and the moon.

   After extending this law to the other bodies of
the system, he composed a series of propositions
on the motion of the primary planets about the sun,
which were sent to London about the end of 1683,
and were soon afterward communicated to the
Royal Society.*

   About this period other philosophers had been
occupied with the same subject. Sir Christopher
Wren had many years before endeavoured to ex
plain the planetary motions "by the composition
of a descent towards the sun, and an impressed
motion ; but he at length gave it over, not finding
the means of doing it." In January, 1683-4, Dr.
Halley had concluded, from Kepler's Law of the
Periods and Distances, that the centripetal force de
creased in the reciprocal proportion of the squares
of the distances, and having one day met Sir Chris
topher Wren and Dr. Hooke, the latter affirmed
that he had demonstrated upon that principle all
the laws of the celestial motions. Dr. Halley con
fessed that his attempts were unsuccessful, and
Sir Christopher, in order to encourage the inquiry,
offered to present a book of forty shillings' value to
either of the two philosophers who should, in the
space of two months, bring him a convincing de
monstration of it. Hooke persisted in the decla
ration that he possessed the method, but avowed it
to be his intention to conceal it for some time. He
promised, however, to show it to Sir Christopher ;
but there is every reason to believe that this prom
ise was never fulfilled.

   In August, 1684, Dr. Halley went to Cambridge

for the express purpose of consulting Newton on
this interesting subject. Newton assured him that
he had brought this demonstration to perfection,
and promised him a copy of it. This copy was re
ceived in November by the doctor, who made a
second visit to Cambridge, in order to induce its

author to have it inserted in the register book of
the society. On the 10th of December, Dr. Halley
announced to the society, that he had seen at Cam
bridge Mr. Newton's treatise De Motu Corporum,
which he had promised to send to the society to be
entered upon their register ; and Dr. Halley was de
sired to unite with Mr. Paget, master of the mathe
matical school in    Christ's      "Hfoorspsietacul,rining  reminding
Mr. Newton of his   promise                                 the inven
tion to himself till such time as he can be at leisure
to publish it." On the 25th February Mr. Aston,
the secretary, communicated        a letter from            "Mtro.
Newton, in which he expressed      his willingness
enter in the register his notions about motion, and
his intentions to fit them suddenly for the press."
The progress of his work was, however, interrupted
by a visit of five or six weeks which he made in
Lincolnshire ; but he proceeded with such diligence
on his return, that he was able to transmit the manu
script to London before the end of April. This
manuscript, entitled Philosophic Naturalis Principia
Mathematica, and dedicated to the society, was pre
sented by Dr. Vincent on the 28th April, 1686, when
Sir John Hoskins, the vice-president, and the par
ticular friend of Dr. Hooke, was in the chair. Dr.
Vincent passed a just encomium on the novelty and

offence at these remarks, and blamed Sir John for

not having mentioned " what he had discovered to
him ;" but the vice-president did not seem to recol

of this discussion was, that
then were the most inseparable cronies, have since
scarcely seen one another, and are utterly fallen
out." After the breaking up of the meeting, the
society adjourned to the coffee-house, where Dr.
Hooke stated that he not only had made the same
discovery, but had given the first hint of it to Newton.
   An account of these proceedings was communi
cated to Newton through two different channels.

In a letter dated May 22d, Dr. Halley wrote to him
"that Mr. Hooke has some pretensions upon the
invention of the rule of the decrease of giavity be
ing reciprocally as the squares of the distances from
the centre. He says you had the notion from him,
though he owns the demonstration of the curves
generated thereby to be wholly your own. How
much of this is so you know best, as likewise what
you have to do in this matter. Only Mr. Hooke
seems to expect you would make some mention of
him in the preface, which it is possible you may
see reason to prefix."
This communication from Dr. Halley induced
our author, on the 20th June, to address a long
letter to him, in which he gives a minute and able
refutation of Hooke's claims ; but before this letter
was despatched, another correspondent, who had
received his information from one of
that were present, informed Newton    t"hethamt eHmoboekres
made a great stir, pretending that he had all from
him, and desiring they would see that he had justice
done him." This fresh charge seems to have ruf
fled the tranquillity of Newton ; and he accordingly
added an angry and satirical postscript, in which he
treats Hooke with little ceremony, and goes so far
as to conjecture that Hooke might have acquired
his knowledge of the law from a letter of his own

directed to Mr. Oldenburg, who used to keep the
originals. His papers came into Mr. Hooke's pos
session. Mr. Hooke, knowing my hand, might have
the curiosity to look into that letter, and there take
the notion of comparing the forces of the planets
arising from their circular motion ; and so what he
wrote to me afterward about the rate of gravity
might be nothing but the fruit of my own garden."
   In replying to this letter, Dr. Halley assured him
that Hooke's "manner of claiming the discovery
had been represented to him in worse colours than
it ought, and that he neither made public application
to the society for justice, nor pretended that you
had all from him." The effect of this assurance
was to make Newton regret that he had written the
angry postscript to his letter; and in replying to
Halley on the 14th July, 1686, he not only expresses
his regret, but recounts the different new ideas
which   he had acquired     ftrhoembeHstomokeeth'sodco"rorefscpoomn

m which Wren, Hooke, and Halley are acknowledged
to have independently deduced the law of gravity
from the second law of Kepler.*
At the meeting of the 28th April, at which the
manuscript of the Principia was presented to the
Royal Society, it was agreed that the printing of it
should be referred to the council ; that a letter of
thanks should be written to its author; and at a
meeting of the council on the 19th May, it was
resolved that the MSS. should be printed at the
society's expense, and that Dr. Halley should super
intend it while going through the press. These
resolutions were communicated by Dr. Halley in a
letter dated the 22d May ; and in Newton's reply on
the 20th June already mentioned, he makes the fol-

The third book was also transmitted, and presented
on the 6th April, and the whole work was completed
and published in the month of May, 1687.
    Such is a brief account of the publication of a
work which is memorable, not only in the annals of
one science or of one country, but which will form
an epoch in the history of the world, and will ever
be regarded as the brightest page in the records of
human reason. We shall endeavour to convey to
the reader some idea of its contents, and of the bril
liant discoveries which it disseminated over Europe.
    The Principia consists of three books. The first
and second, which occupy three-fourths of the work,
are entitled, On the Motion of Bodies ; and the third
bears the title, On the System of the World. The
first two books contain the mathematical principles
of philosophy, namely, the laws and conditions of
motions and forces ; and they are illustrated with
several philosophical scholia, which treat of some of
the most general and' best established points in phi
losophy, such as the density and resistance of bodies,
spaces void of matter, and the motion of sound and
light. The object of the third book is to deduce
from these principles the constitution of the system
of the world ; and this book has been drawn up in
as popular a style as possible, in order that it may
be generally read.
    The great discovery which characterizes the
Principia is that of the principle of universal gravi
tation, as deduced from the motion of the moon,
and from the three great facts or laws discovered by
Kepler.    This principle is, that every
matter is                                   particle of
           attracted by, or gravitates to,
                                            every other
particle of matter, with a force inversely proportional
to  the squares of their distances. From the first law

law of Kepler, that every planet moves in an ellipse
with the sun in one of its foci, he drew the still more
general inference, that the force by which the planet
moves round that focus varies inversely as the
square of its distance from the focus. As this law
was true in the motion of satellites round their pri
mary planets, Newton deduced the equality of gravity
in all the heavenly bodies towards the sun, upon the
supposition that they are equally distant from its
centre ; and in the case of terrestrial bodies, he suc
ceeded in verifying this truth by numerous and accu
rate experiments.
   By taking a more general view of the subject,
Newton demonstrated that a conic section was the
only curve in which a body could move when acted
upon by a force varying inversely as the square of
the distance ; and he established the conditions de

opefntdhineg    on the velocity and the primitive position

scribe a circular, an elliptical, a parabolic, or a

   Notwithstanding the generality and importance
of these results, it still remained to be determined
whether the force resided in the centres of the
planets, or belonged to each individual particle of
which they were composed. Newton removed this

uncertainty by demonstrating, that if a spherical
body acts upon a distant body with a force varying
as the distance of this body from the centre of the

sphere, the same effect will be produced as if each
of its particles acted upon the distant body accord

ing to the same law. And hence it follows that the
spheres, whether they are of uniform density, or
consist of concentric layers, with densities varying
according to any law whatever, will act upon each
other in the same manner as if their force resided
in their centres alone. But as the bodies of the
solar system are very nearly spherical, they will all
act upon one another, and upon bodies placed on
152  SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

their surface, as if they were so many centres of

attraction ; and therefore we obtain the law of gravity
which subsists between spherical bodies, namely,
that one sphere will act upon another with a force
directly proportional to the quantity of matter, and
inversely as the square of the distance between the
centres of the spheres. From the equality of action
and reaction, to which no exception can be found,
Newton concluded that the sun gravitated to the
planets, and the planets to their satellites ; and the
earth itself to the stone which falls upon its surface ;
and, consequently, that the two mutually gravitating
bodies approached to one another with velocities
inversely proportional to their quantities of matter.

   Having established this universal law, Newton
was enabled, not only to determine the weight which
the same body would have at the surface of the sun
and the planets, but even to calculate the quantity
of matter in the sun, and in all the planets that had
satellites, and even to determine the density or
specific gravity of the matter of which they were
composed. In this way he found that the weight of
the same body would be twenty-three times greater
at the surface of the sun than at the surface of the
earth, and that the density of the earth was four times
greater than that of the sun, the planets increasing
in density as they receded from the centre of the

   The discovery of the spheroidal form of Jupiter
by Cassini had probably directed the attention of
Newton to the determination of its cause, and con
sequently to the investigation of the true figure of
the earth. The spherical form of the planets have
been ascribed by Copernicus to the gravity or natural

appetency of their parts; but upon considering the
earth as a body revolving upon its axis, Newton
quickly saw that the figure arising from the mutual
attraction of its parts must be modified by another
force arising from its rotation. When a body re
volves upon an axis, the velocity of rotation in
creases from the poles, where it is nothing, to the
equator, where it is a maximum. In consequence
of this velocity the bodies on the earth's surface
have a tendency to fly off from and this tendency

of gravity, and which Newton found to be the 289th
part of the force of gravity at the equator, and de
creasing, as the cosine of the latitude, from the
equator to the poles. The great predominance of
gravity over the centrifugal force prevents the latter
from carrying off any bodies from the earth's sur
face, but the weight of all bodies diminished by

of the canal will -be heavier than the equatorial
branch, in consequence of its weight not being di
minished by the centrifugal force, and, therefore, in
order that the two columns maybe in equilibrio, the
equatorial one must be lengthened. Newton found
that the length of the polar must be to that of the
equatorial canal as 229 to 230, or that the earth's polar
radius must be seventeen miles less than its equa
torial radius that is, that the figure of the earth

which he confirmed by the fact, that clocks required
to have their pendulums shortened in order to beat
true time when carried from Europe towards the

equator.

   The next subject to which Newton applied the
principle of gravity was the tides of the ocean.
The philosophers of all ages have recognised the
connexion between the phenomena of the tides and
the position of the moon. The College of Jesuits
at Coimbra, and subsequently Antonio de Dominis
and Kepler, distinctly referred the tides to the attrac
tion of the waters of the earth by the moon, but so
imperfect was the explanation which was thus given
of the phenomena, that Galileo ridiculed the idea of
lunar attraction, and substituted for it a fallacious
explanation of his own. That the moon is the
principal cause of the tides is obvious from the well-
known fact, that it is high water at any given place
about the time when she is in the meridian of that

 place ; and that the sun performs a secondary part
 in their production may be proved from the circum
 stance, that the highest tides take place when the
 sun, the moon, and the earth are in the same straight
 line, that is, when the force of the sun conspires
 with that of the moon, and that the lowest tides
 take place when the lines drawn from the sun and
 moon to the earth are at right angles to each other,
 that is, when the force of the sun acts in opposition
 to that of the moon. The most perplexing phe.
. nomenon in the tides of the ocean, and one which is
 still a stumbling-block to persons slightly acquainted
 with the theory of attraction, is the existence of
 high water on the side of the earth opposite to the

 moon, as well as on the side next the moon. To
 maintain that the attraction of the moon at the same
 instant draws the waters of the ocean towards her

 self, and also draws them from the earth in an oppo-
TIDES.             155

 site direction, seems at first sight paradoxical ; but
the difficulty vanishes when we consider the earth,
or rather the centre of the earth, and the water on
each side of it as three distinct bodies placed at dif
ferent distances from the moon, and consequently
attracted with forces inversely proportional to the
squares of their distances. The water nearest the

moon will be much more powerfully attracted than
the centre of the earth, and the centre of the earth

more powerfully than the water farthest from the
moon. The consequence of this must be, that the
waters nearest the moon will be drawn away from

the centre of the earth, and will consequently rise
from their level, while the centre of the earth will

be drawn away from the waters opposite the moon,
which will, as it were, be left behind, and conse

quently be in the same situation as if they were

raised from the earth in a direction opposite to
that in which they are attracted by the moon.
Hence the effect of the moon's action upon the
earth is to draw its fluid parts into the form of an
oblong spheroid, the axis of which passes through
the moon. As the action of the sun will produce
the very same effect, though in a smaller degree,
the tide at any place will depend on the relative po

sition of these two spheroids, and will be always
equal either to the sum or to the difference of the
effects of the two luminaries. At the time of new
and full moon the two spheroids will have their axes
coincident, and the height of the tide, which will
then be a spring one, will be equal to the sum of the

elevations produced in each spheroid considered
separately, while at the first and third quarters the

axes of the spheroids will be at right angles to each
other, and the height of the tide, which will then be
a neap one, will be equal to the difference of the
elevations produced in each separate spheroid. By

comparing the spring and neap tides, Newton found
that the force with which the stm acted upon the

   does not deviate much from observation. Having
   thus ascertained the force of the moon on the waters
   of our globe, he found that the quantity of matter
   in the moon was to that in the earth as 1 to 40, and
   the density of the moon to that of the earth as 11
   to 9.
      The motions of the moon, so much within the

   reach of our own observation, presented a fine field
   for the application of the theory of universal gravi
   tation. The irregularities exhibited in the lunar
   motions had been known in the time of Hipparchus
   and Ptolemy. Tycho had discovered the great in
   equality called the variation, amounting to' 37', and
   depending on the alternate acceleration and retard
   ation of the moon in every quarter of a revolution,

   and he had also ascertained the existence of the
   annual equation. Of these two inequalities Newton
   gave a most satisfactory explanation. The action
   of the sun upon the moon may be always resolved
   into two, one acting in the direction of the line join
   ing the moon and earth, and consequently tending
   to increase or diminish the moon's gravity to the
   earth, and the other in a direction at right angles to
   this, and consequently tending to accelerate or re
   tard the motion in her orbit. Now, it was found by
   Newton that this last force was reduced to nothing,
   or vanished at the syzigies or quadratures, so that
   at these four points the moon described areas pro
   portional to the times. The instant, however, that
   the moon quits these positions, the force under con
   sideration, which we may call the tangential force,
   begins, and it reaches its maximum in the four oc
   tants. The force, therefore, compounded of these

   two elements of the solar force, or the diagonal oi
LUNAR THEORY.  157

the parallelogram which they form, is no longer
directed to the earth's centre, but deviates from it at
a maximum about 30 minutes, and therefore affects
the angular motion of the moon, the motion being
accelerated in passing from the quadratures to the
syzigies, and retarded in passing from the syzigies
to the quadratures. Hence the velocity is in its
mean state in the octants, a maximum in the syzi
gies, and a minimum in the quadratures.

   Upon considering the influence of the solar force
in diminishing or increasing the moon's gravity to
the earth, Newton saw that her distance and her
periodic time must from this cause be subject to
change, and in this way he accounted for the annual
equation observed by Tycho. By the application
of similar principles, he explained the cause of the
motion of the apsides, or of the greater axis of the
moon's orbit, which has an angular progressive mo
tion of 3° 4' nearly in the course of one lunation ;
and he showed that the retrogradation of the nodes,
amounting to 3' 10" daily, arose from one of the ele
ments of the solar force being exerted in the plane
of the ecliptic, and not in the plane of the moon's
orbit, the effect of which was to draw the moon
down to the plane of the ecliptic, and thus cause the
line of the nodes, or the intersection of these two
planes, to move in a direction opposite to that of the
moon. The lunar theory thus blocked out by New
ton, required for its completion the labours of another
century. The imperfections of the fluxionary cal
culus prevented him from explaining the other ine
qualities of the moon's motions, and it was reserved
to Euler, D'Alembert, Clairaut, Mayer, and Laplace
to bring the lunar tables to a high degree of perfec
tion, and to enable the navigator to determine his
longitude at sea with a degree of precision which
the most sanguine astronomer could scarcely have

anticipated.

   By the consideration of the retrograde motion of

158            SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

the moon's nodes, Newton was led to discover the
cause of the remarkable phenomenon of the preces
sion of the equinoctial points, which moved 50" an
nually, and completed the circuit of the heavens in
25,920 years. Kepler had declared himself incapa
ble of assigning any cause for this motion, and we
do not believe that any other astronomer ever made
the attempt. From the spheroidal form of the earth,
it may be regarded as a sphere with a spheroidal
ring surrounding its equator, one-half of the ring
being above the plane of the ecliptic and the other
half below it. Considering this excess of matter
as a system of satellites adhering to the earth's sur
face, Newton saw that the combined actions of the
sun and moon upon these satellites tended to pro
duce a retrogradation in the nodes of the circles
which they described in their diurnal rotation, and
that the sum of all the tendencies being communi
cated to the whole mass of the planet, ought to pro
duce a slow retrogradation of the equinoctial points.
The effect produced by the motion of the sun he
found to be 40", and that produced by the action of
the moon 10".

inAlthough there could be little doubt that the
comets were retained  their orbits by the same
laws which regulated the motions of the planets,
yet it was difficult to put this opinion to the test of
observation. The visibility of comets only in a
small part of their orbits rendered it difficult to as
certain their distance and periodic times, and as their
periods were probably of great length, it was impos
sible to correct approximate results by repeated ob
servation. Newton, however, removed this diffi
culty, by showing how to determine the orbit of a
comet, namely, the form and position of the orbit
and the periodic time, by three observations. By
applying this method to the comet of 1680, he cal
culated the elements of its orbit,  and from the agree
ment of the comouted places         with those which

were observed, he justly inferred that the motions
of comets were regulated by the same laws as those
of the planetary bodies. This result was one of
great importance ; for as the comets enter our sys
tem in every possible direction, and at all angles
with the ecliptic, and as a great part of their orbits
extend far beyond the limits of the solar system, it
demonstrated the existence of gravity in spaces far
removed beyond the planet, and proved that the law
of the inverse ratio of the squares of the distance
was true in every possible direction, and at very re
mote distances from the centre of our system.*

    Such is a brief view of the leading discoveries
which the Principia first announced to the world.
The grandeur of the subjects of which it treats, the
beautiful simplicity of the system which it unfolds,
the clear and concise reasoning by which that sys
tem is explained, and the irresistible evidence by
which it is supported might have ensured it the
warmest admiration of contemporary mathemati
cians, and the most welcome reception in all the
schools of philosophy throughout Europe. This,
however, is not the way in which great truths are
generally received. Though the astronomical dis
coveries of Newton were not assailed by the class
of ignorant pretenders who attacked his optical
writings, yet they were every where resisted by the
errors and prejudices which had taken a deep hold
even of the strongest minds. The philosophy of
Descartes was predominant throughout Europe.
Appealing to the imagination, and not to the reason
of mankind, it was quickly received into popular
favour, and the same causes which facilitated its in
troduction extended its influence, and completed its
dominion over the human mind. In explaining all
the movements of the heavenly bodies by a system

160  SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

of vortices in a fluid medium diffused through the
universe, Descartes had seized upon an analogy of
the most alluring and deceitful kind. Those who
had seen heavy bodies revolving in the eddies of a
whirlpool, or in the gyrations of a vessel of water
thrown into a circular motion, had no difficulty in
conceiving how the planets might revolve round the
sun by analogous movements. The mind instantly
grasped at an explanation of so palpable a character,
and which required for its development neither the
exercise of patient thought nor the aid of mathe
matical skill. The talent and perspicuity with which
the Cartesian system was expounded, and the show
of experiments with which it was sustained, con
tributed powerfully to its adoption, while it derived a
still higher sanction from the excellent character
and the unaffected piety of its author.

   Thus intrenched, as the Cartesian system was, in
fhe strongholds of the human mind, and fortified by
its most obstinate prejudices, it was not to be won
dered at that the pure and sublime doctrines of the
Principia were distrustfully received and persever-
ingly resisted. The uninstructed mind could not
readily admit the idea, that the great masses of the
planets were suspended in empty space, and retained
in then orbits by an invisible influence residing in
the sun ; and even those philosophers who had been
accustomed to the rigour of true scientific research,
and who possessed sufficient mathematical skill for
the examination of the Newtonian doctrines, viewed
them at first as reviving the occult qualities of the
ancient physics, and resisted their introduction with
a pertinacity which it is not easy to explain. Preju
diced, no doubt, in favour of his own metaphysical
views, Leibnitz himself misapprehended the princi
ples of the Newtonian philosophy, and endeavoured
to demonstrate the truths in the Principia by the appli
cation of different principles. Huygens, who above all
other men was qualified to appreciate the new philo-

sophy, rejected the doctrine of gravitation as existing
between the individual particles of matter, and re
ceived it only as an attribute of the planetary masses.
John Bernouilli, one of the first mathematicians of
his age, opposed the philosophy of Newton. Mai-
ran, in the early part of his life, was a strenuous de
fender of the system of vortices. Cassini and Ma-
raldi were quite ignorant of the Principia, and occu
pied themselves with the most absurd methods of
calculating the orbits of comets long after the New
tonian method had been established on the most
impregnable foundation ; and even Fontenelle, a man
of liberal views and extensive information, continued,
throughout the whole of his life, to maintain the
doctrines of Descartes.
The Chevalier Louville of Paris had adopted the
Newtonian philosophy before 1720. S'Gravesande
had introduced it into the Dutch universities at a
somewhat earlier period, and Maupertuis, in conse
quence of a visit which he paid to England in 1728,
became a zealous defender of it ; but notwithstand

ing these and some other examples that might be
quoted, we must admit the truth of the remark of
Voltaire, that though Newton survived the publica
tion of the Principia more than forty years, yet at
the time of his death he had not above twenty fol
lowers out of England.

philosophy in England, some difference of opinion

elegant translation of the same book was published
by Dr. Samuel Clarke, with the addition of notes, in
which that profound and ingenious writer explained
the views of Newton on the principal objects of
discussion, so that the notes contained virtually a
refutation of the text ; they did so, however, only
virtually, all appearance of argument and contro
versy being carefully avoided. Whether this escaped
the notice of the learned doctor or not is uncertain,
but the new translation, from its better Latinity, and
the name of the editor, was readily admitted to all
the academical honours which the old one had en
joyed. Thus the stratagem of Dr. Clarke com
pletely succeeded ; the tutor might prelect from the
text, but the pupil would sometimes look into the
notes ; and error is never so sure of being exposed
as when the truth is placed close to side by side,
without any thing to alarm prejudice, or awaken
from its lethargy the dread of innovation. Thus,
therefore, the Newtonian philosophy first entered

tonian philosophy was made the subject of the aca
demical prelections. For this distinction they are
indebted to James and David Gregory, the first in
some respects the rival, but both the friends of
Newton. Whiston bewails, in the anguish of his
heart, the difference, in this respect, between those
universities and his own. David Gregory taught
Edinburgh for several years prior to 1690, when he
removed to Oxford and Whiston says, He had
already caused several of his scholars to keep acts.

Physics of Rohault were still in use
at least occasionally, to a much later period than this,
and a great deal, no  doubt, depended on the character

of the individual.    Professor Keill introduced the
Newtonian philosophy in his lectures at Oxford in
1697 ; but the instructions of the tutors, which con
stitute the real and efficient system of the univer

was publicly taught by David Gregory at Edinburgh,
and by his brother, James Gregory, at St. Andrew's,f
before it was able to supplant the vortices of Des
cartes in that very university of which Newton
was a member. It was in the Scottish universities
that the philosophy of Locke, as well as that of
Newton, was first adopted as a branch of academi
cal education."
Anxious as we should have been to have awarded
to Scotland the honour of having first adopted the
Newtonian philosophy, yet a regard for historical
truth compels us to take a different view of the sub
ject. It is well known that Sir Isaac Newton de
livered lectures on his own philosophy from the
Lucasian chair before the publication of the Prin-
cipia; and in the very page of Whiston's life quoted
by Professor Playfair, he informs us that he had
heard him read such lectures in the public schools,

though at that time he did not at all understand
them. Newton continued to lecture till 1699, and
occasionally, we presume, till 1703, when Whiston
became his successor, having been appointed his
deputy in 1699. In both of these capacities Whis
ton delivered in the public schools a course of lec
tures on astronomy, and a course of physico-mathe-

phy of Newton was explained and demonstrated,

1707, and the other in 1710,      "pufoblrishtheed,  use  of the
young men in the university." In 1707, the cele
brated blind mathematician Nicholas Saunderson
took up his residence in Christ's College without
being admitted a member of that body. The society
not only allotted to him apartments, but gave him
the free use  of  their library.     With

Newton," and the popularity of these lectures was
so great, that Sir Isaac corresponded on the subject
of' them with their author ; and on the ejection of
Whiston from the Lucasian chair in 1711, Saunderson
was appointed his successor. In this important office
he continued to teach the Newtonian philosophy till
the time of his death, which took place in 1739.
But while the Newtonian philosophy was thus
regularly taught in Cambridge, after the publication
of the Principia, there were not wanting other exer
tions for accelerating its progress. About 1694, the
celebrated Dr. Samuel Clarke, while an under-grad-

uate, defended, in the public schools, a question taken
from the Newtonian philosophy ; and his translation
of Rohault's Physics, which contains references in
the notes to the Principia, and which was published
in 1697 (and not in 1718, as stated by Professor
Playfair), shows how early the Cartesian system
was attacked by the disciples of Newton. The
author of the Life of Saunderson informs us, that

public exercises or acts founded on every part of the
 Newtonian system were very common about 1707,
 and so general were such studies in the university,
that the Principia rose to four times its original
price.* One of the most ardent votaries of the
Newtonian philosophy was Dr. Laughton, who had
been tutor in Clare Hall from 1694, and it is probable
that during the whole, or at least a greater part, of
his tutorship he had inculcated the same doctrines.
In 1709-10, when he was proctor of that college, in
stead of appointing a moderator, he discharged the
office himself, and devoted his most active exertions
to the promotion of mathematical knowledge. Pre
vious to this, he had even published a paper of ques
tions on the Newtonian philosophy, which appear to
have been used as theses for disputations ; and such
was his ardour and learning that they powerfully
contributed to the popularity of his college. Be
tween 1706 and 1716, the year of his death, the cele
brated Roger Cotes, the friend and disciple of New
ton, filled the Plumian chair of astronomy and ex
perimental philosophy at Cambridge. During this
period he edited the second edition of the Principia,
which he enriched with an admirable preface, and
thus contributed, by his writings as well as by his
lectures, to advance the philosophy of his master.
About the same time, the learned Dr. Bentley, who
first made known the philosophy of his friend to the
readers of general literature, filled the high office of
master of Trinity College, and could not fail to have
exerted his utmost influence in propagating doctrines
which he so greatly admired. Had any opposition
been offered to the introduction of the true system

of the universe, the talents and influence of these

individuals would have immediately suppressed it ;
but no such opposition seems to have been made ;

and though there may have been individuals at Cam
bridge ignorant of mathematical science, who ad
hered to the system of Descartes, and patronised
the study of the Physics of Rohault, yet it is pro
bable that similar persons existed in the universities
of Edinburgh and St. Andrew's ; and we cannot re
gard their adherence to error as disproving the gen
eral fact, that the philosophy of Newton was quickly
introduced into all the universities of Great Britain.
But while the mathematical principles of the New
tonian system were ably expounded in our seats of
learning, its physical truths were generally studied,

and were explained and communicated to the public
by various lecturers on experimental philosophy.
The celebrated Locke, who was incapable of under
standing the Principia from his want of mathemati
cal knowledge, inquired of Huygens if all the mathe
matical propositions in that work were true. When
he was assured that he might depend upon their cer
tainty, he took them for granted, and carefully ex
amined the reasonings and corollaries deduced from

them. In this manner he acquired a knowledge of
the physical truths in the Principia, and became a
firm believer in the discoveries which it contained.

In the same manner he studied the treatise on Op
tics, and made himself master of every part of it
which was not mathematical.*     F"rAomdeammoannstursactrioipnt

in a more popular manner than in the Principia, but
there can be no doubt that, even in their present

Oxford about the year 1704 or 1705, and in that way
introduced the love of the Newtonian philosophy."
When Dr. Keill left the university, Desaguliers be

Oxford, in 1710, and delivered more than a hundred
and twenty courses ; and when he went to settle in
London in 1713, he informs us that he found "the
Newtonian philosophy generally received among
persons of all ranks and professions, and even
among the ladies by the help of experiments."

for a while in the recesses of our universities, was

                           Report of
of the Controversy.

Previous to the time of Newton, the doctrine of
infinite quantities had been the subject of profound
study. The ancients made the first step in this
curious inquiry by a rude though ingenious attempt
to determine the area of curves. The method of
exhaustions which was used for this purpose con
sisted in finding a given rectilineal area to which the
inscribed and circumscribed polygonal figures con
tinually approached by increasing the number of
their sides.    This       area was obviously the area
of the curve,              the case of the parabola it was
               and in
found by Archimedes to be two-thirds of the area

formed by multiplying the ordinate by the abscissa.
Although the synthetical demonstration of the re
sults was perfectly conclusive, yet the method itself
was limited and imperfect.
The celebrated Pappus of Alexandria followed
Archimedes in the same inquiries ; and in his demon
stration of           the property of   the   centre of gravity
                      figure, by which  we
of a plane                                   may determine the
solid formed by its revolution, he has shadowed
forth the discoveries of later times.
   In his curious tract on Stereometry, published in
1615, Kepler made           some advances in the doctrine
                            Prompted to the task by a dis
of infinitesimals.
pute with the seller of some casks of wine, he
studied the measurement of solids formed by the
revolution            of a  curve   round any    line whatever.
                                                 these problems,
In solving            some  of the  simplest of
he conceived a circle to be formed of an infinite
number of triangles having all their vertices in the
centre, and their infinitely small bases in the circum
ference of the circle, and by thus rendering familiar
the idea of quantities infinitely great and infinitely
small, he gave an impulse to this branch of mathe
matics. The failure of Kepler, too, in solving some
of the more difficult of the problems which he him
self proposed roused the attention of geometers,
and seems particularly to have attracted the notice

of Cavaleri.
This ingenious mathematician was born at Milan
in 1598, and was Professor of Geometry at Bologna.

In his method of Indivisibles, which was published
in 1635, he considered a line as composed of an in
finite number of points, a surface of an infinite
number of lines, and a solid of an infinite number

of surfaces ; and he lays it down as an axiom that
                            of such lines and surfaces have the
tshaemeinfrinaittieo  sums  compared with the linear or super

be determined. As it is not true that an infinite

number of infinitely small points can make a line,
or an infinite number of infinitely small lines a sur
face, Pascal removed this verbal difficulty by con
sidering a line as composed of an infinite number
of infinitely short lines, a surface as composed of
an infinite number of infinitely narrow parallelo
grams, and a solid of an infinite number of infinitely
thin solids. But, independent of this correction,
the conclusions deduced by Cavaleri are rigorously

true, and his method of ascertaining the ratios of
areas and solids to one another, and the theorems
which he deduced from it may be considered as
forming an era in mathematics.
By the application of this method, Roberval and
Toricelli showed that the area of the cycloid is three
times that of its generating circle, and the former
extended the method of Cavaleri to the case where
the powers of the terms of the arithmetical pro
Ingression to be summed were fractional.

Lagrange and Laplace* have pronounced the latter
to be the true inventer of the differential calculus.
Roberval supposed the point which describes a
curve to be actuated by two motions, by the compo
sition of which it moves in the direction of a tan
gent ; and had he possessed the method of fluxions,
he could, in every case, have determined the rela
tive velocities of these motions, which depend on
the nature of the curve, and consequently the
direction of the tangent which he assumed to be in
the diagonal of a parallelogram whose sides had the

same ratio as the velocities. But as he was able
to determine these velocities only in the conic sec
tions, &c. his ingenious method had but few appli
cations.
The labours of Peter Fermat, a counsellor of the
parliament of Toulouse, approached still nearer to
the fluxionary calculus. In his method of deter
mining the maxima and minima of the ordinates of
curves, he substitutes x-\-e for the independent
variable x in the function which is to become a
maximum, and as these two expressions should be
equal when e becomes infinitely small or 0, he frees
this equation from surds     and radicals, and
viding the whole by e, e is                     after di
                             made = 0, and the  equation
for the maximum is thus obtained. Upon a similar
principle he founded his method of drawing tangents
to curves. But though the methods thus used by
Fermat are in principle the same with those which
connect the theory of tangents and of maxima
and minima with the analytical method of exhibit
ing the differential calculus, yet it is a singular ex

pose by Laplace's expression that the calculus of
finite differences had then already assumed a sys
tematic form, and that Fermat had actually observed
the relation between the two calculi, and derived
the one from the other. The latter conclusion
would scarcely be less correct than the former. No
method can justly be regarded as bearing any anal
ogy to the differential calculus which does not lay
down a system of rules (no matter on what consid
erations founded, by what names called, or by what
extraneous matter enveloped) by means of which
the second term of the development of any function
of x-\-e in powers of e, can be correctly calculated,

he failed in its application. Nicolas Mercator (KaufF-
man) surmounted the difficulty by which Wallis
had been baffled, by the continued division of the
numerator by the denominator to infinity, and then
applying  Wallis's method to the resulting        positive
powers.   In this way he obtained, in 1667,       the first
general quadrature of the hyperbola, and, at the
same time, gave the regular development of a func
tion in series.

areas would form another series. He saw also that
the equation of the circle was intermediate between
the first and second terms of the first series, or
between the equation of a straight line and that of
a parabola, and hence he concluded, that by interpo
lating a term between the first and second term of
the second series, he would obtain the area of the
circle. In pursuing this singularly beautiful thought,
Dr. Wallis did not succeed in obtaining the indefinite
quadrature of the circle, because he did not employ
general exponents ; but he was led to express the
entire area of the circle by a fraction, the numerator
and denominator of which are each obtained by
the continued multiplication of a certain series of
numbers

Such was the state of this branch of mathematical
science, when Newton, at an early age, directed to
it the  vigour of his mind.       At the very beginning
of his                            when the works of Dr.
        mathematical studies,
Wallis fell into his hands, he was led to consider
how he could interpolate the general values of the
areas in the second series of that mathematician.
With this view he investigated the arithmetical law
of the coefficients of the series, and obtained a
general method of interpolating, not only the series
above   referred  to,  but  also  other           These
                                         series.

were the first steps taken by Newton, and, as he
himself informs us, they would have entirely escaped

from his memory if he had not, a few weeks
before,* found the notes which he made upon the
subject. When he had obtained this method, it oc
curred to him that the very same process was appli
cable to the ordinates, and, by following out this
idea, he discovered the general method of reducing
radical quantities composed of several terms into
infinite series, and was thus led to the discovery of
the celebrated Binomial Theorem. He now neglected
entirely his methods of interpolation, and employed
that theorem alone as the easiest and most direct
method for the quadratures of curves, and in the solu
tion of many questions which had not even been
                                      skilful mathematicians.
attAefmteprtedhavbiyngthaeppmlioesdt  the Binomial theorem to  the
rectification of curves, and to the determination of
the surfaces and contents of solids, and the position
of their centres of gravity, he discovered the general
principle of deducing the areas of curves from the
ordinate, by considering the area as a nascent quan
tity, increasing by continual fluxion in the propor
tion of the length of the ordinate, and supposing
the abscissa to increase uniformly in proportion to
the time. In imitation of Cavalerius, he called the
momentary increment of a line a point, though it is
not a geometrical point, but an infinitely short line ;
and the momentary increment of an area or surface
he called a line, though it is not a geometrical line,
but an infinitely narrow surface. By thus regarding
lines as generated by the motion of points, surfaces
by the motions of lines, and solids by the motion of
surfaces, and by considering that the ordinates, ab
scissae, &c. of curves thus formed, vary according
to a regular law depending on the equation of the

hiscurve, he deduces from this equation the velocitiesaaa it it,
                                it
   itwith which these quantities are generated ; and by
 the rules of infinite series he obtains the ultimatea
value of the quantity required. To the velocities a
with which every line or quantity is generated,
 Newton gave the name of Fluxions, and to the linesa
or quantities themselves that of Fluents. This
 method constitutes the doctrine of fluxions which;
 Newton had invented previous to 1666, when the
breaking out of the plague at Cambridge drove himit

 from that city, and turned his attention to other
 subjects.

    But though Newton had not communicated this
          invention to any of his friends, he composed

freatreatise, entitled Analysis per equationes numero
terminorum infinitas, in which the principle of fluxions
and its numerous applications are clearly pointed
out. In the month of June, 1669, he communicated
this work to Dr. Barrow, who mentions in letter
to Mr. Collins, dated the 20th June, 1669, as the pro
duction of friend of his residing at Cambridge, who
possesses fine genius for such inquiries. On the
31st July, he transmitted the work to Collins; and
having received his approbation of he informs him
that the name of the author of was Newton,
fellow of his own college, and young man who
had only two years before taken his degree of M.A.
Collins took copy of this treatise, and returned the
original to Dr. Barrow and this copy having been
found among Collins's papers by his friend Mr. Wil
liam Jones, and compared with the original manu
script borrowed from Newton, was published with
the consent of Newton in 1711, nearly fifty years
after was written.

   Though the discoveries contained in this treatise
were not at first given to the world, yet they were
made generally known to mathematicians by the
correspondence of Collins, who communicated them
to James Gregory to MM. Bertet and Vernon in

and to Strode, Townsend, and Oldenburg, in letters
dated between 1669 and 1672.
Hitherto the method of fluxions was known only
to the friends of Newton and their correspondents ;
but, in the first edition of the Principia, which ap
peared in 1687, he published, for the first time, the
fundamental principle of the fluxionary calculus, in
the second lemma of the second book. No infor
mation, however, is here given respecting the algo

rithm or notation of the calculus ; and it was not till
1693-5[?] that it

                   second volume of Dr.              Wallis's works,
which were published in that year. This informa
tion was extracted from two letters of Newton
written in 1692.
About the year 1672, Newton had undertaken to
publish an edition of Kinckhuysen's Algebra, with
notes and additions. He therefore drew up a trea
tise, entitled, A Method of Fluxions, which he pro

ofposed as an introduction to that work ; but the fear

     being involved in disputes about this new dis
covery, or perhaps the wish to render it more com
plete, or to have the sole advantage of employing
it in his physical researches, induced him to abandon
this design. At a later period of his life he again
resolved to give it to the world ; but it did not ap
pear till after his death, when it was translated into
English, and published in 1736, with a commentary
by Mr. John Colson, Professor of Mathematics in

Cambridge.*

  To the first edition of Newton's Optics, which
appeared in 1704, there were added two mathematical

in 1712, by Dr. Machm, secretary to the Royal So
ciety. With the view of stimulating mathematicians
to write annotations on this admirable work, the
celebrated S'Gravesande published a tract, entitled,
Specimen Commentarii in Arithmeticam Universalem ;
and Maclaurin's Algebra seems to have been drawn
up in consequence of this appeal.
Among the mathematical works of Newton we
must not omit to enumerate a small tract entitled,
Methodus Differentialis, which was published with
his consent in 1711. It consists of six propositions,
which contain a method of drawing a parabolic curve
through any given number of      points, and which          are
useful for constructing tables  by the interpolation
                                                             of
series, and for solving problems depending on the
quadrature of curves.
Another mathematical treatise of Newton's was
published for the first time in 1779, in Dr. Horsley's
edition of his works.* It is entitled, Artis Analytica
Specimina, vel Geometria Analytica. In editing this
work, which occupies about 130 quarto pages, Dr.
Horsley used three manuscripts, one of which was
in the handwriting of the author ; another, written
in an unknown hand, was given by Mr. William
Jones to the Honourable Charles Cavendish ; and a
third, copied from this by Mr. James Wilson, the
editor of Robins's works, was given to Dr. Horsley
by Mr. John Nourse, bookseller to the king. Dr.
Horsley has divided it into twelve chapters, which
treat of infinite series ; of the reduction of affected
equations ; of the specious resolution of equations ;
of the doctrine of fluxions ; of maxima and minima ;
of drawing tangents to curves ; of the radius of cur

vature ; of the quadrature of curves ; of the area of
curves which are comparable with the conic sec
tions ; of the construction of mechanical problems,
and on finding the lengths of curves.

              SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS.                            179

   In enumerating the mathematical works of our

author, we must not overlook his solutions of the
celebrated problems proposed by Bernouilli and
Leibnitz.     On the Kalends of January, 1697, John
Bernouilli    addressed a letter to the most distin
guished mathematicians in Europe,f challenging
them      to  solve the two following problems :
              determine the curve line connecting              two
     1.  To
given points which are at different distances from
the horizon, and not in the same  vertical  line, along
which a body passing by its own   gravity,  and begin
ning to move at the upper point, shall descend to the
lower point in the shortest time possible.
2. To find a curve line of this property that the
two segments of a right line drawn from a given
point through the curve, being raised to any given
power, and taken together, may make every where
the same sum.
   On the day after he received these problems,
Newton addressed to Mr. Charles Montague, the
President of the Royal Society, a solution of them
both. He announced that the curve required in the
first problem must be     a cycloid, and
method of determining      it. He solved    he gave a
                                              also the
second problem, and he showed that by the same
method other curves might be found which shall cut
off three or more segments having the like proper
ties. Leibnitz, who was struck with the beauty of
the problem, requested Bernouilli, who had allowed
six months for its solution, to extend the period to
twelve months. This delay was readily granted,
solutions were obtained from Newton, Leibnitz, and
the Marquis de L'Hopital; and although that of
Newton was anonymous,     "yetat nBquearmno?'uillsiayrsecoheg,nis"eedx

The last mathematical effort of our author was

which                    for the purpose, as he    expressed it,

of feeling the pulse of the English analysts." The
object of this problem was to determine the curve
which should cut at right angles an infinity of curves
of a given nature, but expressible by the same equa
tion. Newton received this problem about five
o'clock in the afternoon, as he was returning from
the Mint ; and though the problem was extremely
difficult, and he himself much fatigued with business,
yet he finished the solution of it before he went
to bed.
Such is a brief account of the mathematical writ
ings of Sir Isaac Newton, not one of which were
voluntarily communicated to the world by himself.
The publication of his Universal Arithmetic         pisartsaoidf
to have been a breach of confidence on the
Whiston ; and, however this may be, it was an un
finished work, never designed for the public. The
publication of his Quadrature of Curves, and of his
Enumeration of Curve Lines, was rendered neces
sary, in consequence of plagiarisms from the manu
scripts of them which he had lent to his friends, and
the rest of his analytical writings did not appear till
after his death. It is not easy to penetrate into the
motives by which         thIfis    great man was    on these
occasions actuated.              his object was to  keep pos

he adopted the very worst method of securing his
tranquillity. That this was the leading motive under
which he acted, there is little reason to douht. The
early delay in the publication of his method of flux
ions, after the breaking out of the plague at Cam
bridge, was probably owing to his not having com
pleted the algorithm of that calculus ; but no apology
can be made for the imprudence of withholding it
any longer from the public. Had he published this
noble discovery even previous to 1673, when his
great rival had not even entered upon those studies
which led him to the same method, he would have
secured to himself the undivided honour of the
invention, and Leibnitz could have aspired to no other
fame but that of an improver of the doctrine of flux
ions. But he unfortunately acted otherwise. He
announced to his friends that he possessed a method
of great generality and power ; he communicated to
them a general account of its principles and applica
tions ; and the information which was thus conveyed
directed the attention of mathematicians to subjects
to which they might not have otherwise applied their
powers. In this way the discoveries which he had
previously made were made subsequently by others ;
and Leibnitz, in place of appearing in the theatre of
science as the disciple and the follower of Newton,
stood forth with all the dignity of a rival ; and, by
the early publication of his discoveries had nearly
placed himself on the throne which Newton was
destined to ascend.
It would be inconsistent with the popular nature
of a work like this, to enter into a detailed history

In the beginning of 1673, Leibnitz came to London
in the suite of the Duke of Hanover, and he became
acquainted with the great men who then adorned
the capital of England. Among these was 01de#

burg, a countryman of his own, who was then sec
retary to the Royal Society. About the beginning
of March, in the same year, Leibnitz went to Paris,
where, with the assistance of Huygens, he devoted

himself to the study of the higher geometry. In
the month of July he renewed his correspondence
with Oldenburg, and he communicated to him some of
the discoveries which he had made relative to series,
particularly the series for a circular arc in terms of
the tangent. Oldenburg informed him in return of
the discoveries on series which had been made by
Newton and Gregory ; and in 1676 Newton commu
nicated to him, through Oldenburg, a letter of fifteen
closely printed quarto pages, containing many of his
analytical discoveries, and stating that he possessed
a general method of drawing tangents, which he
thought it necessary to conceal in two sentences of
transposed characters. In this letter neither the
method of fluxions nor any of its principles are
communicated ; but the superiority of the method
over all others is so fully described, that Leibnitz
could scarcely fail to discover that Newton pos
sessed that secret of which geometers had so long
been in quest.
Had Leibnitz at the time of receiving this letter
been entirely ignorant of his own differential method,
the information thus conveyed to him by Newton
could not fail to stimulate his curiosity, and excite
his-mightiest efforts to obtain possession of so great
a secret. That this new method was intimately
connected with the subject of series was clearly in
dicated by Newton; and as Leibnitz was deeply
versed in this branch of analysis, it is far from im
probable that a mind of such strength and acuteness
might attain his object by direct investigation. That
this was the case may be inferred from his letter to
Oldenburg   (to be communicated to   Newton) of the
            1677, where he mentions  that he had for
Slst June,
some time been in possession of a method of draw

method, which was no other than the differential
calculus. He describes the algorithm which he had
adopted, the formation of differential equations, and
the application of the calculus to various geometrical
and analytical questions. No answer seems to have
been returned to this letter either by Newton or
Oldenburg, and, with the exception of a short letter
from Leibnitz to Oldenburg, dated 12th July, 1677,
no further correspondence seems to have taken
place. This, no doubt, arose from the death of Ol
denburg in the month of August, 1677,* when the
two rival geometers pursued their researches with
all the ardour which the greatness of the subject
was so well calculated to inspire.

   In the hands of Leibnitz the differential calculus
made rapid progress. In the Acta Eruditorum, which

was published at Leipsic in November, 1684, he gave
the first account of describing its algorithm in the
same manner as he had done in his letter to Olden
burg, and pointing out its application to the drawing
of tangents, and the determination of maxima and
minima. He makes remote reference to the simi
lar calculus of Newton, but lays no claim to the sole

invention of the differential method. In the same
work for June, 1686, he resumes the subject and

Leibnitz was nearly the same as his own ; and this
much he might have said, whether he believed that

papers of Collins, or was the independent inventor
of his own. It is more than probable, indeed, that
when Newton wrote this scholium he regarded
Leibnitz as a second inventor ; but when he found
that Leibnitz and his friends had showed a willing
ness to believe, and had even ventured to throw out
the suspicion, that he himself had borrowed the doc
trine of fluxions from the differential calculus, he
seems to have altered the opinion which he had
formed of his rival, and to have been willing in his
turn to retort the charge.

   This change of opinion was brought about by a
series of circumstances over which he had no con
trol. M. Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a Swiss mathe
matician, resident in London, communicated to the
Royal Society, in 1699, a paper on the line of quick

copies of the same manuscripts of Newton." This
imprudent remark, which by no means amounts to a
charge of plagiarism, for Leibnitz is actually desig

showing that the English mathematicians had been
cherishing suspicions unfavourable to Leibnitz, and

in a state of repose, though ready to break out on
the slightest provocation.

   When Newton's Optics appeared in 1704, accom
panied by his Treatise on the Quadrature of Curves,
and his enumeration of lines of the third order, the
editor of the Leipsic Acts (whom Newton supposed
to be Leibnitz himself) took occasion to review the
first of these tracts. After giving an imperfect
analysis of its contents, he compared the method
of fluxions with the differential calculus, and, in a
sentence of some ambiguity, he states that Newton
employed fluxions in place of the differences of Leib
nitz, and made use of them in his Principia in the
same manner as Honoratus Fabri, in his Synopsis
of Geometry, had substituted progressive motion in

place of the indivisibles of Cavaleri.* As Fabri,
therefore, was not the inventor of the method
which is here referred to, but borrowed it from Ca

there can be no doubt that the artful insinuation
contained in the above passage was intended to con

renders it doubly odious ; and we are persuaded that
no candid reader can peruse the passage without a
strong conviction that it justifies, in the fullest mau

he merited the full measure of rebuke which was
dealt out to him by the friends of Newton, and de
served those severe reprisals which doubtless im-

bittered the rest of his days. He who dared to ac
cuse man like Newton, or indeed any man holding
a fair character in society, with the odious crime of
plagiarism, placed himself without the pale of the
ordinary courtesies of life, and deserved to have
the same charge thrown back upon himself. The
man who conceives his fellow to be capable of such
intellectual felony, avows the possibility of himself
committing it, and almost substantiates the weakest
evidence of the worst accusers.
Dr. Keill, as the representative of Newton's
friends, could not brook this base attack upon his
countryman. In letter printed in the Philosophi

disown publicly the injurious sense which his words
might bear. When this letter was read to the
188        SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

society, Keill justified himself to Sir Isaac Newton
and the other members by showing them the ob
noxious review of the Quadrature of Curves in the
Leipsic Acts. They all agreed in attaching the same
injurious meaning to the passage which we formerly
quoted, and authorized Keill to explain and defend
his statement. He accordingly addressed a letter
to Sir Hans Sloane, which was read at the society
on the 24th May, 1711, and a copy of which was
ordered to be sent to Leibnitz. In this letter, which
is one of considerable length, he declares that he
never meant to state that Leibnitz knew either the
name of    tNheewrteoanl 'smemaentinhgodoof rthtehepafsosramgeowf anso,ta"ttiohnat,

and that
Newton was the first inventor of fluxions or of the
differential calculus, and that he had given, in two
letters to Oldenburg, and which he had transmitted
to Leibnitz, indications of it sufficiently intelligible
to an acute mind, from which Leibnitz derived, or at
least might derive, the principles of his calculus."
The charge of plagiarism which Leibnitz thought
was implied in the former letter of his antagonist

is here greatly modified, if not altogether denied.
Keill expresses only an opinion that the letter seen
by Leibnitz contained intelligible indications of the
fluxionary calculus. Even if this opinion were cor
rect, it is no proof that Leibnitz either saw these indi

cations or availed himself of them, or if he did per
ceive them, it might have been in consequence of his
having previously been in possession of the differential
calculus, or having enjoyed some distant view of it.
Leibnitz should, therefore, have allowed the dispute
to terminate here ; for no ingenuity on his part, and
no additional facts, could affect an opinion which
any other person as well as Keill was entitled to
maintain.
Leibnitz, however, took a different view of the
subject, and wrote a letter to Sir Hans Sloane,
dated December 19, 1711, which excited new feelings,

acquainted with the circumstances of the case ;* he
called upon the society to silence his vain and un
just clamours,f which, he believed, were disapproved
by Newton himself, who was well acquainted with

the facts, and who, he was persuaded, would will
ingly give his opinion on the matter.
   This unfortunate letter was doubtless the cause
of all the rancour and controversy which so speedily
followed, and it placed his antagonist in a new and a
more favourable position. It may be correct, though

letter consisted in his appropriating to himself the
opinions of the reviewer in the Leipsic Acts, by
declaring that, in review which charged Newton
with plagiarism, every person had got what was

position of the party who had first disturbed the
tranquillity of science by maligning its most distin
guished ornament ; and the Royal Society was im
periously called upon to throw all the light they
could upon a transaction which had exposed their
venerable president to so false a charge. The so
ciety, too, had become a party to the question, by
their approbation and transmission of Keill's second
letter, and were on that account alone bound to vin

dicate the step which they had taken.
When the letter of Leibnitz, therefore, was read,
Keill appealed to the registers of the society for
the proofs of what he had advanced ; Sir Isaac also
expressed his displeasure at the obnoxious passage
in the Leipsic Review, and at the defence of it by
Leibnitz, and he left it to the society to act as they
thought proper. A committee was therefore ap
pointed on the 11th March, consisting of Dr. Arbuth-
not, Mr. Hill, Dr. Halley, Mr. Jones, Mr. Machin,
and Mr. Burnet, who were instructed to examine
the ancient registers of the society, to inquire into
the dispute, and to produce such documents as they
should find, together with their own opinions on the
subject. On      trheepo2r4tth: --April

March, to Paris, where he kept a correspondence

with Mr. Collins by means of Mr. Oldenburg, till

and Amsterdam to Hanover : and that Mr. Collins

standing that he was shown by Dr. Pell that it was
Newton's method, persisted in maintaining it to be
his own invention, by reason that he had found it by
himself without knowing what Newton had done
before, and had much improved it. And we find no
mention of his having any other differential method
than Newton's before his letter of the 21st of June,
1677, which was a year after a copy of Mr. Newton's
letter of the 10th of December, 1672, had been sent

the first inventor of the method. And we believe
that those who have reputed Mr. Leibnitz the first
inventor knew little or nothing of his correspondence
with Mr. Collins and Mr. Oldenburg long before, nor
of Mr. Newton's having that method above fifteen
years before Mr. Leibnitz began to publish it in the

asserting the same, has been no ways injurious to
Mr. Leibnitz. And we submit to the judgment of
the society whether the extract and papers now pre
sented to you, together with what is extant to the
same purpose in Dr. Wallis's third volume, may not

deserve to be made public."
   This report being read, the society unanimously
ordered the collection of letters and manuscripts to
be printed, and appointed Dr. Halley, Mr. Jones, and
Mr. Machin to superintend the press. Complete
copies of it, under the title of Commercium Epistoli-
cum D. Johannis Collins et aliorum de analyst promota,
were laid before the society on the 8th January, 1713,
and Sir Isaac Newton, as president, ordered a copy
to be delivered to each person of the committee ap
pointed for that purpose, to examine it before its

publication.
Leibnitz received information of the appearance
of the Commercium Epistolicum when he was at
"Vitehnatna;        "being                             I

Leibnitz, with reflections, in a loose sheet entitled
Charta Volans, and dated July 29, 1713. It was
widely circulated without either the name of the
author, printer, or place of publication, and was
communicated to the Journal Literaire by another
friend of Leibnitz, who added remarks of his own,
and stated, that when Newton published the Principia
in 1687, he did not understand the true differential
method ;   and that  he took his fluxions from Leibnitz.

  In this  state of
conceived the design of reconciling the two distin
guished philosophers ; and in a letter dated April 28,
1714,* he addressed himself to Leibnitz, who was
still at Vienna. In replying to this letter, Leibnitz

                                   procured  a book to  be published,
which was written purposely to discredit him, and
sent it to Germany, &c. as in the name of the
society ;" and he stated that there was room to doubt
whether Newton knew his invention before he had it of
him. Mr. Chamberlayne communicated this letter
to Sir Isaac Newton, who replied that Leibnitz had
attacked his reputation in 1705, by intimating that he
had borrowed from him the method of fluxions ;
that if Mr. C. could point out to him any thing in
which he had injured Mr. Leibnitz, he would give
him satisfaction ; that he would not retract things
which he knew to be true ; and that he believed that
the Royal Society had done no injustice by the publi
cation of the Commercium Epistolicum.
The Royal Society, having learned that Leibnitz
complained of their having condemned him unheard,
inserted a declaration in their journals on the 20th
May, 1714, that they did not pretend that the report

of their committee should pass for a decision of the

society. Mr. Chamberlayne sent a copy of this to
Leibnitz, along with Sir Isaac's letter, and Dr. Keill's

that there were other letters among those of Olden
burg and Collins which should have been published ;
and that on his return to Hanover, he would be able
to publish a Commercium Epistolicum which would
be of service to the history of learning." When
this letter was read to the Royal Society, Sir Isaac
remarked, that the last part of it injuriously accused

the society of having made a partial selection of
papers for the Commercium Epistolicum ; that he

did not interfere in any way in the publication of
that work, and had even withheld from the com
mittee two letters, one from Leibnitz in 1693, and
another from Wallis in 1695, which were highly
                his cause. He stated that he                     tdhiadt,noift

might be published in the Philosophical Transac

About this time the Abb6 Conti, a noble Vene
tian, came to England. He was a correspondent of
Leibnitz, and in a letter which he had received soon
after his  arrival,* he                              hi"s   dispute with

he pretends that all matter is heavy, or that each par

The above letter to the Abbe Conti was generally
shown in London, and came to be much talked of at
court, in consequence of Leibnitz having been privy
counsellor to the Elector of Hanover when that
prince ascended the throne of England. Many
persons of distinction, and particularly the Abbe
Conti, urged Newton to reply to Leibnitz's letter,
but he resisted all their solicitations. One day,
however, King George I. inquired when Sir Isaac
Newton's answer to Leibnitz would appear; and
when Sir Isaac heard this, he addressed a long reply
to the Abbe Conti, dated February 26th, 0. 8. 1715-
16. This letter, written with dignified severity, is
a triumphant refutation of the allegations of his ad

In transmitting this letter to Leibnitz, the Abbe
Conti informed him that he himself had read with
great attention, and without the least prejudice, the
Commercium Epistolicum, and the little piece* that
contains the extract ; that he had also seen at the

Royal Society the original papers of the Commer

fluxions or infinitesimals before you, or whether you
had it before him. You published it first, it is true,
but you have owned also that Sir Isaac Newton had
given many hints of it in his letters to Mr. Olden
burg and others. This is proved very largely in the
Commercium, and in the extract of it. What an

public, in order to form an exact judgment of the
affair." The Abbe adds, that Mr. Leibnitz's own
friends waited for his answer with great impatience,
and that they thought he could not dispense with

answering, if not Dr. Keill, at least Sir Isaac New-

terms.
Leibnitz was not long in complying with this
request. He addressed a letter to the Abb6 Conti,
dated April 9th, 1716, but he sent it through M. Ra-
mond at Paris, to communicate it to others. When
it was received by the Abbe Conti, Newton wrote
                             which were communicated
observations upon            ; it,

The death of Leibnitz on the 14th November,                          ;
1716, put an end to this controversy, and Newton

a passage which had been so erroneously inter

  In viewing this controversy, at the distance of

inmore than a century, when the passions of the
dividual combatants have been allayed, and national
jealousies extinguished, it is not difficult to form a
correct estimate of the conduct and claims of the
two rival analysts. By the unanimous verdict of
all nations, it has been decided that Newton invented
fluxions at least ten years before Leibnitz. Some
of the letters of Newton which bore reference to
this great discovery were perused by the German
mathematician ; but there is no evidence whatever
that he borrowed his differential calculus from these
letters. Newton was therefore    the first inventor,

and Leibnitz the second. It was  impossible that the
former could have been a plagiarist; but it was
possible for the latter. Had the letters of Newton
contained even stronger indications than they do of
the new calculus, no evidence short of proof could
have justified any allegation against Leibnitz's
honour. The talents which he displayed in the im

rowing his fluxions from Leibnitz T This odious
accusation was made by Leibnitz himself, and by
Bernouilli ; and we have seen that the former re

peated it again and again, as if his own good name
rested on the destruction of that of his rival. It was

this charge against Newton that gave rise to the at
tack of Keill, and the publication of the Commercium
Epistolicum; and, notwithstanding this high provo
cation, the committee of the Royal Society contented
themselves with asserting Newton's priority, with
out retorting the charge of plagiarism upon his rival.

   Although an attempt has been recently made to
place the conduct of Leibnitz on the same level with
that of Newton, yet the circumstances of the case
will by no means justify such a comparison. The
conduct of Newton was at all times dignified and
just. He knew his rights, and he boldly claimed
them. Conscious of his integrity, he spurned with
indignation the charge of plagiarism with which an
ungenerous rival had so insidiously loaded him ; and

if there was one step in his frank and unhesitating

procedure which posterity can blame it is his omis
sion, in the third edition of the Principia, of the
references to the differential calculus of Leibnitz.

This omission, however, was perfectly just. The

scholium which he had left out was a mere historical
statement of the fact, that the German mathemati
cian had sent him a method which was the same as
his own ; and when he found that this simple asser
tion had been held by Leibnitz and others as a re
cognition of his independent claim to the invention,
he was bound either to omit it altogether, or to
 enter into explanations which might have involved
 him in a new controversy.

    The conduct of Leibnitz was not marked with the
 same noble lineaments. That he was the aggressor
 is universally allowed. That he first dared to
 breathe the charge of plagiarism against Newton,
 and that he often referred to has been sufficiently

no appropriate letters to produce. All this is now
matter of history ; and we may find some apology
for it in his excited feelings, and in the insinuations
which were occasionally thrown out against the
originality of his discovery ; but for other parts of
his conduct we seek in vain for an excuse. When
he assailed the philosophy of Newton in his letters
to the Abbe Conti, he exhibited perhaps only the
petty feelings of a rival ; but when he dared to ca
lumniate that great man in his correspondence with
the Princess of Wales, by whom he was respected
and beloved; when he ventured to represent the
Newtonian philosophy as physically false, and as
dangerous to religion ; and when he founded these
accusations on passages in the Principia and the
Optics glowing with all the fervour of genuine
piety, he cast a blot upon his name, which all his

   Statement that he laboured under Mental Derangement.

   From the year 1669, when Newton was installed
in the Lucasian chair, till 1695, when he ceased to
reside in Cambridge, he seems to have been seldom
absent from his college more than three or four

weeks in the year. In 1675, he received a dispensa
tion from Charles II. to continue in his fellowship
of Trinity College without taking orders, and we

have already seen in the preceding chapter how his
time was occupied till the publication of the Principia
in 1687.

   An event now occurred which drew Newton from
the seclusion of his studies, and placed him upon the
theatre of public life. Desirous of re-establishing
the Catholic faith in its former supremacy, King
James II. had begun to assail the rights and privi
leges of his Protestant subjects. Among otherillegal
acts, he sent his letter of mandamus to the University
of Cambridge to order Father Francis, an ignorant
monk of the Benedictine order, to be received as
master of arts, and to enjoy all the privileges of this
degree, without taking the oaths of allegiance and
supremacy. The university speedily perceived the

consequences which might arise from such a meas
ure. Independent of the infringement of their rights
which such an order involved, it was obvious that
the highest interests of the university were endan
gered, and that Roman Catholics might soon become
a majority in the convocation. They therefore
unanimously refused to listen to the royal order, and
they did this with a firmness of purpose which irri
tated the despotic court. The king reiterated his
commands, and accompanied them with the severest
threatenings in case of disobedience. The Catho
lics were not idle in supporting the views of the
sovereign. The honorary degree of M.A. which
conveys no civil rights to its possessor, having been
formerly given to the secretary of the ambassador
 from Morocco, it was triumphantly urged that the
University of Cambridge had a greater regard for a
 Mahometan than for a Roman Catholic, and was
 more obsequious to the ambassador from Morocco
 than to their own lawful sovereign. Though this
 reasoning might impose upon the ignorant, it pro*

duced little effect upon the members of the univer
sity. A few weak-minded individuals, however,
were disposed to yield a reluctant consent to the
royal wishes. They proposed to confer the degree,
and at the same time to resolve that it should not in
future be regarded as a precedent. To this it was
replied, that the very act of submission in one case
would be a stronger argument for continuing the
practice than any such resolution would be against
its repetition. The university accordingly remained
firm in their original decision. The vice-chancellor
was summoned before the ecclesiastical commission
to answer for this act of contempt. Newton was
among the number of those who resisted the wishes
of the court, and he was consequently chosen one
of the nine delegates who were appointed to defend
the independence of the university. These dele
gates appeared before the High Court. They main
tained that not a single precedent could be found to
justify so extraordinary a measure ; and they showed

that Charles II. had, under similar circumstances,
been pleased to withdraw his mandamus. This
representation had its full weight, and the king was
induced to abandon his design.*
The part which Newton had taken in this affair,
and the high character which he now held in the
scientific world, induced his friends to propose him
as member of parliament for the university. He
was accordingly elected in 1688, though by a very
narrow majority,f and he sat      in the Convention
Parliament till its dissolution.
                                   In the year 1688
and 1689, Newton was absent from Cambridge during
the greater part of the year, owing, we presume, to
his attendance in parliament; but it appears from

the books of the University that from 1690 to 1695
he was seldom absent, and must therefore have
renounced his parliamentary duties.
   During his stay in London he had no doubt expe
rienced the unsuitableness of his income to the new
circumstances in which he was placed, and it is
probable that this was the cause of the limitation
of his residence to Cambridge. His income was
certainly very confined, and but little suited to the
generosity of his disposition. Demands were doubt
less made upon it by some of his less wealthy rela
tives ; and there is reason to think that he himself,
as well as his influential friends, had been looking
forward to some act of liberality on the part of the

government.

   An event however occurred which will ever form
an epoch in his history ; and it is a singular circum
stance, that this incident has been for more than a
century unknown to his own countrymen, and has
been accidentally brought to light by the examina
tion of the manuscripts of Huygens. This event
has been magnified into a temporary aberration of
mind, which is said to have arisen from a cause
scarcely adequate to its production.
While he was attending divine service in a winter
morning, he had left in his study a favourite little
dog called Diamond. Upon returning from chapel
he found that it had overturned a lighted taper on
his desk, which set fire to several papers on which
he had recorded the results of some optical experi
ments. These papers are said to have contained the
labours of many years, and it has been stated that

know the mischief you have done me !" It is a
curious circumstance that Newton never refers to
the experiments which he is said to have lost on this
occasion, and his nephew, Mr. Conduit, makes no
allusion to the event itself. The distress, however

to affect even the powers of his understanding.

The first publication of the preceding statement
produced a strong sensation among the friends and
admirers of Newton. They could not easily believe
in the prostration of that intellectual             strength   which
had unbarred the strongholds of the                 universe.    The

unbroken equanimity of Newton's mind, the purity
of his moral character, his temperate and abstemious
life, his ardent and unaffected piety, and the weak
ness of his imaginative powers, all indicated a mind
which was not likely to be overset by any affliction
to which it could be exposed. The loss of a few
experimental records could                   never  hIfavtehedyistuwrebreed  the

mightiest discoveries were completed and diffused

placed on the loftiest pinnacle of                  earthly ambition.
The incredulity which such views                     could not fail to
encourage was increased by the                      novelty of the in
formation. No English biographer had ever alluded
to such an event. History and tradition were equally
silent, and it was not easy to believe that the Luca-

      exertions of Newton had terminated with the publica

      his mind was the cause of his abandoning the sci
      ences, others indirectly questioned the sincerity of

      new work on any branch of science, but contented
      himself with giving to the world those which he had
      composed long before that epoch, confining himself
      to the completion of those parts which might require
      development. We may also remark, that even
      these developments appear always to be derived
      from experiments and observations formerly made,
      such as the additions to the second edition of the
      Principia, published in 1713, the experiments on
      thick plates, those on diffraction, and the chymical
      queries placed at the end of the Optics in 1704 for
      in giving an account of these experiments Newton                                                 ;;
      distinctly says that they were taken from ancient
      manuscripts which he had formerly composed and
      he adds, that though he felt the necessity of extend
      ing them, or rendering them more perfect, he was
      not able to resolve to do this, these matters being no
      longer in his way. Thus appears that though he

and one which might lead to the strangest conclu

sions, particularly if we refer it to the fatal accident
which Newton had suffered in 1695."
The celebrated Marquis de la Place viewed the
illness of Newton in a light still more painful to his
friends. He maintained that he never recovered the
vigour of his intellect, and he was persuaded that
Newton's theological inquiries did not commence
till after that afflicting epoch of his life. He even
commissioned Professor Gautier of Geneva to make
inquiries on this subject during his visit to England,

as if it concerned the interests of truth and justice
to show that Newton became a Christian and a
theological writer only after the decay of his
strength and the eclipse of his reason.
Such having been the consequences of the dis
cHluoysugreens,ofI  Newton's illness by the        manuscript of
                    felt it to be a sacred duty    to the memory
of that great man, to the feelings of his countrymen,
and to the interests of Christianity itself, to inquire
into the nature and history of that indisposition
which seems to have been so much misrepresented
and misapplied. From the ignorance of so extraor
dinary an event which has prevailed for such a long
period in England, it might have been urged with
some plausibility that Huygens had mistaken the
real import of the information that was conveyed to
him ; or that the Scotchman from whom he received
it had propagated an idle and a groundless rumour.
But we are, fortunately, not confined to this very
reasonable mode of defence. There exists at Cam
bridge a manuscript journal written by Mr. Abraham
de la Pryme, who was a student in the university

1685. This manuscript is in the possession of his
collateral descendant, George Pryme, Esq.,            Profes
sor of Political Economy at Cambridge, to            whom        I

relate. There is one Mr. Newton (whom                          I have
very oft seen), Fellow of Trinity College, that is
mighty famous for his learning, being a most excel
lent mathematician, philosopher, divine, &c. He
has been Fellow of the Royal Society these many
years; and among other very learned books and
tracts, he's written one upon the mathematical prin
ciples of philosophy, which has got him a mighty
name, he having received, especially from Scotland,
abundance of congratulatory letters for the same ;
but of all the books that he ever wrote, there was
one of colours and light, established upon thousands
of experiments which he had been twenty years of
making, and which had cost him many hundred of
pounds. This book, which he valued so much, and
which was so much talked of, had the ill luck to
perish and be utterly lost just when the learned
author was almost at putting a conclusion at the
same, after this manner: In a winter's morning,
leaving it among his other papers on his study table
while he went to chapel, the candle, which he had
unfortunately left burning there too, catched hold
by some means of other papers, and they fired the
aforesaid book, and utterly consumed it and several
other valuable writings ; and, which is most wonder
ful, did no further mischief. But when Mr. Newton
came from chapel, and had seen what was done,
every one thought he would have run mad, he was

so troubled thereat that he was not himself for a
month after. A long account of this his system of
light and colours you may find in the Transactions

of the Royal Society, which he had sent up to them
long before this sad mischance happened unto him."

  apFrom this extract we are enabled to fix the
proximate date of the accident by which Newton
lost his papers. It must have been previous to the
3d January,                  month     before the   date of the
extract ; but  1692, a      fix it by   the dates

manuscript, we should place it about the 29th No- 1

vember, 1692, eighteen months previous to the
conversation between Collins and Huygens. The
manner in which Mr. Pryme refers to Newton's
state of mind is that which is used every day when
we speak of the loss of tranquillity which arises
from the ordinary afflictions of life ; and the meaning
of the passage amounts to nothing more than that
Newton was very much troubled by the destruction
of his papers, and did not recover his serenity, and
return to his                             for a month.    The
very phrase    thuasut al"  occupations,  thought he    would
                            every person

was produced ; and, whatever degree of indisposi
tion may be implied in the phrase "he was not
himself for a month after," we are entitled to infer
that one month was the period of its duration, and
that previous to the 3dFebruary, 1692, the date of Mr.
Pryme's memorandum, "Newton was himself again."
These facts and dates cannot be reconciled with
those in Huygens's manuscript. It appears from
that document, that, so late as May, 1694, Newton

Newton wrote his four                      celebrated   --leltettetresrs  to Dr.
Bentley on the Existence                                                  which
                                           of a Deity,
evince a power of thought and a serenity of mind
absolutely incompatible even with the slightest ob
scuration of his faculties. No man can peruse these
letters without the conviction that their author then
possessed the full vigour of his reason, and was
capable of understanding the most profound parts
of his writings. The first of these letters was writ
ten on the 10th December, 1692, the second on the
17th January, 1693, the third on the 25th February,
and the 4th on the 11th* February, 1693. His mind
was, therefore, strong and vigorous on these four
occasions; and as the letters were written at the
express request of Dr. Bentley, who had been ap
pointed to deliver the lecture founded by Mr. Boyle
for vindicating the fundamental principles of natural
and revealed religion, we must consider such a re
quest as showing his opinion of the strength and
freshness of his friend's mental powers.
In 1692, Newton, at the request of Dr. Wallis,
transmitted to him the first proposition of his book
on quadratures, with examples of it in first, second,
and third fluxions, f These examples were written
in consequence of an application from his friend;
and the author of the review of the Commercium
Epistolicum, in which this fact is quoted, draws the
conclusion, that he had not at that time forgotten
his method of second fluxions. It appears, also,
from the second book of the Optics,J that in the
month of June, 1692, he had been occupied with the
subject of haloes, and had made accurate observations
both on the colours and the diameters of the rings
in a halo which he had then seen around the sun.

But though these facts stand in direct contradic
tion to the statement recorded by Huygens, the
reader will be naturally anxious to know the real
nature and extent of the indisposition to which it
refers. The following letters,* written by Newton
himself, Mr. Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, and
Mr.   Millington of Magdalene College,
      throw much light upon the subject.   Cambridge,

Newton, as will be presently seen, had fallen into
a bad state of health some time in 1692, in conse
quence of which both his sleep and his appetite
were greatly affected. About the middle of Sep
tember, 1693, he had been kept awake for five nights
by this nervous disorder, and in this condition he
wrote the following letter to Mr. Pepys :

"     " Sir,  time  after  Mr.                  Sept. 13, 1693.

and that during that twelvemonth he neither ate nor

meant by not enjoying his former consistency of
mind ; but whatever be its import, it is obvious that
he must have been in a state of mind so sound as to
enable him to compose the four letters to Bentley,
all of which were written during the twelvemonth

here referred to.
   On the receipt of this letter, his friend Mr. Pepys
seems to have written to Mr. Millington of Magda
lene College to inquire after Mr. Newton's health ;
but the inquiry having been made in a vague man
ner, an answer equally vague was returned. Mr.
Pepys, however, who seems to have been deeply
anxious about Newton's health,           addressed   the  Mfoill,

It does not appear from the memoirs of Mr.

letter of Mr. Newton which occasioned this corres
pondence ; but we find that in less than two months
after the date of the preceding letter, an oppor
tunity occurred of introducing to him a Mr. Smith j
who wished to have his opinion on some problem in
the doctrine of chances. This letter from Pepys is
dated November 22d, 1693. Sir Isaac replied to it
on the 26th November, and wrote to Pepys again
on the 16th December, 1693; and in both these
letters he enters fully into the discussion of the
mathematical question which had been submitted to
his judgment.*

   It is obvious, from Newton's letter to Mr. Pepysy
that the subject of his receiving some favour from
the government had been a matter of anxiety with
himself, and of discussion among his friends.f Mr.
Millington was no doubt referring to this anxiety,
when he represents      Newton as            "anthahtonsouucrh     to        the
nation, and expresses   his surprise                                        per
                                                                   a

son should lye so neglected by those in power" And
we   find the           subject         distinctly referred        toprine
two   letters   same     to Mr.          Locke during the
               written
         year. In    "onBeeoinfgthfeuslley,  dated January 26th,

           he says,                          convinced that Mr.

and intend to sit still, unless my Lord Monmouth be
still my friend." Mr. Locke seems to have assured
him of the continued friendship of this nobleman,
and Mr. Newton, still referring to the same topic,
in a letter dated February 16th, 1691-2, remarks,'

* These three letters have been published by Lord Braybrooke in the'
Life and Correspondence of Mr. Pepys.
t This anxiety will be understood from the fart that, by an order of
council  dated January 28th, 1674 5, Mr.     pNeerwwtoenek,w"aosn  excused    from

low circumstances, as he represented."
216             SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

"lam very glad Lord Monmouth is still my friend,

but intend not to give his lordship and you any far

ther trouble. My inclinations are to sit still." In

a later letter to Mr. Locke, dated September, 1693,
and given below, he asks his pardon for saying or
thinking that there was a design to sell him an

office. In these letters Mr. Newton no doubt re

ferred to some appointment in London which he was
solicitous to obtain, and which Mr. Montague and
his other friends may have failed in procuring.
This opinion is confirmed by the letter of Mr. Mon
tague announcing to him his appointment to the
wardenship of the mint, in which he says that he is
very glad he can at last give him good proof of his

friendship.

   In the same month in which Newton wrote to Mr.
Pepys, we find him in correspondence with Mr.

Locke. Displeased with his opinions respecting
innate ideas, he had rashly stated that they struck
at the root of all morality ; and that he regarded
the author of such doctrines as a Hobbist. Upon
reconsidering these opinions, he addressed the fol
lowing remarkable letter to Locke, written three
days after his letter to Mr. Pepys, and conse
quently during the illness under which he then
laboured.

Although the first of these letters evinces the
existence of a nervous irritability which could not
fail to arise from want of appetite and of rest, yet it
is obvious that its author was in the full possession

of his mental powers. The answer of Mr. Locke,
indeed, is written upon that supposition ; and it de
serves to be remarked, that Mr. Dugald Stewart,
who first published a portion of these letters, never
imagines for a moment that Newton was labouring
under any mental alienation.
The opinion entertained by Laplace, that Newton
devoted his attention to theology only in the latter
part of his life, may be considered as deriving some
countenance from the fact, that the celebrated gene
ral scholium at the end of the second edition of the
Principia, published in 1713, did not appear in the
first  edition of that work.    This argument has been
ably                           C. Gregory of Edinburgh,
       controverted by Dr. J.
on the authority of a manuscript of Newton, which
seems to have been transmitted to his ancestor, Dr.
David Gregory, between the years 1687 and 1698.

This manuscript, which consists of twelve folio
pages in Newton's handwriting, contains, in the
form of additions and scholia to some propositions
in the third book of the Principia, an account of the
opinions of the ancient philosophers on gravitation
and motion, and on natural theology, with various
quotations from their works. Attached to this
manuscript are three very curious paragraphs. The
first two appear to have been the original draught
of the general scholium already referred to ; and
the third relates to the subject of an ethereal me
dium, respecting which he maintains an opinion
diametrically opposite to that which he afterward

published at the end of his Optics.* The first para
graph expresses nearly the same                          "idDeeauss  as some
sentences in the scholium beginning                                  summus

est ens aeternum, infinitum, absolute perfectum;"t
and it is remarkable that the second paragraph is
found only in the third edition of the Principia,
which appeared in 1726, the year before Newton's

death.

   In the middle of the year 1694, about the time
when our author is said to be beginning to under
stand the Principia, we find him occupied with the
difficult and profound subject of the lunar theory.

In order to procure observations for verifying the
equations which he had deduced from the theory of
gravity, he paid a visit to Flamstead, at the Royal
Observatory of Greenwich, on the 1st September,
1694, when he received from him a series of lunar
observations. On the 7th of October he wrote to
Flamstead that he had compared the observations
with  thoigsetthheerory",thaendmhoaodn'ssatthisefioerdy  himself     that by
both                                                     may be      reduced
to a good degree of exactness, perhaps to the exact
ness of two or three minutes." He wrote him again
on the 24th October, and the correspondence was

continued till 1698, Ne wton making constant appli

kindly permitted me to read, in the following words I:--" do not know

ciently aware of the importance of the inquiry, re
ceived his requests as if they were idle intrusions in
which the interests of science were but slightly con
cerned.*
     In reviewing the details which we have now given
respecting the health and occupations of Newton
from the beginning of 1692 till 1695, it is impossible
to draw any other conclusion than that he possessed
a sound mind, and was perfectly capable of carrying
on his mathematical, his metaphysical, and his astro
nomical inquiries. His friend and admirer, Mr.
Pepys, residmg within fifty miles of Cambridge, had
never heard of his being attacked with any illness

till he inferred it from the letter to himself written
in September, 1693. Mr. Millington, who lived in
the same university, had been equally unacquainted
with any such attack, and, after a personal inter

no reason to suspect that it hath at all touched his
understanding."
During this period of bodily indisposition, his
mind, though in a state of nervous irritability, and
disturbed by want of rest, was capable of putting
forth its highest powers. At the request of Dr.
Wallis he drew up an example of one of his pro
positions on the quadrature of curves in second
fluxions. He composed, at the desire of Dr. Bentley,
his profound and beautiful letters on the existence
of the Deity. He was requested by Locke to re
consider his opinions on the subject of innate ideas ;
and we find him grappling with the difficulties of the
lunar theory.
But with all these proofs of a vigorous mind, a
diminution of his mental powers has been rashly
inferred from the cessation of his great discoveries,
and from his unwillingness to enter upon new in
vestigations. The facts, however, here assumed
are as incorrect as the inference which is drawn
from them. The ambition of fame is a youthful
passion, which is softened, if not subdued, by age.
Success diminishes its ardour, and early pre-emi
nence often extinguishes it. Before the middle
period of life Newton was invested with all the
insignia of immortality ; but endowed with a native
humility of mind, and animated with those hopes
which teach us to form an humble estimate of human
greatness, he was satisfied with the laurels which
he had won, and he sought only to perfect and com
plete his labours. His mind was principally bent on
the improvement of the Principia ; but he occasion

Hitherto we have viewed Newton chiefly as a
philosopher leading a life of seclusion within the
walls of a college, and   either engaged in                      the duties
                          ardently occupied                      in mathe
of his professorship, or
matical and scientific inquiries. He had now reached
the fifty-third year of his age, and while those of his
own standing at the university had been receiving
high appointments in the church, or lucrative offices
in the state, he still remained without any mark of

the respect or gratitude of his country. All Europe
indeed had been offering incense to his name, and
224  SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

Englishmen themselves boasted of him as the pridea a it,
of their country and the ornament of their species,
but he was left in comparative poverty,* with noJ2
other income than the salary of his professorship,5,
eked out with the small rental of his paternal in
heritance. Such disregard of the highest genius,a
dignified by the highest virtue, could have taken
place only in England, and we should have ascribed
it to the turbulence of the age in which he lived,
had we not seen, in the history of another century,
that the successive governments which preside over
the destinies of our country have never been able
either to feel or to recognise the true nobility of

genius.
   Among his friends at Cambridge Newton had the

honour of numbering Charles Montague, grandson
of Henry Earl of Manchester, a young man of high
promise, and every way worthy of his friendship.
Though devoted to literary pursuits, and twenty
years younger than Newton, he cherished for the
philosopher all the veneration of a disciple, and his
affection for him gathered new strength as he rose
to the highest honours and offices of the state. In
the year 1684 we find him co-operating with Newton
in the establishment of a philosophical society at
Cambridge ; but though both of them had -made per
sonal application to different individuals to become
members, yet the plan failed, from the want, as
Newton expresses of persons willing to try ex

periments.
   Mr. Montague sat along with Newton in the con

vention parliament, and such were the powers which
he displayed in that assembly as public speaker,
that he was appointed commissioner of the treasury,
and soon afterward privy counsellor. In these
situations his talents and knowledge of business
were highly conspicuous, and in 1694 he was ap

pointed chancellor of the exchequer. The current
coin of the nation having been adulterated and de
based, one of his earliest designs was to recoin it
and restore it to its intrinsic value. This scheme,
however, met with great opposition. It was char
acterized as a wild project, unsuitable to a period
of war, as highly injurious to the interests of com
merce, and as likely to sap the foundation of the
government. But he had weighed the subject too
deeply, and had intrenched himself behind opinions
too impartial and too well-founded, to be driven from
a measure which the best interests of his country
seemed to require.

   The persons whom Mr. Montague had consulted
about the recoinage were Newton, Locke, and Hal-
ley, and in consequence of Mr. Overton, the warden
of the mint, having been appointed a commissioner
of customs, he embraced the opportunity which was
thus offered of serving his friend and his country by
recommending Newton to that important office.
The notice of this appointment was conveyed in the
following letter to Newton.

" Sir,                                 London, 19 th March, 1695.

good proof of my friendship, and the esteem the
king has of your merits. Mr. Overton, the warden
of the mint, is made one of the commissioners of

the customs, and the king has promised me to make
Mr. Newton warden of the mint. The office is the
most proper for you. 'Tis the chief office in the mint,
'tis worth five or six hundred pounds per annum, and
has not too much business to require more attendance

Ithan you can spare. I desire that you will come up

as soon as you can, and will take care of your
warrant in the meantime. Let me see you as soon
as you come to town, that 1 may carry you to kiss

                             &c.
226  SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

In this new situation the mathematical and chy-
mical knowledge of our author was of great service
to the nation, and he became eminently useful in
carrying on the recoinage, which was completed in
the short space of two     years. In   the  ytheearm1in6t9,9--, haen
was promoted to the
                           mastership   of
office which was worth twelve or fifteen hundred
pounds per annum, and which he held during the

remainder of his life. In this situation he wrote an
official report on the Coinage, which has been pub
lished ; and he drew up a table of Assays of Foreign
Coins, which is printed at the end of Dr. Arbuthnot's
Tables of Ancient Coins, Weights, and Measures,
which appeared in 1727.
   While our author filled the inferior office of warden
of the mint, he retained his professorship at Cam
bridge ; but upon his promotion in 1699, he appointed
Mr. Whiston to be his deputy, with all the emolu
ments of the office ; and when he resigned the chair
in 1703, he succeeded in getting him nominated his

successor.

   The appointment of Newton to the mastership of
the mint must have been peculiarly gratifying to
the  Royal Society,        it was probably from a feel
ing  of gratitude to  and
                      Mr.  Montague, as much as from
a regard for his talents, that this able statesman was
elected president of that learned body on the 30th
November, 1695. This office he held for three
years, and on the 30th January, 1697, Newton had
the satisfaction of addressing to him his solution of
the celebrated problems proposed by John Bernouilli.
   This accomplished nobleman was created Earl of

Halifax in 1700, and after the death of his first wife
he conceived a strong attachment for Mrs. Catharine
Barton, the widow of Colonel Barton, and the niece
of Newton. This lady was young, gay, and beau
tiful, and though she did not escape the censures of
her contemporaries, she was regarded by those who
knew her as a woman of strict honour and virtue.
PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY. 227

We are not acquainted with the causes which pre
vented her union with the Earl of Halifax, but so
great was the esteem and affection which he bore

her, that in the will in which he left 100/. to Mr.
Newton, he bequeathed to his niece a very large
portion of his fortune. This distinguished states
man died in 1715, in the fifty-fourth year of his age.
Himself a poet and an elegant writer, he was the
liberal patron of genius, and he numbered among
his intimate friends Congreve, Halley, Prior, Tickell,
Steele, and Pope. His conduct to Newton will be
for ever remembered in the annals of science. The
sages of every nation and of every age will pronounce
with affection the name of Charles Montague, and
the persecuted science of England will continue to
deplore that he was the first and the last English
minister who honoured genius by his friendship and
rewarded it by his patronage.
The elevation of Mr. Newton to the highest offices
in the mint was followed by other marks of honour.
The Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris having
been empowered by a new charter granted in 1699,
to admit a very small number of foreign associates,
Newton was elected a member of that distinguished
body. In the year 1701, on the assembling of a new
foparrliathmeenUtn, ivheerswityas   re-elected one  of the members
                                                      In 1703 he was

chosen President of the Royal Society of London,
and he was annually re-elected to this office during
the remaining twenty-five years of his life. On the
16th of April, 1705, when Queen Anne was living at
the royal residence of Newmarket, she went with
Prince George of Denmark and the rest of the court
to visit the University of Cambridge. After the
meeting of the Regia Consilia, her majesty held a

court at Trinity Lodge, the residence of Dr. Bentley,
then master of Trinity ; where the honour of knight
hood was conferred upon Mr. Newton, Mr. John Ellis,
the vice-chancellor, and Mr. James Montague, the
university counsel.*

   On the dissolution of the parliament, which took
place in 1705, Sir Isaac was again a candidate for
the representation of the University, but notwith
standing the recent expression of the royal favour,
he lost his election by a very great majority.f
This singular result was perhaps owing to the loss
of that personal influence which his residence in the
university could not fail to command, though it is
more probable that the ministry preferred the candi
dates of a more obsequious character, and that the
electors looked for advantages which Sir Isaac New
ton was not able to obtain for them.

   Although the first edition of the Principia had been
for some time sold off, and copies of it had become
extremely rare, yet Sir Isaac's attention was so
much occupied with his professional avocations that
he could not find leisure for preparing a new edition.
Dr. Bentley, who had repeatedly urged him to this
task, at last succeeded, by engaging Roger Cotes,
Plumian Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, to
superintend its publication at the university press.
In June, 1709, Sir Isaac committed this important
trust to his young friend ; and about the middle of
July he promised to send him in the course of a fort
night his own revised copy of the work. Business,
however, seems to have intervened, and Mr. Cotes

to learn from Sir Isaac the particular view with
which should be written.

abroad with some disadvantage, and the cause of it
may be easily guessed at. The Commercium Episto-

Igives such indubitable proofs of Mr. Leibnitz's want of

candour, that shall not scruple in the least to speak

were given to Mr. Cotes in consequence of this ap

tonian philosophy, that Sir Isaac had prohibited any
personal reference to the conduct of Leibnitz.
The general preface dated 12th May, 1713, and
in subsidiary preface of only few lines, dated
March 28th, 1713, Sir Isaac mentions the leading
alterations which had been made in this edition.-
The determination of the forces by which bodies
may revolve           in given   orbits  was simplified and
larged. The            theory   of the   resistance of fluids          en

                                                                      was

more accurately investigated, and confirmed by new
experiments. The theory of the moon and the pre
cession of the equinoxes were more fully deduced
from their principles ; and the theory of comets was
confirmed by several examples of their orbits more
accurately computed.

   In the year 1714, several captains and owners of
merchant vessels petitioned the House of Commons
to consider the propriety of bringing in a bill to
reward inventions for promoting the discovery of
the longitude at sea. A committee was appointed to
investigate the subject, and Mr. Ditton and Mr.
Whiston, having thought of a new method of finding
the longitude, submitted it to the committee. Four
members of the Royal Society, viz. Sir Isaac New
ton, Dr. Halley, Mr. Cotes, and Dr. Clarke, were
examined on the subject, along with Mr. Ditton and
Mr. Whiston. The last three of these philosophers
stated their opinions verbally. Mr. Cotes considered
the proposed scheme as correct in theory and on
shore, and both he and Dr. Halley were of opinion
that expensive experiments would be requisite.
Newton, when called upon for his opinion, read the

by spring, and rectified every visible sunrise and

sunset, to tell the hour of the day or night. In the
fourth way such watch not necessary. In the
first way there must be two watches, this and theit a

ways, may be of some service to find the longitude
within degree, and of much more service to find

the success may deserve rewards accordingly. Inaaif

In giving an account of this transaction,* Mr.
Whiston states, that nobody understood Sir Isaac's
paper, and that after sitting down he obstinately
kept silence, though he was much pressed to explain
himself more distinctly. At last, seeing that the
scheme was likely to be rejected, Whiston ventured
to say that Sir Isaac did not wish to explain more
through fear of compromising himself, but that he
really approved of the plan. Sir Isaac, he goes on
to say, repeated word for word what Whiston had
said.  This is        part of   Mr.   Newton's
       M. Biot  the                  puerile, and        c"ontdeuncdt
which           has  described  as
ing to confirm the fact of the aberration of his intel
lect in 1693." Before we can admit such a censure
we must be satisfied with the correctness of Whis
ton's statement. Newton's paper is perfectly intel
ligible, and we may easily understand how he might
have approved of Mr. Ditton's plan as ingenious and
       under particular circumstances, though
Erheacdtiidcanbolet think it of that paramount importance
which would have authorized the House of Com
mons to distinguish it by a parliamentary reward.
The conflict between public duty and a disposition
to promote the interests of Mr. Whiston and Mr.
Ditton was no doubt the cause of that embarrass
ment of manner which the former of these mathe
maticians has so unkindly brought before the public.

    on the Form of the most ancient Year. ,

    On the accession of George I. to the British throne
 in 1714, Sir Isaac Newton became an object of in
 terest at court. His high situation under govern

 ment, his splendid reputation, his spotless charac
 ter, and, above all, his unaffected piety attracted
 the attention of the Princess of Wales, afterward

queen-consort to George II. This lady, who pos

 sessed a highly cultivated mind, derived the greatest
 pleasure from conversing with Newton and corres

ponding with Leibnitz. In all her difficulties, she
 received from Sir Isaac that information and assist

 ance which she had elsewhere sought in vain, and
 she was often heard to declare in public that she
thought herself fortunate in living at a time which
enabled her to enjoy the conversation of so great a
genius. But while Newton was thus esteemed by
the house of Hanover, Leibnitz, his great rival, en
deavoured to weaken and undermine his influence.

In his correspondence with the princess, he repre

sented the Newtonian philosophy, not only as phy

sically false, but as injurious to the interests of
religion. He asserted that natural religion was
rapidly declining in England, and he supported this
position by referring to the works of Locke, and to
          CHRONOLOGY.                                           235

the beautiful and pious sentiments contained in the
28th query at the end of the Optics. He represented
the principles of these great men as precisely the
same with those of the materialists, and thus endea
voured to degrade the character of English philoso
phers.
These attacks of Leibnitz became subjects of con
versation at court, and when they reached the ear of
the king, his majesty expressed his expectation that
Sir Isaac Newton would draw up a reply. He ac
cordingly entered the lists on the mathematical part
of the controversy, and left the philosophical part
of it to Dr. Clarke, who was a full match for the
German philosopher. The correspondence which
thus took place was carefully perused by the prin
cess, and from the estimation in which Sir Isaac
continued to be held, we may infer that the views of
   English philosopher were not very remote from
Sff
her own.
When Sir Isaac was one day conversing with her
royal highness on some points of ancient history,
he was led to mention to her, and to explain, new
                         it,
                                                             a
system of chronology which he composed during his
residence at Cambridge, where he was in the habit,
as he himself expresses  "of refreshing himself
with history and chronology when he was weary
with other studies." The princess was so much
pleased with his ingenious system, that she subse
quently, in the year 1718, sent message by the Abb6

and she, on this occasion, requested copy of the
interesting work which contained his system of chro

in separate papers, which were not only in state
of confusion, but which contained very imperfect
view of the subject, and he promised, in few days,
to draw up an abstract of for her own private use,
and on the condition that should not be communi
cated to any other person. Some time after the

princess received the manuscript, she requested that
the Abbe Conti might be allowed to have a copy of
it. Sir Isaac granted this request, and the Abbe was
informed that he received a copy of the manuscript
with Sir Isaac's leave, and at the princess's request,
and that it was to be kept secret.* The manuscript

of Persia by Alexander the Great." It consists of
about twenty-four quarto printed pages,f with an

The Abbe Conti kept his promise of secrecy during
his residence in England, but he no sooner reached
Paris than he communicated it to M. Freret, a
learned antiquarian, who not only translated it, but
drew up observations upon it for the purpose of re
futing some of its principal results. Sir Isaac was
unacquainted with this transaction till he was in

Before this letter was written, viz. on the 21st
May, the bookseller had received the royal privilege
for printing the work ; and when it was completed,
he sent a copy in a present to Sir Isaac, who received

it on the 11th November, 1725. It was entitled,

The observations made by the translator against the
conclusions deduced by the author were founded on
an imperfect knowledge of Sir Isaac's system ; and
they are so specious, that Halley himself confesses
that he was at first prejudiced in favour of the obser
vations, taking the calculations for granted, and not
having seen Sir Isaac's work.
To all the observations of M. Freret Sir Isaac re
turned a triumphant answer. This presumptuous
aonbstieqruvaatriyonhs,ad"  ventured to state    at the end of his
                            that he believed he  had stated enough
concerning the epochs of the Argonauts, and the
length of generations, to make people cautious about
the rest; for these are the two foundations of all this
new system of chronology." He founds his argu
ments against the epochs of the Argonauts, as fixed
by our author, on the supposition that Sir Isaac
places the vernal equinox at the time of the Argo-
nautic expedition in the middle of the sign of Aries,
whereas      --Sira  Isaac  cpolarrceesspointdiinngthewmitihddtleheomf itdhedlecoonf
stellation,          point
the back of Aries, or 8° from the first star of Aries.
This position of the colure is assigned on the author
ity of Eudoxus, as given by Hipparchus, who says
that the colure passed over the back of Aries. Set
ting out with this mistake, M. Freret concludes that
the Argonautic expedition took place 532 years
earlier than Sir Isaac made it. His second objection
to the new system relates to the length of genera
tions, which he says is made only 18 or 20 years.
Sir Isaac, on the contrary, reckons a generation at
33 years, or 3 generations at 100; and it was the
lengths of the reigns of kings that he made 18 or 20
years. This deduction he founds on the reigns of
64 French kings. Now, the ancient Greeks and
Egyptians reckoned the length of a reign equal to
that of a generation ; and it was by correcting this
mistake, and adopting a measure founded on fact,

that Sir Isaac placed the Argonautic expedition forty

four years after the death of Solomon, and fixed some
of the other points of his system.
   This answer of Sir Isaac's to the objections of
Freret called into the field a fresh antagonist, Father
Souciet, who published five dissertations on the new
chronology. These dissertations were written in
a tone highly reprehensible ; and the friends of Sir
Isaac, being apprehensive that the manner in which
his system was attacked would affect him more than
the arguments themselves, prevailed upon a friend to
dorfatwheup"  an abstract of  Souciet's objections, stripped
              extraordinary   ornaments with which they
were clothed." The perusal of these objections had
no other effect upon him than to convince him of
the ignorance of their author ; and he was induced
to read the entire work, which produced no change
in his opinion.

   In consequence of these discussions, Sir Isaac
was prevailed upon to prepare his larger work for
the press. He had nearly completed it at the time
of his death, and it was published in 1728, under the
title of The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms amended,
to which is prefixed a short Chronicle, from the first
memory of Things in Europe to the                Conquest of Per
sia by Alexander the Great. It was               dedicated to the
queen by Mr. Conduit, and consists of six chapters :
1. On the Chronology of the Greeks ;* 2. Of the
Empire of Egypt; 3. Of the Assyrian Empire; 4.
Of the two contemporary Empires of the Baby
lonians and Medes ; 5. A Description of the Temple
of Solomon; 6. Of the Empire of the Persians.
The sixth chapter was not copied out with the other
five, which makes it doubtful whether or not it was
intended for publication ; but as it was found among
his papers, and appeared to be a continuation of the

same work, it was thought right to add it to the
other five chapters.*

   After the death of Newton, Dr. Halley, who had
not yet seen the larger work, felt himself called upon,
both as astronomer-royal and as the friend of the
author, to reply to the first and last dissertations of
Father Souciet, which were chiefly astronomical;
and in two papers printed in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1727,f he has done this in a most con
vincing and learned argument.
' Among the supporters of the views of Newton,
we may enumerate Dr. Reid, Nauze, and some other
writers ; and among its opponents, M. Freret, who
left behind him a posthumous work on the subject,
M. Fourmond, Mr. A. Bedford, Dr. Shuckford, Dr.
Middleton, Whiston, and the late M. Delambre. The
object of M. Fourmond is to show the uncertainty
of the astronomical argument, arising on the one
hand from the vague account of the ancient sphere
as given by Hipparchus ; and, on the other, from the
extreme rudeness of ancient astronomical observa
tions. Delambre has taken a similar view of the
subject : he regards the observations of ancient
astronomers as too incorrect to form the basis of a

system of chronology ; and he maintains, that if we

admit the accuracy of the details in the sphere of
Eudoxus, and suppose them all to belong to the
same epoch, all the stars which it contains ought at
that epoch to be found in the place where they are
marked, and we might thence verify the accuracy,

and ascertain the state of the observations. It fol

sphere would indicate almost as many different
epochs as it contains stars. Some of them even
had not, in the time of Eudoxus, arrived at the po
sition which had been for a long time attributed to
them, and will not even reach it for three hundred
years to come, and on this account he considers it
impossible to deduce any chronological conclusions
from such a rude mass of errors.
But however well-founded these observations may
be, we agree in opinion with M. Daunou,* "that
they are not sufficient to establish a new system,
and we must regard the system of Newton as a
great fact in the history of chronological science,
and as confirming the observation of Varro, that the
stage of history does not commence till the first
Olympiad."
Among the chronological writings of Sir Isaac
Newton we must enumerate his letter to a person
of distinction who had desired his opinion of the learned
Bishop Lloyd's hypothesis concerning the    form of the
most ancient year. This hypothesis was      sent by the
Bishop of Worcester to Dr. Prideaux. Sir Isaac
remarks, that it is filled with
vations on the ancient year ;     many excellent   o"bsfienrd

twelve months and 360 days without correcting it
from time to time by the luminaries, to make the
months keep to the course of the moon, and the year
to the course of the sun, and returns of the seasons
and fruits  of the   earth." After examining
of all the           of antiquity, he concludes,  th"ethyaet anros
            nations

but such as were either luni-solar, or solar or lunar,

he adds, of 360 days is none of these. The begin

  Studies-- Analogy between the Book of Nature and that of Revelation.

   The history of the theological studies of Sir Isaac
Newton will ever be regarded as one of the most
interesting portions of his life. That he who among
all the individuals of his species possessed the high
est intellectual powers was not only a learned and
profound divine, but a firm believer in the great doc
trines of religion, is one of the proudest triumphs
of the Christian faith. Had he distinguished him
self only by an external respect for the offices and
duties of religion ; and had he left merely in his last
words an acknowledgment of his faith, his piety
would have been regarded as a prudent submission
to popular feeling, and his last aspirations would
have been ascribed to the decay or to the extinction
of his transcendent powers. But he had been a
Christian from his youth, and though never intended
for the church, yet he interchanged the study of the
Scriptures with that of the laws of the material
universe ; and from the examination of the works
of the Supreme Creator he found it to be no abrupt

transition to investigate the revelation of his will,
and to contemplate the immortal destinies of man
kind.
But when the religious habits of Sir Isaac Newton
could not be ascribed to an ambition  toofthpeopfourclaeriotyf,
to the influence of weak health, or
professional impulse, it became necessary for the
apostles of infidelity to refer it to some extraordi
nary cause. His supposed insanity was therefore
eagerly seized upon by some as affording a plausible
origin for his religious principles ; while others,
without any view of supporting the cause of skep
ticism, ascribed his theological researches to the
habits of the age in which he lived, and to a desire
of promoting political liberty, by turning against the
abetters of despotism those powerful weapons which
the Scriptures supplied. The anxiety evinced by
M. de Laplace to refer his religious writings to a
late period of his life seems to have been felt also
by M. Biot, who has gone so far as to fix the very
date of one of his most important works, and thus
to "esFtraobmlishthethenastuusrpeicoiofntsheosfubhjiescct,o"l*leasgauyes. he, " and
from certain indications which Newton seems to
give at the beginning of his dissertation, we may
conjecture with probability that he composed it at
the time when the errors of Whiston, and a work
of Dr. Clarke on the same subject, drew upon them
the attacks of all the theologians of England, which
would place the date between the years 1712 and
1719. It would then be truly a prodigy to remark,
that a man of from seventy-two to seventy-five
years of age was able to compose, rapidly, as he
leads us to believe, so extensive a piece of sacred
criticism, of literary history, and even of bibliogra
phy, where an erudition the most vast, the most

ment well arranged and powerfully          combined.
At this epoch of the life of Newton the reading of
religious books had become one of his most habitual
occupations, and after he had performed the duties
of his office, they formed, along with the conversa
tion of his friends, his principal amusement. He
had then almost ceased to care for the sciences, and,

as we have already remarked, since the fatal epoch
of 1693, he gave to the world only three really new
scientific productions."

cause of his abandoning science and betaking him

matical considerations, so exercised in the observa

conditions by which truth is to be discovered, could
put together such a number of conjectures without
noticing the extreme improbability of his interpreta

on which he has founded them F' We would apply
the same question to the reasoning by which M. Biot
fixes the date of the critical dissertation ; and we
would ask how so eminent a philosopher could haz

which he had not a single fact to guide his inquiries.
The obvious tendency, though not the design, of the
conclusion at which he arrives is injurious to the

of Biot respecting the date of  Newton's theological
works was never maintained      by any other person
than himself, and is capable of being disproved by
the most incontrovertible evidence.

   corruptions of  the Scripture, in         a letter   to a friend.
t     This work    seems to have             been a     very early pro

   duction of our author. It was written in the form
   of a letter to Mr. Locke, and at that time Sir Isaac
   seems to have been anxious for its publication.
   Afraid, however, of being again led into a contro
   versy, and dreading the intolerance to which he
   might be exposed, he requested Mr. Locke, who
 was at that time meditating a voyage to Holland,

-to get it translated into French, and published on
   the Continent. Having abandoned his design of
   visiting Holland, Locke transmitted the manuscript,
   without Newton's name, to his learned friend M. Le
   Clerc, in Holland ; and it appears, from a letter of
   Le Clerc's to Locke, that he must have received it
   before the 11th April, 1691. M. Le Clerc delayed

for a long time to take any steps regarding its pub
lication; but in a letter dated January 20th, 1692, he
announced to Locke his intention of publishing the
tract in Latin. When this plan was communicated
to Sir Isaac, he became alarmed at the risk of de
tection, and resolved to stop the publication of his
manuscript. This resolution was intimated to Mr.
Locke in the following letter :

     1733, in one volume 4to.     The work
in
into two parts, the first of which treats of the Pro
phecies of Daniel, and the second of the  Apocalypse
of St. John. It begins with an account     of the dif
ferent books which compose the Old-Testament ; and
as the author considers Daniel to be the most dis
tinct in the order of time, and the easiest to be un
derstood, he makes him the key to all the prophetic
books in those matters which relate  to the "last time."
He next considers the figurative      language of the
prophets, which he regards as        taken "from the

analogy between the world natural and an empire
or kingdom considered as a world politic ;" the hea
vens and the things therein representing thrones and
dynasties; the earth, with the things therein, the

iaferior people ; and the lowest parts of the earth
the most miserable of the people. The sun is put
for the whole race of kings, the moon for the body
of the common people, and the stars for subordinate
princes and rulers. In the earth, the dry land and
the waters are put for the people of several nations.

Animals and vegetables are also put for the people

of several regions. When a beast or man is put for

a kingdom, his parts and qualities are put for the
analogous parts and qualities of the kingdom ; and
when a man is taken in a mystical sense, his quali
ties are often signified by his actions, and by the

circumstances and things about him. In applying
these principles he begins with the vision of the
image composed of four different metals. This
image he considers as representing a body of four

great nations which should reign in succession over
the earth, viz. the people of Babylonia, the Persians,
the Greeks, and the Romans ; while the stone cut out
without hands is a new kingdom which should arise
after the four, conquer all those nations, become very
great, and endure to the end of time.

   The vision of the four beasts is the prophecy of the
four empires repeated, with several new additions.
The lion with eagles' wings was the kingdom of
Babylon and Media, which overthrew the Assyrian
power. The beast like a bear was the Persian em
pire, and its three ribs were the kingdoms of Sardis,
Babylon, and Egypt. The third beast, like a leopard,
was the Greek empire, and its four heads and four
wings were the kingdoms of Cassander, Lysimachus,
Ptolemy, and Seleucus. The fourth beast, with its
great iron teeth, was the Roman empire, and its ten
horns were the ten kingdoms into which it was
broken in the reign of Theodosius the Great.

  In the fifth chapter Sir Isaac treats of the king

doms represented by the feet of the image composed
of iron and clay which did not stick to one another,
and which were of different strength. These were
250  SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

the Gothic tribes called Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Van
dals, Gepidae, Lombards, Burgundians, Alans, &c. ;
all of whom had the same manners and customs,
and spoke the same language, and who, about the
year 416 A. C. were all quietly settled in several
kingdoms within the empire, not only by conquest,
but by grants of emperor.

   In the sixth chapter he treats of the ten kingdoms
represented by the ten horns'of the fourth beast, into
which the western empire became divided about the
time when Rome was besieged and taken by the
Goths. These kingdoms were,

   1. The kingdom of the Vandals and Alans in Spain
and Africa.

   2. The kingdom of Suevians in Spain.
   3. The kingdom of the Visigoths.
   4. The kingdom of the Alans in Gaul.
   5. The kingdom of the Burgundians.
   6. The kingdom of the Franks.
   7. The kingdom of the Britains.
   8. The kingdom of the Huns.
   9. The kingdom of the Lombards.
  10. The kingdom of Ravenna.
   Some of these kingdoms at length fell, and new
ones sprung up ; but whatever was their subsequent
number, they still retain the name of the ten kings
from their first number.
   The eleventh horn of Daniel's fourth beast is shown
in chapter vii. to be the Church of Rome in its triple
character of a seer, a prophet, and a king ; and its
power to change times and laws is copiously illus
trated in chapter viii.
   In the ninth chapter our author treats of the king
dom represented in Daniel by the ram and he-goat,
the ram indicating the kingdom of the Medes and
Persians from the beginning of the four empires, and
the he-goat the kingdom of the Greeks to the end
of them.
   The prophecy of the seventy weeks, which had
            OBSERVATIONS ON PROPHECY.                            251

hitherto been restricted to the first coming of our
Saviour, is shown to be a prediction of all the main
periods relating to the coming of the Messiah, the
times of his birth and death, the time of his rejection
by the Jews, the duration of the Jewish war by which
he caused the city and sanctuary to be destroyed,
and the   time of his second coming.
          eleventh chapter Sir Isaac               treats  with  great

                                          subject
all preceding commentators.
After explaining in the twelfth chapter the last
prophecy of Daniel, namely, that of the scripture of
truth, which he considers as a commentary on the
vision of the ram and he-goat, he proceeds in the
thirteenth chapter to the prophecy of the king who
did according to his will, and magnified himself above
every god, and honoured Mahuzzims, and regarded
not the desire of women. He shows that the Greek
empire, after the division of the Roman empire into
the Greek and Latin empires, became the king who
in matters of religion did according to his will, and
in legislation exalted and magnified himself above
every god.
In the second part of his work on the Apocalypse
of St. John, Sir Isaac treats, 1st, Of the time when
the prophecy was written, which he conceives to
have been during John's exile in Patmos, and before
the epistle to the Hebrews and the epistles of Peter
were written, which in his opinion have a reference
to the Apocalypse ; 2dly, Of the scene of the vision,
and the relation which the Apocalypse has to the
book of the law of Moses, and to the worship of God
in the temple ; and, Zdly, Of the relation which the
Apocalypse has to the prophecies of Daniel, and of
the subject of the prophecy itself.
Sir Isaac regards the prophecies of the Old and
New Testaments, not as given to gratify men's curi
osities, by enabling them to foreknow things, but that
252                     SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

after they were fulfilled, they might be interpreted
by the event, and afford convincing arguments that
the world is governed by Providence. He considers
that there is so much of this prophecy already ful
filled as to afford to the diligent student sufficient
                   of   God's providence; and he adds, that
"insatmanocnegs

Such                    brief abstract of this ingenious work,
which characterized by great learning, and marked
with the sagacity of its distinguished author. The
same qualities of his mind are equally conspicuous
in his Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions
is ofScripture.
This celebrated treatise relates to two texts in the
                1                                   The first of
EpiisntlesJoohfnStv. .Jo7h. n"  and  St. Paul.                    these
                                      there are      three that    bear
                                For
record in heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, and these three are one." This text he con
siders as gross corruption of Scripture, which had
                   a

its origin among the Latins, who interpreted the
Spirit, Water, and Blood to be the Father, Son, and

Holy Ghost, in order to prove them one. With the
same view Jerome inserted the Trinity in express
words in his version. The Latins marked his varia
tions in the margins of their books; and in the
twelfth and following centuries, when the disputa
tions of the schoolmen were at their height, the
variation began to creep into the text in transcribing.

After the invention of printing, crept out of the
Latin into the printed Greek, contrary to the author

tal body, by baptism of water, and then in an immor
tal one, by shedding his blood upon the cross and
rising again from the dead ; not by water only, but
by water and blood ; being the Son of God, as well
by his resurrection from the dead (Acts xiii. 33), as
by his supernatural birth of the virgin (Luke i. 35).
And it is the Spirit also that, together with the water
and blood, beareth witness of the truth of his coming;

because the Spirit is truth ; and so a fit and unexcep
tionable witness. For there are three that bear record
of his coming; the Spirit, which he promised to send,
and which was since shed forth upon us in the form

of cloven tongues, and in various gifts ; the baptism
of water, wherein God testified ' this is my beloved
Son ;' and the shedding of his blood, accompanied with
his resurrection, whereby he became the most faith
ful martyr, or witness, of this truth. And these three,
the spirit, the baptism, and passion of Christ, agree
in witnessing one and the same thing (namely, that
the Son of God is come) ; and, therefore, their evi
dence is strong : for the law requires but two con

ifsenting witnesses, and here we have three : and
we receive the witness    ooff  men, the threefold witness   of
God, which he bare              his Son, by declaring at    his

baptism 'this   is my beloved Son,'        by  raising him
                                          his  Spirit on us,
from the dead,   and by pouring out
is greater; and, therefore, ought to be more readily
received."

'priving the defenders of the doctrine of the Trinity

been regarded as an Antitrinitarian ; but such a con

   The only other religious works which were com                       a
posed by Sir Isaac Newton were his Lexicon Pro-
pheticum, to which was added a Dissertation on the
sacred cubit of the Jews, and Four Letters addressed
to Dr. Bentley, containing some arguments in proof of
a Deity.

   The Lexicon Propheticum was left incomplete, and
has not been published ; but the Latin Dissertation
which was appended to in which he shows that
the cubit was about 26i Roman unciae, was published
in 1737 among the Miscellaneous Works of Mr. John
Greaves.

   Upon the death of the Honourable Robert Boyle,
on the 30th of December, 1691, was found, by
codicil to his will, that he had left revenue of 50/.
per annum to establish lectureship, in which eight
discourses were to be preached annually in one of
the churches of the metropolis, in illustration of the
evidences of Christianity, and in opposition to the
principles of infidelity. Dr. Bentley, though very
young man, was appointed to preach the first course
of sermons, and the manner in which he discharged
this important duty gave the highest satisfaction, not
only to the trustees of the lectureship, but to the
public in general. In the first six lectures Bentley
exposed the folly of atheism even in reference to the
present life, and derived powerful arguments for the
existence of Deity from the faculties of the soul,
and the structure and functions of the human frame.

tion of the universe, as established in the Principia.
In order to qualify himself for this task, he received
from Sir Isaac written directions respecting a list of
books necessary                         be perused previous to        the study
of that work ;*                     to  having made himself
                                   and                                master of
the system which it contained, he applied it with
irresistible force of argument to establish the ex
istence of an overruling mind. Previous to the pub
lication of these lectures, Bentley encountered a
difficulty which he was not able to solve, and he
prudently transmitted to Sir Isaac during 1692 a
series of queries on the subject. This difficulty oc
curred in an argument urged by Lucretius, to prove
the eternity of the world from an hypothesis of de
riving the frame of it by mechanical principles from
matter endowed with an innate power of gravity, and
evenly scattered throughout the heavens. Sir Isaac
willingly entered upon the consideration of the sub
ject, and transmitted his sentiments to Dr. Bentley
in the four letters which have been noticed in a pre

ceding chapter.

  In the firstf of these letters Sir Isaac mentions
that  when he wrote                     his         treatise about    "ohuer  system,
viz.  the Third Book                    of          the Principia,            had an
eye upon such principles as might work, with con
sidering men, for the belief of a Deity, and he ex
for Inpresses his happiness that it has been found useful
      that purpose.                             answering the first query of
Dr. Bentley, the exact import of which we do not
know, he states, that, if matter were evenly diffused
through a finite space, and endowed with innate
gravity, it would fall down into the middle of the
space, and form one great spherical mass ; but if it
were diffused through an infinite space, some of it
would collect into one mass, and some into another,

so as to form an infinite number of great masses.

In this manner the sun and stars might be formed if
the matter were of a lucid nature. But he thinks it
inexplicable by natural causes, and to be ascribed to
the counsel and contrivance of a voluntary Agent,
that the matter should divide itself into two sorts,
part of it composing a shining body like the sun, and
part an opaque body like the planets. Had a natural
and blind cause, without contrivance and design,
placed the earth in the centre of the moon's orbit,
and Jupiter in the centre of his system of satellites,
and the sun in the centre of the planetary system,
the sun would have been a body like Jupiter and the
earth, that is, without light and heat, and conse
quently he knows no reason why there is only one
body qualified to give light and heat to all the rest,
but because the Author of the system thought it con
venient, and because one was sufficient to warm
and enlighten all the rest.
To the second query of Dr. Bentley, he replies
that the motions which the planets now have could
not spring   from
impressed   by an   any natural cause            "alToone,mbauket  were

a system with all its motions required a cause which
understood and compared together the quantities of
matter in the several bodies of the sun and planets,
and the gravitating powers resulting from thence;
the several distances of the primary planets from
the sun, and of the secondary ones from Saturn, Ju
piter, and the earth, and the velocities with which
those planets could revolve about those quantities
of matter in the central bodies ; and to compare and
adjust all these things together in so great a variety

of bodies, argues that cause to be not blind and for
tuitous, but very well skilled in mechanics and geo
metry."
In the second* letter, he admits that the spherical

mass formed by the aggregation of particles would
affect the figure of the space in which the matter
was diffused, provided the matter descends directly
downwards to that body, and the body has no diurnal
rotation ; but he states, that by earthquakes loosen
ing the parts of this solid, the protuberance might
sink a little by their weight, and the mass by degrees
approach a spherical figure. He then proceeds to
correct an error of Dr. Bentley's in supposing that
all infinites are equal. He admits that gravity might
put the planets in motion, but he maintains that,
without the Divine power, it could never give them
such a circulating motion as they have about the
sun, because a proper quantity of a transverse mo
tion is necessary for this purpose 5 and he concludes
that he is compelled to ascribe the frame of this
system to an intelligent Agent.

   The third letter contains opinions confirming or
correcting several positions which Dr. Bentley had
laid down, and he concludes it with a curious exam
ination of the opinion of Plato, that the motion of

the planets is such as if they had been all created

by God in some region very remote from our sys
tem, and let fall from thence towards the sun, their

falling motion being turned aside into a transverse
one whenever they arrived at their several orbits.
Sir Isaac shows that there is no common place such
as that conjectured by Plato, provided the gravi
tating power of the sun remains constant ; but that

Plato's affirmation is true if we suppose the gravi
tating power of the sun to be doubled at that mo
ment of  "timIfewwe hseunppothsee,y"  all arrive  a"tthtehegirrasveitvyeroalf
orbits.                                says he,
all the planets towards the sun to be of such a quan
tity as it really is, and that the motions of the
planets are turned upwards, every planet will ascend
to twice its height from the sun. Saturn will as
cend till he be twice as high from the sun as he is
at present, and no higher; Jupiter will ascend as
         tETTERS TO BR. BENTLEY.                      259

nigh again as at present, that is, a little above the

orb of Saturn ; Mercury will ascend to twice his
present height, that is, to the orb of Venus ; and so
of the rest ; and then, by falling down again from
the places to which they ascended, they will arise
again at their several orbs with the same velocities

revolve are turned upwards, the gravitating power

of the sun, by which their ascent is perpetually re
tarded, be diminished by one-half, they will now
ascend perpetually, and all of them, at all equal dis
tances from the sun, will be equally swift. Mer
cury, when he arrives at the orb of Venus, will be
as swift as Venus ; and he and Venus, when they
arrive   at the orb      tohfethreeste.arthIf,  will  be as swift as the
earth ;                                                begin all of them
         and so of                              they
to ascend at once, and ascend in the same line, they

will constantly, in ascending, become nearer and
nearer together, and their motions will constantly
approach to an equality, and become at length
slower than any motion assignable. Suppose, there
fore, that they ascended till they were almost con
tiguous, and their motions inconsiderably little, and
that all their motions were at the same moment of
time turned back again, or, which comes almost to
the same thing, that they were only deprived of their
motions, and let fall at that time, they would all at
once arrive at their several orbs, each with the ve
locity it had at first ; and if their motions were then
turned sideways, and at the same time the gravi
tating power of the sun doubled, that it might be
strong enough to retain them in their orbs, they
would revolve in them as before their ascent. But

if the gravitating power of the sun was not doubled,
they would go away from their orbs into the highest
heavens in parabolical lines."*

In the fourth letter* he states, that the hypothesis
that matter is at first evenly diffused through the
universe is in his opinion inconsistent with the
hypothesis of innate gravity without a supernatural

planets and stars to fly up from them, and become

never be hereafter without a supernatural power,
could never be heretofore without the same power."
These letters, of which we have endeavoured to
give a brief summary, will well repay the most
attentive perusal by the philosopher as well as the
divine. They are written with much perspicuity of
language and great power of thought, and they
contain results which incontestably prove that their
author was fully master of his noblest faculties,
and comprehended the profoundest parts of his own

writings.^

   The logical acuteness, the varied erudition, and
the absolute freedom from all prejudice which shine
throughout the theological writings of Newton,
might have protected them from the charge of hav

a failure of mind was supposed to have unfitted him
for his mathematical investigations. But it is fortu

of Christianity, that we have been able to prove the
incorrectness of such insinuations, and to exhibit
the most irrefragable evidence that all the theological

 writings of Newton were composed in the vigour
 of his life, and before the crisis of that bodily dis
 order which is supposed to have affected his reason.
  The able letters to Dr. Bentley were even written
 in the middle of that period when want of sleep and
 appetite had disturbed the serenity of his mind, and

 enable us to prove that this disturbance, whatever
 was its amount, never affected the higher functions

 of his understanding.
    When a philosopher of distinguished eminence,

 and we believe not inimical to the Christian faith,
 has found it necessary to make a laboured apology
 for a man like Newton writing on theological sub
 jects, and has been led to render that apology more
 complete by referring this class of his labours to a
 mind debilitated by age and weakened by its pre
 vious aberrations, it may be expected from an Eng
 lish biographer, and one who acknowledges the
 importance of revealed truth, and the paramount
 interest of such subjects above all secular studies,
to suggest the true origin of Newton's theological
inquiries.

    When a mind of great and acknowledged power
first directs its energies to the study of the material
universe, no indications of order attract his notice,
and no proofs of design call forth his admiration.
In the starry firmament he sees no bodies of stupen
dous magnitude, and no distances of immeasurable
span. The two great luminaries appear vastly in
ferior in magnitude to many objects around him, and
the greatest distances in the heavens seem even in
ferior to those which his own eye can embrace on

the surface of the earth. The planets, when ob

served with care, are seen to have a motion among
the fixed stars, and to vary in their magnitude and
distances, but these changes appear to follow no
law. Sometimes they move to the east, sometimes
to the west, sometimes towards the north, and
sometimes towards the south, and at other times

they are absolutely stationary. No system, in short,
appears,  and no general law seems to        direct their
motions.     By the observations and
                                            inquiries of

promises, he felt it his duty, as it was his pleasure,
to apply to it that intellectual strength which had
successfully surmounted the difficulties of the ma
terial universe. The fame which that success pro
cured him he could not but feel to be the breath of
popular applause, which administered only to his
personal feelings ; but the investigation of the sacred
mysteries, while it prepared his own mind for its
final destiny, was calculated to promote the spiritual
interests of thousands. This noble impulse he did
not hesitate to obey, and by thus uniting philosophy
with religion, he dissolved the league which genius
had formed with skepticism,                and added to the   cloud

   In the preceding chapters we have given an ac
count of the principal labours of Sir Isaac Newton ;
but there still remain to be noticed several of his
minor discoveries and inventions, which could not
properly be introduced under any general head.
   The most important of these, perhaps, are his
chymical researches, which he seems to have pur
sued with more or less diligence from the time
when he first witnessed the practical operations of
chymistry during his residence at the apothecary's
at Grantham. His first chymical experiments were
probably made on the alloys of metals, for the pur
pose of obtaining a good metallic composition for
the specula of reflecting telescopes. In his paper
on thin plates he treats of the combinations of solids
and fluids ; but he enters more largely on these and
other subjects in the queries published at the end

of his Optics.
One of his most important chymical papers is
his Tabula quanlilatum et graduum caloris, which
was published in the Philosophical Transactions.

twice as great as the first, and so on. It is obvious
from this table, that the heat at which equal parts
of tin and bismuth melt is four times greater than
that of blood-heat, the heat of melting lead eight
times greater, and the heat of a small coal-fire six

teen times greater.
    This table was constructed by the help of a ther
mometer, and of red-hot iron. By the former he

measured all heats as far as that of melting tin;
and by the latter he measured all the higher heats.
For the heat which heated iron loses in a given time

is as the total heat of the iron ; and therefore, if the
times of cooling are taken equal, the heats will be
in a geometrical progression, and may therefore be
easily found by a table of logarithms.
   He found by a thermometer constructed with lin

seed oil, that if the oil, when the thermometer was
placed in melting snow, occupied a space of 1000
parts, the same oil, rarefied with one degree of heat,
or that of the human body, occupied a space of
10256; in the heat of water beginning to boil, a
space of 10705; in the heat of water boiling vio
lently, 10725 ; in the heat of melted tin beginning to
cool, and putting on the consistency of an amalgam,
HIS SCALE OF HEAT. ·            267

11516, and when the tin had become solid, 11496.
Hence the oil was rarefied in the ratio of 40 to 39
by the heat of the human body ; of 15 to 14 by the
heat of boiling water ; of 15 to 13 in the heat of
melting tin beginning to solidify ; and of 23 to 20 in
the same tin when solid. The rarefaction of air
was, with the same heat, ten times greater than that
of oil, and the rarefaction of  oil fifteen times greater
than that of spirit of wine.    By making the heats
of oil proportional to its rarefaction, and by calling
the heat of the human body 12 parts, we obtain the
heat of water beginning to boil, 33 ; of water boil
ing violently, 34 ; of melted tin beginning to solidify,
72 ; and of the same become solid, 70.
Sir Isaac then heated a sufficiently thick piece
of iron till it was red-hot ; and having fixed it in a
cold place, where the wind blew uniformly, he put
upon it small pieces of different metals and other
fusible bodies, and noted the times of cooling, till
all the particles, having lost their fluidity, grew cold,
and the heat of the iron was equal to that of the
human body. Then, by assuming that the excesses
of the heats of the iron and of the solidified par
ticles of metal above the heat of the atmosphere,
were in geometrical progression when the times
were in arithmetical progression, all the heats were
obtained. The iron was placed in a current of air,
in order that the air heated by the iron might always
be carried away by the wind, and that cold air
might replace it with a uniform motion ; for thus
equal parts of the air were heated in equal times,
and received a heat proportional to that of the iron.
But the heats thus found had the same ratio to one
another with the heats found by the thermometer ;
and hence he was right in assuming that the rare
factions of the oil were proportional to its heats.
   Another short chymical paper by Sir Isaac New
ton has been published by Dr. Horsley. It is enti

tied De Natura Acidorum, but is principally occupied
with a number of brief opinions on chymical sub
jects. This paper was written later than 1687, as it
bears a reference to the Principia; and the most im
portant facts which it contains seem to have been
more distinctly reproduced in the queries at the end
of the Optics.
   The most important of these queries relate to fire,
flame, and electric attractions, and as they were re
vised in the year 1716 and 1717, they may be regarded
as containing the most matured opinions of their
author. Fire he regards as a body heated so hot as
to emit light copiously, and flame as a vapour, fume,

or exhalation heated so hot as to shine. In his long
query on elective attractions, he considers the small
particles of bodies as acting upon one another at
distances so minute as to escape observation. When
salt of tartar deliquesces, he supposes that this arises
from an attraction between the saline particles and
the aqueous particles held in solution in the atmos
phere, and to the same attraction he ascribes it that
the water will not distil from the salt of tartar with
out great heat. For the same reason sulphuric acid
attracts water powerfully, and parts with it with
great difficulty. When this attractive force becomes
                 as in the union
very powerful,   so as to make the  between    "scuolaplheuscriec
acid and water,                     particles

an accelerated motion, heat is produced by the mix

ture of the two fluids. In like manner, he explains
ftlhueidsp,r--odthuectaiocntioonfofflafumlme infarotimng thpeowdmeirxst,u--rethoefccoomld
bination of iron filings with sulphur,-- and all the
other chymical phenomena of precipitation, combi
nation, solution, and crystallization, and the mechan
ical phenomena of cohesion and capillary attrac
tion. He ascribes hot springs, volcanoes, fire-damps,
mineral coruscations, earthquakes, hot suffocating

exhalations, hurricanes, lightning, thunder, fiery
meteors, subterraneous explosions, land-slips, ebul
litions of the sea, and waterspouts, to sulphureous
steams abounding in the bowels of the earth, and
fermenting with minerals, or escaping into the atmos
phere, where they ferment with acid vapours fitted
to promote fermentation.
    In explaining the structure of solid bodies, he is
of   opinion, "that the smallest particles of matter

may cohere by the strongest attractions, and com
pose bigger particles    of weaker virtue ; and many
                         and compose bigger particles
of these may cohere
whose virtue is still weaker ; and so on for divers
successions, until the progression end in the biggest
particles, on which the operations in chymistry and
the colours of natural bodies depend, and which, by
Ifadhering, compose bodies of a sensible magnitude.

to things, it is humid ; and the drops of every fluid
affect a round figure, by the mutual attraction of their
parts, as the globe of the earth and sea affects a
round figure, by the mutual attraction of its parts, by
gravity."
Sir Isaac then supposes, that, as the attractive

them,       bodies can   virtue ought to succeed ;" and he
            a repulsive

out the immediate contact of the reflecting body, and
also from the emission of light, the ray, as soon as
it is shaken off from a shining body by the vibrating
motion of the parts of the body, getting beyond the

ceeding great velocity by the force of reflection.*
Many of the chymical views which Sir Isaac thus
published in the form of queries were in his own
lifetime illustrated   and confirmed by      --Dra.  wStoerpkheonf

great originality, which contains the germ of some
of the finest discoveries in modern chymistry.
   Although there is no reason                              Sir
Isaac Newton was a believer             to  suppose that    of

alchymy, yet we are informed by the Reverend Mr.
Law that he had been a diligent student of Jacob
Behmen's writings, and that there were found among
his papers copious abstracts from them in his own
handwriting.f He states also that Sir Isaac, together
with one Dr. Newton, his relation, had, in the earlier
part of his life, set up furnaces, and were for several
months at work in quest of the philosopher's tinc
ture. These statements may receive some confir
mation from the fact, that there exist among the
Portsmouth papers many sheets, in Sir Isaac's own
writing, of Flammel's Explication of Hieroglyphic

Figures, and in another hand, many sheets of Wil
liam Yworth's Processus Mysterii Magni Philosophi-
cus, and also from the manner in which Sir Isaac
requests Mr. Aston to inquire after one Borry in
Holland, who always went clothed in green, and who
was said to possess valuable secrets ; but Mr. Law
has weakened the force of his own testimony, when

query above referred to. Sir Isaac, in the most distinct manner, places
the   sphere of   the reflecting force without that of the attractive one.

he asserts that Newton borrowed the doctrine of
attraction from Behmen's first three propositions of
eternal nature.
                                              v

On the 7th December, 1675, Sir Isaac Newton com
municated to the Royal Society a paper entitled
An                                       of light, in which
     hypothesis explaining properties    opinions respect
he,  for the first time, introduces his

     ether,        and   employs   them to explain the nature
of   light,       and   the cause

duced," he says, "to do this, because he had observed
the heads of some great virtuosos to run much upon
hypotheses, and he therefore gave one which he was

inclined to consider as the most probable, if he were
obliged to adopt one."*
This hypothesis seems to have been afterward a
subject of discussion between him and Mr. Boyle, to
whom he promised to communicate his opinion more
fully in writing. He accordingly addressed to him a
long letter, dated February 28th, 1678-9, in which

ether, Newton seems to have subsequently re
nounced; for in the manuscript in the possession
of Dr. C. Gregory, which we have already men
tioned, and which was written previous to 1702, he
states, that ether neither obvious to our senses,
                                                                                  gratuitous

assumption, which,             we are to                trust to reason and
to our senses, must         be banished
                                                        from the nature of
things and he goes on to establish, by various argu
ments, the validity of this opinion. This renuncia
tion of his former hypothesis probably arose from
his having examined more carefully some of the
phenomena which he endeavoured to explain by it.

sible cavities of the capillary tubes than without
them," whereas he afterward discovered their true
cause, and ascribed them to the reciprocal attraction
of the tube and the fluid. But, however this may
be, there can be no doubt that he resumed his early
opinions before the publication of his Optics, which
may be considered as containing his views upon this

subject.
The queries which contain these opinions are the

same with that by which light refracted and re
flected, and by whose vibrations light communicates
heat to bodies, and put into fits of easy reflection
and transmission.
HYPOTHESIS OF ETHER.  273

  This ethereal medium, according to our author, is

exceedingly more rare and more elastic than air.

It pervades all bodies, and is expanded through all
the heavens. It is much rarer within the dense

bodies of the sun, stars, planets, and comets, than
in the celestial spaces between them, and also more
rare within glass, water, &c. than in the free and
open spaces void of air and other grosser bodies.

In passing out of glass, water, &c. and other dense

bodies into empty space, it grows denser and denser
by degrees, and this gradual condensation extends
to some distance from the bodies. Owing to its
great elasticity, and, consequently, its efforts to
spread in all directions, it presses against itself, and,
consequently, against the solid particles of bodies,
so as to make them continually approach to one
another, the body being impelled from the denser
parts of the medium towards the rarer with all that
power which we call gravity.

   In employing this medium to explain the nature
of light, Newton does not suppose, with Descartes,

Hooke, Huygens, and others, that light is nothing
more than the impression of those undulations on
the retina. He regards light as a peculiar substance,
composed of heterogeneous particles thrown off with
great velocity, and in all directions, from luminous
bodies ; and he supposes that these particles while
passing through the ether, excite in it vibrations or
pulses which accelerate or retard the particles of
light, and thus throw them into their alternate fits
of easy reflection and transmission.

   Hence, if a ray of light falls upon a transparent
body, in which the ether consists of strata of varia
ble density, the particles of light acted upon by the
vibrations which they create will be urged with an

accelerated velocity in entering the body, while their
velocity will be retarded in quitting it. In this man
ner he conceives the phenomena of refraction to be
produced, and he shows how in such a case the
274     SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

refraction would be regulated by the law of the
sines.
In order that the ethereal medium may produce
the fits of easy reflection and transmission, he con
ceives that its vibrations must be swifter than light.
He computes its elasticity to be 490,000,000,000
times greater than that of air, in proportion to its
density, and about 600,000,000 times more rare than
water, from which he infers that the resistance
which it would oppose to the motions of the planets
would not be sensible in 10,000 years. He considers
that the functions of vision and hearing may be per
formed chiefly by the vibrations of this medium,
executed in the bottom of the eye, or in the auditory
nerve by the rays of light, and propagated through
the 'solid, pellucid, and uniform capillamenta of the
optic or auditory nerves into the place of sensation ;
and he is of opinion that animal motion may be
performed by the vibrations of the same medium,
excited in the brain by the power of the will, and
propagated from thence by the solid, pellucid, and
uniform capillamenta of the nerves into the muscles
for contracting and dilating them.
In the registers of the Royal Society there exist
several letters* on the excitation of electricity in
glass, which were occasioned by an experiment of
this kind having been mentioned in Sir Isaac's
hypothesis of light. The society had ordered the
experiment to be tried at their meeting of the 16th
December, 1675 ; but, in order to secure its success,
Mr. Oldenburg wrote to Sir Isaac for a more par
ticular account of it. Sir Isaac being tnus "put
upon recollecting himself a little farther about it,"
remembers that he made the experiment with a
glass fixed at the distance of the -jd of an inch from

above them and rubbed, the pieces of paper leaped
from the one part of the glass to the other, and
twirled about in the air. Notwithstanding this ex
plicit account of the experiment, it entirely failed
at the Royal Society, and the secretary was de
sired to request the loan of Sir Isaac's apparatus,
and to inquire whether or not he had secured the

December, Sir  "Iswaaitch
                           recommended to the   society to
rub the glass              stuff whose threads  may rake
its surface, and, if that will not do, to rub it with
the fingers' ends to and fro, and knock them as
often upon the glass." These directions enabled
the society to succeed with the experiment on the
13th January, 1676, when they used a scrubbing
brush of short hog's bristles, and the heft of a knife
made with whalebone.
Among the minor inventions of Sir Isaac Newton,
we must enumerate his reflecting instrument for
observing the moon's distance from the fixed stars
at sea. The description of this instrument was com
municated to Dr. Halley in the year 1700 ; but, either
from having mislaid the manuscript, or from attach
ing no value to the invention, he never communi
cated it to the Royal Society, and it remained among
his papers till after his death in 1742, when it was
published in the Philosophical Transactions. The
following is Sir Isaac's own description of it as

This ingenious contrivance is obviously the very
same invention as that which Mr. Hadley produced
in 1731, and which, under the name of Hadley's
Quadrant, has been of so great service in navigation.
The merit of its first invention must therefore be
transferred to Sir Isaac Newton.
In the year 1672, Sir Isaac communicated to
Mr. Oldenburg his design for a microscope, which
he considered to be as capable of improvement as
the telescope, and perhaps more so, because it
requires only one speculum. This microscope is
shown in the annexed diagram, where AB is the
object-metal, CD the eAyea-glass, F their common

the object is placed. This ingenious idea has been

greatly improved in modern times by Professor
Amici, who makes AB a portion of an ellipsoid,
whose foci are O and F, and who places a small

In order to remedy the evils arising from the
weak reflecting power of speculum metal, and from
its tarnishing by exposure to the air, Sir Isaac pro

   One great advantage of this prism, which cannot
be obtained from the oval metal, is, that without
using two glasses the object may be erected, and
the magnifying power of the telescope varied at
pleasure, by merely varying the distances of the

will be less than that at G. The prism BCD per
forms the same part as a convex lens, G and H
being its conjugate foci, and the relative size of the
images formed at these points being proportional to
their distance from the lens. This construction
would be a good one for varying optically the angu
lar distance of a pair of wires placed in the focus of

the eye-glass EF ; and by bisecting the lenticular

prism BCD, and giving the halves a slight inclina
tion, we should be able to separate and to close the
two images or disks which would thus be produced,
and thusform a double image micrometer.
Among the minor and detached labours of Sir
Isaac, we must not omit his curious experiments on
the action of light upon the retina. Locke seems
to have wished his opinion respecting a fact stated
in Boyle's Book on Colours, and in a letter from
Cambridge, dated June 30th, 1691, he communicated
to his friend the following very remarkable obser
va"tioTnhse  made by himself.
               observation you  mention   in Mr. Boyle's
book of colours I once made upon         myself with the
hazard of my eyes. The manner was this ; I looked
a very little while upon the sun in the looking-glass
with my right eye, and then turned my eyes into a
dark corner of my chamber, and winked, to observe
the impression made, and the circles of colours
which encompassed   and how they decayed by
degrees, and at last vanished. This repeatedit,

second and third time. At the third time, when
the phantasm of light and colours about wereI
almost vanished, intending my fancy upon them toa

    Successors.

    About the year 1722, Sir Isaac was desirous of
publishing a third edition of his Principia, and the
premature death of Mr. Cotes having deprived him
of his valuable aid, he had the good fortune to be
come acquainted with Dr. Henry Pemberton, a young
and accomplished physician, who had cultivated
mathematical learning with considerable success.
M. Poleni, an eminent professor in the University
of Padua, having endeavoured, on the authority of
a new experiment, to overturn the common opinion
respecting the force of bodies in motion, and to es
tablish that of Leibnitz in its place, Dr. Pemberton
transmitted to Dr. Mead a demonstration of its
inaccuracy. Dr. Mead communicated this paper to
Sir Isaac, who not only highly approved of it, but
added a demonstration of his own, drawn from
another consideration of the subject ; and this was
printed without his name, as a postscript to Pem-
berton's paper, when it appeared in the Transac
tions.*

   In a short time after the commencement of their
acquaintance, Sir Isaac engaged Dr. Pemberton to
superintend the new edition of the Principia. In

discharging this duty, Dr. Pemberton had occasion
to make many remarks on this work, which Sir Isaac

                  * Bee Phil. Trans. 1722, vol. ixxiii. p. SI.
ILL HEALTH.  285

always received with the utmost goodness, and the
new edition appeared with numerous alterations in
1726. On the occasions upon which he had per
sonal intercourse with Sir Isaac, and which were
necessarily numerous, he endeavoured to learn his
opinions on various mathematical subjects, and to
obtain some historical information respecting his
inventions and discoveries. Sir Isaac entered freely
into all these topics ; and during the conversations
which took place, and while they were reading
together Dr. Pemberton's popular account of Sir
Isaac's discoveries, he obtained the most perfect
evidence that, though his memory was much de
cayed, yet he was fully able to understand his own
writings.

   During the last twenty years of his life, which he
spent in London, the charge of his domestic con
cerns devolved upon his beautiful and accomplished
niece, Mrs. Catharine Barton, the wife of Colonel
Barton, for whom, as we have already seen, the
Earl of Halifax had conceived the warmest affec
tion. This lady, who had been educated at her
uncle's expense, married Mr. Conduit, and continued
to reside with her husband in Sir Isaac's house till
the time of his death.

   In the year 1722, when he had reached the
eightieth year of his age, he was seized with an
incontinence of urine, which was ascribed to stone
in the bladder, and was considered incurable. By
means of a strict regimen, however, and other pre

cautions, he was enabled to alleviate his complaint,
and to procure long intervals of ease. At this time
he gave up the use of his carriage, and always went
out in a chair. He declined all invitations to dinner,
and at his own house he had only small parties. In
his diet he was extremely temperate. Though he
took a little butcher meat, yet the principal articles
of his food were broth, vegetables, and fruit, of

which he always ate very heartily. In spite of all
286  SHt ISAAC NEWTON.

 his precautions, however, he experienced a return
 of his old complaint, and in August, 1724, he passed
 a stone the size of a pea, which came away in two
 pieces, the one at the distance of two days from the
 other. After some months of tolerable good health,
 he was seized in January, 1725, with a violent cough
 and inflammation of the lungs ; and in consequence
 of this attack, he was prevailed upon, with some
 difficulty, to take up his residence at Kensington,
 where his health experienced a decided improve
 ment. In February, 1725, he was attacked in both
 his feet with a fit of the gout, of which he had re
ceived a slight warning a few years before, and the
 effect of this new complaint was to produce a great
 and beneficial change in his general health. On
 Sunday the 7th March, when his head was clearer
 and his memory stronger than Mr. Conduit had
 known it to be for some time, he entered into a long
 conversation on various subjects in astronomy. He
 explained to Mr. Conduit how comets might be
 formed out of the light of vapours discharged from
 the sun and the fixed stars as the centres of sys
 tems. He conceived that these luminaries were
 replenished by the same comets being again returned
 to them ; and upon this~principle he explained the
 extraordinary lights which were seen among the
 fixed stars by Hipparchus, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler's
 disciples, and which he supposed to arise from the
 additional fuel which they received.*

    Notwithstanding the improvement which his health
 had experienced, his indisposition was still suffi
 ciently severe to unfit him for the discharge of his
 duties at the mint ; and as his old deputy was con

 fined with the dropsy, he was desirous in 1725 of

 resigning his office to Mr. Conduit. Difficulties
 probably were experienced in making this arrange
 ment, but his nephew discharged for him all the

duties of his office ; and during the last year of his
life he hardly ever went to the mint.
But though every kind of motion was calculated
to aggravate his complaint, and though he had de
rived from absolute rest and from the air at Ken
sington the highest benefit, yet great difficulty was
experienced in preventing him from occasionally
going to town. Feeling himself able for the jour
ney, he went to London on Tuesday the 28th of
February, 1727, to preside at a meeting of the Royal
Society. On the following day Mr. Conduit con
sidered him better than he had been for many years,
and Sir Isaac was himself so sensible of this im
provement in his health, that he assured his nephew
that on the Sunday preceding, he had slept from
eleven o'clock at night till eight o'clock next morn
ing without waking. He had undergone, however,
great fatigue in attending the meeting of the Royal
Society, and in paying and receiving visits, and the
consequence of this was a violent return of his
former complaint. He returned to Kensington on
Saturday the 4th March, and was attended by Dr.
Mead and Dr. Cheselden, who pronounced his dis
ease to be stone, and held out no hopes of his
recovery. From the time of his last journey to
London he had experienced violent fits of pain with
very short intermissions ; and though the drops of
sweat ran down his face during these severe parox
ysms, yet he never uttered a cry or a complaint, or
displayed the least marks of peevishness or impa
tience; but during the short intervals of relief which
occurred, he smiled and conversed with his usual
gayety and cheerfulness.
                           On Wednesday the 15th
of March he seemed a      little better; and slight,

though groundless hopes were entertained of his
recovery. On the morning of Saturday the 18th
he read the newspapers, and carried on a pretty long
conversation with Dr. Mead, when all his senses and
faculties were strong and vigorous ; but at six o'clock
   288 SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

  of the same evening he became insensible, and he
  continued in that state during the whole of Sunday,
  and till Monday the 20th, when he expired between
  one and two o'clock in the morning, in the eighty-
  fifth year of his age.

     His body was removed from Kensington to Lon
  don, and on Tuesday the 28th March it lay in state
  in the Jerusalem Chamber, and was thence conveyed
  to Westminster Abbey, where it was buried near the
 entrance into the choir on the left-hand. The pall
 was supported by the Lord High Chancellor, the
 Dukes of Roxburghe and Montrose, and the Earls
 of Pembroke, Sussex, and Macclesfield, who were
 Fellows of the Royal Society. The Hon. Sir Mi
 chael Newton, Knight of the Bath, was chief
 mourner, and was followed by some other relations,
 and several distinguished characters who were inti
 mately acquainted with the deceased. The funeral
 service was performed by the Bishop of Rochester,
 attended by the prebend and choir.

    Sensible of the high honour which they derived
 from their connexion with so distinguished a phi
 losopher, the relations of Sir Isaac Newton who
 inherited his personal estate,* agreed to devote 500/.
 to the erection of a monument to his memory, and
 the dean and chapter of Westminster appropriated
 for it a place in the most conspicuous part of the
 Abbey, which had often been refused to the greatest
of our nobility. This monument was erected in
 1731. On the front of a sarcophagus resting on a
pedestal are sculptured in basso-relievo youths bear

cipal discoveries. One carries a prism, another a

a furnace, and two others are loaded with money
newly coined. On the sarcophagus is placed the
figure of Sir Isaac in a cumbent posture, with his
elbow resting on several of his works. Two youths
stand before him with a scroll, on which is drawn a
remarkable diagram relative to the solar system, and
above that is a converging series. Behind the sar
cophagus is a pyramid, from the middle of which
rises a globe in mezzo-relievo, upon which several
of the constellations are drawn, in order to show
the path of the comet of 1681, whose period Sir
Isaac had determined, and also the position of the
solstitial colure mentioned by Hipparchus, and by
means of which Sir Isaac had, in his Chronology,
fixed the time of the Argonautic expedition. A figure
of Astronomy as Queen of the Sciences sits weep
ing on the Globe with a sceptre in her hand, and a
star surmounts the summit of the pyramid. The
following epitaph is inscribed on the monument.

   In the beginning of 1731, a medal was struck at
the Tower in honour of Sir Isaac Newton. It had
on one side the head of the philosopher, with the

motto, Felix cognoscere causas, and on the reverse a
figure representing the mathematics.

   On the 4th February, 1755, a magnificent full-
length statue of Sir Isaac Newton in white marble

was erected in the antechapel of Trinity College.

He is represented standing on a pedestal in a loose
gown, holding a prism, and looking upwards with an
expression of the deepest thought. On the pedestal
is the inscription,

                       Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit.
                           Who surpassed all men in genius.

   This statue, executed by Roubiliac, was erected

at the expense of Dr. Robert Smith, the author of

the Compleat System of Optics, and professor of as
tronomy and experimental philosophy at Cambridge.
--It has been thus described by a modern poet:

                       Hark where the organ, full and clear,
                     With loud hosannas charms the ear ;
                          Behold, a prism within his hands,
                         Absorbed in thought great Newton stands
                          Such was his brow, and looks serene,
                       His serious gait and musing mien,
                       When taught on eagle wings to fly,
                       He traced the wonders of the sky ;
                       The chambers of the sun exj S-ed,
                       Where tints of thousand hues were-stored.

   Dr. Smith likewise bequeathed the sum of 500/.
          PROPERTY SUCCESSORS.                            291

for executing a painting on glass for the window at
the south end of Trinity College, Cambridge. The
subject represents the  pGreeosregnetaItIiIo.n,   of Sir   Isaac
                                                 who is   seated
Newton to his majesty
under a canopy with a laurel chaplet in his hand, and
attended by the British Minerva, apparently advising
him to reward merit in the person of the great phi
losopher. Below the throne, the Lord Chancellor
Bacon is proposing to register the reward about to
be conferred upon Sir Isaac. The original drawing
of this absurd picture was executed by Cypriani,
and cost one hundred guineas.
The personal estate of Sir Isaac Newton, which
was worth about 32,000/., was divided among his
four nephews and four nieces of the half-blood, the
grandchildren of his mother by the Reverend Mr.
Smith. The family estates of Woolsthorpe and
Sustern he bequeathed to John Newton, the heir-at-
law, whose great-grandfather was Sir Isaac's uncle.
This gentleman does not seem to have sufficiently
valued the bequest, for he sold them in 1732, to Ed

mund Turnor of Stoke Rocheford.* A short time
before his death, Sir Isaac gave away an estate in
Berkshire to the sons and daughter of a brother of
Mrs. Conduit, who, in consequence of their father
dying before Sir Isaac, had no share in the personal
estate ; and he also gave an estate of the same value,
which he bought at Kensington, to Catharine, the
only daughter of Mr. Conduit, who afterward mar
ried Mr. Wallop, the eldest son of Lord Lymington.
This lady was afterward Viscountess Lymington,
and the estate of Kensington descended to the late
Earl of Portsmouth, by whom it was sold. Sir Isaac
was succeeded as master and warden in the mint by
his nephew, John Conduit, Esq., who wrote a trea
tise on the gold and silver coin, and who died in
1737, leaving behind him his wife and daughter, the
former of whom died in 1739, in the 59th year of
her age.

    Such were the last days of Sir Isaac Newton, and
such the last laurels which were shed over his grave.

A century of discoveries has since his day been

added to science ; but brilliant as these discoveries
are, they have not obliterated the minutest of his
labours, and have served only to brighten the halo
which encircles his name. The achievements of
genius, like the source from which they spring, are
indestructible. Acts of legislation and deeds of war
may confer a high celebrity, but the reputation which
they bring is only local and transient; and while
they are hailed by the nation which they benefit,
they are reprobated by the people whom they ruin
or enslave. The labours of science, on the contrary,
bear along with them no counterpart of evil. They
are the liberal bequests of great minds to every
individual of their race, and wherever they are weir
corned and honoured they become the solace of
private life, and the ornament and bulwark of the
commonwealth.

   The importance of Sir Isaac Newton's discoveries

has been sufficiently exhibited in the preceding

chapters : the peculiar character of his genius, and
the method which he pursued in his inquiries, can
be gathered only from the study of his works, and
    CHARACTER OF HIS OF.NIUS.                   293

from the history of his individual labours. Were
we to judge of the qualities of his mind from the
early age at which he made his principal discoveries,
and from the rapidity of their succession, we should
be led to ascribe to him that quickness of penetra
tion, and that exuberance of invention, which is
more characteristic of poetical than of philosophical
genius. But we must recollect that Newton was
placed in the most favourable circumstances for the
development of his powers. The flower of his
youth and the vigour of his manhood were entirely
devoted to science. No injudicious guardian con
trolled his ruling passion, and no ungenial studies or
professional toils interrupted the continuity of his
pursuits. His discoveries were, therefore, the fruit
of persevering and unbroken study ; and he himself
declared, that whatever service he had done to the
public was not owing to any extraordinary sagacity,
but solely to industry and patient thought.
    Initiated early into the abstractions of geometry,
he  was deeply imbued with     her cautious
    his acquisitions were not  made with      spirit ; and
if                                           the rapidity
of intuition, they were at least firmly secured; and
the grasp which he took of his subject was propor
tional to the mental labour which it had exhausted.
Overlooking what was trivial, and separating what
was extraneous, he bore down with instinctive
sagacity on the prominences of his subject, and
having thus grappled with its difficulties, he never
failed to intrench himself in its strongholds.
    To the highest powers of invention Newton
added, what so seldom accompanies them, the talent
of simplifying and communicating his profoundest
speculations.* In the economy of her distributions,
nature is seldom thus lavish of her intellectual gifts.
The inspired genius which creates is rarely con

ferred along with the matured judgment which
combines, and yet without the exertion of both the
fabric of human wisdom could never have been
reared. Though a ray from heaven kindled the
vestal fire, yet an humble priesthood was required to

keep alive the flame.

   The method of investigating truth by observation
and experiment, so successfully pursued in the Prin-
cipia, has been ascribed by some modern writers of
great celebrity to Lord Bacon ; and Sir Isaac New
ton is represented as having owed all his discoveries
to the application of the principles of that distin
guished writer. One of the greatest admirers of
Lord Bacon has gone so far as to characterize him
as a man who has had no rival in the times which
are past, and as likely to have none in those which
are to come. In a eulogy so overstrained as this,
we feel that the language of panegyric has passed
into that of idolatry ; and we are desirous of weigh
ing the force of arguments which tend to depose
Newton from the high-priesthood of nature, and to
unsettle the proud destinies of Copernicus, Galileo,
and Kepler.

writer of the age which he adorned, are points which
have been established by universal suffrage. The
study of ancient systems had early impressed him
with the conviction that experiment and observation
were the only sure guides in physical inquiries ;
and, ignorant though he was of the methods, the
principles, and the details of the mathematical
sciences, his ambition prompted him to aim at the
construction of an artificial system by which the
laws of nature might be investigated, and which
might direct the inquiries of philosophers in every
future age. The necessity of experimental research,
and of advancing gradually from the study of facta

to the determination of their cause, though the
groundwork of Bacon's method, is a doctrine which
was not only inculcated but successfully followed

by preceding philosophers. In a letter from Tycho
Brahe to    K"etpolelra,ythais   industrious astronomer           urges
his pupil                       solid foundation for his          views

by actual observation, and then by ascending from
these to strive to reach the causes of things ;" and
it was no doubt under the influence of this advice
that Kepler submitted his wildest fancies to the test

of observation, and was conducted to his most
splendid discoveries. The reasonings of Coperni
cus, who preceded Bacon by more than a century,
were all founded upon the most legitimate induction.
Dr. Gilbert had exhibited in his treatise on the
magnet* the most perfect specimen of physical re
search. Leonardo da Vinci had described in the
clearest manner the proper method of philosophical
investigation ;f and the whole scientific career of
Galileo was one continued example of the most

gen"iuIns. treating any particular subject, I would first of all make some
experiments, because my design is first to refer to experiment, and then
to demonstrate why bodies are constrained to act in such a manner.
This is the method which we ought to follow in investigating the phe
nomena of nature. It is very true that nature begins by reasoning and
Iends with experiment ; but it matters not, we must take the opposite

course ; as have said, we must begin by experiment, and endeavour
by its means to discover general principles." Thus, says Ventusi, spoke
Leonard a century before Bacon, and thus, we add, did Leonard tell phi
losophers all that they required for the proper investigation of general

J.laws. See Essai sur les ceuvrages pfiysico-mathematiques de Leonard

sagacious application of observation and experiment
to the discovery of general laws. The names of
Paracelsus, Van Helmont, and Cardan have been
ranged in opposition to this constellation of great
names, and while it is admitted that even they had
thrown off the yoke of the schools, and had suc
ceeded in experimental research, their credulity and
ttohetihrepr"ebteunlksioonfs   have been adduced as a proof that
                              philosophers" the method of induc
tion was unknown. The fault of this argument con
sists in the conclusion being infinitely more general
than the fact. The errors of these men were not
founded on their ignorance, but on their presump
tion. They wanted the patience of philosophy and
not her methods. An excess of vanity, a wayward
ness of fancy, and an insatiable appetite for that
species of passing fame which is derived from eccen
tricity of opinion, moulded the reasonings and dis
figured the writings of these ingenious men ; and it
can scarcely admit of a doubt, that, had they lived
in the present age, their philosophical character
would have received the same impress from the
peculiarity of their tempers and dispositions. This
is an experiment, however, which cannot now be
made ; but the history of modern science supplies
the defect, and the experience of every man fur
nishes a proof that in the present age there are
many philosophers of elevated talents and inventive
genius who are as impatient of experimental re
search as Paracelsus, as fanciful as Cardan, and as
presumptuous as Van Helmont.
Having thus shown that the distinguished philoso
phers who flourished before Bacon were perfect
masters both of the principles and practice of in
ductive research, it becomes interesting to inquire
whether or not the philosophers who succeeded
him acknowledged any obligation to his system, or
Ifderived the slightest advantage from his precepts.

    Bacon constructed a method to which modern

science owes its existence, we shall find its cultiva
tors grateful for the gift, and offering the richest
incense at the shrine of a benefactor whose gene
rous labours conducted them to immortality. No
such testimonies, however, are to be found. Nearly
two hundred years have gone by, teeming with
the richest fruits of human genius, and no grateful
disciple has appeared to vindicate the rights of the
alleged legislator of science. Even Newton, who
was born and educated after the publication of the
Novum Organon, never mentions the name of Bacon
or his system, and the amiable and indefatigable
Boyle treated him with the same disrespectful
silence. When we are told, therefore, that Newton
owed all his discoveries to the method of Bacon,

nothing more can be meant than that he proceeded
in that path of observation and experiment which
had been so warmly recommended in the Novum
Organon ; but it ought to have been

have enriched science with the same splendid dis
coveries if the name and the writings of Bacon had
never been heard of.
   From this view of the subject we shall now pro
ceed to examine the Baconian process itself, and
consider if it possesses any merit as an artificial
method of discovery, or if it is at all capable of being
employed, for this purpose, even in the humblest
walks of scientific inquiry.
   The process of Lord Bacon was, we believe, never
tried by any philosopher but himself. As the sub
ject of its application, he selected that of heat. With
his usual erudition,      h--e hceolalercratendgedaltlhtehme  fiancttsabwlehsi,c--h

he cross-questioned them with all the subtlety of a

298             SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

magic of his exclusive processes. But, after all this
display of physical logic, nature thus interrogated
was still silent. The oracle which he had himself
established refused to give its responses, and the
ministering priest was driven with discomfiture from
his own shrine. This example, in short, of the ap
plication of his system, will remain to future ages
as a memorable instance of the absurdity of attempt
ing to fetter discovery by any artificial rules.
Nothing even in mathematical science can be
more certain than that a collection of scientific facts
are of themselves incapable of leading to discovery,
or to the determination of general laws, unless they
contain the predominating fact or relation in which
the discovery mainly resides. A vertical column of
arch-stones possesses more strength than the same
materials arranged in an arch without the key-stone.
However nicely they are adjusted, and however no
bly the arch may spring, it never can possess either
equilibrium or stability. In this comparison all the
facts are supposed to be necessary to the final re
sult ; but, in the inductive method, it is impossible
to ascertain the relative importance of any facts, or

even to determine if the facts have any value at all,
till the master-fact which constitutes the discovery
has crowned the zealous efforts of the aspiring phi
losopher. The mind then returns to the dark and
barren waste over which it has been hovering; and
by the guidance of this single torch it embraces,
under the comprehensive grasp of general princi
ples, the multifarious and insulated phenomena which
had formerly neither value nor connexion. Hence
it must be obvious to the most superficial thinker,
that discovery  consists  --eistohmere  in the detection of
some concealed  relation
                                         deep-seated affinity

its divergence to all the phenomena which it em
braces and explains.
In order to give additional support to these views,
it would be interesting to ascertain the general char
acter of the process by which a mind of acknow
ledged power actually proceeds in the path of suc
cessful inquiry. The history of science does not
furnish       with much information on this head, and
          us  be found at all, it must be gleaned from
if it is  to
the biographies of eminent men. Whatever this

process may be in its details, if it has any, there
cannot be the slightest doubt that in its generalities
at least it is the very reverse of the method of in
duction. The impatience of genius spurns the re
straints of mechanical rules, and never will submit
to the plodding drudgery of inductive discipline.
The discovery of a new fact unfits even a patient
mind for deliberate inquiry. Conscious of having
added to science what had escaped the sagacity of
former ages, the ambitious spirit invests its new
acquisition with an importance which does not be
long to it. He imagines a thousand consequences
to flow from his discovery : he forms innumerable
theories to explain and he exhausts his fancy in
trying all its possible relations to recognised diffiit,

culties and unexplained facts. The reins, however,
thus freely given to his imagination, are speedily
drawn up. His wildest conceptions are all subjected
to the rigid test of experiment, and he has thus been
hurried by the excursions of his own fancy into new
and fertile paths, far removed from ordinary obser
vation. Here the peculiar character of his own ge
nius displays itself by the invention of methods of
trying his own speculations, and he thus often led
to new discoveries far more important and general
than that by which he began his inquiry. For
confirmation of these views, we may refer to the
History of Kepler's Discoveries and we do not
recognise them to the same extent in the labours of
300          SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

Newton, it is because he kept back his discoveries
till they were nearly perfected, and therefore with
held the successive steps of his inquiries.
The social character of Sir Isaac Newton was
such as might have been expected from his intel
lectual attainments. He was modest, candid, and
affable, and without any of the eccentricities of ge
nius, suiting himself to every company, and speaking
of himself and others in such a manner that he was

with the utmost goodness. These were so far from
being any ways displeasing to him, that on the con
trary it occasioned him to speak many kind things
of me to my friends, and to honour me with a public
testimony of his good opinion."
The modesty of Sir Isaac Newton in reference to
his great discoveries was not founded on any indif'
ferenc'e to the fame which they conferred, or upon
any erroneous judgment of their importance to
science. The whole of his life proves, that he knew
his place as a philosopher, and was determined to
assert and vindicate his rights. His modesty arose
from the depth and extent of his knowledge, which
showed him what a small portion of nature he had
been able to examine, and how much remained to
be explored in the same field in which he had him
self laboured. In the magnitude of the comparison
he recognised his own littleness ; and a short time

The native simplicity of Sir Isaac Newton's mind
is finely portrayed in the affecting letter in which
he acknowledges to Locke that he had thought and
spoken of him uncharitably ; and the humility and
candour in which he asks forgiveness could have
emanated only from a mind as noble as it was pure.

   In the religious and moral character of our author
there is much to admire and to imitate. While he
exhibited in his life and writings an ardent regard
for the general interests of religion, he was at the
same time a firm believer in revelation. He was
too deeply versed in the Scriptures, and too much
imbued with their spirit, to judge harshly of other
men who took different views of them from himself.
He cherished the great principles of religious tole
ration, and never scrupled to express his abhorrence
of persecution, even in its mildest form. Immo
rality and impiety he never permitted to pass unre-

and three female servants. In his own house he

was hospitable and kind, and on proper occasions
he gave splendid entertainments, though without

ostentation or vanity. His own diet was frugal, and
his dress was always simple ; but on one occasion,
when he opposed the Honourable Mr. Annesley in
1705, as a candidate for the university, he is said to
have put on a suit of laced clothes.

   His generosity and charity had no bounds, and he
used to remark, that they who gave away nothing
till they died never gave at all. Though his wealth
had become considerable by a prudent economy, yet
he had always a contempt for money, and he spent
a considerable part of his income in relieving the
poor, in assisting his relations, and in encouraging
ingenuity and learning. The sums which he gave
to his relations at different times were enormous ;*
and in 1724 he wrote a letter to the Lord Provost
of Edinburgh, offering to contribute 201. per annum
to a provision for Mr. Maclaurin, provided he ac
cepted the situation of assistant to Mr. James Greg
ory, who was professor of mathematics in the uni
versity.

   The habits of deep meditation which Sir Isaac
Newton had acquired, though they did not show
themselves in his intercourse with society, exer
cised their full influence over his mind when in the
midst of his own family. Absorbed in thought he
would often sit down on his bedside after he rose,
and remain there for hours without dressing himself,
occupied with some interesting investigation which
had fixed his attention. Owing to the same absence
of mind, he neglected to take the requisite quantity

to remind him of his meals.*
Sir Isaac Newton is supposed to have had little
knowledge of the world, and to have been very ig
norant of the habits of society. This opinion has,
we think, been rashly deduced from a letter which
he wrote in the twenty-seventh year of his age to
his young friend, Francis Aston, Esq., who was about
to set out on his travels. This letter is a highly
interesting production ; and while it shows much
knowledge of the human heart, it throws a strong
light upon the character and opinions of its author.
In his personal appearance, Sir Isaac Newton was
not above the middle size, and in the latter part of
his  life was  in" chleinehdadtoa

which appears in his compositions. He had some
thing rather languid in his look and manner which
did not raise any great expectation in those who did

is confirmed by an observation of Mr. Thomas

* The following anecdote of Sir Isaac's absence has been published,
but I cannot vouch for its authenticity. His intimate friend Dr. Stukely,
who had been deputy to Dr. Hailey as secretary to the Royal Society,
was one day shown into Sir Isaac's dining-room, where his dinner had
been for some time served up. Dr. Stukely waited for a considerable
time, and getting impatient, he removed the cover from a chicken, which
he ate, replacing the bones under the cover. In a short time Sir Isaac
entered the room, and after the usual compliments sat down to his din

Besides the statue of Sir Isaac Newton executed
by Roubiliac, there is a bust of him by the same
artist in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge.
Several good paintings of him are extant. Two
of these are in the hall of the Royal Society of
London, and have, we believe, been often engraved.
Another, by Vanderbank, is in the apartments of
the Master's lodge in Trinity College, and has been
engraved by Vertue. Another, by Valentine Ritts,
is in the landing-place near the entrance to Trinity

ler, and is in the possession of Lord Egremont at
Petworth. In the university library there is pre
served a cast taken from his face after death.
Every memorial of so great a man as Sir Isaac
Newton has been preserved and cherished with pecu
liar veneration. His house at Woolsthorpe, of which
we have given an engraving, has been religiously
protected by Mr. Turnor of Stoke Rocheford, the
proprietor. Dr. Stukeley, who visited it in Sir
Isaac's lifetime, on the 13th October, 1721, gives the
following description of it in his letter to Dr. Mead,

written in 1727: "'Tis built of stone as is the way

There were some years ago two or three hundred

where Sir Isaac was born, with the following in

 butions of Newton, Cotes, and others. His telescope,
 represented in fig. 1, page 41, is preserved in the
 library of the Royal Society of London, and his globe,

 his universal ring-dial, quadrant, compass, and a re
 flecting telescope said to have belonged to him, in

 the library of Trinity College. There is also in the
 same collection a long and curled lock of his silver
 white hair. The door of his bookcase is in the Mu
 seum of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

   The manuscripts, letters, and other papers of New

 ton have been preserved in different collections. His
 correspondence with Cotes relative to the second
 edition of the Principia, and amounting to between
 sixty and a hundred letters, a considerable portion
 of the manuscript of that work, and two or three
letters to Dr. Keill on the Leibnitzian controversy,
 are preserved in the library of Trinity College, Cam
bridge. Newton's letters to Flamstead, about thirty-
four in number, are deposited in the library of Corpus
Christi College, Oxford.* Several letters of New
ton, and, we believe, the original specimen which he
drew up of the Principia, exist among the papers of
Mr. William Jones (the father of Sir William Jones),
which are preserved at Shirburn Castle, in the library
of Lord Macclesfield. But the great mass of New
ton's papers came into the possession of the Ports
mouth family through his niece, Lady Lymington,
and have been safely preserved by that noble family.
There is reason to believe that they contain nothing
which could be peculiarly interesting to science ; but
as the correspondence of Newton with contempo
rary philosophers must throw considerable light on
his personal history, we trust that it will ere long be

given to the public.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE FAMILY OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON.

In the year 1705, Sir Isaac gave into the Herald's
Office an elaborate pedigree, stating upon oath that
he had reason to believe that John Newton of Westby,
in the county of Lincoln, was his great-grandfather's
father, and that this was the same John Newton who
was buried in Basingthorpe church, on the 22d De
cember, 1563. This John Newton had four sons,
John, Thomas, Richard, and William Newton of
Gunnerly, the last of whom was great-grandfather
to Sir John Newton, Bart., of Hather. Sir Isaac
considered himself as descended from the eldest of
these, he having, by tradition from his kindred ever

since he can remember, reckoned himself next of kin
(among the Newtons) to Sir John Newton's family.

   The pedigree, founded upon these and other con
siderations, was accompanied by a certificate from

Sir John Newton, of Thorpe, Bart., who states that
he had heard his father speak of Sir Isaac Newton

as of his relation and   kinsman, and   that  hJoehnhimNseewlf
believed that Sir Isaac  was descended  from

ton, son to John Newton of .Westby, but knoweth not in
what particular manner.
The pedigree of Sir Isaac, as entered at the Her
ald's Office, does not seem to have been satisfactory
either to himself or to his successors, as it could not

be traced with certainty beyond his grandfather ; and
it will be seen from the following" interesting corres
pondence, that upon making further researches, he
had found some reason to believe that he was of
Scotch extraction.

a tradition in that family that Sir Isaac Newton
wrote a letter to the old knight that then was (I
think Sir John Newton of Newton was his name),
desiring to know what children, and particularly
what sons he had, their age, and what professions
they intended : that the old baronet never deigned
to return an answer to this letter, which his family
was sorry for, as they thought Sir Isaac might have
intended to do something for them."

Several years after this letter was written, a Mr.
Barron, a relation of Sir Isaac Newton, seems to

have been making inquiries respecting the family
of his ancestor, and in consequence of this the late
Professor Robison applied to Dr. Reid, to obtain

what is above expressed, but that neither they nor
Mr. Gregory, as far as they knew, ever made any
further inquiry into the matter. This appeared very

that their father, Sir John, had a letter from Sir

returned an answer to this letter, thinking probably
that Sir Isaac was some upstart, who wanted to
claim a relation to his worshipful house. This omis

This curious letter I published in the Ed. Phil.
Journal for Octoberl, 1820. It excited the particular
attention of the late George Chalmers, Esq., who
Isent me an elaborate letter upon the subject ; but as

  was at that time in the expectation of obtaining
some important information through other channels,
this letter was not published. This hope, however,

has been disappointed. A careful search has been
made through the charter-chest of the Newtons
of Newton in East Lothian, by Mr. Richard Hay
Newton, the representative of that family, but no
document whatever has been found that can throw

the least light upon the matter. It deserves to be

remarked, however, that Sir Richard Newton, the
alleged correspondent of Sir Isaac, appears to have
destroyed his correspondence ; for though the char
ter-chest contains the letters of his predecessors for
some generations, yet there is not a single epistolary
document either of his own or of his lady's.
Hitherto the evidence of Sir Isaac's Scottish de

                                       I am
kindness of Mr. Robison, to corroborate this evi
dence by the following information, derived, as will
be%seen, from the family of the Newtons of Newton.
Among various memoranda in the handwriting of
Professor Robison, who                 aatreontehetifmolelowpirnogpo:--sed to

                         Henderland      informed me in a letter
dated March, 1794, that he had heard from his infancy
that Sir Isaac considered himself as descended from
the family of Newton of Newton. This he heard
from      his   uncle Richard Newton of      oNfeNwetownha(wll)h:o"
         third  son of Lord William Hay

some of        his fortune to the family possessing the
estate with the title of baronet. Mr. Newton, not

                                     communicated to
Newton, Esq., of that ilk, 18th August, 1800."

covered how long the family of Newton have been
in possession of the barony, there being no tradition
concerning that circumstance further than that they
came     originally   from England                          a very distant
period,  and settled  on these lands."              --at "  The celebrated

Sir Isaac Newton was a distant relation of the
family, and corresponded with the last baronet, the
above-mentioned Sir Richard Newton."
The preceding documents furnish the most com
plete evidence that the conversation respecting Sir
Isaac Newton's family took place between him and
Mr. Gregory; and the testimony of Lord Henderland
proves that his own uncle, Richard Newton of New
ton, the immediate successor of Sir Richard Newton,
with whom Sir Isaac corresponded, was perfectly
confident that such a correspondence took place.

  All these circumstances prove that Sir Isaac New
ton could not trace his pedigree with any certainty
beyond his grandfather,            and that there were      two dif
ferent traditions in his
                                   family, --one which      referred
his descent to John Newton of Westby, and the
other to a gentleman of East Lothian who accom
panied King James VI. to England. In the first of
these traditions he seems to have placed most confi

dence in 1705, when he drew out his traditionary
pedigree ; but as the conversation with Professor
James Gregory respecting his Scotch extraction

tooK place twenty years afterward, namely, between
1725 and 1727, it is probable that he had discovered
the incorrectness of his first opinions, or at least
was disposed to attach more importance to the other
tradition respecting his descent from a Scotch family.

Chalmers, Esq. find the following observations

means opulent. The son of Sir Isaac's father's
brother was a carpenter called John. He was after
ward appointed gamekeeper to Sir Isaac, as lord
of the manor, and died at the age of sixty in 1725.
This John had a son, Robert, (John?) who was
Sir Isaac's second cousin, and who became possessed
of the whole land estates at and near Woolsthorpe,
which belonged to the great Newton, as his heir-at-
law.* Robert (John 1) became a worthless and disso
lute person, who very soon wasted this ancient patri
mony, and falling down with a tobacco-pipe in his
mouth when he was drunk, it broke in his throat,

LETTER FROM SIR ISAAC NEWTON TO FRANCIS ASTON,
    ESQ., A YOUNG FRIEND WHO WAS ON THE EVE OF SET
    TING OUT UPON HIS TRAVELS.

   Mr. Aston was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society in 1678. He held the office of Secretary
between 1681 and 1685 ; and he was the author of

some observations on certain unknown ancient char
acters, which were published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1693.

This letter has been referred to in pages 270 and

M A. REMARKABLE AND CURIOUS CONVERSATION BETWEEN
               SIR ISAAC NEWTON AND MR. CONDUIT."

  " I was on Sunday night, the 7th of March, 1724-5,

at Kensington with Sir Isaac Newton, in his lodgings,
just after he was come out of a fit of the gout,
which he had had in both his feet, for the first time,
                               APPENDIX.                321

in the eighty-third year of his age. He was better
I it,
after and his head clearer, and memory stronger
than had known them for some time. He then
repeated to me, by way of discourse, very distinctly,
though rather in answer to my queries than in one

continued narration, what he had often hinted to
me before, viz. that             was  his conjecture

emitted by the sun, which had their sediment as
water and other matter, had gathered themselves
by degrees into body, and attracted more matter

planet (viz. one of those that go round another
planet and then by gathering to them, and attract
ing more matter, became primary planet and

have five or six revolutions more first, but whenever
did would so much increase the heat of the sun
it
         it

that this earth would be burnt, and no animals in
could live. That he took the three phenomena seen
by Hipparchus, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler's disciples
to have been of this kind, for he could not otherwise
account for an extraordinary light as those were,
appearing all at once among the fixed stars (alj

which he took to be suns enlightening other planets
as our sun does ours) as big as Mercury or Venus
seems to us, and gradually diminishing for sixteen
months, and then sinking into nothing. He seemed
to doubt whether there were not intelligent beings
superior to us who superintended these revolutions
of the heavenly bodies by the direction of the
Supreme Being. He appeared also to be very
clearly of opinion that the inhabitants of this world
were of a short date, and alleged as one reason for
that opinion, that all arts, as letters, ships, printing,
needle, &c., were discovered within the memory of
history, which could not have happened if the world
had been eternal ; and that there were visible marks

have been repeopled if ever it had undergone the
same fate it was threatened with hereafter by the
comet of 1680, he answered, that required the power
of a Creator. He said he took all the planets to be
composed of the same matter with this earth, viz.
eI aarsthk,edwahtiemr,  stones,       &c., but variously  concocted.

deal in conjectures.' But upon my talking to him
about the four observations that had been made of
the comet of 1680, at 574 years' distance, and asking
him the particular times, he opened his Principia,
which laid on the table, and showed me there the
particular periods, viz. 1st, the Julium Sidus, in the
time of Justinian, in 1106, in 1680.
  And I, observing that he said there of that comet,
af dindcsi,de' stteinllaecofrixpaues   solis,' and in   the next   pIatrhaoguragphht
                                      refici possunt,'   told him
he owned there what we had been talking about, viz.
                    APPENDIX.                    323

that the comet would drop into the sun, and that fixed
stars were recruited and replenished by comets
when they dropped into them ; and, consequently,
that the sun would be recruited too ; and asked him
why he would not own as freely what he thought of
the sun as well as what he thought of the fixed stars.
He said, ' that     concerned us more
added, ' that       had said enough for  ;' and, laughing,
               h"e                       people to know
his meaning.'
