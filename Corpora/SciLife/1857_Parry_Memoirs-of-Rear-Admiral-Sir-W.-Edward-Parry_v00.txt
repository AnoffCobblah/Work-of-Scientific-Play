He was notoriginally intended for the naval profession,

but for that of a physician, and, indeed, until within a
few days of going to sea, had never himself bad any
other view. The decision which finally fixed his Aiture
course was made very suddenly. Miss Oomwallis, an
intimate friend of Dr. Parry and his femily, had often

advised, and even solicited, that Edward should be al>
lowed to become a sailor, feeling confident that his

character and tastes were well adapted for an active life
of that description. Admiral the Honorable W. Oom-
walliB, this lady's near relative, was in              command        of the
Channel fleet, off Brest ; and when the                " Ville de     Paris"

(Oaptain Ridketts) was on the point of leaving England
to j<nn that fleet- as the flag-ship, it was yielded to her
representations that the boy should be allowed to make
trial of a sea-life, at least for one cruise. When asked

hi» own choice, he professed himself ready to do what- ]
ever hia parents wished, and was, accordingly, in June,
1808, thioogb the kindness of the Admiral, appointed'
to the "Vflle de Paris," as a volunteer of the first

class.
hjThe evening before he left home to join his ship, it
so happened that a play was to be perfonrtr^d                         the

members of Dr. Morgan's school, in aid of some chari-

table object Edward had always shown considerable

mire.' Tho fHendship ihos formed continued after
their rotom to England, and remained unbroken until
Mr. Martyr's death, which occurred some years later.
The sorrow which Parry folt at the loss of this valued
friend, proved, as will be seen, the means of marking
the advance and development of his own religious
principles.

   Early in 1817, he was recalled to England, in con-
sequence of a severe family affliction. His father had,
in the preceding October, been seized with a paralytic
attack, which deprived him of the use of his right
side, and reduced him, for the remaining six years of
his life, to a state of great sulSfering and helplessness.
His father's illness, and his own despair of promotion,
combined to render this the gloomiest period of our
sailor's life ; but, when the cloud which overhung his
fortunes seemed most impenetrable, an opening unex-
pectedly occurred, which threw a gleam of encourage-
ment over his darkened professional prospects, and
finally proved the forerunner of success and renown.
: r At the conclusion of the war, and, consequently, of
active service on a Ibreign station, Parry, while yet on
the coast of America, had been anxious fer employ-
ment in some expedition fer the purpose of discovery.

A project of exploring the river Ckmgo, in Africa,

being in contemplation, he volunteered for this service,
 but, owipg to his detention at Bermudas, was prevent-
ed firom joining it in time. The travels of Olappwton
 had interested him much, and his attention continued
to be occupied with the subject of African discovery.

    About the close of the year 1817, in which he re-
turned to England, he wrote to a friend on this sub-
ject. The letter was written, but not posted, when his

yean afterwards, when another queen sat on the throne
of Elizabeth, a naval officer, travelling in all haste
flrom the north of our island, arrived at daybreak in

London, and announced to the world, that ti^e North*

tuiies, which elapsed between. the departure of Sir

Martin Frobisher from Greenwich, anu the arrival of

lieutenitnt S. G. Oresswell in London in 1868, with

despatches from Oaptain IfOlure, form an inteiesting
episode in history, being the time occupied in the solu>

be, in his day, '* the only great thing left undone in the

world."

ei^ojment of the IhiitB of this new field of enterprise.
Aooordinglj, Gaspor de Oortereol, a Portuguese of
high rank, sailed ftnm Lisbon in 1500, and returned

to that port tho next year, having made his way na ftr
as tho coast of Labrador, and bringing back with him
several of the nativeg, as trophies of those hitherto
unknown regions. Ho sailed again the next year to
follow up his discoveries, but was never heard of more.
His brother Michael went in search of him, but he, too,

never returned. A third brother offered to follow, but

tho King Emmanuel reftised to permit him to tempt a
similar fate,* and the loss of the two Gortereals will
ever remain one of the impenetrable mysteries of
Arctic story, a foretaste of that more prolonged tragedy
which has been witneflsed by our own generation.

   Frobisher was the first Englishman who sailed in
command of an expedition for the disoovery of a
North-West Passage, Oabot being of Venetian extrati*

tion, though his nautical &me was gained under tho
English flog. The first voyage of the former was
signalised by the disoovery of the strait, %hich bears

his name, but its more immediate results were singular.
Among the ouriosities brought home by him was «
piece of black stone, in appearance much like ordinary
sea coal. This, on being throwii into the fii*e, and
"quenched with vinegar," q>arkled like gold. The
news soon spread, like wildfire, that the "New Coun*

·<My Deasest Pabemts : The Greenland ships having,

at length, in tins latitude, found a plentifhl harvest of

whales, which are now 'blowing* about us in all direo-

tions, the ioe being open for us to the northward, it is
probable that we may here leave them. In regard to

our advance to the northward, it may be said that the

Iseason has been just like any other ; for the whimsioali'

ti9s (as can not help calling thorn) of the ioe are suofa,
that it is impoauble to say, from the appearancie of the
fields of it at one moment, how it will be in ten minutes

afterwards, so suddenly, and apparently without any

cause, does it sometimes open, when it could be least

expected. There is one great reason, however, for think<
ing that we shall do wonders in the next two months;

" Alexander" is more emphatic on this point " Not

o'clock, the weather being remarkably fine and clear,
land was not to bo discerned between N. 21'' W. and

N. 44° E. At this time, our distance from the north-
em land was estimated at seven or eight leagues, and
from the southern six or seven leagues, but, alas I the

sanguine hopes, and high expectations, excited by this
promising appearance of things, were but of short

duration, for, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the
'Isabella' tacked, very much to our surprise indeed, as
we could not see any thing like land at the bottom of

the inlet, nor was the weather well calculated at the
time for seeing any object at a great distance, it being
somewhat hazy. When she tacked, the ' Ibubella' was
about three or four miles ahead of us."

      the oonfidenoe thus reposed in him, promotion waa
      still delayed. For this, however, he now oared com-

     to the ground, by the sight of an extensive Inurrier of

     ice before them, beyond which no water oould be seen.

     They retraced their steps, accordingly, to Barrow's

     Straits, where, to their joy and surprise, the barrier
     of ice, which had before stopped them, had entirely

     disappeared.                           Fogs and light winds rendered their

      It was now the 7th of September, and the season for

The ships, throughout this winter were insufficiently
warmed, and fuel moreover was scarce. The bleak
shore oflfered no substitute, and their own stock was

carefully husbanded, in                case   they  "might    be obliged to
spend another winter in                the   ice.

tedious and most laborious task. All their efforts,
however, to get beyond the south-west extremity of
Melville   bland,   proved unavailing, and, convinced at

object. Parry, after consulting with the other                                   offloeis
of the expedition, determined that any fUrther                                  attempt
to proceed in that direction would be fhiitless.

               In anoh caie^ John Gordon was the man always called
                 for, and the man alwaya at hand. The year after our re-
                 turn to EngUmd, a fresh Arctic Expedition was fitted
                 out, under my command, and, to my great satisfaction,
               one of the first men who presented themselves to accom-

           Ipany, me was John Gordon, to whom gladly gave ouo
           Iof the best petty oflloer*s ratings. And reckoned great-

                 ly on the example such a man would set to all of ray

             orew. But Gk>d,in Hli mysterious providence, had or^

                 dered it otherwise. When the ship had dropped down
                 to Gravesend, Gordon was sent in a boat, one morning,
              to Uy a kedge anchor. In throwing the anchor out of
              the boat, one of the flukes oaught the gunwale, bringing
              it to the water's edge. The tide running very strong,
                Gordon saw that the boat must be swamped, and the

             orew greatly endangenad, if the anchor Were not instant-
              ly released. He flew iW>mthe stem-sheets past the other

                men, and, by the utmost eflbrt of his own muscnUur pow-

quartermaster came hastily down the hatchway, and

without exhibiting any signs of emotion, asked some
questions in low tone, and bade him return to his

            Of ooe of the Sunday evening gohook Mr. Hooper
         writeii in his journal :

         *'I have been, this evonbg, gratified beyond meaaure
         by the condaot of my Bohool. We aaiombled as usual,
         and Captain Parry read to ns an excellent sermon. Wo
         then read over three or four times the second lesson for
         Ithe day, and
                        expounded it to the best of my ability.
         IAfter this, we went to prayers, and, having closed,
J?:'     wished them good night as usual, when my ftiend John
 ffi'.K  Darke (one of the *Heola*s seamen) said he wished to say

         a few vrordi. He then returned to his knees, and, in a
         few simple but affecting words, returned thanks for the
         blessing enjoyed by himself and shipmates b a Christian
                 and a Christian teaoher,^mploring
         koaptam,  behalf of both Captain Parry and                                        the blessing
                                                                                        myself. After
         of God

         Ithis, he desired, for liimself and sliip-matos, to thauk me

         for the trouble had taken, and the countenance of every
         one spoke the same thing, and showed that they bad de-
         puted lilm to do this."

         The offloers and men of the present expedition hav*
         ing almost all served on the former voyages, it was

         thought expedient to     devise eome novelty in the                            way

"  The voyage of     1824, resulting in the                   loss of     the
   Fury," was the    last expedition in which                  Pany       was

engaged for the discovery of a North-West Passage,
his next publio service having a different end in view,
though it led him once more into similar scenes. Still,

wh^ie the great problem remained unsolved, his own

ezertiona had not been without brilliant res^t Lven
his Mures served as landmarks to guide th« deps of

those who followed in his track, and the extent of hia

auooess, on ground hitherto unexplored, had, in a great

measure, exhausted the more difficult part of the un-

       .   Immediately after his return fhjm tbe expedition
        recorded in the last chapter, Parrj resumed his duties

        as hydrographer at the Admiralty. On the 16th Feb-
        i-uary, 1826, thg freedom of the city of Lynn was voted
        to him by the corporation, " in testimony of the high
        .Hensethey entertained of his meritorious and enterpris-
        ing conduct."

           At this time, his interest in religious societies seems

        to have been first awakened. The Society for Promot-
        ing Christianity among the Jews, the Church Mission-
        ary, and the Naval and Military Bible Societies, are
        flrequently mentioned in his letters, the latter especially,
        for which he spoke at the annual May maeting of this

        year, besides taking an active part in the formation of

        an association at Chatham.

The rottgh naturo of tbo ioe, oombined with th«

Boftneu of its upper Bur&oe, rendered each day's

work very tedious and laborious. Often, their way

lay OYor small loose rugged masses, separated by little

pools of water, obliging them constantly to launch
and haul up the boats, each of which operations re*

quired them to be unloaded, and occupied nearly a
quarter of an hour. More than once, they were up*

wordfi of two hours in advancing one hundred yards,

and the snow was often so soft as to take them above

their knees at every step, so that they were sometimes
five minuter together in moving a single empty boat
with the united strength of the whole party, and the

men, in dragging the sledges, were obliged to crawl

on all-fours, to make any progress at all In parts,
the ice was composed, on its upper surfitoe, of irregular
needle-like crystals, which, becoming loosened by the

" thaw, rendered it very fktiguing to walk over, besideii

   that his acceptance of the Company's offer should in no
   way interfere with hia fhture prospects. Accordingly,

rant, who while fVilfllling the charge of an earthly
tewardship, remembered the yet higher tnut of a

heavenly oommiaiion, and, planting hia Maater^a vine-
yard with Roiona of the ' tareeof life,' reared a ohuroh in
the barren deterta of a heathen land. Sir Edward Parry
labored aa a mianonary among the oonviot lervanta of

hia aztensire eotobliahment, contending with a thou-

Mad difllcaltiai over incident to a spiritoal reform.

He erected a small but beautiftd church on the rich

borders of the calm Karuah, where a flock aoon gUully
assembled, to join in the sweet inoense of prayer and

praise^ where never prayer was hmxd before ; and hia
....example animated odMn to do the like.  It was
II the oloBe of a beautiftd Sabbath day, that once* sal*

lied forth for aa evening'a stroll, and almost unoon*

Ivoices^ as of children reading, pmiaed to listen, and,
Ialthough too ftrfrcHn the dweUing to hear distinctly,

saw, throned the open doorway, what was pasiring
within. The fiither of the Hunily, a conviot, sat near

the entrance with a young child oa his knee, while

llhree older ones were grouped around him, reading

fttnn the Scriptures, which from time to time he ez'

Iplained to them. Unwilling to intrude upon a fiunily

thua ODgaged, returned home^ unperoeived by those

Iwho had thus attracted and intereatod me, but on the

following day heard, from the lips of his wUb, the

                   Saturday morning, the 11th of May, her children were

                   brought to her. The eldest of these was only nino
                   yenrs old, and little could they realize that this was the

                   last time they would ever behold her on earth. She

                   did not see them again, and, in her weakened state,

                               On the 29tii of June, 1841, Sir Edwud Pany waa
                           married to Catharine Edwards, daughter of the Rev.
                           K. Hankinaon, Rector of Walpole, Lynn, and widow
                           of Samuel Hoare, Jr., Esq., c^ Hampstead. In this
                           second period of hia married life, he felt, oaoh day,
                           increasing oauae of thankfulness to Him who hod thus
                           permitted him to fill the void which had been left in
                             his heart and home, and to supply, to an extent not
                             often witnessed, the loss which hia children had ex*
                           perienoed in their mother's death.

                              Lpi the oouiae of tho autumn of the same year he
                           was employed, by Sir Robert Peel's government, in
                           drawing up a report on the state of the C iledonian

In April, 1843, Sir Edward let his house in London,

benefit of hia health, which for some mcmtha had been

aerioualy impaired. The additional distance from his

            Another no less striking example of the importance
         he attached to the efficacy of prayer will be found in

                  mooting the cause which had induced him to make an
                  application for retirement," offered to his acceptance
               the post of Oaptain-Superintendent of the Royal
                Olarenoe Yard, and of the Navd Hospital at Haslar.

              It is almost needless to say that the ofier, made in so

                  handsome a manner, yraa gratefUlly accepted. Ho
                felt that the position was one in every way congenial
                  to his tastes, as bringing him, once more, into imme-
                diate connection with members of his own profession ;
                and, on the 2d of December, he received his official
                  appointment to Haslar.

                   On the same day, all the officers of the establish*
                  ment were, according to the usual custom, separately
                  iiitroduced to him by his predecessor, Oaptun Garten
                Among the number of these were Sir John Blohard^
                son, the friend and companion of Fnmklixi, in his
                perilous e2^)editions along die northern shores of the
                continent of America, with whom Sir Edward was
                  well pleased to renew his acquaintance under oin^im:
                  stances which necessarily brought them into daily in-
                tercourse. Of this first interview one of the <Mflloeis
                speaks In Ibllows:

                 **I had never seen )^ Edward Ftoiy befiwe, and was

M'   In his almost daily visitB to the aiok wards, Sir

     Edward never allowed an opportunity to pass of
     dropping a word of spiritual oomfi^rt to the sufforera.

     WheT> any pati«nc asked to see him, he continued his

     visits daily, until the man died or was disoharged from

     the HDspital, and many an hour, during hin five yearn

     at Haiear^ did he thus spend reading by the bedside of

     a siok or dying seaman. On one oooaaion, a man, who

     had been prevented by the weather ftom attending the

     Sunday even'ag leotuie^ had hrard such a report of it

     fixnoA a friend that he ventured to forward a request,

Upon the return of Sir James Boss from the Arotio

regions in 1849, and the report of his &ilare to discover
any traoes of Franklin, Sir Edward was continually

summoned to London, to consult with the Admiralty

as to the best mode of continuing the search fbr the

missing vessels. This was                      subject in which, from

the &te of his friend Franklin, his own feelings were
deeply involved. " have to make my report Unlay,"
he writes to one of his children, *' and trust that

may be led, by better wisdom than my own, to give

sound and judicious advice."

The arrival of Oaptain Austin inEnghind, withtho

relics discovered by Captain Ommaaey at Gape Biley,it
was to him, an object of peotdiar interest, and was

his own and Sir John Bichaidaon's eareflil reports on

the subject, which ultimately settled the question of

their connection vrith the long-lost "Erebus" and

"^Terror." It may well be conceived with what eager*

ness he followed the steps of the searching e;q>editioha^
and' the grtfdual advance of gedgraphical knof^ledge in

those regions to which he himself had opened the way.
