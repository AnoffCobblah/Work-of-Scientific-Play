                                         TO THE

       RAJAH RAMMOHUN ROY.

       My dear Rajah,

  I cannot deny myself the pleasure of express

ing, on this page, the gratification your voyage to
England has afforded me, in your personal acquaint

ance. This I had, for some time, been taught to

desire, from the report of friends who had shared

your society in India, and from the knowledge I

had acquired of your valuable writings.

    The purpose of those writings, the principles
they inculcate, and the spirit and energy they
discover, in the promotion of truth and righteous

ness, all serve to assure me that I shall, in the

following pages, present to you an appropriate
offering of respectful attachment. They will
describe, chiefly in his own language, the progress,
from earliest years to maturity, of one who had
eminently listened to the dictate of eastern wis
dom, " Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
with thy might ;" whether he were extending the
boundaries of science, collecting or communicating
the stores of literature, recommending a just and
equitable civil policy, or, especially, cherishing

                                            IV

the faith and hope, or performing the willing ser
vices of a Christian, that " highest style of man,"
as he ever regarded it.

  And now, my dear Rajah, accept my best wishes,
that when you shall hid adieu to your new asso
ciates, by whom you will be long remembered,
you may have a prosperous passage to your native
shores. There, while the social institutions of
India, and the condition of her people, worthy
objects of patriotic anxiety, shall be improving
around you, may years of mental advancement,
and of wise and benevolent activity, be your por
tion. Thus, may your name survive, distinguished
on the fairest page of human history, among those
who, under different dispensations of an all-righ
teous Providence, with greatly varied talents, and
amidst vast disproportions of worldly advantages,
have alike " served their generation according to
the will of God:'

                I remain,

                          My dear Rajah,
                                       Yours sincerely,

                                    J. T. RUTT.

   Newington Green,
         Oct 25, 1831.

                                  PREFACE.

  ISince formed, in 1815, the design of reprinting Dr.

Priestley's Memoirs, (which he left for publication,) as
part of his Theological and Miscellaneous Works, it has

been encouraged by the obliging communication of his

original letters to various correspondents. I also obtained,
by Mr. Belsham's kindness, which I acknowledge in the

Introduction, all the letters he had received from Dr.
Priestley. But I am peculiarly indebted to the friendly
and liberal attentions of Mr. Thomas Gibson for a large
collection of MSS., which had come into his possession
as Mr. Belsham's executor. They consist of Dr. Priest
ley's letters to Mr. Lindsey, during more than thirty

years, and various other originals, forming a highly

interesting correspondence.

   With such valuable assistance, so freely proffered, I

could not hesitate to determine on a more extended

biography than had been first contemplated ; reserving a
small impression for separate publication. Distinguish
ing the Memoirs, so that they may still be read, exactly

as Dr. Priestley left them, I have adopted a division into

Chapters, according to the order of time, frequently illus
trating the Memoirs and Correspondence by passages
from original letters, chiefly those between Dr. Priestley's
contemporaries, and, generally, his intimate friends.*

   · In  "thtehenoMteosn, thWly.  designs the   "  Theological    and Miscellaneous Works,"
M. R.                             Repository,"                  the remarks of Mr. Thomas
                                                   and T. C.

Cooper, in the American edition of the Memoirs.

vi PREFACE.

   It is much to be regretted that I have been able to

procure scarcely any letters from Dr. Priestley's cor

respondents, except a few which have been already

printed. Mr. Joseph Priestley, in his preface to the
Memoirs, mentions " letters addressed to his father by

persons of eminence" in America and Europe. These
he declined to print, for reasons affording little encou

ragement to an application, which, however, I could not
fail to make, on the present occasion. With that gen

tleman's sense of propriety, the only hindrance, I am
Ipersuaded, to a compliance with my request, have not
Ithe least right or desire to interfere, though should

have been gratified, in no small degree, by an occasion to
acknowledge some assistance in the progress and comple
tion of this undertaking, from a quarter so respectable

as the surviving family of Dr. Priestley.

   Should Mr. Priestley allow himself, especially now,
after the lapse of many years, to review his determination
in 1805, he may perhaps yet bring those letters before
the public, under the guidance of his own discretion.

I need not say how honourable to his father's memory

would be such a publication, or how much valuable in
terest he would thus communicate to whatever my best

exertions in the arrangement and illustration of Dr.

Priestley's biography may enable me to accomplish.

                   INTRODUCTION.

  The name of Joseph Priestley cannot be forgotten

or undistinguished, while the scientific history of his
age and country shall be preserved. Nor was he un
known as a writer on various topics of civil policy and
general literature. Yet, as a serious, diligent, and per
severing investigator of moral and religious truth, an
example of active virtue and unobtrusive piety in the
commerce of the world, and a pattern of Christian re
signation under trials of no common character, he will
be chiefly considered in this attempt to describe the
occurrences, employments, and associations, of his life.

   After too long a delay, from unavoidable hindrances,

I now propose, so far as ability for mental exertion may

be continued, to employ, according to my best judg

ment, whatever assistances I have been able to procure.

IThus would endeavour to satisfy the claims of those

friends to the memory of Dr. Priestley, who encouraged
by their subscriptions an edition of his Theological and

IMiscellaneous Works, to which have devoted, during
Ithe last fifteen years, all the leisure could command,

amidst several other literary engagements.
   The readers of those Works will be aware of informa

tion, remarks, or anecdotes, scattered through the Edi
tor's notes and prefaces, which might have been reserved
for the Author's biography, to illustrate his character, or
to describe his personal, social, and controversial history.

I could not, however, allow myself to withhold from the

                                                                 B

g INTRODUCTION.

volumes of Dr. Priestley's Works, while in the press,
whatever elucidations my recollection could supply ; and
it is designed to enrich this volume with the whole of
that interesting portion of his Works, the auto-bio

graphy. His purpose in preparing that memoir is thus

explained in the introductory paragraph :

   (1.) Having thought it right to leave behind me some account

Iof my friends and benefactors, it is in a manner necessary that

also give some account of myself; and as the like has been

done by many persons, and for reasons which posterity has
approved, I make no further apology for following their
Ifexample.
            my writings in general have been useful to my
Icontemporaries, hope that this account of myself will not be

without its use to those who may come after me, and especially

in promoting virtue and piety, which, I hope I may say, it has

been my care to practise myself, as it has been my business to

inculcate them upon others.*

   My justly respected friend, Mr. Belsham, kindly
bequeathed to me, in aid of this design, all the letters
he had received from Dr. Priestley. To that collection

has been added, by very obliging attentions, the letters
to Mr. Lindsey, from their commencement in 1769, to
within a few days of Dr. Priestley's decease, with those

written to other long endeared friends and associates.

Of such valuable additions to the Author's auto-bio

graphy, with a few letters from his correspondents,

I shall in the following pages largely avail myself.

· In Dr. Priestley's letter to Mr. Lindsey, from " Castle-head, Sept. 9,

1787," is the following notice of time and place for this commencement of

                                               (1733-1752.)

   There have been a few, highly distinguished among

 their contemporaries, not only by superior talents, but
 by a wise, solicitous, and successful application of them
 to the moral and intellectual improvement of mankind.

These, whom " the Author of nature has thought fit to
mingle, from time to time, among the societies of men,"*
require not for their just reputation an ancestry " of
gentle blood," or the herald's " help to fame," always,
in the estimation of wisdom, " slender" as " the chis-

selV aid, and now, especially, of a value every day

rapidly decreasing.

  I have not been able to discover that any ancestors of

Joseph Priestley had been eminent in rank or sta
tion ; yet they appear to have occupied respectable con
ditions in middle life. The late Mr. Samuel Parkes,
well known by his valuable publications on chemistry,
was induced, in 1815, from regard to Dr. Priestley's
memory, to visit the neighbourhood of his birth-place.
There, " in the churchyard of Birstal," he found, in
scribed with the name of Priestley, " three handsome
tombs, made entirely of stone." This was " the burial-
place" of Dr. Priestley's immediate family. Mr. Parkes
was farther shewn, in " the old chapelyard" of " Heck-

                                                  * BoUngbrokn.

mondwick," a neighbouring village, " a row of eight
very handsome tombs, built alike, and entirely of stone,
belonging to the Priestley family," all, indications of
some distinction, amidst " the graves with bending osiers
bound." Mr. Parkes was also " informed" by Dr.
Priestley's nephew, who attended him, " that theirs
was one of the largest and most extended families in
Yorkshire."*

    From this scanty information respecting the ancestry

Iof Joseph Priestley, hasten to that portion of his art

less narrative which extends to the period when, by
the diligent use of what literary aids the circumstances
of a very private life could afford, he was well prepared
to improve the advantages of an academical education.

   (2.^ My father, Jonas Priestley.f was the youngest son of
Joseph Priestley, a maker and dresser of woollen cloth.* His
first wife, my mother, was the only child of Joseph Swift, a
farmer at Shafton, a village about six miles south-east of

Wakefield. By this wife he had six children, four sons and
two daughters. I, the oldest, was born on the thirteenth of
March, old style, 1733, at Fieldhead,§ about six miles south
west of Leeds, in Yorkshire. My mother dying in 1739, my
father married again in 1745, and by his second wife had three

daughters.

playing with a pin, she asked me where I got it; and on telling

Iher that found it at my uncle's, who lived very near to my
Ifather, and where had been playing with my cousins, she

made me carry it back again ; no doubt to impress my mind,
as it could not fail to do, with a clear idea of the distinction of
property, and of the importance of attending to it. She died
in the hard winter of 1739,* not long after being delivered of
my youngest brother,f and having dreamed a little before her
death that she was in a delightful place, which she particularly
described, and imagined to be heaven, the last words which
she spake, as my aunt informed me, were, " Let me go to that

fine place."

   The practice of committing a body of divinity to the memory of an

my own experience of a very early parental instruction, which ever proposed,

under the influence of piety and kind affection, the moral, intellectual, and
especially the religious, improvement of a child. Nor, I apprehend, is this

distinguished himself for his zeal for religion and for his public
spirit. He was also a man of considerable property, and dying

soon after I went to them, left the greatest part of his fortune

to my aunt for life, and much of it at her disposal after her

death.*

   (7-) By this truly pious and excellent woman, who knew no
other use of wealth, or of talents of any kind, than to do good,

and who never spared herself for this purpose,f I was sent to

several schools in the neighbourhood, especially to a large free

school^ under the care of a clergyman, Mr. Hague, under
whom, at the age of twelve or thirteen, I first began to make

any progress in the Latin tongue,§ and acquired the elements

of Greek. But about the same time that I began to learn Greek

at this public school, I learned Hebrew on holidays of the
Dissenting minister of the place, Mr. Kirkby and upon the
removal of Mr. Hague from the free-school, Mr. Kirkby open

Ithis instruction, had acquired a pretty good knowledge of

the learned languages at the age of sixteen ; but from this

time, Mr. Kirkby's increasing infirmities* obliged him to re
linquish his school, and beginning to be of a weakly con
sumptive habit,f so that it was not thought advisable to send

me to any other place of education, I was left to conduct my
I Istudies as well as could till went to the academy at Da-

ventry, in the year 1752.

  I(8.) From the time discovered any fondness for books, my
Iaunt entertained hopes of my being a minister, and readily

entered into her views : but my ill health obliged me to turn

my thoughts another way ; and, with a view to trade, I learned

the modern languages, French, Italian, and High Dutch, with

Iout a master ; and in the first and last of them translated

and wrote letters for an uncle of mine, who was a merchant, %

and who intended to put me into a counting-house in Lisbon.

A house was actually engaged to receive me there, and every

thing was nearly ready for my undertaking the voyage ; but

getting better health, my former destination for the ministry

Iwas resumed, and was sent to Daventry, to study under Mr.

Ashworth, afterwards Dr. Ashworth. §
   During this important period, when the diligent

scholar was left to his own literary resources, andi in-

favourite purpose, he had, while completing his eigh

Joseph Hunter, I am enabled here to insert, from a copy

in the writer's autograph, his answer to the letters of

Joseph Priestley. Those are now, probably, irrecover

able, but their subjects maybe easily conjectured from

the remarks of his correspondent.

Mr. Priestley,                     Dec. 31, 1750.
I received both yours; but the benevolence so often ex

pressed for you, as a young scholar of diligent ami pious cha

racter, was not of so much account as you seem to have rated
it at. As to any hints in my power respecting the conduct of

your studies, I should be glad to offer them as I have oppor

tunity; but various of those which would have occurred on

the supposition that you intended some time to wear the

ministerial character, would be impertinent, as I now hear you

intend some other learned profession.*
   This, however, on any scheme of learning, is a proper hint,

that all study is in order to a useful life, and therefore every

degree of it injurious to bodily health will defeat its own end ;

and if it does not wear out the body prematurely, will at least
be a fatal remora to an active life. This I say in reference to
what I have heard of your very laborious application.

   As to literature, properly, or the study of languages, what

occurs to meat present is, that Rabinical skill, which you seem
to have some itch for, will least answer the pains you will be

obliged to employ upon it ; and if it was worth the labour,

yet would much of it be lost, without some sufficient tutor to

lead you first into the idiom of the Hebrew language. The
other learned laanguages, viz. Latin and Greek, you cannot be
too exact in ; and as probably you have had a competency of
school helps, your own application will furnish the means of

a ready accuracy and critical skill in both of them. But that
labour will be shortened, and made much more effectual, if

you compare the classics in both languages, with translations

of reputation. No one means of assisting youth, and short-

ening the drudgery of that sort, so useful, yet so neglected.

Tacitus is a fine Latin historian : if you could procure Gor

don's translation, you would read him to much advantage, and

by that single book become acquainted with the phraseology

and diction, in a good measure, of other histories of note which

you will have inclination to consult. Dunster's Horace would
Ibe of like good use respecting poetic language.
                                                  proceed no
Ifurther in this, because this hint will lead you on to all

intend by it.

   Joseph Priestley would be easily inclined, on this
recommendation, to " procure Gordon's Tacitus," a
translation which had been very lately executed. What
ever assistance he might thence derive for ascertaing the
sense and spirit of the Roman historian, the liberal sen

timents avowed in the " Political Discourses," annexed

by the translator, could scarcely fail to engage his atten

tion. It may, perhaps, be not unfairly conjectured, that

the young student thus instructed, would be easily en
couraged to entertain those just and enlightened views

of civil policy which he first disclosed in his " Essay
on Government." I return to his narrative :

  I(9.) Looking back, as often do, upon this period of my life,
I see the greatest reason to be thankful to God for the pious

care of my parents and friends, in giving me religious instruc
tion. My mother was a woman of exemplary piety, and my
father also had a strong sense of religion, praying with his
family morning and evening, and carefully teaching his chil
dren and servants the Assembly's Catechism, which was all

the system of which he had any knowledge. In the latter part
of his life he became very fond of Mr. Whitfield's writings,
and other works of a similar kind, having been brought up in
the principles of Calvinism, and adopting them, but without
ever giving much attention to matters of speculation, and
entertaining no bigoted aversion to those who differed from

him on the subject.

    (10.) The same was the case with my excellent aunt; she was

truly Calvinistic in principle, but was far from confining salva

tion to those who thought as she did on religious subjects.

Being left in good circumstances, her home was the resort of

all the Dissenting ministers in the neighbourhood, without dis

tinction ; and those who were the most obnoxious on account

of their heresy, were almost as welcome to her, if she thought

them honest and good men, (which she was not unwilling to

do,) as any others.

   (11.) The most heretical ministers in the neighbourhood,

were Mr. Graham, of Halifax ;* and Mr. Walker of Leeds ;f

but they were frequently my aunt's guests. With the former

of these my intimacy grew with my years, but chiefly after I

became a preacher. We kept up a correspondence to the last,
Ithinking alike on most subjects. To him
                                                                dedicated my
" Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit ;"J and when he died,§

he left me his manuscripts, his Polyglot Bible, and two hun

dred pounds. Besides being a rational Christian, he was an

excellent classical scholar, and wrote Latin with great facility

and elegance. He frequently wrote to me in that language.

  (12.) Thus I was brought up with sentiments of piety, but

without bigotry ; and having, from my earliest years, given

Imuch attention to the subject of religion, was as much con

firmed as I well could be in the principles of Calvinism,|| all

the books that came in my way having that tendency.

· Tims represented, in 1/71, by Rev. Dan Taylor, a General Baptist, who

"then resided in his neighbourhood :

      Mr. Graham preached before the dissenting clergy at Leeds, a discourse
published under the title of ' Repentance the only Condition of Final Accept

  I(13.) The weakness of my constitution, which often led me

to think that should not be long-lived, contributed to give

my mind a still more serious turn ; and having read many

books of experiences, and, in consequence, believing that a new

birth, produced by the immediate agency of the spirit of God,

was necessary to salvation, and not being able to satisfy myself

I Ithat had experienced any thing of the kind, felt occasion

ally such distress of mind as it is not in my power to describe,

Iand which still look back upon with horror. Notwithstand
ing I had nothing very material to reproach myself with, I

often concluded that God had forsaken me, and that mine was

like the case of Francis Spira,* to whom, as he imagined,
             and salvation were denied. In that state of mind I
repentance   reading the account of " the man in an iron cage,"
remember
in the " Pilgrim's Progress,"f with the greatest perturbation.
   I(14.) imagine that even these conflicts of mind were not

without their use, as they led me to think habitually of God

and a future state. And though my feelings were, then, no

doubt, too full of terror, what remained of them was a deep

reverence for divine things, and in time a pleasing satisfaction

I Iwhich can never be effaced, and, hope, was strengthened as

have advanced in life, and acquired more rational notions of

religion. The remembrance, however, of what I sometimes

felt in that state of ignorance and darkness, gives me a peculiar

sense of the value of rational principles of religion, and of which

I can give but an imperfect description to others.

   (15.) As truth, we cannot doubt, must have an advantage

over error, we may conclude that the want of these peculiar

Calvinism." W. XVIII. 37.

feelings is compensated by something of greater value, which

arises to others from always having seen things in a just and

pleasing light; from having always considered the Supreme
Being as the kind parent of all his offspring. This, however,

Inot having been my case, cannot be so good a judge of the

effects of it. At all events, we ought always to inculcate just
views of things, assuring ourselves that proper feelings and
right conduct will be the consequence of them.

   (17.) In the same interval I spent the latter part of every
week with Mr. Thomas, a Baptist minister, now* of Bristol,

but then of Gildersome, a village about four miles from Leeds,

who had had no learned education. Him I instructed in

Hebrew, and by that means made myself a considerable profi

going to the academy later than is usual, and being thereby

being what is called a Baxterian ;* and his general conversa

tion had a liberal turn, and such as tended to undermine my

prejudices. But what contributed to open my eyes still more,
was the conversation of a Mr. Walker, from Ashton-under-
Line, who preached as a candidate when our old minister was
superannuated. He was an avowed Baxterian, and being re

jected on that account, his opinions were much canvased, and

he being a guest at the house of my aunt, we soon became very

Iintimate, and I thought saw much of reason in his sentiments.
IThinking farther on these subjects, I was, before went to the

academy, an Arminian; but had by no means rejected the
doctrine of the Trinity, or that of Atonement.

   I I(19.) Though, after saw reason to change my opinions,

found myself incommoded by the rigour of the congregation

and Arminius. --The compromising doctrine of Baxter may be seen in his

    * Mr. Belsham, in his Sermon on the death of Dr. Priestley, did ample
justice to this acknowledgment. He was soon called forth, in reply to the
animadversions of a learned Calvinist, to shew how well such an acknowledg
ment might consist, with his friend's and his own opinion, that the creed of

the Geneva reformer, as to the lapsed state, the partial recovery, and the
final condition of mankind, was ill supported by the concurrent testimony of
the Scriptures, on the designed end of the Divine dispensations. Thus Dr.

Priestley and his friend, (and they were by no means singular,) who could

well distinguish between Calvinism and Calvinists, from no scanty experience
of both, pursued the poet's excellent counsel,

                        Be just to all, be candid where you can,
                        But vindicate the ways of God to man.

which there was not some meeting of one or other part of the

congregation. On one evening there was a meeting of the

young men for conversation and prayer. This I constantly

attended, praying extempore with others, when called upon.

   (20.) At my aunt's there was a monthly meeting of women,

who acquitted themselves in prayer as well as any of the men

belonging to the congregation. Being at first a child in the

family, I was permitted to attend their meetings, and growing
up insensibly, heard them, after I was capable of judging. My

aunt, after the death of her husband,* prayed every morning

18 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

I I(22.) It was my custom at that time to recollect as much as
could of the sermons                          heard, and to commit it to writing.
This practice I began very early, and continued it until I was

able from the heads of a discourse to supply the rest myself.

For, not troubling myself to commit to memory much of the

Iamplification, and writing at home almost as much as had
Iheard, insensibly acquired a habit of composing with great
Ireadiness; and from this practice believe I have derived great

advantage through life; composition seldom employing so

much time as would be necessary to write in long hand any

Ithing have published.*

   (23.) By these means, not being disgusted with these strict
forms of religion, as many persons of better health and spirits

Author had higher desires than that of building up to himself a fame on

tuneful periods or sparkling fantasies. He felt so intensely the infinite value

of truth, that he thought not of those ornaments by which, to minds of a

different constitution, she might be rendered alluring. The great charms of
his writings/next to the force of their arguments, are the intense earnestness

with which every important doctrine is urged, and every lesson of wisdom

impressed on the reader, and the plain-heartedness and unaffected feeling

which glow even through his most profound and abstracted reasonings."

                                                   (1752-- 1755.)

   Dr. Calamy, in his Continuation of Baxter, and,

after him, Dr. Toulmin, in his "Historical View, from
the Revolution to the Accession of Queen Anne," have

related how the Nonconformists endeavoured to provide
for a continuance of that academical education of which

the rigorous Act of Uniformity, in 1662^ had deprived
them. They might, indeed, have temporized, anticipating
the apologies of a Powell or a Paley ; but they could not
resolve to make shipwreck of consistency; or, in the
expressive words of Milton, to " subscribe slave.'* Dr.
Toulmin has thus recorded the vexations inflicted on their

conscientious integrity :
    Seminaries, which, but for a malignant policy, would never

have existed, were opened in various parts of the kingdom.
These were viewed with fear and jealousy; yet recourse was
not had to remedial measures of a mild and liberal nature.
Several aspersions were cast on those who taught university
learning ; the calm retreat of the student was haunted by the
spectre of intolerance ; and harassing processes in the spiritual
court were commenced against those who presided over theolo
 gical seminaries.*

   The latest attempt of which I am aware, and probably

the last to be endured in England, thus to harass a Non-

   conformist instructor, occurred in 1732, in the case of
   Doddridge, who was cited into " the Spiritual Court"
   for having presided, however respectably, over his semi
   nary at Northampton, without the licence of Episcopal
   authority. But Doddridge was an able, zealous, and
   influential partizan of a new and not yet universally ac
   knowledged dynasty. The " prerogative royal" promptly
   interfered ; and " the judges," seldom uncourtly, imme
   diately " ordered a prohibition to be issued."* Thus,
   when Joseph Priestley, now at the age of nineteen, had
   determined to pursue an academical education for the
   Christian ministry, he was free to choose a tutor among
   the Nonconformists ; and he proceeds to describe the

   difficulties he encountered in effecting his purpose, which
   interfered, on a question of no small importance, with
   the kindly-intended resolutions of his family:

however, would probably have been to no purpose, and I must
have adopted some other mode of life, if Mr. Kirkby (above-

mentioned)* had not interposed, and strongly recommended

Ithe academy of Dr. Doddridge, on the idea that should have

a better chance of being made a scholar. He had received a

good education himself, was a good classical scholar, and had
no opinion of the mode of education among the very orthodox
Dissenters, and being fond of me, he was desirous of my having

every advantage that could be procured for me. My good

aunt, not being a bigoted Calvinist, entered into his views, and

IDr. Doddridge being dead,f was sent to Daventry, and was

the first pupil that entered there.J My step-mother also, who
was a woman of good sense, as well as of religion, had a high
opinion of Dr. Doddridge, having been some time house-keeper

in his family. She had always recommended his academy,

pursuits, and free from the cares and anxieties which seldom
fail to lay hold on them when they come out into the world.

   (27.) In my time, the academy was in a state peculiarly
favourable to the serious pursuit of truth, as the students were
about equally divided upon every question of much importance,
such as liberty and necessity, the sleep of the soul,* and all
the articles of theological orthodoxy and he"resy; in conse
quence of which, all these topics were the subject of continual
discussion. Our tutors also were of different opinions; Dr.
Ashworth taking the orthodox side of every question, and Mr.
Clark,f the sub-tutor, that of heresy, though always with the

greatest modesty.

   (28.) Both of our tutors being young, at least as tutors, and
some of the senior students excelling more than they could
pretend to do in several branches of study, they indulged us in
the greatest freedoms, so that our lectures had often the air of
friendly conversations on the subjects to which they related.
We were permitted to ask whatever questions, and to make
whatever remarks we pleased ; and we did it with the greatest,
but without any offensive, freedom.J The general plan of our
studies, which may be seen in Dr. Doddridge's published lec-

tures,§ was exceedingly favourable to free inquiry, as we were

referred to authors on both sides of every question, and were

even required to give an account of them. It was also ex

pected that we should abridge the most important of them for
our future use. The public library contained all the books to

which we were referred.

   (29.) It was a reference to " Dr. Hartley's Observations on

Man,"* in the course of our Lectures, that first brought me

acquainted with that performance, which immediately en

gaged my closest attention, and produced the greatest, and in

my opinion the most favourable effect on my general turn of

thinking through life. It established me in the belief of the
doctrine of Necessity, which I first learned from Collins;f it
greatly improved that disposition to piety which I brought to

the academy, and freed it from the rigour with which it had

been tinctured. Indeed, I do not know whether the consider

 ation of Dr. Hartley's theory contributes more to enlighten

 the mind, or improve the heart ; it affects both in so super-

 eminent a degree.

   I(30.) In this situation, saw reason to embrace what is

his " late friend the Rev. Samuel Merivale, theological tutor at Exeter."

the academy, was to read every day ten folio pages in some
Greek author, and generally a Greek play in the course of the
week besides. By this means we became very well acquainted
with that language, and with the most valuable authors in it.

This exercise we continued long after we left the academy,
communicating to each other by letter an account of what we
read. My life becoming more occupied than his, he continued

Ihis application to Greek longer than did, so that before his
Ideath he was, imagine, one of the best Greek scholars in

this or any other country. My attention was always more

drawn to mathematical and philosophical studies than his was.

   (33.) These voluntary engagements were the more necessary
in the course of our academical studies, as there was then no

provision made for teaching the learned languages. We had
even no compositions or orations in Latin. Our course of lec
tures was also defective in containing no lectures on the Scrip

tures, or on ecclesiastical history, and by the students in gene

ral (and Mr. Alexander and myself were no exceptions) com

mentators in general and ecclesiastical history also were held

in contempt. On leaving the academy, he went to study under
his uncle, Dr. Benson,* and with him learned to value the

critical study of the Scriptures so much, that at length he

almost confined his attention to them.f

Iand which still attends me. Sometimes absolutely stam

mered,* and my anxiety about it was the cause of much dis

tress to me. However,' like St. Paul's " thorn in the flesh,"

I hope it has not been without its use. Without some such
Icheck as this, might have been disputatious in company, or

might have been seduced by the love of popular applause as a
preacher ; whereas my conversation and my delivery in the
pulpit having nothing in them that was generally striking,

II hope have been more attentive to qualifications of a supe

rior kind.

  I(37.) It is not, believe, usual for young persons in Dissent

ing academies to think much of their future situations in life.
Indeed, we are happily precluded from that, by the impos
sibility of succeeding in any application for particular places.
We often, indeed, amused ourselves with the idea of our
dispersion in all parts of the kingdom, after living so happily
together; and used to propose plans of meeting at certain
times, and smile at the different appearance we should pro
bably make after being ten or twenty years settled in the
world. But nothing of this kind was ever seriously resolved

Iupon by us. For my own part, 1 can truly say had very

little ambition, except to distinguish myself by my application

Ito the studies proper to my profession ; and cheerfully lis

tened to the first proposal that my tutor made to me, in con
sequence of an application made to him to provide a minister
for the people of Needham Market, in Suffolk, though it was
very remote from my friends in Yorkshire, and a very in
considerable place.

  · To this " impediment" Dr. Priestley refers in " Lectures on Oratory
and Criticism" (xxxv) W. XXIII. 480.

                    CHAPTER III.

                                              (1755-I7C1.)

  I had expected that the obliging inquiries of inti

mate friends in the vicinity of Needham Market would
have enabled me here to connect the Memoir of Joseph
Priestley with some further notices of his residence
in that place. Yet, though the venerable chapel
remains, apparently, as in the days of his ministry,
a lapse of more than seventy years has obliterated all
traces of the youthful preacher's habits and intercourse,
except what he has himself unaffectedly recorded, and

Ia few passages which shall presently quote, in the just

defence and illustration of his character. I now resume

his Memoir.

  I(38.) When went to preach at Needham as a candidate, I

found a small congregation, about an hundred people, under a

Mr. Meadows, who was superannuated. They had been with
out a minister, the preceding year, on account of the smallness
of the salary; but there being some respectable and agreeable

Ifamilies among them, flattered myself that I should be useful

and happy in the place, and therefore accepted the unanimous
invitation to be assistant to Mr. Meadows, with a view to
succeed him when he died. He was a man of some fortune.

   (39-) This congregation had been used to receive assistance

from both the Presbyterian and Independent funds; but upon

my telling them that I did not choose to have any thing to do

with the Independents, and asking them whether they were
able to make up the salary they promised me, (which was

forty pounds per annum,) without any aid from the latter fund,
Ithey assured me they could.
                                    soon, however, found that they
Ideceived themselves ; for the most that ever received from

them was in the proportion of about thirty pounds per annum,

when the expense of my board exceeded twenty pounds.*

   (40.) Notwithstanding this, every thing else for the first

half year appeared very promising, and I was happy in the

success of my schemes for promoting the interest of religion in
Ithe place.
             catechised the children, though there were not
many, using Dr. Watt's Catechism ;f and I opened my lectures
on the theory of religion from the " Institutes," which I had

composed at the academy, admitting all persons to attend them,

without distinction of sex or age; but in this I soon found that
I had acted imprudently. A minister in that neighbourhood

had been obliged to leave his place on account of Arianism ;

and though nothing had been said to me on the subject, and

from the people so readily consenting to give up the Indepen

dent fund, I thought they could not have much bigotry among

Ithem, I found that when came to treat of the Unity of God,

merely as an article of religion, several of my audience were

attentive to nothing but the soundness of my faith in the doc

trine of the Trinity.

  I(41.) Also, though had made it a rule to myself to intro

duce nothing that could lead to controversy into the pulpit ;J

yet making no secret of my real opinions in conversation, it

was soon found that I was an Arian.§ From the time of this

1783 settled at Stow Market, only three miles from Needham Market, where

the late Dr. Priestley had been settled as minister in the early part of his

life, I frequently attempted to gain information respecting so distinguished
a character, though with but little success. I however recollect Mr. Spink,

a gentleman of my congregation, informing me that he attended upon Mr.

Priestley's ministry, and though very young himself, he well remembered

that the freedom with which he delivered his opinions occasioned a general

dissatisfaction ; but his opponents could not but commend him, for the easy

access all persons had who came to controvert them, and the calm patience

"with which he heard them.

      Also, being on a visit to the Rev. Mr. Toms, of Hadleigh, (who died
Jan. 2, 1801, aged 91,) a most patriarchal and venerable minister of the

gospel, himself a moderate Calvinist, at the time when Dr. Priestley's
' History of the Corruptions of Christianity* came out in 1782, 1 expressed

my disapprobation of that work in pretty strong terms. The old gentleman
replied --' My young friend, Dr. Priestley's sentiments are not mine. I
hope they will never be yours ; and I am sorry they are his ; but from my
acquaintance with him when at Needham Market, I shall

Mr. Tailor, while the Dissenting minister of that place, introduced Dr.
Priestley to Needham Market. Mr. N. often heard Mr. T. predict the future

eminence of his friend, not merely from his great application, but from

the most undeviating adherence to plan in every thing he did. So exact

was he in the division of his time, that he accustomed himself to study with

a watch on the table ; and however interesting the subject engaged in might

be, he never suffered one branch of literature to encroach upon the period

allotted for another.--"  I       remain,  d"eaErLISAirS,  yours,

it to me any more.

X As to their elder minister, on Mr. T. Scott's (see 57) ordination at

Ito others, and thinking that when was settled in the world,
I ought to be no longer burthensome to her. Together with

me, she had brought up a niece, who was almost her only

companion, and being deformed, could not have subsisted

without the greatest part, at least, of all she had to bequeath.
In consequence of these circumstances, though my aunt had

always assured me that, if I chose to be a minister, she would
Ileave me independent of the profession, was satisfied she was

not able to perform her promise, and freely consented to her

leaving all she had to my cousin ; I had only a silver tankard

as a token of her remembrance. She had spared no expense
in my education, and that was doing more for me than giving

me an estate.*

   (44.) But what contributed greatly to my distress, was the

fimpediment in my speech, which had increased so much, as

to make preaching very painful, and took from me all chance

of recommending myself to any better place. In this state,

hearing of the proposal of one Mr. Angier, to cure all defects
Iof speech,
                prevailed upon my aunt to enable me to pay

his price, which was twenty guineas ; and this was the first

occasion of my visiting London. Accordingly, I attended him
about a month, taking an oath not to reveal his method, and I

received some temporary benefit ; but soon relapsed again, and

spoke worse than ever. When I went to London, it was in

company with Mr. SmithsonJ who was settled at Harleston,
in Norfolk.§ By him I was introduced to Dr. Kippis, and

· " He knew how to bear poverty without murmuring, and disappoint

ment without fretfulness. He justified the will of his aunt, which deprived

him of expectations which she had excited." M. R. XVII. 169. Such are

  I(45.) At Needham felt the effect of a low despised situa

tion, together with that arising from the want of popular

talents.J There were several vacancies in congregations in
that neighbourhood, where my sentiments would have been no

objection to me, but I was never thought of. Even my next

neighbour, whose sentiments were as free as my own, and
known to be so, declined making exchanges with me, which,

when I left that part of the country, he acknowledged was not

owing to any dislike his people had to me as heretical, but for

other reasons, the more genteel part of his hearers always ab

senting themselves when they heard I was to preach for him.
But visiting that country some years afterwards, when I had

raised myself to some degree of notice in the world, and being

invited to preach in that very pulpit, the same people crowded

to hear me, though my elocution was not much improved, and

they professed to admire one of the same discourses they had

fonnerly despised.

  (46.) Notwithstanding these unfavourable circumstances, I
was far from being unhappy at Needham. I was boarded in
a family from which I received much satisfaction ; I firmly

believed that a wise Providence was disposing every thing for

the best, and I applied with great assiduity to my studies,

which were classical, mathematical, and theological. These
required but few books. As to experimental philosophy, I had

always cultivated an acquaintance with it,§ but I had not the

means of prosecuting it.                         Ireading,     was pretty

noblest instances of liberality of sentiment,* and the truest

generosity, among them.

   {48.) My studies, however, were chiefly theological. Having

fIleft the academy, as have observed, with a qualified belief

of the doctrine of atonement, such as is found in Mr. Tomkin's

book, entitled " Jesus Christ the Mediator,"J I was desirous

of getting some more definite ideas on the subject, and with

  " When he began to learn astronomy, he used to be frequently in the

"that time very little known.

Ser*m". This is certainly no part of their character as a sect. Thomas Letchworth,
one of the most acute and ingenious of their preachers, who, from the
writings of Dr. Priestley, had become a firm convert to his Unitarian opi

nions, informed me, that the expression of those opinions would be attended

with certain expulsion from the society. Very lately, Hannah Barnard, a

female Friend, who went from America to England, was prohibited from

preaching  by the society, on        "acAcoNuanrtratoivf eheorf  Unitarian doctrines." T. C.

such general considerations as occurred to me while I was thus

In consequence of this, I was urged by them to publish the

greater part of what I had written. But being then about to

leave Needham, I desired them to do whatever they thought

38 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

Iwhich I gave to the writings of this apostle at the time that

examined them, in order to collect passages relating to the

doctrine of atonement, satisfied me that his reasoning was in

many places far from being conclusive ; and in a separate work

I examined every passage in which his reasoning appeared to
me to be defective, or his conclusions ill supported, and I

Ithought them to be pretty numerous.

   (51.) At that time had not read any commentary on the
Scriptures, except that of Mr. Henry, when I was young.

However, seeing so much reason to be dissatisfied with the

Apostle Paul as a reasoner, I read " Dr. Taylor's Paraphrase

on the Romans ;"* but it gave me no sort of satisfaction ; and

his general " Key to the Apostolic Writings," still less. I

therefore at that time wrote some remarks on which were
long time afterf published in the " Theological Repository."

thing that was of much consequence in the other^ in order to
its being submitted to the examination of learned Christians.

ture of W. W. But I cannot say that his remarks gave me

much satisfaction.lf

  I(54.) When was at Needham, I likewise drew up a treatise

on the doctrine of divine injiuem e, having collected a number
of texts for that purpose, and arranged them under proper

Iheads, as had done those relating to the doctrine of atone
ment. But I published nothing relating to it until I made use

of some of the observations in my sermon on that subject,

  (55.) While I was in this retired situation, I had, in conse

quence of much pains and thought, become persuaded of the
falsity of the doctrine of atonement, of the inspiration of the
authors of the books of Scripture as writers, and of all idea of
supernatural influence, except for the purpose of miracles.

But I was still an Arian, having never turned my attention to

the Socinian doctrine, and contenting myself with seeing the
absurdity of the Trinitarian system.

   (5G.) Another task that I imposed on myself, and in part

executed at Needham, was an accurate comparison of the
Hebrew text of the hagiographa, and the prophets with the
version of the Septuagint, noting all the variations, &c This

II had about half finished before left that place ; and I never

resumed it, except to do that occasionally for particular pas

sages, which I then began, though with many disadvantages,
with a design to go through the whole. I had no polyglot

Bible.f and could have little help from the labours of others.
   (57.) The most learned of my acquaintance in this situation

was Mr. Scott, of Ipswich, + who was well versed in the
Oriental languages, especially the Arabic But though he was
far from being Calvinistical, he gave me no encouragement in

the very free inquiries which I then entered upon. Being ex

cluded from all communication with the more orthodox minis

ters in that part of the country, all my acquaintance among
the Dissenting ministers, besides Mr. Scott, were Mr. Tailor,
of Stowmarket ; § Mr. Dickinson, of Diss ; and Mr. Smithson,
of Harleston : and it is rather remarkable that we all left that

country in the course of the same year ; Mr. Tailor removing

with Mr. Chauvet, the rector of Stowmarket. He was de

Iscended of French parents ; and, think, was not born in

England. Whilst he lived, we were never long without seeing

each other. But he was subject to great unevenness of spirits,

sometimes the most cheerful man living, and at other times

most deplorably low. In one of these fits he at length put an
Iend to his life.
                   heard afterwards, that he had at one time

been confined for insanity, and had even made the same

attempt some time before.

  (59.) Like most other young men of a liberal education, I

had conceived a great aversion to the business of a school

Imaster, and had often said that would have recourse to any

thing else for a maintenance in preference to it. But having

Ino other resource, was at length compelled by necessity to
Imake some attempt in that way; and for this purpose printed
Iand distributed proposals, but without any effect. Not that

was thought to be unqualified for this employment, but because

were no objection to me there, I was not approved. But Mr.

ployment in my own school rooms, I went to teach in the

family of Mr. Tomkinson, an eminent attorney, and a man of
large fortune, whose recommendation was of the greatest ser

vice to me ; and here I continued until seven in the evening.

I had, therefore, but little leisure for reading, or for improving

myself in any way, except what necessarily arose from my em

ployment.

  (64.) Being engaged in the business of a school-master, I
made it my study to regulate it in the best manner, and I
think I may say with truth, that in no school was more busi

ness done, or with more satisfaction, either to the master or the

scholars, than in this of mine. Many 6f my scholars are pro

bably living, and I am confident that they will say that this is

no vain boast,
I(65.) At Needham
                   was barely able, with the greatest
Ieconomy, to keep out of debt, (though this always made a

point of doing at all events,) but at Nantwich my school soon

enabled me to purchase a few books, and some philosophical

instruments, as a small air-pump, an electrical machine, &c

These I taught my scholars in the highest class to keep in

order, and make use of ; and by entertaining their parents and

friends with experiments, in which the scholars were generally

the operators, and sometimes the lecturers too, I considerably
extended the reputation of my school ; though I had no other
object originally than gratifying my own taste. I had no

leisure, however, to make any original experiments until many

years after this time.*                                   (which

   (66.) As there were few children in the congregation,
did not consist of more than sixty persons, and a great

tion of them travelling Scotchmen,) there was no scope for

exertion with respect to my duty as a minister. I therefore
contented myself with giving the people what assistance I

could at their own houses, where there were young persons ;

and I added very few sermons to those which I had composed
at Needham, where I never failed to make at least one every

week.

sensible man, and at the same time the person of the greatest

Iproperty in the congregation, and who was fond of music,

was induced to learn to play a little on the English flute, as

the easiest instrument ; and though I was never a proficient in

it,

years of my life.f                        would recommend the knowledge and

practice of music to all studious persons and will be better

for them, like myself, they should have no very fine ear, or

exquisite taste; as by this means they will be more easily

pleased, and be less apt to be offended when the performances

they hear are but indifferent.

§  Who died in 1794, aged 65.
In the preface to his translation of Abaazit's Miscellanies,
                                                                                                            774, Dr. Har-

wood, referring to the second of his Dissertations, in which he had main

tain"ed     the  Arian doctrine,           says,   Dr.  Priestley,         would        answer              and shew
       II  wish   my ingenious            friend,

under obligations to serve any party, and that am rigidly attached to nothing

but truth."

   During the succeeding ten years, the inquiries of Dr. Harwood bad brought
him nearer to Dr. Priestley. In letter to Mr. William Christie, of Mon

tro"se,    afterwards of America, in               1784, he thus           writes:
           am inclined to think that                Socinianism,           when
                                                                                   the   diction            and  phrase

ology of the New Testament are better understood, will be found to be the

doctrine of scripture.  I                 have written     in         favour of Arianism these twenty

at Congleton, preaching alternately at Leek and Wheelock, the
latter place about ten miles from Nantwich. Being both of us

schoolmasters, and having in some respect the same pursuits,

we made exchanges for the sake of spending a Sunday evening
together every six weeks in the summer time. He was a good

classical scholar, and a very entertaining companion.

   (70.) In my congregation there was (out of the house in

I Iwhich was boarded) hardly more than one family in which

could spend a leisure hour with much satisfaction, and that

was Mr. James Caldwall's, a Scotchman. Indeed several of

the travelling Scotchmen who frequented the place, but made
no long stay at any time, were men of very good sense ; and,

Iwhat thought extraordinary, not one of them was at all Cal-

vinistical.

(71.) My engagements in teaching allowed me but little time
for composing any thing while I was at Nantwich. There,
Ihowever,       recomposed my " Observations on the Character

and Reasoning of the Apostle Paul," as mentioned before.* For

the use of my school, I then wrote an English Grammar,f on a

new plan, leaving out all such technical terms as were bor

rowed from other languages, and had no corresponding modifi

Ications in ours, as the future tense, &c; and to this afterwards

a schoolmaster, for a scanty maintenance, have been all
ingenuously related by himself. He will now appear to
occupy a station which prepared for his talents a more
extended exercise. Hence also he shared the society,
and at length secured the intimate friendship, of men
who have largely contributed to the moral and intellec
tual " glory of their times : leaders of the people by their
counsels ; wise and eloquent in their instructions ; mer
ciful men, whose righteousness hath not been forgotten."
The Memoir thus proceeds :

   (73.) My removal to Warrington was in September, 1761,
after a residence of just three years at Nantwich. In this new

Isituation I continued six years, and in the second year married

a daughter of Mr. Isaac Wilkinson, an ironmaster, near Wrex

ham, in Wales, with whose family I had become acquainted,

in consequence of having the youngest son, William, at my
school at Nantwich. This proved a very suitable and happy
connexion, my wife being a woman of an excellent under
standing, much improved by reading, of great fortitude and
strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affec
 tionate and generous ; feeling strongly for others, and little for

herself.* Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to
household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern of
that kind, which allowed me to give all my time to the prose
cution of my studies, and the other duties of my station. And

though, in consequence of her father becoming impoverished,

I Iand wholly dependent on his children, in the latter part of his

life, had little fortune with her, unexpectedly found a

great resource in her two brothers, who had become wealthy,

especially the elder of them. At Warrington I had a daughter,

Sarah, who was afterwards married to Mr. William Finch, of

Heath Forge, near Dud ley. f

* This felicitous union, amidst greatly varying worldly circumstances,

continued during thirty-four years, Mrs. Priestley dying at Northumberland,
"U. S., Sept. 17, 1796, aged fifty-two. Her son relates that his father,
   noting the  "event in   his diary," writes, nearly in  the language of  his
Memoir, that               of a noble and generous mind,  and cared much   for
                  she was

others, and little for herself, through life." The particulars of the affecting

bereavement, and the Christian consolations which sustained the suffering

survivor, will be described, in the sequel, from Dr. Priestley's letters to Mr.

Lin"dsTehyisanhdapMprys.coBnanrbeaxuiolnd. added greatly to his usefulness as well as his

comfort, for it enabled him to take a number of the young men into his

house as boarders, to their own great advantage, and it secured to him, both

in their parents and in themselves, many valuable friendships, which were
of great importance to him in the subsequent periods of his life. Mrs.

Priestley's engaging manners and highly improving society attracted the

warm attachment of many friends, particularly of Mrs. Barbauld, then Miss

Aikin, whose deep regrets on her leaving Warrington were expressed in one

"of the first and finest productions of her muse." M. R. VIII. 231. See

   The Works of A. L. Barbauld," (1825.) pp. 39, 46.

t Mrs. Finch died in 1803, a few months before her affectionate father.
His exemplary daughter's Christian endurance of adversity will be found

noticed in some of his latest letters to Mr. Lindsey. Of her eldest child,

Anne Finch, who died in 1809, and in whom the juniors of her family lost

a second mother, though she had reached only her twenty-first year, there is

an interesting obituary, which may, I believe, be justly ascribed to the pen
of Mrs. Barbauld. I adorn this page with the conclusion :

" When loveliness, arrayed in opening bloom,              [But

   Framed to delight the sense, the heart to cheer,
   Sinks early blasted to the silent tomb,
   Who can suppress the sigh, restrain the tear ?

and read Lectures on the Theory of Language and Universal Grammar, on

Oratory and Philosophical Criticism, and also on the Civil Law. This is

the principal part of my business. Our terms are two guineas each tutor

                 Dr.  Priestley  added in discoursing   from               his written lectures

of which are since published to the world) was pointedly and clearly illustra

tive of the subject before him, and expressed with great simplicity and

distinctness of language, though he sometimes manifested that difficulty of

utterance which he mentions in the Memoirs of his Life. At the conclu

sion of his lecture he always encouraged the students to express their sen

timents relative to the subjects of

had delivered without reserve.       pleased him when any one commenced

such conversation. In order to excite the freest discussion, he occasion

ally invited the students to drink tea with him, in order to canvas the sub

jects of his lectures.           do not recollect that he ever shewed the least dis

pleasure at the strongest objections that were made to what he delivered

but distinctly remember the smile of approbation with which he usually

received them nor did he fail to point out in very encouraging manner
the ingenuity or force of any remarks that were made, when they merited
these characters. His object, as well as Dr. Aikin's, was to engage the

students to examine and decide for themselves, uninfluenced by the senti
ments of any other person. His written lectures he used to permit each

student to take and read in his own lodgings. Those on Rhetoric he gave
them the liberty of copying, those on History of reading only, as he intended

besides composing courses of " Lectures on the Theory of
Language," and on " Oratory and Criticism,"* on which my
predecessorf had lectured, I introduced lectures on " History
and General Policy,"J on the " Laws and Constitution of En

gland," and on the " History of England."§ This I did in

consequence of observing that, though most of our pupils were

young men designed for situations in'civil and active life, every
article in the plan of their education was adapted to the learned

professions.

   (75.) In    order to recommend such                            Istudies as  introduced, I

composed       an " Essay on a Course                             of Liberal   Education for
Civil and Active Life," with " Syllabuses" of my three new

courses of lectures; and Dr. Brown having just then published

a plan of education, in which he recommended it to be under

taken by the state,|| I added some " Remarks on his Treatise,"

them for publication. From minutes in short-hand, he dictated to each
student, by turns, one of the lectures on History, who copied after him in
long-hand. From this copy the Doctor told me they were printed, with some

and Dr. Priestley endeavoured to instil into the minds of the students an

habitual regard to good morals, and a veneration for the Supreme Being,
and for the Christian Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, the great

purpose and design of which, to instruct and improve mankind in piety and

virtue, they judged to be best promoted by the most thorough, liberal, and

unbiassed inquiry into the evidence of their divine authority, and the true

duced them there, so that afterwards every Saturday the tutors,

all the students, and often strangers, were assembled to hear

English and Latin compositions, and sometimes to hear the
delivery of speeches, and the exhibition of scenes in plays.

It was my province to teach elocution,* and also logic and

IHebrew. The first of these retained ; but after a year or
two I exchanged the two last articles with Dr. Aikin, for the

civil law, and one year I gave a course of lectures in anatomy.

   (78.) With a view to lead the students to a facility in writing

IEnglish, I encouraged them to write in verse. This did not

with any design to make them poets, but to give them a greater

facility in writing prose, and this method I would recommend
to all tutors. I was myself far from having any pretension to
the character of a poet ; but in the early part of my life I was
fa great versifier, and this, I believe, as well as my custom of

writing after preachers, mentioned before,J contributed to the

ease with which I always wrote prose. Mrs. Barbauld§ has

told me that it was the perusal of some verses of mine that

first induced her to write any thing in verse, so that this
country is in some measure indebted to me for one of the

best poets it can boast of. Several of her first poems were

written when she was in my house, on occasions that occurred

while she was there.||                                        I published my

truly say, that gain was never the chief object of any of my

and the rest of my philosophical friends in London ; and my

letters circulated among them all, as also every part of my

have made a considerable volume, and it took up much time ;

but it was of great use with respect to the accuracy of my
experiments, and the perfection of my work.

   (84.) After the publication of my " Chart of Biography,"
Dr. Percival, of Manchester,* then a student at Edinburgh,
procured me the title of Doctor of Laws, from that university ;

and not long after, my new experiments in electricity were
the means of introducing me into the Royal Society, with the
recommendation of Dr. Franklin, Dr. Watson, Mr. Canton, and

Dr. Price.f

singularly happy in the society of my fellow-tutors, + and of
Mr. Seddon, the minister of the place. § We drank tea toge-

Canton and Dr. Franklin, could not satisfy him from my letters, (which

you are pleased to suppose would recommend me to the Society,) that I was

a person properly qualified to be a member, mere personal acquaintance

had been of no moment at all. My recommendation to the University
of Edinburgh was signed by Lord Willoughby. He also wrote to Dr.

Robertson in my favour. A copy of this Dr. Robertson gave my friend Dr.
Percival, who has sent it to Dr. Watson, as it may possibly be of some weight

ther every Saturday, and our conversation was equally instruc

tive and pleasing. I often thought it not a little extraordinary

that four persons, who had no previous knowledge of each

other, should have been brought to unite in conducting such
a scheme as this, and all be zealous Necessarians, as we were.
We were likewise all Arians, and the only subject of much
consequence on which we differed was respecting the doctrine

of Atonement, concerning which Dr. Aikin held some obscure
notions. Accordingly, this was frequently the topic of our
friendly conversations. The only Socinian in the neighbour
hood was Mr. Seddon, of Manchester ;* and we all wondered

at him.f But then we never entered into any particular exa
mination of the subject.

  (86.) Receiving some of the pupils into my own house, I

was by this means led to form some valuable friendships, but
especially with Mr. Samuel Vaughan,J a friendship which has

continued hitherto, has in a manner connected our families,

Iand will, doubt not, continue through life. The two eldest

of his sons were boarded with me.§

   (87.) The tutors having sufficient society among themselves,
we had not much acquaintance out of the academy. Some

Itimes, however, made an excursion to the towns in the
neighbourhood. At Liverpool I was always received by Mr.

Bentley, afterwards partner with Mr. Wedgwood, a man of ex
cellent taste, improved understanding, and a good disposition,*
but an unbeliever in Christianity, which was therefore often
the subject of our conversation. He was then a widower, and
we generally, and contrary to my usual custom, sat up late.

IAt Manchester was always the guest of Mr. Potter, whose

son Thomasf was boarded with me. He was one of the wor

thiest men that ever lived. At Chow bent I was much ac

quainted with Mr. Mort, a man equally distinguished by his

Jcheerfulness and liberality of sentiment.

  I(88.) Of the ministers in the neighbourhood recollect with
Imuch satisfaction the interviews had with Mr. Godwin, of

think myself honoured by the confidence he would place in me, by placing

his sons in my family, and that I know no person whose sons I would take

    (89.) Though all the tutors in my time lived in the most per

and there was no complaint of want of discipline, the academy
did not flourish. There had been an unhappy difference
between Dr. Taylor and the trustees, in consequence of which
all his friends, who were numerous, were our enemies ; and

too many of the subscribers being probably weary of the sub

it, and of justifying their conduct afterwards.

still obliged occasionally to have recourse to the same expe

   The following articles of correspondence may suitably
conclude Dr. Priestley's account of his residence at
Warrington. Thev commence with a letter of the ear-

can discover, his only autograph in the British Museum.

      Rev. Sir,           To Dr. Birch.

                             Warrington, July 11, 1764.

As I am informed that Mr. Mynde, who is engraving a chart

of biography for me, intends to apply to you for a few dates,

Iwhich I desired him to endeavour to procure me, have taken
Ithe liberty to acquaint you how sensible shall be of the favour

of any assistance that you shall give him. My Lord Wil-

loughby, indeed, encouraged me to apply to you if I was at a
loss for any dates, and said, that if I would at the same time

write to him when he was in town, he would second my re

Iquest ; but was unwilling to give you or his Lordship any trou

ble about such an affair. Indeed, except a few modern dates,

which my situation in the country gave me no opportunity of

learning, and which Mr. Mynde will mention to you, I have
got almost every date I chose to make use of, except those of

Oulugbeg or Ulugh Bek, a Tartar prince, and Abu ^Jemain,

an Arabian poet, which, if you could help roe to, I shall be

obliged to you.

But the principal reason of my giving you this trouble is to

beg that you would inspect the chart, or the specimen of  it
which Mr. Mynde will shew you and you approve of the           it,

teach any English Grammar. Making the scholars compose

dialogues, themes, &c, &c, &c, correcting their bad English,

and making occasional remarks, always found of most real

use. Let them write fair copies of the English of many of

their lessons, and omit no opportunity of making them write
in their own language. This you will find pleasant to your

self, and of prodigious service to your pupils. Do not fail to

teach geography along with the classics, for by this means

your pupils will indirectly acquire much real knowledge.

am obliged to you for the notice you were so kind as to

send me, of the honour done me by the Royal Society, and for

your advice about the most eligible method of defraying the

necessary expenses. Inclosed you will find a bill of twenty-
five guineas, at as early a date I can procure for ready money.

Please to deliver the receipt and book of rules to Mr. Johnson,

bookseller, who will wait upon you with this letter, and who
will soon have an opportunity of transmitting them to me.

   I am glad that the specimen of Noah's Bacon was accepta

doing you any service in my power.

   Dear Sir,                              Warrington, January 7, 1767.

The best books for teaching modern geography are New

berry's Geography, and then Salmon's. But Newberry is

sufficient to teach ; Salmon they may read at their leisure, and
an account be taken of it occasionally.

  I find the best method to be, appointing boys a certain num

ber of places to be found in the maps every day, and always

mentioning some circumstance that makes the place memora

ble. That makes them remember             a           and other places are not

                                (1767-1773.)

 Dr. Priestley's Memoirs and Correspondence have

discovered how he was introduced to valuable new ac

quaintances, or cultivated to intimacy his intercourse
with former connexions, during the six years passed at
Warrington. He has also narrated his various occupa
tions in the Academy, the devotion of his leisure to the
investigations of science, and the circumstances under
which he determined to relinquish the engagements of a
tutor, and to resume the duties of the Christian minis

try. Having mentioned his removal from Warrington,
in September, 1767, he thus proceeds:

  (92.) At Leeds I continued six years very happy with a

liberal, friendly, and harmonious congregation, to whom my

services (of which I was not sparing) were very acceptable.*
Here I had no unreasonable prejudices to contend with, so that
I had full scope for every kind of exertion ; and I can truly
Isay that always considered the office of a Christian minister

as the most honourable of any upon earth, and in the studies

fproper to it I always took the greatest pleasure.

  (93.) In this situation I naturally resumed my application to

speculative theology, which had occupied me at Needham;
and which had been interrupted by the business of teaching at
Nantwich and Warrington. By reading with care Dr. Lard-

  Before I lay aside Dr. Lardner's last letter, it will, I trust, be deemed an
excusable digression, if it does not, indeed, promote my design of illustrating

the age of Priestley, to quote a passage which discovers in the writer, just

closing a retired and learnedly laborious life, in his 85th year, a very laudable

anxiety for the  public  bgisooeds, tiamsaitnevoolfve"d      in   the progressing interests of  truth

    After the expression of kind regards for his correspondent's children, who

       been lately bereaved of   a mother's                  care, Dr. Lardner says,

effect ; but I own also that the Confessional has made more noise, and met with
more friends, than I expected. And I believe and hope it has done a great deal

of good, and will do more. The general election, though there have been
some instances of ' base' bribery and corruption, has let us know the tern

more impressed with the idea of its importance.

74 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY,

This controversy led me to print another pamphlet, entitled,

"A View of the Principles and Conduct of the Protestant Dis

senters, with respect to the Civil and Ecclesiastical Constitu

tion of England."* With the encouragement of Dr. Price and

IDr. Kippis, also wrote an " Address to Protestant Dissenters

as such, by a Dissenter,"t but without my name. Several of

these pamphlets having been animadverted upon by an anony

Imous acquaintance,J who thought had laid too much stress
Ion the principles of the Dissenters, wrote a defence of my

conduct in Letters addressed to him.§

 I(98.) The Methodists being very numerous in Leeds, and many

of the lower sort of my own hearers listening to them, wrote
" An Appeal to the Serious and Candid Professors of Christia
nity ,"|| " An Illustration of Certain Passages of Scripture,"H

and republished the Trial of Elwall,** all in the cheapest man

ner possible. Those small tracts had a great effect in esta

blishing my hearers in liberal principles of religion, and in a

short time had a far more extensive influence than I could
fthave imagined.

76 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

I by degrees contrived a convenient apparatus for the purpose,

but of the cheapest kind.

  I I(101.) When began these experiments, knew very little

of chemistry, and had in a manner no idea on the subject

Ibefore attended a course of chemical lectures, delivered in

the academy at Warrington, by Dr. Turner, of Liverpool.*

But I have often thought that upon the whole this circum

Istance was no disadvantage to me ; as in this situation was

led to devise an apparatus, and processes of my own, adapted

Ito my peculiar views. Whereas, if had been previously

accustomed to the usual chemical processes, I should not have

so easily thought of any other ; and without new modes of opera

tion I should hardly have discovered any thing materially new.f

   (102.) My first publication on the subject of air was in

  * " Dr. Turner was a physician at Liverpool : among his friends a professed
Atheist. It was Dr. Turner who wrote the reply to Dr. Priestley's Letters

to a Philosophical Unbeliever, under the feigned name of Hammon. (See
I1 18.) He was in his day a good practical chemist.
                                                                                                               believe it was Dr.

Turner who first invented, or at least brought to tolerable perfection, the art

of copying prints upon glass, by striking off impressions with a coloured

solution of silver, and fixing them on the glass by baking on an iron plate in
a heat sufficient to incorporate the solution with the glass. Some of them

are very neatly performed, producing transparent copies in a bright yellow

upo"nDtrh.e  clear glass.  not  merely a whig,                                            but     a republican.  In a friendly
             Turner was

debating society at Liverpool, about the close of the American war, he

observed, in reply to a speaker who had been descanting on the honour

Great Britain had gained during the reign of his present Majesty, that it was

true we had lost the terrnfirmn of the thirteen colonies in America, but we
ought to be satisfied with having gained in return, by the generalship of Dr.

Herschel, a terra incognita of much greater extent in nubibtu." T. C. Stem.

            This

apparatus, and was the means in some degree of improving it in this impor

tant respect. This plainness of his apparatus rendered his experiments easy

to be repeated, and gave them accuracy. In this respect he was like his

great contemporary, Scheele, whose discoveries were made by means easy to

be procured, and at small expense. The French chemists have adopted a

bestowed upon experimental chemistry. He supplied the laboratory with

many new and useful articles of apparatus, and the improved methods of

ing water with fixed air; which being immediately translated
into French, excited a great degree of attention to the subject,f
and this was much increased by the publication of my first
paper of experiments, in a large article of the " Philosophical

ITransactions," the year following^ for which received the

gold medal of the Society.§ My method of impregnating water
with fixed air, was considered at a meeting of the College of
Physicians, before whom I made the experiments, and by them
it was recommended to the Lords of the Admiralty, (by whom
they had been summoned for the purpose,) as likely to be of
use in the sea scurvy.||

   (103.) The only person in Leeds who gave much attention
to my experiments was Mr. Hey, a surgeon. He was a zealous

Methodist, and wrote answers to some of my theological tracts ;

but we always conversed with the greatest freedom on philoso

phical subjects, without mentioning any thing relating to theo

logy. When I left Leeds, he begged of me the earthen trough

Iin which I had made all my experiments on air while was

there. It was such an one as is there commonly used for

washing linen.

for that purpose, and published the " History of Discoveries
relating to Vision, Light, and Colours."* This work, also, I

believe I executed to general satisfaction, and being an under
taking of great expense, I was under the necessity of publish

encourage me to proceed with a work of so much labour and

expense ;f so that after purchasing a great number of books,

   (106.) I was also instrumental in reviving the use of large

electrical machines, and batteries, in electricity, the generality

of electrical machines being little more than play-things at the

Itime that began my experiments. The first very large elec

trical machine was made by Mr. Nairne, in consequence of a

request made to me by the Grand Duke of Tuscany, to get
him the best machine that we could make in England. This,

and another that he made for Mr. Vaughan,* were constituted
on a plan of my own. But afterwards Mr. Nairne made large

machines on a more simple and improved construction ; and in

Iconsideration of the service which had rendered him, he

made me a present of a pretty large machine of the same kind.

Bewley.t who was acquainted with Mr. Michell, was the
means of opening a correspondence between us, which was

Ithe source of much satisfaction to me as long as he lived.

instantly communicated to him an account of every new expe

riment that I made, and in return was favoured with his re

marks upon them. All that he published of his own were
articles in the "Appendices" to my volumes on air, all of

which are ingenious and valuable. Always publishing in this
manner, he used to call himself my satellite. There was a
vein of pleasant wit and humour in all his correspondence,
which added greatly to the value of it. His letters to me
would have made several volumes, and mine to him still more.

When he found himself dangerously ill, he made a point of

paying me a visit before he died ; and he made a journey from

Norfolk to Birmingham, accompanied by Mrs. Bewley, for
that purpose ; and after spending about a week with me, he

went to his friend, Dr. Burney, and at his house he died.

Iafter heard that Dr. Forster, a person far better qualified for

adorned his life, and the various learning which the diligent application of

youth had acquired, and his manhood had devoted, with persevering indusa

   Mr. Cappe, besides the production of single discourses, which deservedly

attracted public attention, was chiefly distinguished for his able advocacy of
man's uninterrupted consciousness at death, without the intervention of

separate     state, an opinion        which he   deduced from       some very  novel  interpre

Catharine Cappe survived her husband many years, which were eminently

"deivnotfeudll  to pious,  benevolent, and   highly useful pursuits. She was indulged,

of life, July 27, 1821, having just completed her 77th year.

Mrs. Cappe, who kindly favoured me with the free use of Dr. Priestley's

letters to her husband, left for publication a volume of autobiography, which

has been very generally and justly admired. See M. R. XIII. 386, 510;

to which their coolness was a seasonable check.

   (113.) At Leeds began my intercourse with Mr. Lee, of

Lincoln's Inn.* He was a native of the place, and exactly one

week older than myself. At that time he was particularly

connected with the congregation, and, before he was married,

spent his vacations with us. His friendship was a source of

Lord Shelburne, when my prospects wore rather a cloudy

I(114.) When
              visited London, during my residence at

Leeds, commenced my particular friendship for Dr. Price, to
Iwhom had been introduced several years before, by Dr. Ben

son ; our first interview having been at Mr. Brownsword's, at

Newington, where they were members of a small literary

society, in which they read various compositions. At that

time Dr. Benson read a paper which afterwards made a section
in his " Life of Christ." For the most amiable simplicity of
character, equalled only by that of Mr. Lindsey, a truly Chris

tian spirit, disinterested patriotism, and true candour, no man,

in my opinion, ever exceeded Dr. Price. His candour will

appear the more extraordinary, considering his warm attach

ments to the theological sentiments which he embraced in

very early life. I shall ever reflect upon our friendship as a

circumstance highly honourable, as it was a source of peculiar

satisfaction to me.

Igenerally steel. After a few discharges,         perceive a circular

space marked out of about half an inch, or three quarters in

diameter, like a shade, the whole of which is afterwards filled

with coloured rings.

  The first colour is violet or purple. It then changes into all

the intermediate colours, till it becomes red. As this ring

expands, another comes up in its place, and in this manner I

have sometimes procured three or four distinct rings. There

is, however, a considerable variety in them in several respects.

Beyond the coloured rings, the steel shews a fine shade,

not sensibly coloured, which is sometimes near an inch in

diameter. It is very visible after eight or ten explosions. I

generally place the needle perpendicular to the polished sur

face, and the rings are nearly circles. When I make the

needles point obliquely, the circles made by the fusion is

properly and exactly a circle ; but the colours extend in an

oblong form, as if the matter that formed them had been

thrown directly from the point.

  I have made a great number of other observations on these

coloured rings, the account of which would fill several letters.

I shall therefore refer you to my book of minutes, which I

shall bring along with me and read to you.

  I am obliged to Mr. Canton for his letter, and the curious

experiment it contains.*

Rev. Sir,

I very much regret that I missed the pleasure of an inter
view with you at Warrington, for though a stranger to you, I

was in hopes that by the means of our common friend, Mr.

Aikin, I might have engaged your assistance in carrying on a
periodical, or rather an occasional paper, which I shall call

Jthe Theological Repository, of which he shewed you the
plan. I was very happy, however, in being informed that you

approved of the plan, and seemed willing to encourage it.

  Mr. Aikin mentioned to me a piece of Mr. Moyle's,* of which

Iyou have the disposal, which, should think, would make an

exceeding proper article for such a work. You will oblige
me if you will transmit a copy of it to Mr. Johnson, book
seller, in Paternoster Row, London, and I would insert it in
Ithe very first number.
                                       suppose you would draw up some
preamble by way of introduction to it,f and I shall think it a

great recommendation of the work.

Mr. Aikin also tells me that you could procure sufficient

evidence of Dr. Watts's dying in the Socinian sentiments, with

respect to the person of Christ, and that he left a piece con

taining those sentiments, with orders that it should be pub

lished. I think it of importance to the cause of truth, that

such facts should be generally known, as thousands are in

fluenced in their opinions by the authority of such men as Dr.

Watts, and I think the Repository would be a proper place

for such an anecdote.

  P. S. I hope you will allow me to make use of your name

in the Repository ,+ as one with whose concurrence it is under

Itaken, and who will probably be an occasional contributor.

also hope that your worthy colleagues in the academy§ will

not think the work unworthy of their encouragement.||

90 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

Extract of a Letter from Mr. Merivale, of Exeter,
  to Dr. Priestley, at Leeds, relating to the late
  Dr. Watts.*
  "What I mentioned to Mr. Aikin concerning Dr. Watts I

had from Dr. Lardner, who told it me as a thing known to

few, though without enjoining me secresy ; but unless you

had other evidence distinct from what I can furnish, I should

not think it right to have the anecdote appear in print, as both
Dr. Watts's and Dr. Lardner's surviving friends might take it

amiss.

   Having mentioned in the course of my correspondence with
the latter the difficulty of fixing my sentiments with regard to
the person of Christ, though I had formerly thought the doc
trine of his pre-existence sufficiently proved by Dr. Clarke,
Dr. Watts, and others, he replies,

  " I think Dr. Watts never was an Arian (to his honour be
it spoken). When he first wrote of the Trinity, I reckoned

he believed three equal divine persons ;t but in the latter

think it was the result of his own meditations on the Scrip
tures. He was very desirous to promote that opinion, and
wrote a great deal upon the subject. But his papers fell into
good hands,* and they did not think them fit for publication.
I also saw some of them."

   As there seemed some ambiguity in the word Unitarian,

(though I knew very well in how strict a sense the Doctor

generally used it,) and being aware that Dr. Watts, in his later
publications, quite gave up the notion of a threefold Deity,
though he contended earnestly for the pre-existence of Christ's
human soul, originally possessed of powers superangelic,f (on

from his amica collatlo               with Tomkins,   i"n   1722. It     also appeared (W. XIII.

"97t)heasditshceipleospindiuorningof                       Questions     concerning Jesus," that

                                      the life of Christ had not arrived to any firm belief of

his godhead," otherwise, "amongst their many doubts and queries, they

would have asked him this obvious and important one, how couhi he he
God, and his Father be God also, 'and yet not two Gods?" See ibid. V.

Dr. Watts survived the date of his note, in 1729, nearly 20 years, during

had appeared to have given up that point. In answer to which

Dr. Lardner wrote

  " I question whether you have any where in print Dr. Watts's

last thoughts upon the Trinity. They were known to very few.
My nephew Neale, an understanding gentleman, was intimate

with Dr. Watts, and often with the family where he lived. Some

times in an evening, when they were alone, he would talk to his

friends in the family of his new thoughts concerning the per

son of Christ, and their great importance; and that if he should

be able to recommend them to the world, it would be the most

considerable thing that ever he performed. My nephew, there

fore, came to me and told me of and that the family was
greatly concerned to hear him talk so much of the importance

good deal, but they were not fit to be published.* Dr. Watts's

                            papers   were   mutilated and    published in a very imperfect

manner. Some were wholly suppressed ; and it was with difficulty that Dr.

Doddridge could rescue from destruction a certain curious paper respecting

the Trinitarian controversy, published among his posthumous works, entitled,

acquainted with the secret ; and it was but a short time before Dr. Dod

conduct, both with respect to Dr. Watts and himself, to whose charge, in

tended they have, I am almost persuaded, that the most effectual arguments

they have employed for this purpose, have been drawn from the rigour of

our present laws respecting the Papists. They tell the people, that, consci

ous of the weakness of our cause, we dare not give them full liberty to teach

and exercise their religion : knowing that the excellency of it is such, that,

if it were publicly exhibited, it would attract universal admiration ; and that

"what we are not able to silence by argument, we suppress by force.

      Besides, the traces and remains of Popery are so striking in the Book
of Common Prayer, and in the whole of our ecclesiastical establishment, that
the derivation of it from the Popish system cannot be concealed ; and hence

it may not be difficult for an artful Papist to persuade many of the common

people to quit the shadow, and have recourse to the substance ; to abandon
the interests of an apostate child, and adopt that of its ancient and venerable

"parent."
   Hence it is  proposed,                                  not to render evil for evil to our old mother
church ;" but,  '' instead                              of using more rigour with the Papists, to allow

them a full toleration ;" in                            which    stphueobwsateiutrutshteoorfinwgoou"vledtrhnesmcaeCrnchteu. lrychFfaoilroft"oEtcnhogemlappnreder,

than sufficient to prevent any from being made." See W. XXII. 64 -- 67.
* These sentiments sufficiently appear in the letters from Mr. Hollis to

Mr. Lindsey, written during this period, the originals of which, by the kind

ness of a friend, are in my possession. They contain alarming representa

had now the same appalling expectations, and, in concert with the Archdea

con, Dr. Fleming, and several anonymous associates, continued to commu

nicate through the columns of the public prints, these Protestant alarms,

which had so powerfully affected their own imaginations. Mr. Hollis, who

chiefly resided in London, appears to have devoted his munificent purse, and

his unwearied personal attentions, to retain newspapers in this service, and

to promote, by various methods, their extensive circulation. These objects

seem, indeed, to have constituted, too often, his undivided daily avocation.

the toleration of Papists, (for of Catholic emancipation they had no concep

Papal ascendancy.

other liberal minds, from which better things might have been expected,

this neighbourhood. I know nothing how it has been received

by Mr. Venn, or his friends. He lately preached at Leeds, for

the benefit of the Infirmary; Ibut the whole sermon, am told,

was upon the subject of our controversy, and he again declared

that he would renounce his Christianity if some opinions which

he mentioned were not true.

   How this interview, otherwise so gratifying, had aggravated Mr. Lindsey'a

mental anxiety, as illustrating by a striking contrast his now rapidly increas

ing"  clerical perplexities,  has been thus described by Mre. Cappe :
       Happening to be at     Catterick soon after their departure, the conversa

tion frequently turned on the subject of the late visitors. Mrs. Lindsey
observed, that ' they were not alone illustrious for their various and uncom

mon mental endowments, but to be admired also for the innocent, and even
playful cheerfulness of their conversation.' ' Ah,' returned Mr. Lindsey,

' your observation is just, but they arc at ease.'" Mem. of C. Cappe, pp.

148, 149.

  I think myself very much obliged to you for the care with

benefit of your remarks in time, I should probably have altered

every tiling you object to ; but as the thing was printed, I con

passage that you objected to the most. I paid the postage of

that packet, because the purpose of sending was only my own

advantage, and therefore you should not have paid the post

meant only that for divines, but I wish I had been more ex

which 1 have sent inclosed to Mr. Blackburne.

All that I know of the Papists about Leeds is, that one of

them is become a hearer of mine ; but I believe it was chiefly

owing to his wife, who had belonged to us, and who is now
Idead.
         never had any conversation with him ; nor, to my
knowledge, did I ever converse with any Papist in my life.

We were brought up in a thorough abhorrence and contempt

Iof them. But enough of this.
       think the preliminary part of the pamphlet concerning

Mr. Venn,* of much more value than the rest. How he takes

it, or what he will do, I am not informed. You are more

acquainted with his friends.

   The reviewers have taken it into their heads to censure, as
" hasty and inaccurate," the very best and mc*t correct part

of my Remarks on Balguy.f I could not alter a word for the
better, but the observations Ihe has selected are, believe, new.
I think them important, and I am sure he did not understand

them. As the writer addresses himself to me in so particular
J Ia manner,
              had written a reply ; but Dr. Price suppressed

it,
                    it

Johnson's, together with another that had written to the

   The plates to Chart of Biography* must be re-engraved.
Have you any observation to make on it ?f

         To Mr. Clement Sharpe.J

   Sir,                                   Leeds, Feb. 4, 1770.

As your letter seems to bear the marks of a sincere desire of

information, and not to have been written for any captious
purpose, my thoughts on the subject of baptism are at your
service, or that of any of your friends to whom you may choose

to communicate them.

  It appears to me, that few persons in this western part of

the world, enter sufficiently into the ideas and notions of the

Jews and other people of the East ; and that your objections

to infant baptism cannot be satisfactorily answered, without

laying aside some of the ideas peculiar to this part of Europe,

and especially in modern times.

Nothing was, or indeed is, more common in the East, than

to express sentiments and purposes by actions; and so natural
was it to the Jews to denote purity of heart by outward wash

ing, that we find by the success of John's preaching, that,

though he did not pretend to teach a new religion, but only

insisted upon repentance and greater regularity and strictness
of manners than was common among the Jews ; yet that few
of them made any difficulty of being baptized, considering it
nothing more than a profession of repentance and a new life,

and therefore it is called the baptism of repentance. With
respect to the subjects of baptism, we should consider, more
than we do, the great power of a master of a family in the

East, and how far his own acts affected his wife, children, and

servants, and indeed every thing belonging to him : . thus,
though circumcision was a religious ceremony, expressive of a

covenant between God and Abraham, it was applied not only

to the children of Abraham, but also to all that were born in

his house, or bought with money, i. e. his slaves, who were
not in the least interested in the covenant. In fact, it only

concerned Isaac; Ishmael, who, however, was circumcised,
had no interest in it at all. See Gen. xvii, 12, 23. The cir

cumcision of Ishmael, of the children of Abraham in general,
and of his slaves, was not considered as any act of theirs, but
only of their master, and therefore their consent was not in the

least necessary.

   When the Ninevites repented at the preaching of Jonah,
the cattle were made to fast, as expressive of the contrition of

their masters.

  I have no doubt but that the Jews admitted proselytes to

their religion, by solemn washing or baptism as well as by

circumcision ; indeed, considering their ideas and practices in

other respects, I should have wondered if they had not done
it ; and I have as little doubt but that when a master of a
family embraced their religion, their children, if not their

slaves also, were baptized and circumcised. This, then, being
the common practice of the Jews, our Lord had no occasion to
give any particular instruction as to the proper subjects of
baptism. When a head of a family was converted to Christia
nity, he and all his house, i. e. his children and slaves, were
baptized ; not as a mark of their being Christians, but of their
master being one, and of the obligation he was under to

educate them in that religion, and inculcate upon them the

maxims of it; this is an obligation that is peculiarly sacred,
and hardly ever fails of success all over the East. There is

nothing that a Mahometan is more intent upon than to make
his servants good Mussulmen. When the children were grown

up, or the slaves changed their service, they might adhere to

the religion they had been brought up in, or not, as they

pleased. Infant baptism appears to me to have been the uni

form practice of Christians, as far as I can collect from the

primitive fathers, till an idea was introduced of the peculiar
efficacy of baptism, as such, to wash away sins, and the safety
of dying soon after baptism, before a person had contracted
fresh guilt. On this account Constantine the Great, and many
others, deferred baptism till the hour of death. Afterwards,

slaves being generally enfranchised, and considered as acting
for themselves, and the power of fathers over their children

more than declaration of my being Christian myself, and,

       Dear Sir,                                                    Leeds, Feb. 21, 1770.
       I am obliged to you for Patrobas,f but I could not find room

for it in the number just printed. It is promised for the next.
I like it very well ; but I am afraid the quotations are too long.

Perhaps it may be better only to mention Locke's opinion, and

refer to his book.J

be said by way of objection to it. In the present number

you will find an article of mine signed Liberius.\\ It is the

nothing of Mr. Turner's in this number, but he has some very

good matter that will come in this volume.lf

For my own part I can see no more reason to repent writing
that piece than any thing else that I have done ; and if I re

publish any of my pamphlets, that will be one of them. Every

paragraph was considered and approved by my excellent and

cool-judging friends at Warrington ; and my friends among the

Dissenters like it far better than most of my other pieces. I
am far, however, from thinking it has no fault; and if I re
print it,* I hope to improve it a good deal, but not so as to

satisfy those who are much dissatisfied with it in its present

I have of late been very busy, and pretty successful in my

philosophical pursuits. I have sent to the Royal Society a

memoir, as long as a pamphlet, containing an investigation

new experiments, electrical and chemical ;lf and I am now

that excellent man has strangely mistaken my meaning, and

even my writing, in my last letter to him. In answer to his
Iquestion, " to whom shall we go ?"  said, " suppose it had

been asked by Luther." He read to Luther, and gives a long

comment upon it.

  When I said that any appearance of an alliance between the

Reforming clergy and the Dissenters would do the former no
good, I meant it would render them more obnoxious to the

superior clergy, and not, as he supposes, that on your joining

with us (an event which I am far from desiring) we should
demand more than would content you. And when I apolo
gized for the freedom with which I wrote, I said no more than

he had said to me to the same purpose, and which would

never have suggested to me the idea of his being jealous of me.

  I wish he may have preserved that letter, and that you

would give him this explanation of it. I certainly write letters

without much thinking; but I should not have thought that I

could have expressed myself so very incautiously as to give

a colour to such a construction. My real sentiments are the
IfIsame that expressed in that letter.
                                        it be possible for us

Dissenters to act in concert with you, I wish you would tell
us how. It is a thing that I have no conception of, except as
I there explained myself. Let us be content to prosecute the

same general cause, though in a manner independent of one

another. In the present state of Christianity I am for in

creasing the number of sects rather than diminishing them;

but I am only one individual. There may be Dissenters who

are just what the archdeacon would have them. I should be
ashamed of the cause, if we all thought and acted alike.*

know how it is, but when a thing has begun to be neglected,

it is a kind of reason for continuing to be so. Of late I can
truly say I have been more busy in composing and transcribing

IIthan ever was in my life. I have frequently written till

could hardly hold the pen, for writing long hand is irksome,

Iand indeed painful to me ; and after all, I do assure you,

Letters to me on the subject of the Lord's Supper, with some

corrections and large additions to my own piece.* Another

is a set of Letters to the Dissenter, that I mentioned to you,f

and which the archdeacon has seen. That kind of an attack

Igave me an opportunity to say several things wished to say,

and the like may never come again.

of which we have not so much as the shadow with us; and I

know I shall be severely ridiculed by many of our freethinking
IDissenters for molesting the subject; but am very serious,
Ifand have said a good deal about it.  I have ever been severe
upon the Church of England, I have been here as much so
upon ourselves, so that I expect soon to be in the case of
Ishmael, " My hand will be against every man, and every
man's hand against me ;" but I have not his promise to be un-

Dear Sir,                          Leeds, Aug. 30, 1770.
I think myself much obliged to you for the favourable
I Imention, doubt not, you made of me to the duke.
                                                         shall

certainly wait upon him when I go to London, which 1 fancy

will be the next winter ; but I am by no means sanguine in

my expectations from him, or indeed from any other quarter.

  I shall be a loser by the Repository this year; but I am en

couraged to expect that some friends of the design will ad

vance something towards defraying the expenses attending it,
till the sale shall repay me. If ever it do, I shall return what
Iever shall be advanced.
                            have not the least doubt of its being

carried on with spirit, and that I shall be supplied with very
Ivaluable materials, for a considerable time to come.
                                                         have

by me the quantity of half a volume. Mr. Cappe has perused

the MS. on the Intermediate State, and joins the archdeacon in

requesting that it may be all printed, except a few pages, which,

fhe says, are not much to the purpose.
   By this time you will have seen my Letters to Mr. Enfield.J

I Ido not know how they are received by him, but as have

not heard from him, I am afraid he doth not take it so well as

I hoped he would have done.§ My piece will give more

offence to a Very considerable part of those who are called

rational Dissenters than you can imagine. By one mean* or

another, I believe I have more enemies among the Dissenters
than in the Church. I shall soon be obliged to court the

Papists and Quakers in order to have any friends at all, ex

cept a few philosophical people, who, like his Grace, know

nothing of my having meddled with theology or politics.

  I shall soon read Beattie,* Dr. Leechman gave me a good

account of it some time ago.

  It would give Mr. Turner and me great pleasure to see you

with us ; but indeed we cannot make another journey north

             To Mr. Clement Sharp.J

Sir,                                     Leeds, Sep. 12, 1770.

I received yours of the 29th of May only a few days ago.

It was not found in the pack of wool till the manufacturer had

Ioccasion to make use of it. Being very busy myself, sent

your queries to an ingenious friend of mine, who signs Vigilins
in the Repository, and I enclose you his answer,§ which I much

approve, in his own hand-writing. I wish it may give you the

satisfaction you want; but, in this imperfect state, we are

not to expect a perfect solution of all our doubts and difficul

ties. We must be content with as much light as is sufficient

to guide our conduct, and, in lesser things, we must often be

determined by probabilities only, certainty not being to be

had.

  I am sorry for the loss you have sustained, but it is happy

that you do not grieve as one without hope,

"* In May 1770, Dr. Beattie's ' Essay on the Nature and Immutability

of Truth, in opposition to Sophistry and Scepticism,' made its appearance.

As the manuscript had been seen by many eminent men of learning, and as
the ' Essay on Truth' was known to be written as a direct attack on the

philosophical principles of Mr. Hume, its publication had been looked for

with considerable expectation. The boldness, too, of a writer so little known

to the world as Beattie was at this time, in attacking an author so formidable

as Mr.  HFourmbee,s'sco"ntLriibfeuteodf   not a little to excite the public  curiosity."  See
Sir W.                                   Beattie," (1824,) p. 90, infra, p.

"An anonymous critic has lately remarked, that the Essay on Truth, though

it produced a great sensation when it appeared, and was hailed as a com

plete antidote to the sceptical poison of Hume, is now acknowledged to l>c

a somewhat shallow work. The author did not appreciate either the depth

or the snbtlety of the arguments he controverted, and eked out his super

ficial answer with a good deal of clamorous invective." Blackwood's                       Ed.

   Dear Sir,                     Leeds, Nov. 1, 1770.

I am exceedingly glad that you like the scheme and conduct
Iof the Repository so well.
                                 do assure you that your appro
Ibation of it is one of the greatest encouragements
                                                                                         have to

continue it ; but I really hope it doth good, and so long as that

is the case it shall not die, if there be a possibility of keeping
it alive. I think Dr. Duchal's piecej a very good article, and

am much shocked that our good friend, the Archdeacon, in a

letter I received along with yours, should question his belief

of the Christian revelation.§ He has much more reason to

question my belief of Christianity, and yet I think I love and

value it as much as those who are more orthodox than himself;

Inay, am sure that / feel more as a Christian, since I have

thought with so much freedom, than before.

  ISince I wrote the Essays on the Harmony have met with

a much larger edition of Mr. Mann's Dissertations,|| in Latin,

with additional arguments, &c, of which I intend to give an

account in a supplement to what I have written. I do not lay

any stress (as any person may see) on several of the transpo

sitions I have proposed, though I think some of them very
probable, and I am clearly of opinion that Christianity will be

a gainer by such freedoms as I have taken with the Evangelists.

I shall take much greater liberties with the apostolical epistles,

that kind, I have taught school and given lectures many years

suits, is my favourite study ; and if I live to complete my other

I am glad that you approve of any thing in my Essay of

justly find with it.U However, I wrote it with as much cir
Icumspection as am capable of, and you expect too much
from me if you look for any thing better.

him about them very lately, and hope to receive them soon.

material.

however, if it hasten your sequel.**

that, if he meet with no unexpected hindrances, he shall be able to deliver it

work will make one volume in quarto, but perhaps not quite so large as his
History of Electricity. He chose to begin with this branch of experimental

philosophy for no other reason but because the books he had collected fur

nished him with more materials for it than for any other. The next subject

he propose to give his attention to is Magnetism, which he conjectures may

make another volume. Beyond this, he has no distinct views himself, and

"therefore he can give no further information to others.

       Notwithstanding the generous assistance he has met with in the books

that have been sent to him for the use of this work, be could not avoid being

at a very considerable expense himself; but, being now engaged, he is

determined not to be retarded by any expense for which he can possibly
provide ; confiding for his indemnification in the encouragement he promises

himself from the liberal-minded friends of science, which is of no particular

party either in politics or religion ; and in his attachment to which he is as

sincere and as zealous as he is with respect to any other subject which

"he imagines to be equally interesting and useful to mankind.

  I wonder that Mr. Jebb does not so much as mention Mr.
Mann's Harmony. If I were to lecture in divinity I would

not take his method. It must be very tiresome to students,
and would keep them too long to one thing to the neglect of

others. Besides, it is too timid a plan. Systems are the best

ffor instruction, though they should be accompanied with parti

cular criticism. Mr. Jebb recommends Taylor on the Romans,
which, I think, can only puzzle and mislead a person.J

134 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

  I do not know what to say to Lardner's piece.* You must

own that it is unworthy of him ; and as it is not improbable

but this may be the last volume of the Repository, I would

have the materials very choice and original. Direct to me at
Mr. Johnson's.

  I would be governed by you with respect to the Repository,
if it were practicable, but I cannot possibly undertake to an

swer all the objections to Christianity, and all difficult ques

tions that are sent me. As to the Deistsf I have no reason to

think that I have had a single article sent from that quarter,

though several have been solicited to state in it the objections
that had the most weight with them. Pyrrho% is a very sincere
Christian, and an exemplary good man, though something of a

sarcastical turn,§ contracted, I believe, by the great opposition

he for a long course of years has been exposed to from the

Methodists and Independents, from which quarter I also begin

 to suffer a good deal.||

I Dear Sin,             ferry-bridge, Feb. 17, 1771-

am exceedingly sorry that your letter came so late. The

last sheet of the Repository was printed off, and even the

blue cover ; so that it was not possible to notice the addition

to Socrates Scholasticus at all. I think it a very proper addition

to the paper, and you may depend on its being inserted in the

next number;** but it will not be published till the first of

September next.

On Saturday last I sent you two sets of both volumes of the

Repository, and twelve 6ets of the second volume, which, ac

cording to my calculation, is the number that you ordered.

This work shall not die, if I can possibly keep it up, and I do
Inot easily give up any scheme that I engage in.
                                                                        have left to

hypothesis, and some very judicious remarks on Chubb's
Farewell, by W. W.,f the antagonist of Paulinus. He is a

very ingenious and worthy man of my acquaintance, a Dissent

ing minister,^ and has not the least notion that I am Paulinus.

    The deceased friend that Paulinus refers to in this number

of the Repository is Mr. Clarke, of Birmingham,§ who gave me
bis name at the beginning of the scheme. I most exceedingly

regret my friend Alexander.!! He would have been to me

instead of a legion. I ani informed that several more pieces of

Dr, Duchal.lf and some of Abernethy, were sent me for the

Repository ; but they must have been lost in their passage to

Liverpool; but I shall write immediately to procure fresh

copies of them.

I have some letters that passed betwixt Dr, Lardner and

Mr. Hallet ;** but the doctor's executor hesitates about giving

me the whole correspondence, and without that I think it will

not be worth while to print the beginning of it. It relates
chiefly to the Logos.ff I shall see him in London.
IDo not be uneasy about my affairs at Leeds.               hope I shall

do very well. The increase of Methodism with us is sudden

        Dear Sir,                                                     Leeds.f

I have been returned from London about a fortnight; but

a variety of business has prevented me from writing to you so

Isoon as ought to have done. I hope you received a letter I

wrote to you from Ferrybridge, on my way to London, relating

to the Repositories you were so obliging as to order .J

  I thank you for your remarks on the Address.§ They are
certainly just ; but I consulted with Dr. Kippis about them,

and we thought it was hardly worth while to cancel what was

already printed for the sake of the improvements. In this I

hope you will excuse us. In one of the passages there was a

misprint, which will be corrected with a pen.

Ithem in person, do not think quite so clear.
  I have also lately seen a piece on the prophecies, written by

one Taylor, in Scotland, which contains some things well
worth notice. Daniel says that " the sanctuary shall be
cleansed" after " 2300 days."* These, reckoned from " the
third year of Belshazzar," when the " vision" was seen, would

lead us to expect that the restoration of the Jews cannot be

ffar off. In Abubeker's instructions to his generals,J (which

you may see either in the Universal History, or in Guthrie's

General History,) you will find a remarkable illustration of

where the Arian doctrines are constantly inculcated. This man, within

these ten days, has printed two or three papers, and distributed them about

the University, all tending to promote this Arian and Socinian scheme, in

order to gain the University to pass a grace, that for the future persons may

be admitted to academical degrees without subscribing to the articles and

litu"rgTyh. e clergy who join this scheme must be either blind to their own in

terest, or abandoned to the cause of Christianity, as it is evidently an infidel

and libertine design to overthrow religion, and bring nothing but confusion

and anarchy into the church. Deism, Arianism, Socinianism, and all the

various offspring of Calvinism, may then take preferments in the church,
which, in my opinion, if this scheme prevails, it will be a disgrace to be any

longer a member of. Pray God it may prove abortive, together with the

a person who calls himself a Shaver,* but it is altogether un
worthy of notice.

author of the inclosed.
   In a former letter Mr. Honeyman informs me that he would

be glad to find employment as a tutor to some young gentle

man. I wish I could be of service to him. I should think it

to be befriending a disciple in the name of a disciple.

         Dear Sir, ,                                    Leeds, Aug. 23, 1771.

The state of religion with us is similar to what you describe

it to be with you, but not quite so bad. The Appeal has ex
cited, I may say, universal attention here. Two answers have

appeared, and several more are threatened. No notice will
be taken of them, except that a third will be published, con

taining a new translation, or familiar illustration, of all the texts

of which the Calvinists avail themselves. I inclose the second

edition of the Appeal, and the sequel to it.J
   The Repository will fail, for no other reason but because it

is too expensive to me. 1 should have lost 20/. by the last

volume, but that a few friends bought sets to give away, on

purpose to indemnify me, but I cannot expect such assistance
a second time. I am glad that the article signed Clemens has

your approbation. There are four articles of mine in the

number that is just printed.§ I think I told you that Liberius

is one of my signatures. I like the paper you sent me very
much. || You may depend upon seeing it in the next number.

I hope you will not fail to send me your thoughts on the sub
ject you mention. I shall be obliged to you if you will urge

they indulge themselves must do great harm to the cause of

truth, and woe unto them by whom the offence cometh.||

esteem him much.K He was lately at Leeds, upon a scheme

to hear of the declining state of yours, and wonder what can

have been the reason of it. Indeed, all our academies for

ministers are poorly supplied. There is very poor encourage

                                 To Rev. T. Lindsey.

       Dear Sir,                                              Leeds, Aug. 23, 1771.
I presume that by this time you are returned from London,
so that I hope this will find you at Catterick.

  If I have been rightly informed, you were no more than

twenty-four at the meeting,* and you were in the chair, which

prelates, should have been three, Yorke, Percy, and Porteus. See Lindsey's

as the like voluntary combinations of serious and inquisitive persons, un

known to each other, ever will be made up, of men differing in opinion from

each other in many respects, but united in this, that subscription to human

formularies of faith was an unjust imposition upon the consciences of men,

and an invasion of Christ's authority, the only Lord of conscience, and Head

of his church." Apology, (1/82,) Ed. 4, pp. 3, 4. See Mem. of Lindsey,

pp. 46, &c.

Mr. Lindsey, at the date of Dr. Priestley's letter, appears to have been

still absent from Catterick, incessantly employed in promoting the objects

of the petition. From "London, July 31," he had thus written to Mr.

Jeb"bO:ur enemies say (for I have met and combated several in this town and

its environs) that we are composed of a few insignificant people, a mere

made a mouse to breathe for a considerable time without

drinking glass full of five minutes, and was taken out as

vigorous as when was put in. The same mouse, as well as

some others, was exceedingly convulsed, and would have died

in a minute or two, in the place from which the fixed air had

been taken. Had       been very strong, they would have died

much sooner.         propose to repeat these experiments several

times, and shall re-examine those that failed.

wax candles have burned out, whereas air of the same parcel

         To Rev. Joshua Toulmin.§

         Dear Sir,                                   Leeds, Nov. 6, 1771.

I have just received a packet from you, the contents of

which are exceedingly agreeable to me. The articles for the

Itepositoryll are already in the hands of the printer for the

next number. When articles are short, and tend to set any

part of the evidences of Christianity in a new or clearer point

of light, I am glad to receive them, though the thoughts be

not absolutely original; but the more truly original any thing
is, the more proper it certainly is for the purpose of the

Repository. If you have any other short articles similar to

these, they will be very acceptable to me.

Your scheme of a Life of SocinusU strikes me very much as

peculiarly seasonable at this time; but you overrate my ac

Iquaintance with history, if you imagine am able to direct

did it recompense Dr. Priestley, in a pecuniary point of view, especially
as he had gone to considerable expense with a view to the completion of his

extended plan.

   " To him, indeed, though pecuniary loss was a serious evil, pecuniary
profit was a consideration of small importance. His motives to literary labour

seem uniformly to have arranged themselves as follows : utility, reputation,

profit." Mem. 8vo. p. 286.

you to any materials for it. Besides, a critical life is not the

thing I wish fo see so much as a plain and judicious narrative,

calculated to give a favourable idea of his principles, and to

inspire the lukewarm Freethinkers among us with a greater

zeal for truth, and more serious endeavours to promote it. But

I have no occasion to say any thing on this subject, as your

views are exactly the same with mine.* I have expressed

myself pretty strongly with respect to the prevailing indiffer-
ence to important truth, in an additional section in the new

edition of the "Address to Dissenters as such;" but I do not

meet with many persons who see these things in the same light
with myself.f

  IAs far as I have had time to look into your Sermons^

think them well calculated to do good, and more practical

treatises similar to them would be very useful. But it is hardly
possible for one person to direct or assist another in schemes of

this nature. To a person who is disposed and qualified for
works of this kind, particular objects will occur, and he will

execute them to more advantage when the schemes are his

own.

    * As appears in the following passage of his letter from " Taunton, Oct.

5,  "17S7o2m,"e  to Dr.  Calder:
                 of my   acquaintance,
                                        I understand, rather wonder what I propose

by a life of Socinus. A mere account of his sentiments, life, and death,

they say, will be of no service to the literary world, and will not be desired

by the generality ; an interesting life will require great pains, and needs the
use of a large library. I apprehend your opinion, and that of those to whom

I have communicated my plan, is very different on this matter ; and there

fore I am inclined to pursue my design without attempting a work merely

calculated for the literati, and yet something that may, to the generality, be

interesting and new ; not so much a critical as a popular life of this injured

person, with a view to hold him forth to esteem and imitation." Nichols's

Lit. Wat. IV. 845.

  IAs the frank will contain them, inclose for your amuse
Iment two small pieces, which wrote for the use of the com

mon people in this neighbourhood. The fancy of selling them
for a penny has given them a very great run. We have sold
near three thousand of the Appeal, and two thousand of the

other pamphlet. Three answers are already published,* so

Ithat you may think have enough upon my hands.
  I have these two summers been giving familiar lectures to

the youth of my congregation, on the foundation of Natural

and Revealed Religion. I am now revising and enlarging the
short text I made use of for that purpose, and may, perhaps,

publish it with a discourse, on the best method of communi
cating religious knowledge in such societies as ours.f

  If you have not begun already, I hope you will soon set
Iabout the Life of Socinus, and shall be very glad to hear of

the progress you make in it. As you have a school ,+ you
must be pretty fully employed; but an obligation to do busi
ness soon makes it habitual and easy, and generally those per

sons do the least who have the least to do.

  The most considerable of your remarks, I observe, relates to
my objection to Newton's " fits of easy reflection and trans

mission,"* as you think he doth not suppose that the rays are
in those fits in the whole of their progress. P. 257, 8vo.,f you

will find these words: " Light is in fits of easy reflection and

easy transmission, before its incidence on transparent bodies.

And probably it is put into such fits at its first emission from

luminous bodies, and continues in them during all its progress.

For these fits are of a lasting nature," &c I therefore think

that all my objections must be well founded. Boscovich, also

Mr. Melville and Mr. Michell, understood him in that sense.J

  It was absolutely necessary to abridge Newton, but I never

ventured to do     it,   unless    imagined at least that did not

     Dear Sir,                                         Leeds, Dec. 5, 1771.
     I cannot help communicating to you a proposal that Mr.

Bankesf has just made to me, to accompany him in his+ second
voyage, in the character of astronomer, with a handsome pro

vision secured to me and my family. I have so far listened to
it as to desire to. know what terms can be procured for me. I

wish to have your real thoughts, and that of some others of my

friends, on the subject, as I am far from being determined.
My favourite employment is that of a minister,? but, I doubt

not, my place would be supplied till my return, and retirement

will be necessary to the execution of my schemes, which I
could resume with peculiar advantage after my return. I

wish you would see Mr. Vaughan, or Mr. Lee, on the subject.
The proposal || came to me through the hands of Mr. Lee and

Mr. Eden.f

employment might have been chosen, and his dissent in religious points no

objection. But I think our public has been retrograde, in those respects,

ever since, and we shall become less liberal, ere we are more so, unless this

I most sincerely wish you success, and hope what you are

doing cannot fail to produce good effects.
   You must permit us Dissenters, however, who are not used

to the idea even of spiritual superiors, to smile at your scheme,
as an application to the powers of this world for a reformation
in the business of religion. As the disciple of a Master whose

kingdom is not of this world, I should be ashamed to ask any

thing of temporal powers, except mere peace and quietness,

which, being temporal blessings, they may bestow ; but I should

be sorry to make any application to them which should imply
an acknowledgement of their having other kind of power.
The more I think of an application to such an House of Com-
mous, or such a Parliament as ours, on the subject of religion,
the more does the absurdity of it strike me. But I shall say

no more on this subject, lest I should offend you. I really did

not mean to say so much.

      Dear Sir,                                       Leeds, Mar. 9, 177-2.
      I am truly sorry that I made the observation in my last on
your application to Parliament, in which I am really much
Iinterested, and in the success of which shall most sincerely
rejoice. I cannot help thinking, however, that an application

to temporal powers to remove religious grievances is a very
different thing in those who continue in a state of voluntary

subjection to them, and in those who never owned their au

thority. In the former case, a request to make any alteration
seems to be a recognition of a power either to make or not

more, in order to put yourself into good humour with me.
should be very sorry if this inadvertence should have displeased

Iyou, and affect a correspondence, from the revival of which

expect much pleasure and improvement.

  Notwithstanding I am truly desirous to secure the conti
nuance of your correspondence, I begin to find the writing of
Inecessary letters rather burdensome, on which account de
cline all correspondence as much as possible. I have just

finished a pretty long letter in Latin to a professor at Upsal,t
and another in French to an electrician at Como, in the Milan

ese, and not being used to write those languages, it is rather

irksome to me. They both wrote to me to lay claim to certain

discoveries, having seen a translation which has lately been

made of my History of Electricity into French.J I am afraid
I shall have more trouble of the same kind, and doing justice
will by no means please all.

   You seem to think that the Dissenters would succeed in an

application to Parliament to get relieved from the obligation

to subscribe, and that this would promote your business. I

should be afraid that so many applications of the same kind
would disgust our statesmen, as it might lead them to think

that if they once begun that work, there would be no end of
it; but this I say quite at random. I shall most heartily join
in any thing for the relief either of ourselves or you; but I

really thought you would wish us to keep off for the present.

I shall hear more of it when I am in London. § I rejoice in every

thing that occasions a discussion of such important subjects.

         Dear Sir,                                           London, April 3, 1772.

1 snatch a moment to inform you that I am just returned

from the House of Commons, where the motion to bring in a

Bill to excuse Dissenting ministers and schoolmasters from an

obligation to subscribe any of the Thirty-nine Articles was

carried triumphantly.

   Sir Harry Houghton made the motion, and Sir G. Savile

seconded it. It was opposed by Sir Roger Newdigate, and

Dolben,* and the elder of the Foxes,f but they spoke miserably
indeed. Mr. Burke spake admirably in our favour,* and Mr.

Onslow, Mr. Montague, and several others, also spake well.
   I am sorry, however, that our success was carried in such

a manner as bodes your petition no good. Almost all the

speakers laid great stress on the difference between your case

and ours, contending for a strict establishment and a large

toleration.

The bishops at first favoured us, then violently opposed,

and now seem to acquiesce. Lord North was not present, and

I believe the ministry wished us well.§

I take the first opportunity of informing you of my return

from London, and desiring your acceptance of a small pamphlet

which I printed when I was there.

Iand give me any hints that may occur to you for their improve

at the same time that the three pamphlets shall continue to be

the House of Lords, though I should think they will hardly

choose to bear all the odium of it. Whether we succeed or

Inot, hope some good will be done by our attempt as well as

by yours.

gave me very great satisfaction. The story of Hartley's Ob

deacon. I hope that no difference we can ever have* will

make either of us less ready to do one another ahy service in

our power, or check our readiness to ask any favour.

  A friend of mine losing his wife, by Whom he had no chil

dren, privately married her sister, the relations on both sides
very much approving of it. They are now desirous of avow
ing their marriage ; but being apprehensive of trouble from the
officers of the Spiritual Court, they desire to know what are
the most prudent steps they can take to prevent or alleviate it.

What is the worst they have to fear ? Who are the persons

the most likely to give them trouble ; or can any thing be done

by friendship or interest ? They were married three years
ago in London, and live in Leeds. They would apply to Par

 liament if they thought they could obtain a confirmation of

 the marriage. The sooner you can procure an answer to the

above questions, the more you will oblige me and my friend. t
   I am truly sorry to lind that it has been given out that the

 Dissenters are no friends to the petition of the clergy, and can

 assure you that, as far as my acquaintance extends, it is alto
 gether void of foundation.

     We do think our case to be in some respects different from
 yours, and our request more reasonable. We ask no emolu
 ment, and therefore think it peculiarly hard to be burdened

it                  in the Archdeacon's autograph    to Dr. Priestley's letter :

                                                     I know of no municipal       law  pro

hibiting the marriage of the wife's sister, and the ecclesiastical law hardly

gives canonical authority to Archbishop Parker's degrees, so that I believe
the spiritual court will hardly venture to molest his friends ; and if they do,

it would be advisable to move the King's Bench for a prohibition, on the

strength of the Lord Chief Justice Vaughan's opinion, which the doctor may

sec"aYt ofuullhalevnegtah   in Fry's pamphlet.         Iof the same sort, where was
                           case in your neighbourhood
solicited to act ex officio, but I advised the complainant to be quiet, as we

could do nothing, having no foundation to go upon. Mr. Frankland's case

is well known. Something was attempted against him, but he paid bo re

       1 think the parties should  be easy, and give themselves no trouble,

is but shifting out of the jurisdiction where the process is commenced."

imagine how it could be of any disservice to you as petitioning
Ifclergy.
             I had written any letters to him, it would have been

chiefly with a view to serve you, by taking that opportunity

of setting in a strong light the evil and iniquity of subscription

to the Thirty-nine Articles, in the case of a mind so enlight

ened as his. It is to me and my friends really surprising that

you should imagine his case and yours the same, or that you
Ifderive any advantage from his joining you.                                  I be rightly

informed, it operated otherwise in the House of Commons, in
which his conduct was particularly alluded to. When all that

he can say even of the Athanasian Creed is, that it is unhappily

expressed,* it must surely appear very impertinent to trouble

the Legislature on the subject. And what great hardship can

he have to complain of, whose mind (as is apparent from what
he has already done) is prepared to subscribe any articles what

soever that may stand in the way of his preferment ? Let him

be asked if he would not repeat his subscription to-morrow

with as little reluctance as he first made it? And yet this is

the man who, though living in contradiction to every principle

of the Confessional, is considered by the author of it as his best

supporter in the controversy.f Were I the author of that
work, I should think myself under a necessity of disclaiming
all connexion with him. It was certainly petulent and foolish

in him       to attack me as he has                done.J           His   brother Obadiah,
who is                                             to me          upon
             one of my hearers, said                                      the occasion, " I

do not know what my brother meant by attacking you, but I
Iknow he hates the Dissenters."
                                                   am afraid his case is that of

one who hates the light because his deeds are evil.

   What I said to Dr. Dawson, the physician, (from whom you
must have had the intelligence you referred to,) was only to

amuse myself, and hear what he would say. I also wished

Ithat he would let his brother know what thought on the

controversy at any time, much less into such a controvery at this time."

  I have seen Mr. Madan's letter, but feel no inclination at
present to answer it. I wish you would do it for me.*

I*' believe now the Bill will pass the House of Lords. The two R. R.'s

most vehement against it are London and Lincoln. Warburton has changed

his note. At the table of a friend, whom we have known near thirty years,

the subject was brought up the other day, among other dishes of discourse,

and the bishop's whole conversation was in favour of the Dissenters, whence

I opine that whether he spoke his real sentiments or not, he most probably

echoed those of his patron, Lord Mansfield, which alone weigh more than

the whole bench of prelates. He intimated farther, that he should not be

present on the occasion ; on which our friend intimated that he thought it
his lordship's duty to be so. The truth, I suspect,

The Rev. Martin Madan had been educated for the bar, which he ex

changed for the Church, and became a highly popular Calvinistic preacher

at the chapel of the Lock Hospital, where I remember to have heard him a

few years after this period.
   He was chiefly known as an author by Thelypthora, advocating the lawful

ness    of polygamy among      C"hrfiestmiaanles  ; though denying the expediency, ex
cept    for the prevention of                     ruin." In the critiques on this publica

answer immediately, I shall have an opportunity of hearing
and attending to your remarks before it be printed off.

   I flatter myself that the extracts from Penn will please
Iyou.* I am sorry that have not room for more ; but as they

are only intended to give an idea of that man's sentiments, and

of the free manner in which he expressed them, these may
suffice. It will hardly be said that these, as well as the other,
are an invention of my own. I have now got a few dates re

lating to Elwall's trial, which, I think, determine it to 1726.

These I propose to print at the back of the title-page.
  I fancy my friend Mr. Lee was mistaken, when he informedf

me that only one lay-lord spake against the Dissenters' bill. I
have heard nothing from London about it since I wrote to you

last, and therefore cannot tell you what will be done in conse

quence of it. Many of the ministers, I know, were displeased
with the conduct of their committee, and when I left them,

they did not expect to be thanked for their trouble. But the

discontented were chiefly those who expected to have been of

the committee themselves, or who disapproved of the declara

tion which was to have been substituted instead of the sub
J Iscription.
A few of the orthodox,  believe, wished for no

alteration. All, except these last, I doubt not, would join in

an application to parliament by petition; but whether this
Imethod will be adopted I cannot tell.
                                        never expect to see

the Dissenters agree in any thing. Nor do I see how this can

be more reasonably expected than that all establishments

should agree. Besides, I rather think the managers in London

will be tired out. To make the motion any where else would
answer no end at all. So that, I imagine, things will remain

as they are, unless the late noise should be echoed in a few

Ipamphlets, in which shall have no concern.

  I dreamed, indeed, the last night, that I had addressed a

letter to the Bishop of Llandaff, (pray is he not Lord North's

I Ibrother ?)§ in which said bolder things than have yet done;

     Dear Sir,     To Dh. Price.*

T think myself exceedingly honoured by the very favoura

ble opinion which Lord Shelburne's propo9alf implies that

he has entertained of me, as both from your own account, and

that of others, I conceive him to be, for ability and integrity

together, the very first character in this kingdom. But I really
think it would not be in my power to render his lordship any

Iservices equivalent to the recompence which, in prudence,
ought to expect, if ever I leave Leeds ; and I could not satisfy

myself with receiving a salary, without rendering what should

appear to myself an equivalent service.

My salary* exceeds that of most Dissenting ministers, and I

may say that the whole of my time is at my own disposal, so

Ithat can pursue what studies I please, without interruption.

Indeed, my place is such, that, according to present appear
Iances, the only motive can ever have to remove

whoever he be, it is not probable that he will submit to be

directed by another.

  It is true, that my reading and studies have had as great a
range as, I believe, those of most people ; but I imagine that

the information which his lordship might occasionally want,

would relate chiefly to things of a political nature, which I

have not particularly studied, and require more acquaintance

with modern history than I can pretend to.

   But supposing that, by changing the course of my studies,

I could become whatever his lordship wishes me to be, I am

so habituated to domestic life, and am so happy at home, that

it is not possible I should receive any compensation for not
living in my own family. Or, if it could be compatible with

his lordship's views, to compromise this article with me, his

living partly in London and partly in the country, would make

it impossible for me to take any advantage of officiating as a

Dissenting minister, if any society in London should make

choice of me, which, however, I do not think very probable ;
Inor do see from what other source I could benefit myself,

except, perhaps, from reading lectures, either in natural philo

sophy, or the subjects on which I used to give lectures at

Warrington.

Please to represent to Lord Shelburne my sentiments on the
Ifgeneral view of his lordship's proposal.
                                            he should think

that the obstacles I have mentioned may be removed in a

manner consistent with his own views, he shall find me very

ingenuous and explicit on the subject.

  You want to know what I am doing about air. 1 have

lately resumed my experiments on that subject, with consi

derable success. I have perfectly ascertained the restoration

of air, injured by respiration, putrefaction, or by the burning of
candles, spirit of wine, or brimstone matches, by the growing

of plants. For this purpose I have made use of mint, balm,

groundsel, and spinage, and have found that this effect depends

upon the vegetating state of the plants. I have also discovered

that air receives, in a great measure, the very same kind of in

jury from flame as from respiration, and but only about one-

third in degree.*

   The pamphlet I have printedf only contains directions for
making Pyrmont water. I can make better than you import;
and what costs you five shillings, will not cost me a penny. I.

might have turned quack. Several of my observations relate
to air that has passed through burning charcoal. These and

many others I am pursuing farther, and should oftener write

to you on these subjects, but that I consider every correspon

dence as an additional burden to you.J

tioned in his letter, as what he thought his lordship would have

no objection to, viz. .£250 per annum. This he said he would

immediately settle on me for life ; beside providing for me a

house in town, and another in the country, adjoining to his

own. The house in town is, he says, exactly such as let in

Ithat neighbourhood for .£70 per annum. The services might

render him, he says, he hopes will not much interfere with my

Iown pursuits, and, indeed, from his account of them, do not

think they would. We conversed some hours on the subject

with great frankness, on both sides, and he said I might take

Iwhat time pleased, either to consider of the proposals, or,

after accepting them, to leave my present situation.

  IIn this situation things stand, and cannot but say, that
after this interview with his lordship, I am more disposed to

Ilisten to his proposals than was before.
  If I leave Leeds, it will not be to be more happy in myself,

but to make better provision for my family, and not to be less

IIuseful in the world ; and do not see that am doing more

good here than another will do after me ; probably less, on

account of the odium of my sentiments.

want of my intercourse with you, which has been a source of

great satisfaction to me, as well as a necessary assistance in all

my theological schemes.                    Monday  morning,

Dear Sir,    Leeds, Aug. 25, 1772.

On Saturday last, Lord Shelburne, as you gave me reason

to expect, called upon me, and he explained and enforced his

proposal in such a manner, that I own I am much disposed to

comply with it. He said he never thought of settling upon

me less than .£200 per annum for life, and would do as much

more as you and myself should think reasonable. So we

agreed upon the sum mentioned in your letter, «£250. Besides,

I am to have a house adjoining to his own in town, and ano

ther very near his seat in the country. If, however, we should

like the situation in the country, it is probable we shall keep

to it, myself only attending his lordship when he shall require

Imy attendance in London. He gives me what time think

proper to consider of his proposals, and also to leave my pre
sent situation, after I have determined to do it.
I think, however, it will answer no good end, either to keep

his lordship in suspense, or to stay long here after I am deter
Imined to go. So that, according to all appearances,
                                                      shall

launch into a new sphere of life about Christmas next. I am

fearful, however, lest, out of your friendship for me, you

Ishould have led his lordship to expect from me more than
Ishall be able to fulfil. shall always reflect upon your friend

ship with equal gratitude, whether the issue be happy or

otherwise.

  If I should leave Leeds, can you recommend a successor, as

my opinion will probably be asked on the subject? The per

son I had thought of is invited to preach as a candidate at

Birmingham.

the subject of air. I was sensible also, that, with respect to
questions of theology, and the state of religious liberty, &c,
Mr. Turner's correspondence would be of more value to you

than mine could be.

  I have not yet seen Dr. Kippis's pamphlet, but am truly sorry
that he should have given occasion to a letter,* which I see
addressed to him in the public papers. I flatter myself, how
ever, that you will not have the less favourable hearing from
appearing to have had no connexion with us. In the end, this

little difference may be of service to both. Our supposed
agreement was certainly of disservice to both. But, indeed,
whether we agree or disagree, a handle will be made of it to

our common prejudice.

  I must now come to a subject more immediately interesting

to myself. Lord Shelburne has made repeated proposals to
me by Dr. Price, and last week in person, to be his librarian,

189 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

  Mr. Turner and I have fixed to be at York on Monday

next, to stay over Tuesday, and should be happy in meeting
you there.*

                 From Dr. Franklin.

      Dear Sir,                 London, Sept. 19, 1772.

In the affair of so much importance to you, wherein you
ask my advice, I cannot, for want of sufficient premises, coun
sel you what to determine ; but, if you please, I will tell you

how.

When those difficult cases occur, they are difficult, chiefly,

because, while we have them under consideration, all the

reasons pro and con are not present to the mind at the same

time ; but sometimes one set present themselves ; and at other

times another, the first being out of sight. Hence the various

purposes or inclinations that alternately prevail, and the uncer

tainty that perplexes us.

   To get over this, my way is to divide half a sheet of paper,

by a line, into two columns, writing over the one pro, and over
the other con : then during three or four days' consideration, I

put down under the different heads short hints of the different

motives that at different times occur to me for or against the

Imeasure. When have thus got them altogether in one view,
I Iendeavour to estimate their respective weights, and where
Iffind two, (one on each side,) that seem equal, I strike them
both out.  I find a reason pro, equal to some two reasons
Ifcon, 1 strike out the three.
                                I judge some two reasons con,
equal to some three reasons pro, I strike out the Jive ; and thus
proceeding, I find at length where the balance lies ; and if

after a day or two of farther consideration, nothing new that is

of importance occurs on either side, I come to a determination

accordingly. And though the weight of reasons cannot be

taken with the precision of algebraic quantities ; yet, when

each is thus considered, separately and comparatively, and the

whole lies before me, I think I can judge better, and am less
Iliable to make a rash step ; and, in fact, have found great

advantage from this kind of equation in what may be called

moral or prudential algebra.

   Wishing sincerely that you may determine for the best, I

am ever, my dear friend, yours most affectionately.*

                   To Dr. Price.!

Dear Sir,                          Leeds, Sept. 27, 1772.

You think much too well of me, and are too much con
Icerned about me.
                   am truly sorry for the trouble you have

given yourself on my account, as it is not now likely to answer

the friendly design you had in it.

  I thought it right to send you Mr. Johnson's letter. It was

the first remonstrance I received upon the subject. After that,

Mr. Lee talked to me in much the same strain, except that,

upon the whole, he seemed inclined to think favourably of the

Earl of Shelburne's character. I also find that Sir John Prin-

gle, and others, are of opinion that the state I should be brought

into would be too dependant and humiliating, and not leave me

sufficiently master of my own conduct.

  For my own part, I do think that, if I be capable of

doing any good in the world, exclusive of my own private in

Iterest, can do it to the most advantage in my present situa

tion. It is true that my schemes lead me into a variety of ex

penses, and put it out of my power to do much for my family?

ever, to prosecute my experiments as I have opportunity,

keeping off such as would involve me in much expense.

   I have been long bewildered with a multiplicity of new
Iappearances of an extraordinary kind ; but I think that now

begin to see a little into the nature of them, and am not with

out hopes that, after another summer's course, I shall be able
to give a much better account of them than I can at present.

I have been improving my electrical apparatus, with a view to

some experiments of that kind this next winter. From a globe

which I fitted up this day, I can make a dozen or twenty

pencils* fly off at a time, a sight which, I fancy, was never

seen before.

   I am desious of getting subscriptions to the first volume of

the Repository, as the reprinting of it might make more sets

go off. At present I lose £50 by that work. Myself and a
few of my friends wrote the greatest part of it. It was a

   I still continue inclined to accept of Lord Shelburne's pro
posal,* notwithstanding I have heard more said against it than

I have yet communicated to you ; and I cannot help thinking

that it will put me more in the way of being useful both to

my family and the world than 1 can be in my present situa

tion. This, I observe, that those who are acquainted with

Lord Shelburne encourage me to accept of his proposal ; but
most of those who know the world in general, but not Lord
Shelburne in particular, dissuade me from it. All of them
also greatly overrate my present situation, of which myself only

can be a judge, and by comparison with which I must estimate

any other situation.

  I hope to see you the first week in December, having agreed

to take part in a chaise, in company with Mr. Lindsey and
another petitioning clergyman. We expect to be in London

on the Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, and on that day

I propose to wait upon you.

  I intend to send to Mr. Johnson's and you by the first coach

copies of the second volume of my Institutes; and, if you have

time, could wish you would give it a perusal before it goes

into the world.

Ison to Dr. Franklin, and by him to be sent to Dr. Maty.

air, which I got about a year ago from saltpetre, and which

was then quite wholesome, and in which a candle burned per
fectly well, is now become in the highest degree noxious, and
makes no effervescence with nitrous air. It stood in water ;

and common air, in the same circumstances, I find not to be

injured at all in the same time.*

Dear Sir,                    Leeds, Nov. 26, 1772.

    I am sorry to inform you that your recommendation came

too late, the people here having unanimously invited Mr.

Wood, of Ipswich, to succeed me, and he having accepted the

invitation-J Indeed, though I had no previous knowledge of

Mr. Wood, except by character, yet he was so early and so

strongly recommended to us by Dr. Price, Dr. Kippis, and

others, that any other recommendation would have been in

effectual.

  I have been exceedingly happy at Leeds, and though upon

  whatever ; since all the notices that we receive of any sub

  such as bear some relation to our senses, which are the inlets

seems to be very great want of such persons.f

I have now largely availed myself of Dr. Priestley's

correspondence during the seven years of his residence

at Leeds ; having been greatly indebted, as I have be

fore had occasion to acknowledge, for such a valuable

illustration of his Memoirs, to several friendly and most

with any communication more appropriate than the fol

lowing, which 1 copy from the original. It is an inte

resting record of the worthy purpose, and encouraging

prospects, with which, amidst various other avocations,

he had uniformly promoted the improvement of the

were marked by a chaste and correct style of composition, and a rational,

My Young Friends,                              Calne, June 14, 1773.
I cannot Iexpress to you the satisfaction received from

your letter, and unexpected present. Valuable as it is in
Iitself,
          shall value it much more as a memorial of your

esteem, and more still as an evidence of the favourable accept

ance which my endeavours for your improvement in religious

knowledge have met with from you, and, therefore, I trust, of

the benefit you have received from them.

  Be assured that I shall ever retain a most grateful remem
brance of every instance of friendship which I have received

from the congregation, and especially this of yours.

  It is the most earnest wish of my heart that, by a wise and

steady conduct arising from just principles and views, a con

duct which is perfectly consistent with the highest enjoyment
of life, and without which, indeed, life cannot be enjoyed

with any real satisfaction, you may do honour to yourselves,

your friends, and country, here, and what is of still more im

portance, secure a happy immortality hereafter.
   Hoping that the affection and respect which you have had

for me, will be transferred to my worthy successor, I remain

          Your affectionate friend and well-wisher,

                 CHAPTER VI.

                        (1773-1780.)

  A few months after Dr. Priestley had finally quitted

his residence at Leeds, to fulfil his engagement with the
Earl of Shelburne, he received from his philosophical

associates the honourable acknowledgment, which has
been already mentioned * of his diligence and success in
the pursuits of science. On that occasion the President,
Sir John Pringle, thus addressed the Royal Society :

   Gentlemen,

It is with great satisfaction I enter upon this part of my

office, to confer, in your name, the prize-medal of this year

upon a member of this Society, so worthy of that distinction.

  IIt is with singular pleasure acquaint you that the Rev.

Joseph Priestley, Doctor of Laws, has been found at this time

the best entitled to this public mark of your approbation, on

account of the many curious and useful experiments contained

in his Observations on Different Kinds of Air, read at the
Society in March, 1772, and inserted in the last complete
fvolume of your Transactions.
                               And indeed, Gentlemen, when

you reflect on the zeal which our worthy brother has shewn

to serve the public, and to do credit to your Institution, by his

Inumerous, learned, and valuable communications, you will,

imagine, be inclined to think that we have been rather slow

than precipitate in acknowledging so much merit.

    The President proceeded to commemorate the pre
decessors of Dr. Priestley in his scientific pursuits, and
enlarged, to a considerable extent, on the ingenuity and
importance of their associate's own discoveries. The
discourse then concluded with the following address :

      Dr. Priestley,

  It is now time that, in the name and by the authority of

the Royal Society of London, instituted for the improvement

of natural knowledge, I present you with this medal, the palm

and laurel of this community, as a faithful and unfading tes
timonial of their regard, and of the just sense they have of
your merit, and of the persevering industry with which you
have promoted the views, and thereby the honour, of this

ISociety. And, in their behalf, must earnestly request you

to continue those liberal and valuable inquiries, whether by
further prosecuting this subject, probably not yet exhausted,
or by investigating the nature of some other of the subtle fluids
of the universe. You will remember that fire, the great in
strument of the chemists, is but little known even to them
selves ; and that it remains a query, what was by the most
celebrated of philosophers, (Newton's Optics, Quer. 18-- 24,)
proposed as such, whether there be not a certain fluid, (he
calls it ffither,) the cause of gravity, the cause of the various
attractions, and of the animal and vital motions.

    These, Sir, are indeed large demands ; but the Royal
Society have hitherto been fortunate in their pneumatic re
searches ; and were it otherwse, they have much to hope from
men of your talents and application, and whose past labours
have been crowned with so much success.*

   About this time Dr. Priestley appears to have fur
nished to his friend Dr. Calder,-f for the article Fixed
Air, in a scientific dictionary, an account of the progress

and variety of his discoveries in that department. It is

here copied verbatim from Dr. Priestley's autograph.*

      · " The bounds of this branch of natural knowledge have been much

extended of late years, especially by our countrymen, as has appeared by

the account that has been given of the discoveries made by Dr. Hales, Dr.

Bro"wTnrreigagd.inDg ri.n  Black, Dr.        Macbride, and Mr. Cavendish.              has not only
                            the steps       of these philosophers, Dr. Priestley

added considerably to the knowledge we had before of the several kinds of

air, which were the subjects of their inquiries, but has discovered several
new species of air, of which no account, or at least no distinct account,

had been given before, and has made a considerable progress in the inves

"tigation of their properties.

      That water would imbibe fixed air, and that Pyrmont water derives its

accidulous taste and peculiar properties from fixed air, had been discovered

by the philosophers above-mentioned; and Dr. Priestley having observed

that agitation prodigiously facilitated the impregnation, contrived a method

of making artificial Pyrmont water, by which it may be easily made in large

qua"ntInitfileasm, maanbdleat  a very  small expense.         with  which  philosophers  have been
                               air is  a species of air

pretty well acquainted before; but Dr. Priestley found that it might be

procured from copper and lead by the marine acid ; and that, whereas it is

naturally as noxious as any kind of air, yet by agitation in water, by which

it is greatly diminished, it first becomes fit for respiration, though inflamma
ble, then loses its inflammability ; and, lastly, by a continuation of the same
process, comes to extinguish a caudle. With respect to this kind of air, he

has also observed, that the electrical spark taken in it is red, and that mixed

with the fumes of smoking spirit of nitre, a quantity of it is fired at one
                               if it

and that it will serve these purposes a certain time only, had been known to

all mankind ; but the manner in which it. becomes incapacitated for these

purposes, or the provision in nature for purifying and thereby keeping

the atmosphere fit for the purposes of animal life, were altogether unknown.a

Dr. Priestley, however, has made pretty evident that common air becomes    it,
                                       by                                     by

unfit for these purposes,                   being overcharged with that principle which the

chemists call phlogiston, which decomposes the common air, and makes                              it

deposit the fixed air which entered into its constitution. He observed that

the consequence of this overcharge of phlogiston                           diminution of the quan

tity, amounting in some cases to one-fourth, and that air diminished by

one"  isprocess, not liable to              be any further diminished            another.

of candles. which, however, go out when the air is injured about one-third

"us much as by the other processes.                 processes, he found to be so far

      Common air, injured by any of these

restored by a brisk agitation in water, that it was fit for respiration, but

would not admit a candle to burn in it. Air injured by respiration, or pu

trefaction, he restored to the same state by plants in a vegetating state,

which were observed to thrive exceedingly when surrounded with this air ;

and air injured by the burning of candles was perfectly restored by the same
process, so that candles would burn in it again. It is probable, therefore,

that the injury which the atmosphere continually receives from the respira

tion of animals, and from putrefaction, is remedied in part by the agitation

of the water in seas and great lakes, and in part by that prodigious number

of"plBanytsmweainths'  which the earth abounds.     which  does  not appear to have
                        of another species of air,

been observed separately before, Dr. Priestley has been able to ascertain
the quality of any kind of air, with respect to its fitness for respiration.

This he calls nitrous air, being that which is dislodged from metals by the

nit"rouSsuchacidis. the nature of this air, that when one measure of it is mixed

with two measures of common wholesome air, the mixture instantly turns

red ; and after a momentary expansion, occasioned by the heat of the effer

vescence, the whole begins to contract, and the diminution goes on, till, in
stead of there being any addition to the bulk of the two measures of com

mon air, by the one measure of nitrous air, it is reduced to one-fifth less

tha"n   its original quantity.  or  diminution  at all perceived on the mixture of
       There is no redness

nitrous air with any kind of air that is unfit for respiration ; and the diminu

tion"  is more  or less in proportion to  the goodness of the air.        by the  effer
       Nitrous   air, however, is itself  diminished to one-fourth,

vescence of a mixture of iron-filings and brimstone, by the long contact of

iron, or the fumes of liver of sulphur. By the two last of these processes,
it becomes of the nature of inflammable air. This nitrous acid is a very

strong antiseptic, not only preserving flesh from putrefaction, but restoring

tha"t  which is become    putrid.           two     other  kinds of air,  one of which
       Dr. Priestley has   also discovered

he calls acid, being expelled by heat from spirit of salt, and the other

alkaline, being expelled from any liquor containing volatile alkali. These
kinds of air can only be retained by means of quicksilver, being readily
imbibed by water, which in one case becomes by this means strong spirit of

"salt, and in the other a volatile alkaline spirit.

       The acid air decomposes most substances that contain phlogiston, and is

This was in the year 1774.*

  I(117.) This little excursion made me more sensible than

should otherwise have been of the benefit of foreign travel.t
even without the advantage of much conversation with foreign
ers. The very sight of new countries, new buildings, new
customs, &c, and the very hearing of an unintelligible new lan
guage, gives new ideas, and tends to enlarge the mind. To me

Ithis little time was extremely pleasing, especially as saw

every thing to the greatest advantage, and without any anxiety
or trouble, and had an opportunity of seeing and conversing
with every person of eminence, wherever we came ; the poli

tical characters by his lordship's connexions, and the literary

ones by my own. I was soon, however, tired of Paris, and

chose to spend my evenings at the hotel, in company with
a few literary friends. Fortunately for me, Mr. Magellan X
being at Paris at the same time, spent most of the evenings
with me; and, as I chose to return before his lordship, he

accompanied me to London, and made the journey very pleas

ing to me ; he being used to the country, the language, and

Ithe maimers of it, which was not. He had seen much of the

world, and his conversation during our journey was particu
larly interesting to me. Indeed, in London, both before and

after this time, I always found him very friendly, especially

 in every thing that related to my philosophical pursuits.

200 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

I Ihope that in due time it will do more.*        can truly say,

that the greatest satisfaction I receive from the success of my

philosophical pursuits, arises from the weight it may give to

my attempts to defend Christianity, and to free it from those

corruptions which prevent its reception with philosophical
and thinking persons, whose influence with the vulgar and the

unthinking is very great.

  I(119.) With Lord Shelburne I saw a great variety of charac

ters ; but, of our neighbours in Wiltshire, the person had

the most frequent opportunity of seeing was Dr. Frampton, a
clergyman, whose history may serve as a lesson to many. No

man, perhaps, was ever better qualified to please in a convivial
hour, or had greater talents for conversation and repartee ; in

consequence of which, though there were several things very

disgusting about him, his society was much courted, and many

promises of preferment were made to him. To these, not

withstanding his knowledge of the world, and of high life, he

gave too much credit ; so that he spared no expense to gratify
his taste and appetite, until he was universally involved in

debt ; and though his friends made some efforts to relieve him,

he was confined a year in the county prison, at a time when

his bodily infirmities required the greatest indulgences; and

he obtained his release but a short time before his death, on

condition of his living on a scanty allowance ; the income of

his livings (amounting to more than four hundred pounds per

annum) being in the hands of his creditors.       Such was the
end of a man who kept the table in a roar.

   (120.) Dr. Frampton being a high Churchman, he could not
at first conceal his aversion to me, and endeavoured to do me
some ill offices. But being a man of letters, and despising the

clergy in his neighbourhood, he became at last much attached

Ito me ; and in his distresses was satisfied, I believe, that was

one of his most sincere friends. With some great defects, he

had some considerable virtues and uncommon abilities, which

appeared more particularly in extempore speaking. He always

preached without notes, and when, on some occasions, he com-

She had the care of his lordship's two sons, until they came

died suddenly, had made astonishing attainments both in

knowledge and piety, while very young, far beyond any thing

202 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

I dedicated to Lord Fitzmaurice, Lord Shelburne's eldest

son.* Here also I publishedf the third and last part of my

" Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion ;"J and having

in the preface attacked the principles of Dr. Reid,§ Dr.
Beattie,|| and Dr. Oswald,1T with respect to their doctrine of

common sense,** which they made to supersede all rational in

Iquiry into the subject of religion, was led to consider their

system in a separate work,ft which, though written in a man

Iner do not entirely approve, has, I hope, upon the whole,
Ibeen of service to the cause of free inquiry and truth.JJ

   (124.) In the preface had expressed my belief of the doc
trine of Philosophical Necessity, but without any design to
pursue the subject, and also my great admiration of Dr. Hart

ley's theory of the human mind,§§ as indeed I had taken many

opportunities of doing before. This led me to publish|||| that
part of his " Observations on Man,"1H[ which related to the
doctrine of association of ideas, detached from the doctrine of

vibrations, prefixing Three Dissertations,*** explanatory of

his general system. In one of thesefft I expressed some doubt

of the immateriality of the sentient principle in man ;tt+ and

the outcry that was made on what I casually expressed on that
subject can hardly be imagined. In all the newspapers, and

Imost of the periodical publications, was represented as an

unbeliever in revelation, and no better than an Atheist.

    (125.) This led me to give the closest attention to the sub
ject, and the consequence was the firmest persuasion that man
is wholly material,* and that our only prospect of immortality

is from the Christian doctrine of a resurrection. I therefore

digested my thoughts on the subject, and published my " Dis

quisitions relating to Matter and Spirit :"f also the subjects

of Socinianism and Necessity, being nearly connected with

Ithe doctrine of the materiality of man, advanced several con

siderations from the state of opinions in ancient times in favour
of the former; and in a separate volume,J discussed more at
 large what related to the latter, dedicating the first volume of
 this work to Mr. Graham,§ and the second to Dr. Jebb.||

   (126.) It being probable that this publication would be un

 popular, and might be a means of bringing odium on my

 patron, several attempts were made by his friends, though
 none by himself, to dissuade me from persisting in it. But

 Ibeing, as I thought, engaged in the cause of important truth,

 proceeded without regard to any consequences, assuring them

 that this publication should not be injurious to his lordship.

    (127.) In order, however, to proceed with the greatest cau
 tion in a business of such moment, I desired some of my

 learned friends, and especially Dr. Price, to peruse the work

 before it was published ; and the remarks that he made upon

 it led to a free and friendly discussion of the several subjects

years, I addressed a letter to him on the subject,* and to this

he made a reply in a separate work. The controversy pro

ceeded to several publications on both sides, in the most ami
cable manner, and the last " Postscript" was published jointly
by us both.f Though my side of the question was without

any advocates that I know of, and had only been adopted by
Mr. Mann,+ who seemed to have had no followers, there are

Ifew persons, believe, who have attended to our discussion of

the subject, who are not satisfied that I have sufficiently proved
what I had advanced. This controversy was not finished until

after my removal to Birmingham.§

    (129.) Reflecting on the time that I spent with Lord Shel-

burne, being as a guest in the family, I can truly say that I was

not at all fascinated with that mode of life. Instead of look
ing back upon it with regret, one of the greatest subjects of my
present thankfulness the change of that situation for the one
in which am now placed and yet was far from being un

 happy there, much less so than those who are born to such

 state, and pass all their lives in it. These are generally un
 happy from the want of necessary employment; on which

 account chiefly there appears to be much more happiness in
 the middle classes of life, who are above the fear of want, and

yet have sufficient motive for constant exertion of their

 faculties and who have always some other object besides

 amusement.

    (130.) used to make no scruple of maintaining, that there
     not only most virtue, and most happiness, but even most
 true politeness, in the middle classes of life. For in propor
 tion as men pass more of their time in the society of their
 equals, they get better established habit of governing their
 tempers they attend more to the feelings of others, and are
 more disposed to accommodate themselves to them. On the
 other hand, the passions of persons in higher life, having been

less controlled, are more apt to be inflamed ; the idea of their

rank and superiority to others seldom quits them ; and though

they are in the habit of concealing their feelings, and dis

guising their passions, it is not always so well done but that

persons of ordinary discernment may perceive what they in
wardly suffer. On this account they are really entitled to

compassion, it being the almost unavoidable consequence of
their education and mode of life. But when the mind is not

hurt in such a situation, when a person born to affluence

can lose sight of himself, and truly feel and act for others,
the character is so godlike, as shews that this inequality of

condition is not without its use. Like the general discipline

of life, it is for the present lost on the great mass, but on a
few it produces what no other state of things could do.

  I(131.) The greatest part of the time that spent with Lord

Shelburne I passed with much satisfaction, his lordship always

behaving to me with uniform politeness, and his guests with
Irespect ;* but about two years before  left him I perceived

  · " The account here given of Dr. Priestley's connexion with Lord Shel

burne must be gratifying to every friend of science and literature, notwith
standing the subsequent separation. To such persons the character of a
nobleman who, like Lord Shelburne, devotes so much of his time, and so
much of his income, to the pursuits of knowledge, and the encouragement of

those who eminently contribute to enlighten mankind, cannot but be inte

resting. Had he behaved dishonourably or disrespectfully to a man of Dr.

Priestley's high station in the literary world, it would have been an argu

ment that science and literature were ineffectual to soften the pride of titled
opulence and hereditary rank. But Ovid has observed justly, ingenuas

"didicisse fideliter artet, emollit mores, nec tinit esse feros.

      It is right to mention an anecdote highly honourable to Lord Shelburne,
on the authority of Dr. Priestley. At the conclusion of the treaty of peace
in 1783, negociated by Lord Shelburne while he was in the ministry, a strong

opposition was expected, particularly from his former coadjutors, who, soon
after the death of Lord Rockingham, had seceded from Lord Shelburne's

administration. It was suggested to this nobleman that it was customary for
the minister for the time being to let it be understood among the mutes of

the ministerial members, that they might expect the usual douceur for their

votes on such an occasion. Some light might be thrown on the nature and
quantum of this douceur by the list of ministerial rewards distributed at the
close of each session, as stated publicly to the House of Commons by the
late Sir George Savile. Lord Shelburne, without hesitation, refused com

Ievident marks of dissatisfaction, though never understood the

cause of it; and until that time he had been even lavish on all

I Ioccasions in expressing his satisfaction in my society to our

common friends. When left him, asked him whether he

had any fault to find with my conduct, and he said none.

   (132.) At length, however, he intimated to Dr. Price that he

wished to give me an establishment in Ireland, where he had

large property. This gave me an opportunity of acquainting

him that if he chose to dissolve the connexion, it should be on

the terms expressed in the writings which we mutually signed

Iwhen it was formed, in consequence of which should be en

titled to an annuity of an hundred and fifty pounds, and then

I would provide for myself, and to this he readily acceded.

He told Dr. Price that he wished our separation to be amica

Ible, and assured him that nothing should be wanting on my
Ipart to make it truly so. Accordingly, expected that he

would receive my visits when I should be occasionally in

London, but he declined them.
I(133.) However, when
                             had been some years settled at

Birmingham, he sent an especial messenger, and common friend,

to engage me again in his service, having, as that friend as

sured me, a deep sense of the loss of Lord Ashburton (Mr.
Dunning) by death,* and of Colonel Barre", by his becoming

almost blind, and his want of some able and faithful friend,

such as he had experienced in me, with other expressions
Imore flattering than those.
                               did not choose, however, on any
Iconsideration, to leave the very eligible situationf in which

now am, but expressed my readiness to do him any service in

my power. His lordship's enemies have insinuated that he

was not punctual in the payment of my annuity ; but the con

trary is true : hitherto nothing could have been more punctual,

Iand have no reason to suppose that it will ever be otherwise.

pliance ; and declared that if his peace could not obtain the unbought ap

probation of the House, it might take its chance. The consequence was,

that although the address was carried in the Lords by 72 to 59, it wag lost in

the Commons by 224 to 208." T. C. Mem. 8vo. pp. 84, 85.

  (134.) At Calne I had another son born to me, whom, at

Lord Shelburne's request, I called Henry.*

  (135.) It was at the time of my leaving Lord Shelburne that
I found the great value of Mr. and Mrs. Lindsey's friendship,
in such a manner as I certainly had no expectation of when

our acquaintance commenced, especially by their introducing
me to the notice of Mrs. Rayner,f one of his hearers and most

zealous friends.

   (136.) Notwithstanding my allowance from Lord Shelburne

Iwas larger than that which had at Leeds, yet my family

growing up, and my expenses, on this and other accounts, in

Icreasing more than in proportion, was barely able to support

my removal. But my situation being intimated to Mrs. Ray-

ner, besides smaller sums, with which she occasionally as

sisted me, she gave me an hundred guineas to defray the

expense of my removal, and deposited with Mrs. Lindsey,

which she soon after gave up to me, four hundred guineas,

and to this day has never failed giving me, every year, marks of
Iher friendship. Hers is, indeed,

    (137.) Spending so much of my time in London was the
means of increasing my intimacy with both Mr. Lindsey and
Mr. Lee, our common friend ; who, amidst the bustle of po
litics, always preserved his attachment to theology, and the

cause of truth.* The Sunday I always spent with Mr. Lind

sey, attending the service of his chapel, and sometimes offici

ating for him ; and with him and Mrs. Lindsey I generally

spent the evening of that day at Mr. Lee's, who then admitted

Ino other company, and seldom have enjoyed society with

more relish.

   (138.) My winter's residence in London was the means of

improving my acquaintance with Dr. Franklin. f I was seldom

many days without seeing him, and being members of the
same club,J we constantly returned together. The difference

"as a lady of strong sense, aud uncommon generosity." He adds, " She

was a great friend of Dr. Priestley, but could not bear his opinion respecting

the dormant state of man after death, and wrote a long letter to him on this

subject. No, she would exclaim, I shall continue the same conscious being
after death that I am now. I have repeatedly heard her express great indig

nation against Mr. Urwick, for asserting in his own pulpit the pre-existencc

of Christ. She did this once when he was present, and he only made this

calm reply, You did not hear me condemn those who disbelieve it." M. R.

with America breaking out at this time, our conversation was

chiefly of a political nature, and I can bear witness that he

was so far from promoting, as was generally supposed, that he

took every method in his power to prevent a rupture between
the two countries.* He urged so much the doctrine of for
bearance, that for some time he was unpopular with the Ame

ricans on that account, as too much a friend to Great Britain. f

His advice to them was to bear every thing for the present, as

they were sure in time to out-grow all their grievances, as it
could not be in the power of the mother country to oppress

them long.

   (139.) He dreaded the war, and often said, that if the differ

ence should come to an open rupture, it would be a war of
ten years, and he should not live to see the end of it. In

reality the war lasted nearly eight years, but he did live to see

the happy termination of it.J That the issue would be favour-

made by this admirable philosopher, which formed the foundation of all

modern chemistry, and which he was now pursuing with his usual ardour

and ability, added much to the entertainment and instruction of the com

   (140.) It is much to be lamented that a man of Dr. Frank

lin's general good character and great influence should have
been an unbeliever in Christianity, and also have done so much

as he did to make others unbelievers.f To me, however, he

acknowledgedJ that he had not given so much attention as he
ought to have done to the evidences of Christianity, and de
sired me to recommend to him a few treatises on the subject,

such as I thought most deserving of his notice, but not of

great length, promising to read them, and give me his senti

Iments on them. Accordingly, recommended to him Hart

ley's evidences of Christianity in his " Observations on Man,"§

                  the faithful

that calm fortitude which characterized him through life. No repining, no

peevish expressions ever escaped him, during a confinement of two years,

in which, I believe, if every moment of ease could be added together, the

sum would not amount to two whole months. When the pain was not too

violent to be amused, he employed himself with his books, his pen, or in

conversation with his friend ; and upon every occasion displayed the clear

ness of his intellects, and the cheerfulness of his temper. Even when the

intervals from pain were so short that his words were frequently interrupted,
I
   h"aveI  known him hold a discourse in a sublime strain of piety.
                                                                                    last  summer.
           Inever shall forget one day that passed with our friend
I found him in bed in great agony, but when that agony abated a little, I
asked if I should read to him. He said, Yes ; and the first book I met with
was Johnson's Lives of the Poets. I read the life of Watts, who was a

favourite author with Dr. F. ; and, instead of lulling him to sleep, it roused

him to a display of the powers of his memory aud his reason. He repeated

several of Watts's Lyric Poems, and descanted upon their sublimity in a
strain worthy of them and of their pious author. It is natural for us to

wish that an attention to some ceremonies had accompanied that religion of

the heart which I am convinced Dr. F. always possessed ; but let us who feci

the benefit of them continue to practise them, without thinking lightly of

that piety which could support pain without a murmur, and meet death

without terror." Ibid. XVI. p. 4. See Mem. of Price, pp. 146, 147.

written immediately on his landing in America, is very

striking.*

  I(141.) About three years before the dissolution of my con

nexion with Lord Shelburne, Dr. Fothergill, with whom had

always lived on terms of much intimacy,f having observed, as
he said, that many of my experiments had not been carried to

their proper extent on account of the expense that would have
attended them, proposed to me a subscription from himself and

some of his friends, to supply me with whatever sums I should

want for that purpose, and named a hundred pounds per an
num. This large subscription I declined, lest the discovery of
it (by the use that I should, of course, make of

Constable, and Sir George SavileJ

with the loss of one half of my income,§ Dr. Fothergill pro

plied me with every instrument that I wanted in glass, parti

 his benefactions in this way would have amounted to a con
 siderable sum. Mr. Wedgwood also, besides his annual bene

faction, supplied me with every thing that I wanted made of

zeal in every good cause can hardly be exceeded. My obliga

of the heads of the congregation made me a present of two

hundred pounds to assist me in my theological publications.

   (149.) Mr. Lee shewed himself particularly my friend, at the

time that I left Lord Shelburne, assisting me in the difficulties
Iwith which was then pressed, and continuing to befriend me

afterwards by seasonable benefactions. By him it was hinted to
me during the administration of Lord Rockingham, with whom

he had great influence, that I might have a pension from the

government to assist in defraying the expense of my experi

beginning of Mr. Pitt's administration, by a bishop, in whose
power it was to have procured it from him. But in both cases

I declined the overture, wishing to preserve myself independent

the friendship of the latter has added much to the happiness of

my situation here [Birmingham]. Seldom, if ever, have I

known two persons of such cultivated minds, pleasing man

latter had the greatest attachment imaginable to my wife.

to my experiments, and moreover proposed to take one of my

avoid, or to estimate so that without so much as keeping

218 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   In the preceding pages of his narrative, Dr. Priestley
has occasionally anticipated circumstances which oc
curred during his residence at Birmingham. The fol
lowing correspondence, while illustrating his Memoirs,
will bring to frequent recollection those events, of mighty,
and still extending influence, which had previously en

gaged his earnest solicitude. It will also describe the

variety of his pursuits, his favourite associations, and
the progress of his inquiries, from the commencement
to the termination of his liberal connexion with the

Earl of Shelburne. That nobleman may, perhaps, be

not unjustly regarded as having, at length, yielded to
an aspiring statesman's policy, when he declined the
disparaging society of an unworldly, though an emi

nently enlightened, philosopher. This, however, at "a

day too late," Lord Shelburne again discovered that he

could duly appreciate.*

I am become negligent of your correspondence ; but the busi

Since the publication of my papers, have read two treatises,
                         I

written by Dr. Alexander, of Edinburgh, and am exceedingly

pleased with the spirit of philosophical inquiry which they dis

cover. They appear to me to contain many new, curious, and

valuable observations; but one of the conclusions which he

draws from his experiments am satisfied, from my own ob

cellent treatise on the diseases of the army. On this account,

I have thought it not improper to address to you the following

observations and experiments, which I think clearly demon
strate the fallacy of Dr. Alexander's reasoning, indisputably

establish your doctrine, and indeed justify the apprehensions
of all mankind in this case.

  I think it probable enough that putrid matter, as Dr. Alex

ander has endeavoured to prove, will preserve other substances
from putrefaction; because, being already saturated with the

putrid effluvium, they cannot readily take any more ; but Dr.
Alexander was not aware that air that is loaded with putrid

effluvium is exceedingly noxious when taken into the lungs.

I have lately, however, had an opportunity of fully ascertain

ing how very noxious such air is.
   Happening to use at Calne a much larger trough of water

for the purpose of my experiments than I had done at Leeds,

and not having fresh water so near at hand as I had there, I

neglected to change it till it turned black, and became offen

sive, but by no means to such a degree as to deter me from

making use of it. In this state of the water I observed bubbles

of air to rise from

                     and especially in one place, to which

some shelves that had in directed them, and having set an in

verted glass vessel to catch them, in few days collected con
siderable quantity of this air, which issued spontaneously from

the putrid water, and putting nitrous air to                                                 found that no

change of colour or diminution ensued, so that must have

been in the highest degree noxious.  repeated the same ex

periment several times afterwards, and always with the same

result.

   After this, had the curiosity to try how wholesome air
would be affected by agitation in this water; when to my real
         I

not burn in it; and after three or four minutes, was in the

same state with the air which had issued spontaneously from

the same water.

to this property of water.

   In consequence of using the rain-water and the well-water

Iabove-mentioned, was very near concluding, contrary to what
I have asserted in my printed papers, that common air sutlers
Ia decomposition by rarefaction ; for when had collected a

considerable quantity of air which had been rarefied about 400

times by an excellent pump made for me by Mr. Smeaton,* I
always found that, when I filled my receivers with the water

above-mentioned, though I did it so gradually as to occasion as
little agitation as possible, a candle would not burn in the air

Ithat remained in them. But when used distilled water, or

fresh spring water, I undeceived myself.

first, you have given to my experiments^

There will be much more room for censure there than in the
former part ; but I hope soon to have your freest sentiments

about it.

    Dr. Kippis has undertaken to review the Repository, and
thinks it will gratify the public and facilitate the revival of

the work if the principal writers will allow him to give their
names.* I hope that you who are the principal writer will

not refuse yours. Your pieces are unquestionably the most

valuable in the whole work, and cannot but do you great

credit.

   My Discourse on giving the Lord's Supper to Children, is
now published.f I shall send you a copy by my wife, who
will be with me on Monday next, and after staying about a

week, will go to Leeds, whither I should be very happy to

accompany her, but I am afraid it will not be possible. Nothing

would give me more pleasure than to see you once more, just

as I used to do.

  I have been of late more fortunate than. ever in my philoso

have done about air in a separate volume immediately4

Dear Sir,                                              London, March 25, 1774.

  I am much obliged for your friendly concern on account of
my late bad state of health. I thank God I have been for
Isome time perfectly recovered, and think have better health

Ithan ever had in my life. My situation is, in all respects,

perfectly agreeable to me, except that I cannot be so much
with my family as I could wish.

  If you would allow me to advise you with respect to a
Itelescope, would recommend an achromatic one, rather than

a reflector. They are not dearer, and magnify as much, in

proportion to the length. I fancy you would like best one

that Mr. Dolland sells for eleven guineas. It magnifies fifty
Iftimes for land objects, and eighty for the celestial.
                                                                                     you
Ichoose this kind and size, will let you have one that Mr.

Dolland let me have, as the best he could make, and I can take

an opportunity to provide myself with another.

Dear Sir,                                    Calne, May 31, 1774.
IOn Saturday the 22nd sent from hence my achromatic

telescope. You will find two eye-pieces ; a short one, which

inverts objects, and magnifies eighty times; and a longer,
which magnifies fifty times. The former, therefore, is more

proper for celestial objects, and the latter for terrestrial.

  If you be viewing a small and very luminous object, as

Venus, or a fixed star, it will be necessary to have a much

smaller aperture than the diameter of the object glass. An

opening of the diameter of an inch is quite sufficient. For this
Ipurpose made a paste-board cap, to slip on to the end of the
Itelescope, over which had pasted another paper, with such a
hole in it. If I had not lost

  I believe you will find the telescope a very good one. Mr.

Walker, the Lecturer in Experimental Philosophy,* and

myself, compared it with a reflector of his own of the same

length, and which cost more, and he acknowledged mine was

much better, and he had boasted of his very much, as a very

good one of its kind ; and this has the advantage of being much

lighter, and more manageable. The screw near the eye-glass
serves to adjust the instrument to the eye, and the distance of

objects. It is now a good deal out of its place, in order to

make the telescope go into the box.                                                                                         I it,  to be

               To Rev. T. Lindsey.

    Dear Sir,                               Calne, June 4, 1774.
I have long owed Mr. Honeyman* a letter, and to-morrow
I think to write to him, and join with you in dissuading him

from his strange purpose.

  I see no impropriety in your acknowledging Mr. Rotheram's

benefaction,f as he did not wish to conceal it from you.
I have received great pleasure from your last, especially the
Icopy of Mr. B. Turner's letter.J
                                            doubt not of your meeting

with sufficient encouragement, and that the number of your
Iconstant hearers and subscribers will increase.

to be informed of the amount of the annual subscriptions. I

would, by all means, push the scheme of building, or some
thing equivalent. You will run no risk by any moderate un

dertaking of that kind.

Mr. Johnson mentions to me his wish that you would pub

lish your Sermon on the Lord's Supper, but that you have not
Iyet consented to do it.§
                              wish you would take sufficient care

that your hearers be apprized of your sentiments on that sub

ject; but perhaps it may be advisable not to publish any thing
more, at least till the next winter, lest it should be construed

to a catching at every opportunity of publishing. But you are

the best judge yourself.

risons that I hear between his conduct and yours.* Your

conduct will greatly promote the cause of the petitioning
clergy ,f but I find will be of no service to the men and their
characters. Every body says that they ought, all of them, to
do as you have done ; and they really are not spoken of with

the compassion or esteem that they were before your resigna

not be your cordial friends.

principles on me, left me to my own judgment. At first I re

ceived these principles without hesitation, and soon became ac

quainted with the best arguments for them. I had no opportu

nity for a long time to converse with judicious men of contrary

Isentiments, so that easily vanquished those who contradicted me.

But yet my mind suggested many difficulties which I could not
solve. Hence I began to doubt. Imparting my doubts to some

Ifriends, was told there were mysteries in religion; that I

should take God's word for them, and pry no further. This

Isatisfied me for awhile, but not long ; for considered, let a

mystery be what it may, God would not deliver absurdities.

Again, it does not follow that all our Bible is divine because
some is. And if any part of our Bible contain absurdities,

&c, that part is not divine. 1 could not get books on any
Isubject.
            wanted instruction on predestination, remission of

sins, assistance of the spirit, eternity of hell torments, and

various other points. My friends could not satisfy me. At

length I surmounted these difficulties, wading through many
doubts, and little less than infidelity. I now believe that the

prophecies in our Bible were given by God ; that the Gospels

are true ; that whatever we believe should accord with the

speeches of Christ therein recorded. I believe the doctrine
Iof original sin to be absurd.
Iassists our apprehension.      believe the spirit of God only

                            believe the foreknowledge of God,

held by the Arminians, to be equal to the decree of God, held

by the Calvinists : that they are both wrong ; and the truth
                                   I

                                                           ;

Dear Mr. Petty,                         Lisle, August 26, 177 4.
IAs am sure your curiosity is not less than your brother's,
I shall endeavour to gratify it by resuming our journal where

your papa left off.

  I was very much struck with the appearance of Calais, as it
was the first fortified town I had ever seen ; being surrounded

with a deep ditch and strong walls, built in such a manner as

to make it very difficult to be taken by an enemy. St. Omers,
Aire, Bethune, and Lisle, which we have seen since, are all

fortified in the same manner ; and they have all spacious

market places, where the inhabitants may be assembled, and

where the soldiers can parade. All these towns are much bet

ter built than the generality of towns in England. In Lisle,

especially, the houses are curiously ornamented towards the
street with figures of heads, festoons, and other decorations.

The rooms in the inns which we have seen are exceedingly

large and lofty ; and the furniture, though it has, in some re
spects, the air of great magnificence, is in general ill made,

and not elegant ; most things being finished in a manner that

we should be ashamed of in England. Their fire-places are

much unlike ours, but pretty enough, and they are all made
for the burning of wood, as the country produces no coal.

    Having dined at Calais, we reached St. Omers, but not till
after it was dark ; by which means we were deprived of the
sight of a good part of the country, which has improved upon
us ever since we left Calais. In the neighbourhood of that

place we found the ground miserably neglected, and yielding
hardly any thing at all. We were particularly surprised to
find a great deal of hay in the fields, some just mowed, and a
field of oats quite green. But every thing wore a much better
aspect as we advanced farther into the country; and yesterday,
in which we travelled from St. Omers to Lisle, we saw every

where the finest cultivation possible, and the harvest nearly

got in. It seemed to be much superior to the generality of

English husbandry; but we have yet seen no inclosures, and

hardly any grass or meads, cows or sheep ; these being fed in

places where the soil is not so rich. At Bethune we were
amused as we went through the market with a sight of a num
ber of the slenderest and leanest pigs we had ever seen. They
might almost have been taken for greyhounds. The horses we

have seen are, in general, small, lean, and not at all handsome ;

but, notwithstanding, very active, and do their business very

well. You would have smiled if you had been with us this
morning, and seen, as I did, dogs drawing little carts with very

considerable loads, and men drawing sedan chairs mounted on

wheels. By this means, however, people are very well carried,
and one man does the work of two with us.

   All the way we have come, we were surprised at the prodi

gious quantity of tall, fine beans, which are all standing, and-
especially with the plantations of tobacco and poppies, which
are not cultivated in England. The tobacco was very green,
and looked exceedingly beautiful ; the poppies were all reaped
and formed into sheaves or ricks. We could not imagine of
what use so much poppy seed could be, but upon inquiry we
were informed that they get a great deal of oil from them, and
that the many windmills we saw in that neighbourhood were
all employed to press that oil, which is used for lamps.

   Though you are not a man of gallantry, yet, as you are an

Iobserver of human nature, must tell you what has struck me

most relating to the women we have seen. Many of them,
even those who are well dressed, walk the streets in slippers,
without any thing to cover the heel; so that, except the toe,
the whole foot is seen as they walk, which to me, who never
saw the like before, looked slatternly and indelicate. Almost

all the women are dressed in what we call a French night-cap,
which almost covers their cheeks; and we saw a great number
of country women going to and from the market of Bethune,
many of them in carts, with their heads dressed particularly
neat ; but not one of them had any hat to screen them from

the sun or rain ; nor have we seen one woman with a hat on

since we left England. By this means they soon get sun
burned and look ugly, while the men wear very large hats and
save their faces. Instead of cloaks, the women of all ranks
have a square piece of cloth or stuff which they throw over
their shoulders or their heads at pleasure ; and sometimes it is
so large as to reach almost to their feet. Betwixt Lisle and
 Ghent, which we reached on Saturday, the country women
 were provided with straw bonnets, which, though not very

elegant, must be very convenient. All the better sort of peo

 ple, men as well as women, when they walk out in the sun or
 the rain, hold an umbrella in their hands, and sometimes one

 of them will serve for two persons. A number of these um

 brellas have a very pretty appearance in a street, especially as
 they are of different colours, and the fashion of them is elegant ;
 but they would by no means do in the streets of London, or

 any crowded place; for they necessarily take up a good deal

 of room.
    At Lisle, you, as having a military turn, would have received

 great pleasure from what was not only irksome, but a cause of
 a good deal of pain to me. This was the review of a regiment

 of French soldiers in compliment to your papa. They did not
 fire, but they performed a variety of new and very useful evo
 lutions lately introduced by the King of Prussia. The pain

 Ithat felt on the occasion did not arise from any consideration

 of the mischief that this new discipline might enable the

at the time, which affected my teeth very much.

    Being suddenly called to close my letter by an opportunity

that just offers of sending it to England, I can only conclude

with assuring you that this journal shall be continued, and that

I shall think myself very happy if it contributes to your

amusement.

sincerely.

                                                             Amsterdam, Sep. 6, 1774.

      My dear Lord Fitzmaurice,
   Your brother will, I hope, before this time, have commu
nicated to you the account I sent him of our travels as far as
Lisle, and it is with great pleasure that I now sit down to send

you an account of our progress from thence to Amsterdam,
where we now are, and where we propose to stay a few days.

   We left Lisle on Saturday, the 27th of August, and passing
through Menin and Courtray, both fortified towns, arrived at
Ghent before dinner, and from thence we set out the next day
and arrived at Brussels before night. There we waited upon
the Duke D'Aremberg and dined with him in town the next
day, and the day following in the country, at Engyen, about
fifteen miles from Brussels.

   On Thursday, the first of September, we left Brussels, and
passing through Mechlin, got to Antwerp before dinner ; and
setting out from thence early the next morning, we arrived,
after a very fatiguing journey, at Rotterdam, but in the dark.

   The whole of Austrian Flanders is highly cultivated and
populous. The farm-houses seemed to be substantially good,
and the poorest people we met, tolerably well clothed. Indeed,
we have not yet seen any people so exceedingly shabby and

wretched as the poor of Calne. It is something remarkable,

however, that in this country the boys that beg on the way
side have the very same ridiculous custom of tumbling and

standing on their heads that you will see at Studley, and which

I have also seen in one part of Yorkshire. But here we once

saw a girl standing on her head for this purpose. You may be
assured that we did not encourage so much idleness and inde
cency by giving them any thing, though the custom could not
have been established, if others had not been diverted with it

and countenanced it.

   This country has formerly produced very excellent painters,
especially the celebrated Rubens; and though (which is very
remarkable) they can boast of no painters at present, the rich

and curious give immense sums for pictures to furnish their
cabinets, and some make a gainful traffic of buying to sell

again. A curious character of this kind we met with at Ghent,
who took no little pains, and used a good deal of address, to
take in your papa. We got a sight of his pictures over night,

and as he was very importunate, partly promised to see him
again the next morning. However, as we were walking in the
church, the next morning, which was Sunday, we happened to

pass by a confessional chair where he was confessing an old

woman ; and the moment he cast his eyes upon us, he gave us
an intimation that he would be with us immediately; and so
despatching his penitent with a most indecent hurry, he pre

sently joined us. It was then impossible to avoid going to his

house, from whence we returned, truly pleased with many of
his pictures; more with so curious a character ; and most of all

 that we saw through his artifice, and did not contribute to gra

 tify his covetousness at our expense.
    Another adventure of this kind we had at Antwerp. One

of these trafficking connoisseurs shewed us a picture as an
 original of Rubens, and asked a prodigious great price for it.
 Our guide, who, no doubt, was in league with him, avouched
 it ; but going immediately from thence to the house of a rich
 and whimsical canon, we saw the real original of the very
same picture, the same guide conducting us. This canon also

 was a much greater curiosity himself than any thing he had to

shew. He had no real knowledge of any thing he had got, but
had a valet who shewed them ; and we were told, that some

times when such questions were asked, as he could not answer

himself, he would send for his maid. Indeed, his valet made

so very free, both with his master and us, as made any thing
of this kind very credible. This canon was very eager to hear

every thing about him admired, but affected to make a great
secret of every thing, and, in the bluntest and rudest manner,
said no to almost every question your papa asked him about

the management of his flowers, &c ; and though we particu

larly admired some fine peaches that he had got, he would not
understand the hint so far as to desire our acceptance of one ;
and had we directly asked him for one, as your papa, for curi

Iosity, had once thought of doing, doubt not he would have

again said no ; which was a monosyllable that seemed to be

very familiar to him. Two such characters as those of these

canons can hardly be found except in such a seclusion from
the world, and such an independence on others, as is peculiar

to the Romish clergy.

  From Alost to Brussels we saw many hops, and, I think,

finer than any wc had seen as we travelled through Kent.
The beer of this country is by no means so good as in England.

   The country we are now in is in many respects different
from that of Flanders, but my paper admonishes me to con
clude, and write a continuation at another opportunity.

dear Lord, your affectionate, humble servant.
   P. S. Your papa is very well, and sends his love to your

brother.

We took our leave of Flanders on Friday, the 2nd of Sep

tember, and crossing an arm of the sea at Mardyke, arrived at

Rotterdam after it was dark ; the lights in the town having a

very agreeable effect across the water, over which we passed to

come to it.

Holland seems to be surrounded either by the sea, or an

absolute desert. Such, however, is the boundary, that we

passed on the side of Flanders, and also on the side of Ger

many, and, on both these sides, are as unpassable as sand can

make them. We had on this account most tiresome travelling,

both into this country and out of it.
   We spent the morning of Saturday the 3rd, in walking about

Rotterdam, and seeing what was most worth seeing in it; and after

dinner we went in the Trackschuyt by Delft, (where we stopped
to see a magnificent tomb of the Prince of Orange,) to Leyden.

The next morning we saw the physic garden in this place ;

then went by Woder to Haarlem, where we heard the famous
organ, during the time of divine service, and went in two small

carriages by land to Alcmaer, where we arrived just at dark.

In this journey we skirted that part of Holland which is occu
pied by sand-hills, along the coast of the German Ocean. This

tract of hilly ground seems to be of no use but to keep off the

sea. In one place we saw there had been an attempt to sow a

little barley in but the produce had not been worth reaping.

On Monday we set out in an awkward kind of carriage that

held four persons, and dining at Purmeren, and stopping to see
the village of Brook, we got to Amsterdam before night. We

had intended to have seen the famous dykes that keep off the

sea, and also Saardam, where most of the Dutch ships are
built; but we were disappointed by our guides, who after

having pocketed the money for that tour, took us another and

a shorter way and had our lives depended upon                                              instead of

the gratifying of our curiosity, almost think those Dutchmen

would have done just the same thing, and with the same cool

ness and self-applause. But, for the honour of human nature,

am willing to think we should not have been served so in any

other country.

Though          probable that the commerce and power of this

                R

244 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

country is upon the decline, the harbour of Amsterdam is
really a most astonishing sight. Such a number 6f ships is, I
believe, no where else to be found in one placed The Town
House also quite astonished me, both for the expense and
magnificence of that part of it which is always open to every
body, (being all cased with marble, disposed in excellent taste
and exquisite workmanship,) and for the noble suite and fur
niture of the rooms adapted to all kinds of public business.

   We were also much pleased with the rope-house and stow-
house of the East India Company ; but, excepting these, and a
few good pictures, which we saw at Mr. Hope's, with whom
we dined on Wednesday, we saw nothing worth particular
notice in this place, which, upon the whole, is a very disagree
able one. We therefore left it on Thursday, which was sooner
than we had intended, and came by water to Utretcht in the
dark. There we joined the cook, who had been sent thither

from Rotterdam with the coach.

   In this passage we were much amused with the view of the

Dutch country houses, with which this canal, (as also that
which led from Delft to Leyden,) was lined. Some of them
were old-fashioned, dark, and gloomy retreats, suitable enough,
in my opinion, for those who had amassed a fortune in such a
manner as is generally ascribed tor this industrious, but selfish
people. But in others there was real elegance and good taste,
with a general unformity, (especially in long straight vistas of

trees, some covered and some open, and all most exactly cut
and trimmed,) amidst a very great and whimsical variety. Some

of them must have been exceedingly expensive, and equal to
those of very rich country gentlemen in England.

   On Friday we left Utrecht, intending to have reached Nime-
guen before night; but we found the roads so intolerably
heavy, that we were obliged to lodge at a small place called
Grip; so we dined at Nimeguen the next day, and got to
Cleef, in the King of Prussia's dominions, that night; taking
leave, to our great satisfaction, of the country and people of
Holland.

   Altogether, however, it must be allowed that Holland is a

great curiosity, and well worth the transient visit of a states

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  245

 man, or a philosopher, though it is certainly the last in which
 a man of a liberal turn of mind would choose to live.

    The people here are so much occupied with commerce, that
 agriculture is no object of attention with them. We hardly
 saw a single field of corn in Holland, all the ground being em
 ployed in pasture. But though the cattle do not look ill, the
 horses are not capable of much service, and the flesh of their
oxen and sheep is of a loose texture, and without flavour.

This is owing, I suppose to the marshiness of their meadows,

and the very bad water they are obliged to drink. Indeed, the
whole country of Holland does not afford any water that a

man can well drink. This circumstance, at least, furnishes

them with an excuse for drinking wine and spirituous liquors
in great quantities, and also for smoking tobacco, with which

they almost poison every body that comes near them. Indeed,

I can hardly express how very low, beastly, and sordid, the

manners of the common people in this country are. It is a

thing very different from the roughness and brutality of some

of the low-bred people of England. In Germany or France,
as far as I can observe, neither of those characters, which are

the disgrace of human nature, exists.
    Upon the whole, we were much disgusted with the people of

Holland, and their manners ; and were glad to get into the
more open air, and more natural and agreeable manners of

Germany.

                               The Journal continued.

    On leaving Holland we felt ourselves elevated, as if we were

 emerging from a low and heavy atmosphere into a superior
 region, where we fancied that we breathed more freely than
 before ; and yet the entrance into Germany, after passing
 Nimeguen, was not very promising, being nothing but heath

or wood. The woods, however, began to be very pleasant,
especially when the inequality of the ground gave us tolerable

prospects.
    On the evening of Saturday, 10th of September, we arrived

at Cleef, and lodged in the park, near the medicinal springs.
This is a delightful spot, and from a hill that overhangs the

246 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

inn we had a most extensive prospect into Germany. At this

place we were much entertained with two young Dutchmen,
but who, we were informed, were notorious sharpers. They
seemed to have some design upon us, but on hearing Lord
Shelburne's name, they were visibly embarrassed, and desisted

from making any attempt upon us.
   The next morning we went through Cleef, and in this coun

try we met a procession of several hundred people walking to
the town. We just stopped at San ton to see a curious old
church, full of images, and dining at Hoogstraten, we got by
dark to Dusseldorff, crossing the Rhine in a pont volant just
at the town. The roads were very wet and bad.

   In the morning we went to see the pictures at the Elector
Palatine's palace. Some of them were exquisite, especially a

Madona, by Guido. On the road we saw an elegant palace
belonging to the elector ; and dining at a little inn, on the pro
visions we carried with us, we arrived at Cologn before it was
dark, passing the Rhine just at the city.

   In the morning we went too see several churches, but found
nothing very remarkable in any of them, besides a picture of
the crucifixion of St. Peter, by Rubens. The town is old,

ruinous, and disagreeable.

    Before dinner we got to Bonn, where we saw the electoral
palace, and dined with Mr. Cressner, the English Ambassador,

the most political character I ever met with, but a very agree
able man. Beyond Cologn I, for the first time, saw vineyards ;

but from that place to Paris we never lost sight of them long.
    On Wednesday we set out early, and got to Coblentz before

 three o'clock. The weather was exceedingly wet and unplea
 sant; otherwise we should have had most delightful travelling.

    With this inconvenience it was still singularly fine, and
 afforded views that were exceedingly striking. We had the
 Rhine to the left, with hills and rocks covered with vines or

 woods close to the vines intermixed with kidney beans and

 pumpkins. Sometimes the road was cut in rock almost

 perpendicular, the river being below us, and houses above us,
 with chapels neatly cut in the rock.

     Upon our arrival at Coblentz, we waited upon Baron Breid

                                                         a

bank, to settle the ceremonial of our visit to the elector, and

spent the evening at the inn.

Thursday, we crossed the river to see the citadel, from which,

being situated on a high and craggy rock, at the foot of which,

and close to the river, is the palace, we had a most glorious
prospect indeed, seeing the course of the Rhine, with all its

windings, to an immense distance, especially up the river ; the
junction of the Moselle with and fine level country beyond

    in which was palace of the elector. Being introduced at

court, we dined with the elector, pleasant looking young

man, but said to be great bigot. The Bishop of Hontheim,

very intelligent man, and one of the company, conducted us

to Carthusian monastery, pleasantly situated on the brow of                                        aa
hill near the city.

Friday, having crossed the Rhine, our road lay through

very hilly country, and exceedingly romantic Almost half

the day we travelled along the side of river, which washed
the foot of steep ridge of hills covered with wood, and the
              a
                                                     a

side on which we travelled was rising ground covered with

vines. The remainder of the day we travelled through forests

and open fields, and arrived at Schwallback just at dark.

In the afternoon of this day, Lord Shelburne and                                 I,having

walked before the carriage, lost ourselves, which threw me,                                   it

   Saturday, before we set out, we visited the famous spring of

Seltzer-water, near this place. The morning was foggy, but

presently cleared up; and when we had reached the top of

the hill, we had most glorious prospect as we travelled along
              it,
the ridge of        ahaving the Rhine under us, and an immense

tract of country beyond            in view, though frequently inter

rupted by the trees of the forest through which we passed.

We went little out of our way to see famous salt and hot

town, and has the air of much politeness. But we made no

stay in except to see few churches, and especially Car

thusian monastery,       little way on our road, out of the town,

the cloister of which was finely painted, and arrived at Worms
just as it began to be dark.

    Sunday, we saw the cathedral, which had been ruined by
the French, the Lutheran church, and the town hall, where
Luther was examined, now a small garden, and got to Man-
heim, crossing the Rhine before dinner. Lord Shelburne went

to court, escorted by Mr. Dun, while I spent the day at the
inn, and hearing a sermon in High Dutch at the Jesuits'

church.

    Monday, we visited the palace, which is very large and mag
nificent. We also went to see a collection of models of antique

statues, a porcelain warehouse, &c, and reached Landau after
the gates were shut, in consequence of Lord Shelburne and I

having lost ourselves, and rambled many miles, the carriage

having passed us.
    Tuesday, we set out early in the morning, and travelling

through the rich country of Alsace, got to Strasburgh before
night, and time enough to go to the play that evening.

    Wednesday, we called upon Professor Spielman, then went
to see the bishop's palace and the cathedral, going up the
spire, which is said to be the highest in the world, but did not
go quite to the top. After dinner we saw the town library,

 the instruments belonging to the university, and an ingenious
electrician called Krafts.

    The cultivation of all the tract of country through which
 we travelled along the Rhine is excellent, especially about
Manheim, and in Alsace it is most excellent, resembling a rich
garden. This look is much favoured by the variety of crops,
 and the divisions of fields, being often distinguished by rows of
vines. All our varieties of corn, turkey wheat, canary seed,

 hemp, pumpkins, kidney beans, vines, turnips, potatoes,
 tobacco, and many other things, all intermixed in long and
 narrow fields, makes a new and curious spectacle to an En
 glishman. The roads, and also many of the fields, are planted
 with fruit trees, especially the walnut trees, the fruit of which

 is used for making oil.
    The soil of this country, and especially of Alsace, is so light

that they generally plough with one horse, or cow, which they
always yoke by the horns, which was the custom every where
in our travels, except in Lorraine, where we saw some oxen
yoked as with us. In Lorraine we frequently saw them plough
ing with eight horses, and women either holding the plough or

driving it. The wheat of Alsace is celebrated. At Strasburgh

Iwe had bread of the most exquisitely fine flavour ever tasted ;

and at Nancy we were told that they cannot make such in

France.

  IThursday the 22nd, rambled into several Lutheran churches,

where the ministers were catechising the children and young
persons, and among others a class of young women about twenty
years of age. After breakfast we left Strasburgh, and dining
at Severne, where we saw a magnificent palace of the Arch
bishop of Strasburgh, we got to Sarreburg before night. From
the hills which divide Lorraine from Alsace, we had a noble

prospect of all the country to and beyond the Rhine.
   Friday, we dined at Luneville, where we saw a curious

manufacture of terre cuite, and the palace of King Stanislaus,

and then reached Nancy before night.

   A good deal of the first part of Lorraine is planted with pear-

trees, scattered through the fields. The fruit they dry and

preserve.
   Saturday, went to see Mr. Grenville, about a mile out of

town, in a delightful country. We spent the rest of the day
in seeing the churches, the square, and the governor's house of
this excellent city. In the evening Mr. Grenville brought in

the English newspapers.
   Sunday, we dined at Metz, after passing a delightful road,

with vines on both sides, the valleys well watered and full of
cattle. These were the only pastures we saw in all our tour,
except in Holland.

   Monday, we were detained for want of post horses till after

twelve, and spent our time in seeing the churches, the prome
nade, the arsenal, and a machine for sawing timber. We

lodged at Verdun.

    Tuesday, we set out early and got to Chalons, where we

house, and the promenade.

many that know in England, especially in the middle ranks
of life, where there is, perhaps, more real politeness, as well asis
more virtue, than in the highest rank of society.*

   In general, as far as can judge, the French are too much
taken up with themselves to admit of that minute and benevo
lent attention to others which essential to politeness. This

appears in nothing more than their continually interrupting
one another in discourse, which they do without the least
apology so that one half of the persons in company are heard

gracefulness of motion and address, as far as pretend to
judge, the English are by no means behind the French with

respect to it.

ingenious mechanic arts, the French appear to me to be far

behind the English, and in nothing could I imagine them

superior to the English, or to have any advantage of us with
respect to the commodious enjoyment of life, except in the
arrangement of the parts of a house, which, however, is of late
date with them, and which we consult taste in externals too

much to have attended to.

    Notwithstanding the French know more of other countries
than they used to do, (for before the last war they thought all
foreign nations unworthy of their notice,) they still have that
conceit of themselves, and that contempt of other people, which
are the truest marks of barbarism.

   The French being debarred from the discussion of politics,

by an arbitrary and consequently a jealous government, give

very much into a taste for theatrical entertainments ; and they
seem to have them in greater perfection than with us. But
though, for the same reason, many of them apply to literary and

philosophical pursuits, they have not attained a decided supe
riority over other nations in these respects. They shew, how
ever, a spirit and a liberality in these noble studies at which

the English ought to blush.

   I was made very unhappy by a report in the papers, of your
having broke your leg, till I was relieved by another, which
said there was no foundation for the report. I was exceed

ingly distressed to be so far from you in such a situation ; but

I hope God will preserve your health and strength for the

greatest purposes.

   We receive the English papers here very irregularly, so that

we have sometimes been a fortnight behind hand, which, in

the present very critical state of American affairs, is the source
Iof great anxiety to me.

what you know at this moment. Perhaps you know the issue
of the congress,* and of the troubles which seemed to be begin

fning to break out at Boston.

People here triumph in our dissensions, and think the breach

with the colonies is irreparable; but the system of the present
ministers is certainly pacific, though that of Spain may be

otherwise.

  I have here had opportunity of seeing many of the men

who have the chief lead in the direction of affairs, which

Igives me some pleasure, as shall have a better idea of them
when I read of them in the papers. They are a set of philo

sophical men, whose object is freedom of commerce, and uni

versal peace. But there is another set out of the ministry,
whose object is the very reverse. At present, however, it is

not thought that they have any chance of getting the upper

hand; and there are every where such luxury and dissipation,

as must make a state of war very irksome, even to the officers.

In other respects, if the present ministry continues in power

for a few years, this country will be in excellent order for

commencing a war ; for they are bent upon economy, and im
proving the riches and strength of the nation.

here, and long exceedingly to be about my experiments, or

Isome composition. Upon my journey have read and studied

the Gospels very much, and should like exceedingly to print

the Greek text, in the order of a harmony, with my disserta

tions from the Repository prefixed.* It would certainly add

much to the satisfaction of reading the Life of Christ, to have

the whole narrative in one continued story, and the variations
Iin separate columns.
                                          will, at least, cut to pieces, and put

I Itogether, one copy for my own use.f In reading over the gos

pel of John, think perceive that one of his principal objects

was to shew what opportunities the Jews had for knowing the
divine mission of Christ, and consequently how inexcusable

they were in their rejection of him; and the supposition of

this gospel being written after the destruction of Jerusalem,

Isuggests a reason for his having such an object in view.
   The more attention give to the study of the Scriptures, the

I Imore attached am to it ; and hope the time will come when
II shall apply myself to it chiefly. At present read chiefly

with a practical view ; and the attentive consideration of the

facts in the gospel history has certainly the strongest tendency

to impress the heart and influence the life in the most favour

able manner. The more I read the history of the death of

IChrist, in particular, the more reasons think I see why he
Iwas to suffer ; at least see the old ones in a stronger light, and

feel more of their force. Other studies, and other pursuits,

that to many others are very proper and useful, appear to me

to be altogether insignificant compared to these.

  I am here in the midst of unbelievers, and even Atheists.
I had a long conversation with one, an ingenious man, and

good writer, who maintained seriously that man might arise,

without any Maker, from the earth. They may despise me ;

I Iam sure despise and pity them.+

To Rev. William Graham.*

  I was very much pleased with almost every place I saw,
Iexcept Holland, which could not endure ; and we visited

almost every corner of it.f The country, however, is a great

Icuriosity, and well worth seeing for once ; but thought it the
Ilast place where should choose to live.

   I was greatly surprised to find the cultivation of Flanders

superior to that of England, and that of Alsace superior even

to Flanders. Even in what we saw of France, from Strasburg

to Paris, we saw no waste lands, like our commons ; and what

struck me very much, (except in Holland, where they do not

plough at all, and a little of Lorraine,) I saw no grass lands, or

meadows.

  I was more shocked at the superstition of the Catholics than
I expected to have been ; but found some of their priests very in

telligent and candid, and some of them as truly Christian charac

Iters, in all respects, as any sort can boast ; but these, believe,
Iare few. The generality, have reason to think, from the in
Iquiries have made, are either very stupid, or infidels. Their

philosophers are almost universally the latter.

  I had a conversation of two hours with a most ingenious

man, and a considerable writer, who maintained that man

might have sprung out of the earth by spontaneous genera

I Ition ;J and was told by another, that was the first believer

in Christianity that he had met with of whose understanding
Ihe had any opinion.§
                       always told them very freely that I

could easily acount for their infidelity by the very corrupted
state of their established religion, farther than which they

plainly had not looked, and that they could not pretend to

have studied the subject as myself and other believers in

England had done. However, I left them all as I had

found them ; and whether they think better or worse of me

on that account, I am very indifferent. They could not pos-

  I saw a good deal of several of the present leading statesmen

of France. They are, in general, philosophical people, very
honest and economical, friends of commerce and of peace.
The king on all hands, agreed to have nothing at all in him,
and while he in good hands, all will do well.* But there are
many persons disaffected, intriguing, lovers of war, and violent

enemies of England. If these get into power, which far from

being impossible, we shall certainly have war, and the eco
nomy of the present ministers will have brought the nation into
excellent order for it.

   The present French ministry are great friends of toleration.

A person who very much in their confidence told me, he

hoped that in ten years all religions would have full tolera
tion in France; but that, am convinced, will be pushing
things too fast for that country. At present they are miserably
hampered by the censeurs of the press. The person who has

translated my Treatise on Air could not obtain leave to insert

                   From Rev. A. M. Toplady.f

Ret. Sir,                                       Broad-Hcmbury, Dec. 20, 1774.

Condescend to accept the thanks of a person who has not

the honour of being acquainted with you, for the pleasure and

· Communicated by Rev. W. Graham to Rev. W. Turner, from whose

letter to Rev. N. Cappe, dated "Wakefield, May 22, 1775," it has been

"here copied verbatim. Mr. Turner adds,

       Mr. Lee told me that the French translation of the Doctor's Observa
tions on Air is ill done, insomuch that the philosophers at Paris could not

understand many things, or verify many of the experiments. Therefore,

"the Doctor was desired to exhibit several of them.

      For this end a meeting was appointed at Monsieur Turgot's, who has an

excellent apparatus. Many eminent persons attended ; among others, three

archbishops. This distinguished assembly was much surprised, satisfied and

delighted with many things the Doctor exhibited, particularly with the won-

"ful appearance on the mixture of nitrous with common air.

      At their first arrival, Lord Shelburne carried the Doctor to public

spectacles, and the assemblies and routs of the great ; but these things were

very insipid and irksome to him. He, therefore, desired to he excused.

Thenceforward, he spent his evenings with parties of literary and philosophi

                                                                   friend was highly   caressed and ho

noured there, and at the 6ame time reflected no little honour on his patron,

as being in his suite. Monsieur Luc, the German philosopher, who is now

in England, very intimate with the Doctor, and sees all his experiments,

is making a new translation of the Observations, &c, under the Doctor's

inspection." Orig. MS. On De Luc, see W. III. v, 21 1--215.

   Mr. Turner has omitted the date of the letter to Mr. Graham ; but it was,

probably, written soon after Dr. Priestley's return to England.

"has been partly attributed to excessive mental application, was a learned

and most zealous Calvinist, and too often a fierce polemic," assailing

(though not always unassailed) Wesley, Sellon, and other Arminian clergy,

with all the rancour and scurrility of South. (See M. R. V. 638, 639.)

improvement recently received from a perusal of your spirited
(and for the most part just) animadversions on the three
Northern Doctors. Allow me also to thank, in an especial
manner, the good providence of God, which has raised up no
less a man than yourself to contend so ably for the great doc
trine of necessity ; a doctrine, in my idea, not only essential to

Isound and rational philosophy, but, abstracted from which,

could not, for my own part, consider Christianity itself as a

if filled, would hold about 200 people,) where auctions (particularly for

books) used to be held. He seems to be a man of much personal modesty

and diffidence, and, I verily believe, acts upon principle ; but he has no

popular talents. He must unavoidably soon sink into obscurity, when the

novelty of his secession begins to subside, and when his Arian friends are

weary of puffing him off in the newspapers. He is no more qualified to

tification, you have occasionally fired some random shot on a

very numerous set of men, who, so far as concerns the article
of necessity, are your actual friends and your natural allies.

Permit me, therefore, Sir, to offer you in this private manner

a few plain, but not intentionally disrespectful, strictures on

some rash and exceptionable passages ; which serve as foils to

render your penetration and candour on some other occasions

the more conspicuous.

  I shall confine myself to your Introduction.*

   1. Are you certain that " the common Arminian doctrine of
free-will" is founded on scripture, and pre-supposed by " the

philosophical doctrine of necessity"                 ? Is  mitennothavveerynpotos"sibtlhee,
and often actually matter of fact,                   that

power of doing what they please or will" to do ? The trium

Ivirate of doctors, (for instance,) are, doubt not, very willing

to beat you off from their intrenchments, and to give you a

total defeat ; but I am much mistaken if they have " the power

of doing" it.
  2. Why are " the notions of Calvin" represented as "gloomy"?f

Is it gloomy to believe that the far greater part of the human

Irace are made for endless happiness? There can, think,

be no reasonable doubt entertained concerning the salvation of
Ifevery young person.
                       (as some who have versed themselves

in this kind of speculations affirm) about one half of mankind

die in infancy; andif, as indubitable observation proves,
                       if,                                 t
                                                                                 a
                                       is
very considerable number of the remaining half die in early

childhood; and  as there                             the strongest reason to think,

many millions of those who live to maturer years, in every

successive generation, have their names in the book of life,

then what very small portion, comparatively, of the human
      ;

         if

                 a

                                                  1

This view of things, am persuaded, will, to an eye so philo

sophic as yours, at least open very cheerful vista through the

gloom,  not entirely turn the imaginary darkness into sun

shine for, with respect to the few reprobate, we may, and we

ought, to resign the disposal of them implicitly to the will of

that only King who can do no wrong, instead of summoning
the Almighty to take his trial at the tribunal of our own

speculations, and of setting up ourselves as the judges of

Deity.

  I3. must confess I see nothing wonderful, nor to be gazed

at, as a " strange phenomenon," in the coincidence of " philo

sophical necessity" with the Calvinistic theology and meta

physics. I should rather wonder if they did not coincide ;

since (according to the ideas formed by me, who live in a

Christian country, and believe the Christian revelation) they

mutually suppose and support each other : for what is Cal

vinism, but a scriptural expansion of the philosophic prin

ciple of necessity; or, if you please, a ramification of that
principle into its religious parts ? It is possible, indeed, for a

person to be a gross Necessitarian, or a Necessitarian at large,

without being fully a Calvinist (witness many of the ancient,
and some modern, philosophers) ; but it seems impossible to

me that any person can be fully a Calvinist without being a

Necessitarian.

Moreover, every Christian Necessitarian is, so far, a Calvin

ist. Have a care, therefore, Dr. Priestley, lest, having set your

foot in the Lemaine Lake, you plunge in, quantus quantus ; a

catastrophe which, for my own part, and for your own sake,

I Isincerely wish may come to pass, and of which do not

wholly despair.

                                                                                  by

                                                                                                             a
posing, that had the great and good Mr. Edwards " lived
little longer," he must " have been sensible that his philo

sophy was much more nearly allied to Socinianism than to

Calvinism." That deep and masterly reasoner would rather

have rejoiced at seeing so important branch of the Calvin

istic philosophy (viz. the doctrine of necessity) so warmly

adopted by Socinian divine.

Seriously, think you have admitted Trojan horse into

your gates, whose concealed force will probably, at the long
run, display the banner of John Calvin on your walls, and

master your capital, though at present garrisoned     the con
federate forces of Pelagius, Sozzo, and Van Harm in.

       MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.                                             261

5. Nor was it any " piece of artifice in Mr. Edwards to

represent the doctrine of philosophical necessity as being the

same thing with Calvinism, and the doctrine of philosophical

liberty as the same thing with Arminianism." This sugges

tion, Sir, (which, by the way, is more than a little ungenerous,

when we consider how upright and valuable a man Mr. Ed

wards, by all accounts, proved himself in every part of his

conduct,) seems to have been started merely as a salvo for

yourself. You are, on the article of necessity, the reverse of

an Arminian ; and you are terribly afraid of being dubbed a

Calvinist. I must own you are in some little danger. But

cheer up ; your case is not yet desperate. Poor Jansenius was

in a situation somewhat similar to yours. He indeed swam

farther into the Geneva lake than you have ventured to do ;

and, to elude the name of heretic, assured as many good peo

ple as would believe him, that he was all the while bathing in

the Tiber.

  So far as I can judge, Mr. Edwards gave the naked and ge
nuine sentiments of his heart to the public. And I am like

wise of opinion, that the fact stands, simply and literally, just

as he represents it. Arminianism, when stripped of its sophis

tical trappings, contends for such an absolute and inviolable

freedom, sv apQi^peiroi, as is independent in its exercise on

any thing but the will itself. Consequently the Arminian

scheme is no less incompatible with the religion of reason than

with the religion of the Bible; and directly contravenes the

whole current, both of natural and of revealed truth.
                   very unguarded assertion, that " the

modern question of liberty and necessity" what the Cal-
vinian divines " never understood, or, indeed, had so much as

heard of." The contrary evincible from their writings. The
question, so far from being purely "modern," has exercised

some of the ablest Protestant pens from the Reformation quite

down to the present day. It has been agitated, with no little

zeal, pro et contra, even among the Papists, long before, but

more frequently since, the Protestant ara. And                               was the

subject of no small debate among some of the heathen philoso

phers themselves.

262 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

    7.  " Mr.   Edwards," therefore, was not     the first  Calvinist
who     ever "  hit upon the true philosophical  doctrine   of neces

sity." A vast number of the greatest Reformed divines, both

foreign and English, touched the self-same key. And it is ex

tremely evident that Mr. Edwards himself received much

light from them into the subject, and even availed himself

very frequently of phrases, distinctions, and arguments, which

those grand luminaries bad, with success, made use of before

him.
   8. " Zealous Calvinists," you tell us, " regard your writings

with abhorrence." It would have been candid, Sir, to have

expressed this with more restriction, and with less vehemence.
Many very "

subjects, not
admiration. Dark and " gloomy" as you have represented us,

we still have sufficiency both of eye-sight and of day-light, to

discern the lustre of your genius, and the improvements which

your equally profound and refined researches have added to the

stock of philosophic knowledge.

  9. Nervous (and, as I think, irrefragable) as Mr. Edwards'

treatise is, you still are much too sanguine in asserting that the

" Calvinists boast" of it " as the strongest bulwark of their

own gloomy faith." We never boasted of it under any such

character. We have, in my apprehension, some hundreds of
" bulwarks," no less strong than this American one, whose
towers I concur with you in deservedly admiring. Exclusively
of which numerous " bulwarks," we have a citadel (the Bible)
Iagainst which no weapon can possibly prevail.
                                                            pass over

your favourite epithet *' gloomy," which you so repeatedly
prefix to Calvinistic " faith." When you have attended as

minutely to the philosophy of scripture vision as you have to
that of animal optics, you will perceive the district of Calvin

to be, not a Cimmerian region, but a very land of Goshen.

   10. You think proper, Sir, to suppose, that "zealous Cal

their wonder will mount to surprise. There are so many

weaknesses, contradictions, and inconsistencies, in philoso

phers, as well as in ordinary men, that few people, who know

"musuchrpriosfedt"heatwaonryldthianngd. of human nature, will be greatly

    11.  You, however, are of     a different opinion  --perhaps, be
cause    " zealous Calvinists,"  like moles and bats,   live in a thick

and perpetual gloom, with hardly a single ray of truth, or of

common sense, to gild their midnight darkness. People in so

melancholy a situation are doubtlessly very apt to take fright.

If your charity will not pour day-light on our gloomy abodes,

it would, at least, be compassionate in you to mitigate the woe
ful surprise with which you think your treatise calculated to

impress us.

No! You will no more deign to alleviate our surprise than

to dissipate our gloom. It is rather cruel, though, first to shut
us up in the dark, and then to scare us. It seems we " must"
still " continue to wonder." Wherefore ? Because " it would
be to no purpose" for you " to explain" to the " zealous Cal
vinists why they ought not to wonder" at the matter. " What

tIosr,ho"ulwd ousaldy  on that  subject," adds the high and mighty    Doc
                       not be   intelligible to them." Inexpressibly
                                                                       can

did and polite! The plain English of the compliment is this:

Every zealous Calvinist is a fool, or a dunce at best. I will

therefore waste no time on such incurable asses. All my phi

losophic apparatus itself would not afford them a gleam of

knowledge ; nor all my consummate skill in language and in

reasoning make them comprehend the lowest of my sublime

Iideas ; therefore leave them to stumble on in their impenetra

ble gloom, and to knock their blockish heads against tables,

doors, walls, and posts, amid the tremor of their surprise.

Our case is pitiable indeed. But why will not the illumi

nated and illuminating Doctor direct a few of his rays, by way
of experiment, toward our dark and dreary habitations ? Be

honest, good Sir, and fairly tell us, that your reason for hud

dling the matter up, and for not descending to particulars, was

not our stupidity, but your fear of the consequences that would

result to yourself, had you gone to the bottom of the subject,
and unfolded all that was in your heart To screen yourself,

you affect to give us over, as incurable, before you have so

much as tried what you can make of us. If you set about it,

who can tell but, stupid as we are, some of us may recover our
sight and sense, and be emancipated from our gloom and our
surprise together? Electricity, under your auspices, may
work miracles.

  However lightly I may, occasionally, have expressed my
self, I assure you, on the word of an honest man, that I have

the honour to be, with seriousness and truth, Rev. Sir, your

admirer and very humble servant.

   P. S. On reviewing this letter, I deem myself obliged, in

some measure, to apologize for that vein of freedom into which
the supreme and insulting contempt you express of the Cal-
vinists has unwarily betrayed me. Your last-quoted para
graph, Sir, appears to carry an implication of extreme preju
dice, and of sovereign pride. Nothing can be more superci
lious, more rude, or more unjust, than the letter and the spirit

of that whole passage. I would willingly, if I were able, frame

an excuse for you, by supposing that it escaped you, volante

calamo ; and that it is to be imputed, not so much to malice,
to haughtiness, or even to your unacquaintedness with the
people you traduce, as to the hurry and precipitation with

which your treatise was apparently written.
    Believe me to be, Sir, most respectfully yours.*

answer the same purposes as temporal ones are found to do, all of which

tend to good and arc evidently admitted for that purpose ; so that God, the

author of all, is as much to be adored and loved for what we suffer as for

                        To Ret. N. Cappe.*

       Dear Sir,                              London, Jan. 10, 1775.
Your short little letter contains so many queries, &c, that

you must absolutely come to London to have satisfactory an

swers, especially to what relates to my little tour on the con

tinent. It gives me great joy, however, to find you are so

well recovered from an indisposition that gave all your friends

the greatest concern and alarm.f Had it not been for this, I

should certainly have done nothing in the metaphysical way

Iwithout you, for there is none of my acquaintance that could

expect to enter into my views so much as yourself, and who is

at the same time so capable of guiding and assisting me. The

Examination and Dissertations+ were not communicated to a
single person. The edition of Hartley ought to have been

printed when I was abroad, and since I have come home the

same printer has been engaged with a second edition of the

" In comparing these two schemes, I can see no sort of resemblance, ex

cept that the future happiness or misery of all men is certainly fore-known
and appointed by God. In all other respects they are most essentially dif

ferent ; and even where they agree in the end, the difference in the manner

by which that end is accomplished is so very great, that the influence of the
two systems on the minds of those that adopt and act upon them, is the re

verse of one another." W. III. 532--534.

   The very unceremonious style of this letter, (from a stranger,) of which

the ready writer appears to have been, occasionally, rather than prevailingly

conscious, was not sufficient to deter Dr. Priestley from a personal inter

course  with  h"isbrleoaurgnhetd   and acute  opponent. Thus,      in 1790, shewing how
he had  been                      acquainted  with persons of all  principles and charac

ter"s,"Ohnee  says,  I  remember,  I dined in company  with an     eminent Popish
               day,
Ipriest ; the evening spent with philosophers, determined unbelievers ,- the
next morning I breakfasted, at his own request, with a most zealously or
thodox clergyman, Mr. Toplady ; and the rest of that day I spent with Dr.

'Jebb, Mr. Lindsey, and some others, men in all respects ufter mt/oicn heart."

            To Rev. T. Lindsey.

Dear Sir,   Calne, March 25, 1775.
I am at length, I thank God, got well home, and find all my

family well. The girl was fully acquitted, and the young man
will marry her. Judge Blackstone was exceedingly civil, and

took several occasions of paying me compliments, so that the

Idisagreeable business went off better than could have ex

pected. The grand jury did not find the bill, which, though

it did not prevent a public trial on the inquest, made the fa
vourable issue of it pretty certain.

  I inclose a letter I have just received, and wish you would

inform me whether the writer be not an author, and what

Ihe has written. Please to return it soon, as have not an

swered it.
I have got a cheap method of making my new air in large
quantities, but cannot pursue my experiments as I would wish,
Ion account of my boils; otherwise
                                    have many very pro

mising things in view.

especially what you do about the ground. f

I have now discovered an air five or six times as good as
Icommon air.
                        got it first from mercurius calcinatus, per se,

red lead, &c. ; and now, from many substances, as quick-lime,

(and others that contain little phlogiston,) and spirit of nitre,
and by a train of experiments demonstrate that the basis of

Iour atmosphere is spirit of nitre. Nothing ever did has

surprised me more, or is more satisfactory. In various other

I Irespects have added to the new facts had discovered before.

   Dr. Franklin has left us ;* but I do not know that he has

any thing particular in view. He told me in general that he

thought he did no good here, and might do some in America.

He had no idea of the Americans' submitting to our measures,

though he thought Lord Chatham's billf would have been a

good foundation for a final settlement.J

Dear Sir,                                      Calne, July 7, 1775.

I have read your articles for the Dictionary with much

pleasure. My only objection to them is that they are too

to the common defence, and for the support of civil government, and the

administration of justice in such colony. The proposition was founded on
no one radical principle of reconciliation. The minister at length acknow

ledged that it was designed to divide America, while it should unite Great

"Britain." Amer. Ann. II. 268, 269.

   * Toward the end of May a considerable reinforcement arrived, and

about the same time Generals Howe, Burgoyne, and Clinton. General Gage,

thus reinforced,   prepared   to    a"ct   with more decision."    He first, however,
offered the royal  pardon to   all        who shall forthwith lay  down their arms,

and return to the duties of peaceable subjects, excepting Samuel Adams and
John Hancock, whose offences are of too flagitious a nature to admit of any

"other consideration but that of condign punishment." Ibid. pp. 275, 2/6.

proceed with the greatest unanimity, and their meetings are

well attended. It will scarce be credited in Britain that men

can be as diligent with us, from zeal for the public good, as
with you for thousands per annum. Such is the difference
between uncorrupted new states, and corrupted old ones.

   Great frugality and great industry are now become fashion
able here. Gentlemen who used to entertain with two or three

courses, pride themselves now in treating with simple beef and
pudding. By these means, and the stoppage of our consump
tive trade with Britain,* we shall be better able to pay our
voluntary taxes for the support of our troops. Our savings in
the article of trade amount to near five millions sterling per
annum.

  I shall communicate your letter to Mr. Winthorp, but the

camp is at Cambridge, and he has as little leisure for philo

sophy as myself.
   Believe me ever, with sincere esteem, my dear friend, yours

fmost affectionately.

I thank you for your attention to the passage from the
IEncyclopedic
               intended to have written to you about it, but
forgot. I never saw the passage myself, and only heard of it

from you. The meaning of my desiring Mr. Johnson to put it

into your hands was, that you would point out to me any thing

that you thought exceptionable, and it is not yet too late to

do it.

    Dear Sir,                            Calne, Aug. 28, 1775.
I am glad to find that you approve of my Essays prefixed

to the edition of Hartley.f I think I shall compose some

other essays on metaphysical subjects, and publish them se

parately, but not very soon. If it will amuse you, I will very

gladly put them into your hands as they are composed. One
Iis nearly finished.
                           shall be glad to hear your opinion of

them.

  I have made many observations on human nature, with a

view to the illustration of Hartley's theory. They relate very

much to the conduct of the mind and happiness, and they are

so necessarily intermixed with observations on education, that
I almost think it will be best to publish them altogether as one

please.

the two disciples going to Emmaus was not well founded. § I

English, illustrations of all the difficult passages for the use of

but those who choose to have both, may have the latter without

the dissertations. With these I have taken a good deal of
Ipains, and hope they will give you some pleasure. Among
other things, I have a new interpretation of Daniel's prophecy

of seventy weeks.**

as you are well acquainted with my writings on similar sub

jects, you must be sensible that my sentiments and those
which you now express are very different. But you know
my natural freedom, and that it is not only consistent with,

Ibut arises from, my sincere friendship ; and therefore know

you will excuse it.

   My notions on the subjects of your essay were always what

are called old-fashioned ; and I used to flatter myself that
yours were nearly the same with mine : but I, whose religious
sentiments have undergone what you call (p. 9) " a total re

volution,"* cannot be offended at another person on account of

any change of a like nature.

Sometimes people's sentiments and views of things of this

nature change, in consequence of coming more into the world ;
Ibut do not find that this is the case with myself. I now see
Ifpretty much of what is called high life.
                                                                          there be any such
thing in this country, I may say that I live in it; but still my
ideas with respect to devotion, " sects, and establishments,"
Iare just what they were before; and, am sorry to say
                                                                      ;                                in

almost every respect the very reverse of those in your essay.

And really, Mrs. Barbauld, all my more serious and judicious

acquaintance, who are among your best friends, are, without

exception, of the same opinion, and declared themselves to be

so without having had any communication with one auother

upon the subject.*

   To discuss all the articles of your essay would be too much

for a letter; but I shall just hint at what I think to be the

most exceptionable in it.

  I cannot help considering the very title of your essay, viz.

" on the Devotional Taste," to be a debasing of the subject.
Agreeably to this you say, (p. 2,) that devotion is " an affair

of sentiment and feeling, and has its source in that relish for

the sublime, the vast, and the beautiful, by which we taste the
charms of poetry, and other compositions that address our
finer feelings."t You also say, (p. 5,) that " those who want

Jthis taste want a sense, a part of their nature."

   Now, if this be the case, all endeavours to acquire it must

be in vain. But then, being a thing so vague and so rare as
taste in works of genius, it may be thought that the want of

it is not much to be regretted; for though, like other refined

tastes, it might add to the elegant enjoyments of life, we may
do very well without it. This may not be a strictly logical

inference from your maxim, but it is an inference that will

naturally be drawn from and not far from being just.it it,is is
   On the other hand, to consider devotion not as an affair of
                              is
taste, but, as certainly is, an elevated passion, or affection,
          a
                                  not liable to any just objection.
             it
adapted to proper object,

Whereas your placing  on the same footing with the taste
" for the fine arts," has led you to treat of in such manner
                                                             it

                                                                                  a

                                                                                     I
that appears to some of my most judicious acquaintanceit
that the tendency of your essay in reality the very reverse
of the professed object of it; for that, instead of promoting the
true " spirit of devotion," will contribute to damp it.

Many serious persons are more especially offended, and

think justly, at your comparing devotion to the passion of love,

his mentioning " the name of his mistress amongst mixed com
panies,"* and especially when you say (p. 23), " you can hardly
address the greatest of all Beings in a strain of more profound
adoration than the lover uses to the object of his attachment."f

Now if there be any persons who apply the language of " pro
found adoration" to a human being, I consider it as a most

abominable practice, as nothing less than direct impiety, and

that the crime is the same in the person who bears such lan

guage, as in the person who uses it. As there is an infinite
difference in the object of our attachment in these two cases,
certainly both our feelings, and the expression of our feelings,

ought to be very different, so as hardly to bear the most re

mote comparison. A much more- proper comparison in this

case would be that mixture of love and reverence that a child

bears towards his parent.

   Your notion, (p. 10,) that " philosophy is unfavourable to
piety,"J 1 think altogether ill-founded, if by philosophy you

mean true philosophy, founded on the most just and exalted
conceptions of the Divine Being and his providence that we
can attain to. For surely the more raised are our conceptions
of God, the deeper will be our sense of humility and reverence,
the more entire will be our confidence in his care and good
ness, and the more unreserved our resignation to his will ; and

   * " In general, I believe, we may venture to assert, that no man who has

a proper veneration for the primary truths of religion, will be fond of

making them the subjects of common discourse, any more than a person who
loved with ardour and delicacy would choose to introduce the name of his

mistress amongst mixed companies in every light and trivial conversation.

The regard in both cases would be deep and silent, and not apt to vent itself

in words, unless called forth   bwyorsdome"  interesting occasion."      This censured
passage, which followed the                  metaphysics," (ibid. p.   235, 1. 24,) was

282 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

Ithese are the sentiments that are the basis, may say the

essence, of true devotion. The firm belief of a providence,

with respect to which nothing is either too great or too small,

that every degree of happiness, and every measure of affliction,

are appointed by the same wise and kind over-ruling power,

cannot impress the mind in a manner unfavourable to the most

lively feelings of gratitude, confidence, and joy.

   To     have    the mind habitually impressed with                   these   senti
           is to  set God always before us, and to live                       seeing
ments,                                                                 as "

him who is invisible." It is this that raises the mind above
                         it fixed, " stayed
the world, and keeps                         on God,"                  in all the
varieties of prosperity  and adversity, and
                                             enables us                to " rejoice

evermore." It is this that gives us a solid satisfaction in

doing and bearing the will of God, as such, here below, and

that fills the mind with "joy unspeakable and full of glory,"

in the prospect of death and a future life. Such language as

this is equally that of the Scriptures, and that of the strictest

philosophy, of which you say, (p. 14,) that it " must ever be

cold and dry."*

  If you mean a spurious and false philosophy, you should

have specified it. At present, it will naturally be concluded,

from what you say on the subject, that you have adopted the

maxim ascribed to the Papists, viz. that " ignorance is the
mother of devotion ;" and what you say of establishments in
general, will be thought to favour that construction of your

meaning.f

  Indeed, I am much surprised that you should give so evident

a preference to establishments, above every thing that comes

under the denomination of a sect, and especially that you
should say, (p. 34,) that " an establishment will preserve
Idevotion from ever sinking into contempt."J
                                                                       am persuaded

you would not have used this language if you had seen what I

lately saw upon the continent, where every thing relating to

fact, no more than sect, and has nothing of the venerable

appearance of its mother church.

   It appears to me that the devotion of the Church of Rome,

and even, in great measure, that of the Church of England,

as partaking of the same spirit, so far from answering the

most useful purposes of devotion, viz. that of being security

for the practice of virtue, that   too often the substitute for

the most substantial part of virtue, and in general has little or

no connexion with the duties of social life. The feelings that

are inspired by solemn processions, pictures, images, music,

&c, are very improperly called devotion.

   What you say, (p. 33,) of establishments in general, that
" they affect the mind by splendid buildings, music, the mys

terious pomp of ancient ceremonies, the sacredness of peculiar
orders, habits, and titles,"* &c, only applies to some esta

blishments, and does not belong to them as such. There            is

284 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   You say, (p. 6,) " there is nothing more prejudicial to the

feelings of a devout heart than a habit of disputing on religious

subjects."* Now I am clearly of opinion that the contrary is

universally true, and that it may be evinced both from the
nature of the thing and from fact. No person can have practi

cal religion much at heart, who has not a value for religious

truth (which, indeed, is the necessary foundation of all reli

gious practice) ; and if he really values                     he will, occasion

you only look into their writings you will find them to be, in

general, half controversial and half practical, or devotional as

may be exemplified                      the writings of Luther, Calvin, Owen,

their piety than Socinus and Biddle, whose writings are entirely

                            if

(and few persons now living have had more to do with reli

deem to be absolutely incompatible.

Lastly, would observe that common opinion, which, in

this case, may be allowed to have some foundation, entirely   is

contrary to this maxim of yours. For the orthodox Dissen

ters are always supposed to be the most pious and devout of us

all, and yet  is it         notorious that they are the most disputatious

   I am exceedingly concerned to have occasion to say any
thing to Mrs. Barbauld, whom I always have esteemed, and
Ialways shall esteem so much, that may give her pain ; but
shall be greatly deceived if you do not think it well meant,

and, believing it well meant, if you be displeased with me.
   To balance my opinion, you have secured the applause of

Ithe high clergy, (as know in several instances,) of the decent

part of the polite world in general, and of those Dissenters in

particular who wish to have their defection from us made

easier to them than it would otherwise have been. On this

account I cannot help wishing that you had, at least, qualified
what you have said on these subjects, with some intimation of

Ithe stress, which am sure you cannot but lay, on religious

truth, and the rights of conscience. For, because you have

said nothing about them, when a tolerably fair opportunity

presented, many will conclude, though unjustly, that you have

little regard for them.

  I cannot say but that it gives me, as well as many others,

much concern, that with respect to the important subjects of

your essay, a person of your acknowledged genius, and a Dis

senter, should have given so much countenance to a turn of

thinking which is very seducing, and, I think, very alarming
and dangerous. It is the way to which the world and the

temper of the times leads ; and this so strongly, that all we

can write, say, or do, is ineffectual to counteract
                                         a           except

"the Essay :

      There remains only to add, lest the preceding view of sects and esta

blishments should in any degree be misapprehended, that it has nothing to

do with the truth of opinions, and relates only to the influence which the

adventitious circumstances attending them may have upon the manners and

morals of their followers. It is, therefore, calculated to teach us candour,

but not indifference. Large views of the moral polity of the world may

serve to illustrate the providence of God in his different dispensations, but

are not made to regulate our individual conduct, which must conscientiously

follow our own opinions and belief. We may see much good in an esta

blishment, the doctrines of which we cannot give our assent to, without

violating our integrity ; we may respect the tendencies of a sect, the tenets

of which we utterly disapprove. We may think practices useful which we

cannot adopt without hypocrisy. We may think all religions beneficial, and
believe of one alone that it is true." Works, II. 259.

   P. S. I have just sent Mrs. Barbauld a very long and very
serious letter, on the subject of her late essay, disapproving
totally of all the sentiment of it. Dr. Price, and all my serious

and judicious acquaintance in London, think as I do on the

subject, and approved of my letter to her.*

   I blame myself much for not answering your former letter,
but I was just then setting out on a tour upon the continent,

and after that I had nothing very particular to write about.

   I have been very variously employed ever since, and am now

intent upon several courses of experiments which are very

promising. Among other things, I have lately sent to the

Royal Society an account of a set of experiments to ascertain

the use of the blood in respiration,J which I find is to dis

charge phlogiston from the system ; and it affects air in the

very same manner when congealed, and out of the body, as it

does when fluid, and in the body. It is also acted upon by

the air through a bladder, and a large body of serum, as well

as in immediate contact. I have likewise proved decisively

that fixed air is a modificaticn of the nitrous acid. But the

experiments, though very remarkable, are too particular for a

letter.

   We have just got a little news from America. A ship which

       Dear Sir,                                         Calne, July 8, 1776.

   We are, indeed, exceedingly disappointed in your not

Icoming to Calne, and, for my part, see no sufficient reason

for your confining yourself to London all the summer-time ;

but you are the best judge. If it must be so, we must submit,
though I own it is with peculiar reluctance and chagrin.

  What have you done with respect to a chapel? I admire

your cheerful perseverance under your many discouragements;
but it is the noblest of causes that you are engaged in.

  I keep wishing to hear from you almost every post, hoping

to receive some comfort in the present unpromising prospect

of American and public affairs ;f and your not writing makes

me conclude you had nothing encouraging to send me.

independence. % But it does not seem that this will be the

indispensable, when a treaty was discovered for 18,000 German carcases, to

be promptly supplied, in good fighting condition, by the Prince of Hesse, to
George HI., who, in the versification of a KingVspeecb, somewhat later, thus

complains :

had not, hitherto, been generally desired. But foreign assistance must be

sought [see supra, p. 271] in the character of independent states. Common
Sense, written by Thomas Paine, produced great effect. While it demon
strated the necessity, the advantages, and the practicability of inde

succession with ridicule. The change of the public mind on this occasion,

is without a parallel. In the short space of two years, nearly three millions

of people passed over, from the love and duty of loyal subjects, to the hatred

and resentment of enemies.

 "June 7- [1776.] A motion was made in Congress, by Richard Henry Lee,

of Virginia, for declaring the colonies free and independent. This caused very

294- MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

If you have any farther scheme of composition, I shall be
Iglad to be informed of it.
                                           think, now that you are so far

engaged, you will always have matter to write about, as indeed

there will in the nature of things be an increasing demand for

good writers, especially in moral and theological subjects.

  My Harmony, in Greek, though printed, Mr. Johnson, I find,

does not choose to publish till the next winter, by which time

I hope the English will be ready. This depends on Mr. Tur

I ought to have written to you before, but I was waiting
Ifor some answer from those of my friends, to whom sent
your Proposals, and I have not yet had any. Lord Shelburne

Igave his name very cheerfully, but have seen nobody else to
whom I could, with any propriety, apply, except some who I

found had subscribed in London. But I do not see any occa

sion to defer putting the work to the press. You cannot doubt

but that there will be a competent number demanded, if not

subscribed for.

   My " Lectures on Oratory and Criticism" are got half
through the press, and I am meditating another metaphysical
work, " on Matter and Spirit,"J but I shall not, probably, print

it till the next summer.

    Please to give my compliments to Dr. Warren,* and tell

him that if he have any paper that I can with propriety insert

in my Appendix, I will gladly do it.
  I have not your last at hand, and do not recollect whether

any thing in it requires particular notice, but was unwilling,

though in haste, to defer writing to you any longer.

      Dear Sir,     To the Same.

to add to the names he sent you, that of Rev. Mr. Lloyd, of

      In deference  to the judgment  of my friend,    and  the  ministers   to whom

he alludes, I have written to Mr. Sowden this week, though I expect no

satisfaction on the point of the present state of the Unitarian churches in

Poland; because, (unless such churches have been formed since,) by a

severe edict about an hundred years since, all the Unitarians were banished,

and their churches exterminated."    (See   W".   V.  83.)   has  favoured  me  with
   On another subject Mr. Toulmin    adds,       Dr.  Price

a letter this week. He acquaints me he has prepared a supplement to his

296 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

  I am really very glad that you think of illustrating Hartley's
Evidences of Christianity. I shall be very glad to be excused

from what I once intended, and, after all, I might never have
done it. I shall be glad to hear of the progress you make in

the work.*

  I have just printed a pretty large metaphysical work, which
I propose to call " Disquisitions concerning Matter and Spirit."

You will easily guess the principal design of it ; but it has
rather a greater extent than the title speaks. I shall probably

send it to the press soon after Christmas, and in due time it

will speak for itself. You will not easily imagine the con

nexion ; but one great object of the book is to combat the

doctrine of pre-existence, and especially that of our Saviour.
   How are your neighbours affected towards America? It

does not appear that the Americans are at all discouraged by

their losses, and I have little doubt but they will gain their
point, and become entirely independent of this country.

  P. S. We have lost our minister, Mr. Williams. I have sent
an invitation to Mr. Jervis's brother, but I do not think him

likely to accept it. Can you in that case recommend any one to

us ? There are two places to serve, at the distance of seven
miles, and together they raise £45, exclusive of assistance from

fthe funds.

                 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.                                                                           297

I rejoice to hear of your continual progress in those useful
Idiscoveries.
                 find that you have set all the philosophers of
         at work upon fixed air ;
Europe                                      and it is with  great pleasure I
observe  how high you stand in              their opinion;
                                                             for I enjoy my

friend's fame as my own.

   The hint you gave me, jocularly, that you did not quite

despair of the philosopher's stone, draws from me a request,

that when you have found it, you will take care to lose it
again; for I believe, in my conscience, that mankind are

wicked enough to continue slaughtering one another as long as
they can find money to pay the butchers. But, of all the wars

in my time, this on the part of England appears to me the
wickedest; having no cause, but malice against liberty, and

Ithe jealousy of commerce. And, think, the crime seems

likely to meet with its proper punishment; a total loss of her

own liberty, and the destruction of her own commerce.

  I suppose you would like to know something of the state of

affairs in America. In all probability we shall be much

stronger the next campaign than we were in the last ; better
armed, better disciplined, and with more ammunition. When

I was in the camp before Boston, the army had not five

rounds of powder a man. This was kept a secret,* even from

our people. The world wondered that we so seldom fired a
cannon. We could not afford but we may now make pow

To me seems, as           has always done, that this war must

end in our favour, and in the ruin of Britain, she do not

speedily put an end to it. An English gentleman here the

#other day, in company with some French, remarked, that
 was folly in France not to make war immediately. And, in

England, replied one of them, not to make peace.

I am really ashamed to think how long your very friendly
Iletter has lain by me unanswered, though think mine have

sometimes lain as long by you. In fact, I have had more ill

Iness, and what find to be a consequence of illness, more indo
lence, than usual for some time past ; but I hope with care and

Iexercise shall get better in both respects.

Iable, and the leaf was cancelled. I cannot recollect how fell

into that mistake. However, in looking into Lardner about

Dear Sir,                         Calne, Sept. 14, 1777.
I have desired Mr. Johnson to send you a copy of my " Dis
quisitions on Matter and Spirit," which I shall be obliged to

you if you will be so good as to read with some care, that, if it

be necessary, I may yet make alterations in it before it be pub
lished. A second volume on Necessity is nearly printed off,

and that will also be sent to you for the same'purpose.

  It is very probable that in the Disquisitions you may find
many things that you will disapprove, and I may not see rea
son to alter ; but I hope by the help of such friends as you to

send it out free from very gross mistakes, or passages needlessly

offensive. I hope you will make as much dispatch as you con

veniently can.

   I am now busy in writing notes and occasional paraphrases
for my English Harmony,* and I have made so many new ex

Iperiments, that must make another publication on the sub
ject ; but I shall change my title, and begin a new work.f My
experiments are more in the way of chemistry than before. I

shall probably go deeper in this business than ever, in con

sequence of having undertaken to teach philosophy to Lord

Shelburne's children, and having a noble apparatus for that

purpose. I often wish I had your son with us. My best re

If I had not experienced your goodness on former occasions,
I should be absolutely ashamed to write to you after so long
a silence, and having had your letter so long before me ; but

really I am a very bad correspondent in general. I wish, how

ever, very often that you were nearer to me, because, of all my

acquaintance, I consider you as most likely to enter deeply

into Hartley's theory, and contribute to the farther investiga

tion of that important subject, and should like to converse

with you about such matters. I am satisfied from what you

say that you clearly understand his theory, which few do, and

are apprized of the very extensive application of it. By this

time you may observe the use that I have made of it in the

business of criticism^ though it is very probable that you ex
pected more than you found in it. It is a very delicate subject.

  I Ihave desired Mr. Johnson to send you two volumes that

have just published,§ a work which I expect will rather shock

and offend many of my friends ; but I have some idea that it

will not much stagger you. When you have read it with care,

be so good as to let me know freely what you think of it.

Many cannot be reconciled to the doctrine of Necessity; but

thus, if I mistake not, you have been long with me.||

I hope you will not take it ill when your friend informs
you that I have not seen him. I was from my rooms (for a
IIfew hours) when he came to seek me.
                                                                  staid at home all the

following day, but found no more of him. Had known
where he lodged in Oxford, I should have visited him. Ex
cuse me then that I must take the other communication you

proposed, and send this by post.

   Of the anonymous letter from Bristol, which you mention,

II know nothing. It was probably written by some one, hope

well-meaning, who wished to check your philosophic Disqui

sitions of Matter and Spirit. That such information should

excite the curiosity, especially of one so incredulous, I cannot

wonder. But such curiosity I neither blame nor neglect.

  That I may satisfy you, I will tell you, 1, Who I am ; 2,
Whether I believe those things; 3, Whether I be willing to

demonstrate their truth sensibly ; 4, What good ground that

information had.

   I. A 8 to myself, I shall only write what I think pertinent to
this purpose. I had a small school education. I loved reading

and thought from my earliest years. Peculiarly I was attached
to religious, and, though at first I knew not the term, meta-

physic studies. These (both in the authors and systems, or
courses of learning), having no teacher, meeting with none but

such as slighted, blamed, pitied my turn of thinking, or only

Iwondered at it -- these pursued not regularly, but as they

occurred to a boy discountenanced, uninformed, with scattered

intervals of scanty leisure, and a very few unselect, out-of-the-

way books.                                             Both

increased to me in time. So did some kind and degree of

seeming knowledge. Opinions multiplied and varied ; but

doubts exceeded. Sceptical as those made me, they did me
good; 1, In making me never positive; 2, Nor unwilling to

change ; 3, Nor a despiser of those who thought otherwise

than I. I mention my being very doubtful, the rather because

you will agree with me, that, when one thinks no certainty

is to be found, one will be less nice in assenting to insufficient
I Ievidence. Perhaps am an instance.
                                      have nothing to add

of myself, but to thank you for your kind attention to letters

of mine, (some years ago,) for your hints, and the books you
lent and gave to me. Do not you recollect it?

  II. Do I believe those things? 1, I have no reason to think

them absurd or impossible. 2, They are commonly asserted

Iin all ages. 3, And generally believed. 4, find myself more

at ease in believing them ; my notions are suitable. Thence, it

may be on bad proof, I assent that there are such things. You
will the less wonder at such a belief, when I add, that I not

only assent to spirits, apparitions, magic, and witchcraft, but

that I allow Behmen's philosophy, and Swedenborg's visions.
Yea, I deny hardly any thing of that sort. So you will per

ceive that I easily believe, and require not too much demon

stration.

  III. Whether I be willing to demonstrate their truth sen
sibly? 1, I do not know that I can give any such exhibition.
2, The faith itself is not interesting, nor have I the least wish

to convince any. 3, My conscience is not clear that such

acts are innocent. 4, They would not be, at least may not,

you be convinced if I shewed you a spirit?" answered, " No;
I should grant any thing at the time, but afterwards I should

think you had frighted me out of my senses, and then you could

make me believe any nonsense."

  IIV. What good ground had that information ? will tell
Iyou all know. I have asked Miss More. She says, had you

asked her, she would have told you that she knew nothing of

the matter. Many people have known that I studied astrology,

geomancy, and magic, and was of an abstract mind. They sur

mised. Common things looked extraordinary. Little things

were greater. I was reported a conjuror. I was teased to

tell fortunes, raise spirits, and sometimes to cast out a devil.

Some pretended to a graver curiosity, and asked me for a
positive answer to, " Have you not seen and raised a spirit?"

I always replied, " I will tell you any thing about them out of
books, but as to my own experience I will not say." " Can
you deny it?" I said, " I will not deny it." Thence they
Iaffirmed it abroad. To sum up all : 1, 1 believe. 2, I think

have reason. 3, No one was ever witness to any appearance

with me. 4, I never told any one that ever I raised a spirit. 5,

Dear Sir,                                         1777.
I am much concerned to hear by Mr. Jervis that you have
not yet received from me any copy of my " Disquisitions," and
Treatise on Necessity, which I ordered Mr. Johnson to send to

you before they were published. Having heard before, that
the first copy had not reached you, I ordered another to be

sent. Perhaps by proper inquiry you may recover one or both

the copies.  that my  " Lectures  on  Criticism"  gave you any

pleasure ; but, though I much approve of your hints for an
Iimproved edition, fear I shall hardly be able to give the at

tention to it that will be necessary to execute them. Besides,

I do not imagine that there will be much demand for the work,

so as to require a new edition, at least soon.

  I thank you for your hints respecting a new answer to Mr.

Hume ; but you who have suggested them are best able to

Ipursue them, and would seriously advise you to set about it.
I Ishould be happy to see what you write ; and if could give

you any assistance then, I should do it with great pleasure.

   The experiments of your friend on vision and hearing are
very curious, and deserve to be particularly attended to. You
will do well to take a regular account of all facts of this

kind.

  I should be very glad to see you and my other friends in the

West, but it will not be in my power to have that satisfaction.

                                               Knightsbridge, Jan. 20, 1778.
   1am much your debtor, Sir, for your late polite favour from
Calne; but especially for the obliging present of your Disqui
sitions concerning Matter and Spirit, and of the Appendix con

cerning Necessity. I have read them with great attention ;

such, was totally unqualified to advance the insinuation of

which I have such just reason to complain.*

   · Calvin, as I have quoted (W. III. 534) his Institutes, L. iv. C. xv.

S. x., could, even though a parent, reconcile himself to the belief that in

fants bring their damnation with them from their birth (Infantes guogue
ipsi suam secum damnulionem a matris utero afferunt). Yet, according to
C. xvi. S. xvii., certainly some of that age will obtain salvation (certi, ex ea

ettate, omnino, aliqui servantur).
   Dr. Priestley's able and ingenious correspondent would readily perceive

"thatbefore he could venture               (asruepra",   p. 259)            to deny, with  any plausibility,
        the notions of Calvin"                          gloomy,"              it would be  necessary to in
that

terpolate the genuine text of Geneva from his own unauthorized and here

tical version of Calvinism. Thus he reads, not merely that some infants

would     certainly be  thsaavted"  from         the damnation universally                  inflicted by an
infant's    birth, but              there       can be no reasonable doubt                 entertained con

cerning the salvation of every young person."
A calculation follows, more merciful than any I have found among the
theories of Calvin, (see W. III. 8, 9, notes,) or of his eminent disciple Ed
"wards, or indeed in

person," Mr. Toplady

two theories together, and what will be the product ? That
my sum total, and that of every other man, amounts to just

nothing at all. I have neither body nor soul ; I have no sort

of existence whatever.

Here it may be alleged that the two systems cannot be
Ithrown together, as being totally incompatible.
                                                                                      answer,

why may not Bishop Berkeley's word go as far as Dr. Priest

ley's, and the doctor's as far as the bishop's ? though, when all

is done, the best way, in my opinion, is to cease from both, and

to believe neither.

The arguments from absolute and universal Materialism

drawn (or rather pretendedly drawn) from rational and phi

losophic sources, appear to me prodigiously forced, lame, and

inconclusive ; and, if we take Scripture into the account, not
all the subtlety, nor all the violence of criticism, will ever be

able to establish your system on that ground. What wretched
work do you yourself make with those few texts which you

venture to quote, and strive to obviate, wherein, plena et prima,

facie, man is spoken of as a being compounded of matter and

spirit !

gonists, may treat you, as I ever desire to do, with the respect

   How is your health ? Beware of too close application, and
of too intense exertions of mind. I, for my own part, can
most heartily subscribe to these remarks of the Apocryphal
writer :

   " The thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices

are but uncertain. For the corruptible body presseth down
the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind
that museth upon many things. Hardly do we guess aright
at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the
things that are before us ; but the things which are in heaven
who hath searched out ? And thy counsel who hath known,
except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from

above ?"

into our hearts, be a light to the paths of the much esteemed

Ifriend to whom am writing, and the paths of his obliged and

orator and statesman proved himself peculiarly unworthy of Mr. Everett's

distinguished eulogium. On the 7th of April, 1778, the Duke of Richmond
moved an address to the king, recommending peace with America on the

only condition then attainable, the acknowledgment of her independence.
This the Earl of Shelburne opposed, declaring that thus ' the sun of Bri

posal, as the American historian, Gordon, says, ' with a strength of deter

describe them. For any thing which appears, Lord Chatham would have

continued to deluge her fields with blood, to dispossess her of independence,

his own repeated declarations, Great Britain had proved herself the unfeel

though we are at a great distance, your circumstances are easy,

and I think you will hardly content yourself without sometimes
visiting London, if not Bath. I should be particularly happy

to see you at my own house, and we can say more in two or

three days' conversation than in many years' correspondence.

  If you favour me with a line soon (which I own is more than
I deserve) I shall be obliged to you if you will mention the

state of political opinions, and of trade, &c, in your part of

the world.

   P. S. My wife desires her respects to you.f

   I am, indeed, very much obliged to you for the pains you

have taken to make remarks on the Disquisitions, &c They
Iare very ingenious, and will be useful to me when revise the
work,* which I shall do soon, carefully, in order to insert any

correction that may occur to me in my controversy with Dr.
Price on the subject. You will excuse my not entering into

particulars in a letter, as I have not leisure for it.

  To the controversy with Dr. Price I shall subjoin letters to

those of my antagonists that have appeared since the publica

your difficulties cleared up, as far as is necessary, for my

purpose. If any copies of the work be in the hands of your

of it.

318 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   An interval of several months now, unfortunately,

occurs in the correspondence ; for which the only sub

stitutes, in my possession, are two letters from Mr.
Lindsey. In one, written to Mr. Turner, are several
passages on the occupations of Dr. Priestley during this
period. The earlier letter to Mr. Shore, and by him
communicated to Mr. Turner, relates what Mr. Lindsey

had witnessed in the House of Commons on the dis

cussion of a subject in which Dr. Priestley, on several

occasions, appears to have discovered a lively interest.*

It was now agitated on a renewed application of the

Protestant Dissenting Ministers, for parliamentary relief

from the unjust and rigorous obligation, on preachers
and schoolmasters, as the price of civil protection, to

subscribe the articles of the Church of England.f

                                                  London, April 21, 1779.

   Yesterday was a day of good debate. Lord North opened
with the proposal of a test, that the minister, &c, should
acknowledge himself a Christian and Protestant, and declare

that the Holy Scriptures, commonly received by Protestant
churches, contained a revelation of the whole will of God ; and

that he would take them for the rule of his doctrine and prac
tice. This is not exactly as it was worded, but to this effect.

   For the bill, as it was, without a test, Sir Henry Hoghton,
Mr. Wilkes, Mr. Dunning, Mr. Charles Fox, Mr. Serjeant
Adair, Mr. Charles Turner, Lord John Cavendish, Sir William
Meredith, and Mr. Goodricke, were the speakers. Sir H.
Hoghton endeavoured to shew that the imposition of such a
test was without the magistrate's province.

   Mr. Wilkes was well heard in his defence of the most un
limited toleration, which he enlivened with many pleasant and

witty remarks on Athanasius, and the thirty-nine articles. Mr.
Dunning was full of excellent close reasoning, but was feeble

Iin his voice, and not so animated and pointed as have heard

him. Mr. Fox excelled all men but himself, in depth, force,

and clearness of argument, and demonstrated the utter wrong-

ness of the civil magistrate requiring any test whatever, as a

condition of enjoying so natural and unalienable a right as that

of worshiping God according to a man's own conscience.*

The rest spoke very well.

On the other side, after Lord North, were a Mr. Crofts,

member for the University of Cambridge, who said a few
words, Mr. Powys, member for Northamptonshire, Mr. Burke,
Sir Adam Ferguson, the Lord Advocate of Scotland.

   Mr. Burke spoke admirably well, kept closer to his point,

and with fewer digressions, than I ever knew him, made use of

a great deal of plausible reasoning, not without some artifice,

to shew the unaccountable peevishness and perverseness of

men's refusing to subscribe what they did believe; never

attending to the just objection some minds might make to do
it at the bidding of the civil magistrate. He also dwelt long

and with more reason, on the inconsistency of objecting to

subscribe the Scriptures, at the command of the magistrate,

and yet making no objection to the declaration against Popery ;

                      as an orator, to make the most of it;

divided against the test. Sir George Savile was not returned

Dr. Priestley's English Harmony is printing here very
Ibriskly.
                had a long letter from him a few days ago, upon

his return from Exeter, where, upon being solicited to it, he

had been joined in an ordination of Mr. Jervis's brother with

Dr. Kippis and Mr. Hogg.* II believe, also, ought to add

Sir Harry Trelawny,f who begun the service ; at which latter

circumstance, also, I much rejoice, as it shews that that deserv

Sir Harry, a descendant of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, Bishop of Winchester,

had been distinguished at Christ Church, Oxford, for his exemplary deport

Ordination of the Rev. Sir Harry Trelawny, Bart. and A. B., to the Pastoral

Office, in the Church of West Looe, Cornwall." Mon. Rev. LVII. 335.

Crowded congregations now attended Sir Harry's preaching in the metro

polis ; attracted by rank, the reputation of opulence, an agreeable person,
and (to my young experience) a highly-impressive pulpit-eloquence. At

the Tabernacle I heard one of his earliest discourses, and in Essex Street
chapel nearly, if not the last he ever preached as a Nonconformist ; and in

which he controverted the Calvinistic    thvaitews"   of  the Christian                                    salvation, from
the declaration of the Apostle James,                 by  works a man                                      is justified, and

not by faith only."

   Thus,  after a very  short        s"ojopurerntenadmeodnghoPlyrotoersdtearnst"  Dissenters, Sir Harry

Ition, and became, believe, a prebendary in the Cathedral of Exeter, though
he has, since, seldom, if ever, attracted public notice.

   Dr. Priestley composed h is sermon for the occasion here in

the spring, and preached it in our chapel ; one of the best and
most instructive I ever heard, and many others also bore the
same testimony to it : the subject, the parable of the sower.*

It was, apparently, preached with equal acceptance at Exeter,

and there was a very hearty request afterwards to publish it,

wrote me a letter, civil enough in terms, but desiring I would

allow him to revoke his concurrence in the request, as he ima
gined the sermon was intended to support the doctrine of

necessity. It is supposed that Mr. Cornish,* who had ex
pressed some dislike of the sermon, had been with him. In

the same letter he desired me to preach a plain, practical ser
mon at his place, where he had engaged me for Sunday morn
ing. Dr. Kippis, as well as myself, thought it very odd and

improper that I should now oblige him. I therefore, after

shewing his mistake of my sermon, declined preaching for him

at all, This I found made him very uneasy, and he and the
Iheads of the congregation requesting that should give them
Ian evening lecture, . consented, and preached my sermon on
Habitual Devotion, which, I believe, gave much satisfaction to

many who had before thought very ill of me."

  I thought you would be pleased with this little history, as

perhaps you may not hear from our excellent friend so parti

cularly on the occasion. He tells me afterwards that he had

been advised to print his sermon alone, and had accordingly

sent it to the press, which you will be glad to learn, as you
will now also have an opportunity of seeing it. It strikes at

the root of all fanaticism in religion, methodism, &c, &c I

any want of friendship or esteem, but to what it is really

owing to, viz. having nothing very important to communicate,

and a variety of engagements, not always so agreeable as writ

Mr. Scholefieldf and his sister have lately spent ten days
Ifwith us, and made us very happy.

we could talk over a thousand things ; and if you have any

taste for my philosophical pursuits, it would be in my power

to amuse you in that way,

  I IIam as busy, and, think, as successful as ever have been

in my experiments, especially on the influence of light in the

production of pure air from substances of all kinds, especially

vegetable and animal, in water; but the particulars are too

minute for a letter. It is a continuation of a process of which

       Dear Sir,
                                                                Calne, Aug. 5, 1779.

   I have printed the sermon that I delivered at the ordina

tion, but without any mention of that service, on account of the

request for its publication not being unanimous ; and because

it was thought to savour of the doctrine of necessity, I wrote

the preface that you see prefixed to it.

  I Iwas very happy during the short stay made with you ;
Ibut, for the sake of conversation, had rather have you by my

own fire-side.

  I am at present chiefly busy about my experiments, having

no less a personage than the Sun at work for me, though of

late he has not minded his business so closely as I wished him

to have done.

  I have just finished a letter to the Bishop of Ossory,f in

defence of the principles of my Harmony.

  I have just received Mr. Palmer's answer to my Treatise on

Necessity ,J but I have not had time to look into it. I wish I

could engage somebody to read and answer these things for

me.

  I beg my compliments to your worthy father and mother,

and also to Mr. Hogg, Mr. Morgan, Mr. Manning, and my
other friends in Exeter, and to Mr. Jervis§ and Mr. Bartlett,

when you see them.

conclusion, I fancy it will be agreeable to you to be ac

quainted with the result.

   The green matter that you saw producing the pure air, I

found to be a vegetable substance, the seeds of which must be

invisible in the atmosphere : for when the communication with

Ithe air was cut off, it was never produced. On this tried
other plants that grew wholly in water, and I find that they

all, without exception, yield the same pure air, and some

of them much more copiously; so that I conclude that all

plants do, in fact, the same ; imbibing air in an impure state, and

emitting;        as excrementitious to them, in dephlogisticated

I am glad you approve the sentiment of the sermon. It is

the only ground on which we can combat the doctrine of
sudden and late conversion, &c I should like to know who it

was that preached against it. In my Letters to an Unbeliever,

I have begun, as you wished me, with explaining the nature of

reasoning, &c,* but perhaps not so largely as you wish. It is

all on the principle of the association of ideas. Mr. Locke's
doctrine, of the coincidence of ideas, will not do for all cases.

Some of my friends who have seen the letters think them too

metaphysical, and do not advise me to publish them, at least

for the present. They are now in the hands of Dr. Price.
You are so much out of the way, or there is nobody into

I inclose a spare copy of my Letter to the Bishop of Ossory,

which will be inserted in the English Harmony, now printed

off. On this subject, you and I entirely differ, and as you did

not see any weight in my former arguments, I cannot expect

that you will see any more force in the circumstances men

   I have printed an Answer to Mr. Palmer on Necessity, of

perimental researches into nature, and of the success you meet

with. The rapid progress true science now makes, occasions

my regretting sometimes that I was born so soon. It is impos

sible to imagine the height to which may be carried, in a thou
sand years, the power of man over matter. We may, perhaps,

learn to deprive large masses of their gravity, and give them

absolute levity, for the sake of easy transport. Agriculture

may diminish its labour and double its produce : all diseases

may by sure means be prevented or cured, (not excepting
even that of old age,) and our lives lengthened at pleasure,

even beyond the antediluvian standard. O that moral science

were in as fair a way of improvement, that men would cease

to be wolves to one another, and that human beings would at

length learn what they now improperly call humanity!

  I am glad my little paper on the Aurora Borealis pleased.
If it should occasion farther inquiry, and so produce a better

hypothesis, it will not be wholly useless.
I have considered the situation of that person* very atten
Itively.
          think that, with a little help from the Moral Alge-

bra,f he might form a better judgment than any other person

can form for him. But since my opinion seems to be desired,

I give it for continuing to the end of the term, under all the

present disagreeable circumstances: the connexion will then
die a natural death. No reason will be expected to be given

for the separation, and of course no offence taken at reasons

given ; the friendship may still subsist, and in some other way

be useful. The time diminishes daily, and is usefully em

ployed. All human situations have their inconveniences; we

feel those that we find in the present, and we neither feel nor
see those that exist in another. Hence we make frequent and

troublesome changes without amendment, and often for the

worse.

strangers to me, and not very agreeable. Near the river side

I saw what I took to be a pleasant green meadow, in the mid

dle of which was a large shady tree, where it struck my fancy

I could sit and read, (having a book in my pocket,) and pass
the time agreeably till the tide turned ; I therefore prevailed
with the captain to put me ashore. Being landed, I found the

greatest part of my meadow was really a marsh, in crossing
which, to come at my tree, I was up to my knees in mire : and

I had not placed myself under its shade five minutes before

the muskitoes in swarms found me out, attacked my legs,

 hands, and face, and made my reading and my rest impossible;

I have the same idea concerning supernatural influence, and

of the bad use that has been made of the popular doctrine on

that subject ; but you have taken much more pains, and have
been much more successful in the investigation of the sense of

scripture.

   I very much wish that your pamphlet was properly made
public, and not confined, as it seems to be at present, to pri

vate use. I cannot help thinking that much good would arise

from it. Few of those who really want light on the subject

Iwill look into any thing that write ; but a person whose name

is not obnoxious, seriously discussing the point as a purely
scriptural inquiry, would probably be better heard.

Dear Sin,  Calne, April 2, 1780.
I am really concerned that by my long silence I should seem

to neglect you, and not to place a proper value on your friend

ship, of which you are always giving me the most flattering

marks ; but partly illness, partly hurry of employment, and

partly an expectation of seeing you at Calne, given me by

your friends at Bristol, as well as yourself, have prevented my

writing to you as I had intended.

  I have received the 5/. 8s. which you have been so obliging

as to get for the sermons, with which you must have had a

great deal of trouble. I shall be obliged to you, if you or Mr.

Tucker will keep the rest a while longer, as they are not

wanted any where else; or if you think they will do any good,

I wish you to dispose of them by gift, as you may think pro

per yourself. I do not wish to see any of them again.

I write now to apprize you that I expect to pay you a short
visit on Monday or Tuesday next. My brother-in-law, Mr.

Wilkinson, is here, and going to Birmingham, and presses me

much to go with him, as travelling is recommended to me for
a bilious disorder, by which I have lately suffered much, and
Iam but imperfectly recovered.
                                have with much pain parted
with a gall-stone, and may have many more, which exercise

may help to expel.

      Besides, my connexion with Lord Shelburne is now dis-

- solved, and I retire with an annuity of 150/. per annum ;* and
 Ias intended to reside in some cheaper place than Calne, and
  Mr. Wilkinson wishes me to fix somewhere near him, I think

Birmingham will be near enough ; and a neighbourhood to you,

and other circumstances, strongly recommend it to me, in pre

Iference to most other parts of the kingdom. However, wish

to see the country, and make inquiries, being in no hurry about

the matter. A convenient and cheap house, in the skirts of

Ithe town, would be a great motive. What shall do further

is altogether undetermined.

Sir,                                     London, June 1, 1780.

I ought long ago to have acknowledged the receipt of your
Ivaluable treatise.
                     read it with a good deal of attention, and

intended to have written to you on the subject immediately on

Imy arrival in London; but was seized with a painful disorder,
Iso that have been obliged to neglect all my correspondents,

and am now but imperfectly recovered.

   Your book, I think, fully answers its object, as far as scrip

ture can be interpreted by itself ; but though the frequent and

long quotations you have made may be necessary to some, they

will appear tedious to others, especially where the thing to be

illustrated is pretty obvious, or at least generally taken for

granted. A few remarks occurred to me, but they were not

of much consequence ; and not having the book now by me,

I cannot recollect them. Only in general I did not see much

reason for supposing that the Jews had any difference of opi

nion concerning the Messiah.

   As to the publication of your other piece, I can only say

that I am always well satisfied if my bookseller will take upon

himself the risk of publishing my theological pamphlets, which
he would not always do, but in consideration of what he gains

by my other publications. A very few copies for particular
friends is all that I ever get or ask. This is not an age in

which there is much demand for things of this kind.
   To get books into " proper hands," as you observe, is a

difficult thing indeed. All our hope depends upon the younger
and less prejudiced. The old must carry their errors to the

grave, and this is no inconsiderable advantage attending the

succession of the human species by death. All we can do is

to scatter instruction indiscriminately, leaving it to the provi
dence of God to direct it to the proper soil.*

In a hasty answer to your obliging inquiries after my health,
I wish to inform you that I am just returned to Calne, pretty
well recovered, though I do not expect to be perfectly well for

some time.

  I have just written to Sir H. Trelawny, to invite him hither,

according to a former appointment, and I am very anxious that
you would accompany him, especially as I leave Calne at

Michaelmas, and am removing to Birmingham, my connexion

  I am sorry you have not received a copy of my Letters to an

Unbeliever. I imagine the delay arose from my reprinting a

leaf, and Mr. Cruttwell afterwards forgetting it. When you

come hither I shall have a copy for you ; but I own I wish

you may see it before you come, and the price is not such as
to be of any consequence to you.

  I have not yet received the letter or plan you speak of, and

your last, of the 7th instant, only a few days ago. Please to
write to me no more under cover to Lord Shelburne.

   I Ishall have the greater expectation of seeing you, as fancy

it will be your vacation-time, though on that account (our boys

being at home) I do not know that we can make more than
one spare bed ; but for that, if you and Sir Harry come toge

ther, we will provide as well as we can.

Best respects to your father and mother.

P.S. My wife, who is much better than she has been, de

sires her respects to you.*

From the conclusive arguments of this pamphlet, I have great pleasure in

separating the following description of early-matured human excellence.

"Ostendent terris hunc tantum fata.

      The Honourable William Granville Petty finished his short career of

life in the tenth year of his age, when the dawn of reason held out the

early promise of a bright intellectual day, and disclosed a splendid pros
pect of blooming virtues, and the fondest hopes. His intellectual faculties

were naturally vigorous and alert; while a thoughtful turn of mind occa

sionally disposed him to contemplative habits very unusual at his age. His

countenance was animated and intelligent, and when lighted up by adverting

to any elevated sentiment or generous action, bore the significant impress of

"his mind.

      A sacred love of truth, a high sense of honour, elevated notions of

liberty, justice, and humanity, and an unaffected piety, invariably inspired

his youthful breast. An energy of mind, a vivid imagination, a singularly

retentive memory, a fondness for reading, and a love of knowledge, with an
insatiable desire of acquiring it by close attention and diligent application, --

were qualities by which he was no less eminently distinguished. To these

were added the engaging influence of a gentle, yet animated disposition, an

artless, undesigning temper, and a generous, feeling heart. Had it pleased

Providence to have spared a life so precious, he would no doubt have been

an ornament to  "hisRecmouanrtkrsy,   the pride of his  family,  and an honour to human
nature 1" See                                            in the  ' Literary Recollections'

                  (1780^-17870

The foregoing Memoirs and Correspondence, with

such illustrations as inquiry or recollection could supply,

have described the friendships, opinions, and employ

ments of Dr. Priestley, till his removal to Birmingham.
He had beheld, in 1780, those scenes of misrule and riot

which have indelibly disgraced the name of Protestant.

They, indeed, too clearly proved the baneful influence, on
bigotry and ignorance, of such unreasonable alarms as

his prejudiced associates had widely circulated, and
which he had so early and so ably controverted. Yet,
little apprehending " the pitiless storm" which would

one day burst upon himself, he proceeds, with unalloyed

satisfaction, to describe the facilities he had enjoyed for

those various pursuits by which, like Berkeley, he would
" dedicate his age, as well as his youth, the latter growth,

as well as the first fruits, at the altar of truth."*

I(154.)  consider ray settlement at Birmingham as the

happiest event in my life, being highly favourable to every

(who soon left us, by removing from Lichfield to Derby,) Mr.
Galton.t and afterwards Mr. Johnson, of Kenilworth, and

myself, dined together every month, calling ourselves the

Lunar Society, because the time of our meeting was near the

full moon.
   (155.) With respect to theology, I had the society of Mr.

Hawkes,J Mr. Blyth, and Mr. Scholefield,§ and his assistant,

Mr. Coates, and, while he lived, Mr. Palmer, before of Mac

clesfield. We met and drank tea together every fortnight.

At this meeting we read all the papers that were sent for the
" Theological Repository," which I revived || some time after

my coming hither, and in general our conversation was of

the same cast as that with my fellow-tutors at Warrington.^
   (156.) Within a quarter of a year of my coming to reside at

Birmingham, Mr. Hawkes resigned, and I had an unanimous

invitation to succeed him as colleague with Mr. Blyth,** a man

of a truly Christian temper. The congregation we serve is the

Imost liberal, believe, of any in England ; and to this freedom

the unwearied labours of Mr. Bournff had eminently con

tributed.

of catechising and legturing, and my classes have been well

but which I would earnestly recommend to all ministers. My

time being much taken up with my philosophical and other

studies, I agreed with the congregation to leave the business

of baptizing and visiting the sick to Mr. Blyth,* and to confine

my services to the Sundays. I have been minister here be

fhappiness; and for this I am sensible I am in a great measure

friends think the world indebted to me for.

   (165.) Not to enlarge again on what has been mentioned
already, on the fundamental blessings of a religious and liberal

education, I have particular reason to be thankful for a happy

temperament of body and mind, both derived from my parents.

were remarkably healthy and long lived ; and though my con

(being often violently heated with exercise, and as often im

difficulty I recovered, it has been excellently adapted to that

studious life which has fallen to my lot.

complaints that are peculiarly unfavourable to study. I have

troubled with gall-stones, which sometimes gave me exquisite

recovered, and have now been so long free from the disorder,

that I am under no apprehension of its return.
  (167.) It has been a singular happiness to me, and a proof, I

believe, of a radically good constitution, that I have always

slept well, and have awaked with my faculties perfectly vi

Iever I have been fatigued with any kind of exertion, could at

that I ever knew, and by this means was as happy towards the

close of life, -when reduced to poverty, and dependent upon

Iothers, as in his best days, and who, am confident, would

not have been unhappy, as 1 have frequently heard him say,

in a workhouse.

   (170.) Though my readers will easily suppose that, in the
course of a life so full of vicissitude as mine has been, many

things must have occurred to mortify and discompose me,

nothing has ever depressed my mind beyond a very short

period. My spirits have never failed to recover their natural

level ; and I have frequently observed, and at first with some
surprise, that the most perfect satisfaction I have ever felt has

been a day or two after an event that afflicted me the most,
and without any change having taken place in the state of
things. Having found this to be the case after many of my
troubles, the persuasion that it would be so after a new cause of

uneasiness, has never failed to lessen the effect of its first im

pression, and, together with my firm belief of the doctrine of

necessity, (and consequently that of every thing being ordered
for the best,) has contributed to that degree of composure

which I have enjoyed through life, so that I have always con

sidered myself as one of the happiest of men.

  I(171.) When I was a young author, (though did not pub
lish any thing until I was about thirty,) strictures on my
Iwritings gave me some disturbance, though believe even then

less than they do most others ; but after some time, things of

that kind hardly affected me at all, and on this account I may

be said to have been well formed for public controversy.*

But what has always made me easy in any controversy in

which I have been engaged, has been my fixed resolution

Ihad fallen into. That have never been in the least backward

   (172.) As I have not failed to attend to the phenomena of
Imy own mind, as well as to those of other parts of nature,

have not been insensible of some great defects, as well as some

advantages, attending its constitution ; having, from an early

period, been subject to a most humbling failure of recollection,

so that I have sometimes lost all ideas of both persons and
Ithings that have been conversant with. I have so completely
forgotten what I have myself published, that in reading my
Iown writings, what find in them often appears perfectly new
to me, and I have more than once made experiments, the re

sults of which had been published by me.
(173.) I shall particularly mention one fact of this kind, as

it alarmed me much at the time, as a symptom of all my men

tal powers totally failing me, until I was relieved by the re

collection of things of  a similar nature  "haDviisnsgerthaatpiopennse,"d   to me
before. When I was        composing the                                    which
Iare prefixed to my " Harmony of the Gospels,"*
                                                                           had to

ascertain something which had been the subject of much dis

cussion, relating to the Jewish passover, (I have now forgotten
what it was,) and for that purpose had to consult and compare

several writers. This I accordingly did, and digested the re
Isult in a compass of a few paragraphs, which wrote in short

hand ; but having mislaid the paper, and my attention having

Ibeen drawn off' to other things, in the space of a fortnight

did the same thing over again, and should never have disco

Ivered that had done it twice, if, after the second paper was
transcribed for the press, I had not accidentally found the

former, which I viewed with a degree of terror.

  I(174.) Apprized of this defect, never fail to note down,

as soon as possible, every thing that I wish not to forget. The

same failing has led me to devise, and have recourse to, a variety

of mechanical expedients to secure and arrange my thoughts,

which have been of the greatest use to me in the composition

of large and complex works ; and what has excited the won

der of some of my readers, would only have made them smile

if they had seen me at work. But by simple and mechanical

                         * Sec supra, p. 204.

346 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

methods one man shall do that in a month which shall cost

another, of equal ability, whole years to execute. This metho
dical arrangement of a large work, is greatly facilitated by

mechanical methods, and nothing contributes more to the

perspicuity of a large work than a good arrangement of its

parts.
I(175.) What
               have known with respect to myself, has

tended much to lessen both my admiration and my contempt

of others. Could we have entered into the mind of Sir Isaac

Newton, and have traced all the steps by which he produced

his great works, we might see nothing very extraordinary in

the process. And great powers with respect to some things

are generally attended with great defects in others ; and these

may not appear in a man's writings. For this reason it seldom

happens but that our admiration of philosophers and writers is

lessened by a personal knowledge of them.
   (176.) As great excellencies are often balanced by great,

though not apparent defects, so great and apparent defects are

often accompanied by great, though not apparent excellencies.

Thus my defect in point of recollection, which may be owing
to a want of sufficient coherence in the association of ideas

formerly impressed, may arise from a mental constitution more

Ifavourable to new associations ; so that what have lost with

respect to memory, may have been compensated by what is
called invention, or new and original combinations of ideas.
This is a subject that deserves attention, as well as every thing

else that relates to the affections of the mind.

  I(177.) Though have often composed much, in a little time,
it by no means follows that I could have done much, in a given
Itime. For whenever have done much business in a short

time, it has always been with the idea of having time more

than sufficient to do it in ; so that I have always felt myself

Iat ease, and I could have done nothing, as many can, if had

been hurried.

   (178.) Knowing the necessity of this state of my mind to

the dispatch of business, I have never put off any thing to the

last moment; and instead of doing that on the morrow which

ought to be done to-day, I have often blamed myself for doing

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  34.7

to-day what had better have been put off until to-morrow ;

precipitancy being more my fault than procrastination.

   (179.) It has been a great advantage to me that I have never
been under the necessity of retiring from company in order to

Icompose any thing. Being fond of domestic life, got a habit

of writing on any subject by the parlour fire, with my wife

and children about me, and occasionally talking to them, with
out experiencing any inconvenience from such interruption.
Nothing but reading, or speaking without interruption, has
been any obstruction to me. For I could not help attending

(as some can) when others spoke in my hearing. These are
useful habits, which studious persons in general might acquire

if they would ; and many persons greatly distress themselves,

and others, by the idea that they can do nothing except in

perfect solitude or silence.

   (180.) Another great subject of my thankfulness to a good
Providence, is my perfect freedom from any embarrassment in

my circumstances, so that, without any anxiety on the subject,

my supplies have always been equal to my wants ; and now

Ithat my expenses are increased to a degree that had no con
ception of, some years ago, I am a richer man than I was, and

without laying myself out for the purpose. What is more,
this indifference about an increase of fortune has been the

means of attaining it. When I began my experiments, I ex
pended on them all the money I could possibly raise, carried

on by my ardour in philosophical investigations, and entirely

regardless of consequences, except so far as never to contract

any debt; and if this had been without success, my impru
dence would have been manifest. But having succeeded, I
was in time more than indemnified for all that I had expended.

   (181.) My theological studies, especially those which made
it necessary for me to consult the Christian fathers, &c, have

also been expensive to me. But I have found my theological

friends even more liberal than my philosophical ones, and all

beyond my expectations.

  I(182.) In reflecting on my past life, have often thought of

two sayings of Jacob. When he had lost one of his sons, and

thought of other things that were afflictions to him, he said,

348 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

" all these things are against me," at the same time that they

were in reality making for him. So the impediment in my

speech, and the difficulties of my situation at Needham, I now

see as much cause to be thankful for, as for the most brilliant

scenes in my life.
  I(183.) have also
                      applied  to myself  what   Jacob said on his
return from Padan                         staff
                     Aram, "   With my           I went over this

Jordan, and now I am become two bands ;" when I consider

how little I carried with me to Needham and Nantwich, how

Imuch more had to carry to Warrington, how much more

still to Leeds, how much more than that to Calne, and then to

Birmingham.
  I(184.) Yet, frequently as have changed my situation, and
I Ialways for the better, can truly say that never wished for
Iany change on my own account.
                                          should have been con
Itented even at Needham, if could have been unmolested, and

had bare necessaries. This freedom from anxiety was remark

able in my father, and therefore is in a manner hereditary to

me ; but it has been much increased by reflection ; having

frequently observed, especially with respect to Christian minis

ters, how often it has contributed to embitter their lives, with

out being of any use to them. Some attention to the improve

ment of a man's circumstances is, no doubt, right, because no

man can tell what occasion he may have for money, especially

if he have children, and therefore I do not recommend my ex

Iample to others. But am thankful to that good Providence

which always took more care of me than ever I took of

myself.

  I(185.) Hitherto have had great reason to be thankful with

respect to my children, as they have a prospect of enjoying a
good share of health, and a sufficient capacity for performing
the duties of their stations. They have also good dispositions,

and, as much as could be expected at their age, a sense of re

Iligion. But as I hope they will live to see this work, say the
less on this subject, and 1 hope they will consider what I say

in their favour, as an incitement to exert themselves to act a

Christian and useful part in life; that the care that I and

their mother have taken of their instruction may not be lost

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.               349

upon them, and that they may secure a happy meeting with us
in a better world.

  I(186.) esteem it a singular happiness to have lived in an
Iage and country, in which have been at full liberty both to

investigate, and by preaching and writing to propagate, reli
Igious truth ; that though the freedom
                                        have used for this

purpose was for some time disadvantageous to me, it was not

Ilong so, and that my present situation is such that can with

the greatest openness urge whatever appears to me to be the

truth of the gospel, not only without giving the least offence,

but with the entire approbation of those with whom I am par

ticularly connected.

   (187.) As to the dislike which I have drawn upon myself by

my writings, whether that of the Calvinistic party, in or out of

the Church of England, those who rank with rational Dissen

ters, (but who have been exceedingly offended at my carrying

my inquiries farther than they wished any person to do,) or

whether they be unbelievers, I am thankful that it gives less

disturbance to me than it does to themselves ; and that their

dislike is much more than compensated by the cordial esteem

and approbation of my conduct by a few, whose minds are

congenial to my own, and especially that the number of such

persons increases.

  I have now, according to my best ability, carried on

the " Memoirs of Dr. Priestley" to the end of that
largest portion of them, which, as before described, he
wrote in England, and to the last paragraph of which he
has annexed " Birmingham, 1787." The following cor
respondence, continued to the same period, will conclude
the earlier part of this Biography.

silence to any thing but a want of a most grateful remembrance
of your kind partiality to me. I was long in an unsettled state
Iafter my coming hither, and I now find that have so much to
Ido, that I hardly know what to set about first.
                                                    am almost

satisfied, however, that I did acknowledge the receipt of your

very valuable remarks on my Letters.* I have them not just

Inow at hand, but was much struck with them ; and if ever

reprint those Letters, shall certainly make much use of them.

  I have just printed a sermon that I preachedf on accepting

the invitation to the new meeting in this town, and shall desire

Mr. Johnson to send you a copy. Of the Letters to the Bishop

Iof Waterford hardly made any presents, as we only printed
Ia small number, and the work can never pay for itself. wish,

however, you may see it, and tell me how the argument im

presses you.

  I have nearly printed a fifth volume of " Experiments," &c,

and when that is quite out of the press, (which will be in a

Ifortnight or three weeks,) propose to go and spend a few
weeks in London. I should be happy if it should suit you to

meet me there.

  I was much surprised at receiving the invitation from

IExeter ,% imagining that I could not have many friends there.
   am glad to find by your account, and that of some others,

Ithat judged wrong. As far as I can judge, I have a pros

pect of being very useful and happy here. I have proposed

four classes of young persons : two I have opened already, and

two more I shall form soon. I shall also have a library for the

use of my classes, and in some measure for the congregation at
I Ilarge ; so that hope to do more in that way here than did
Iat Leeds.
            have also begun to give short explanatory notes,
&c, as I read the Scriptures, which are much attended to,
perhaps the more, as I have hitherto done this extempore.?

something more considerable, and more permanent, but I do

not know whether they are likely to succeed. This business

least illustration.

take in so good part my neglecting to write to you ; but indeed

and the sights at Birmingham. Mr. Burke, above a year ago, after having

called upon Dr. Priestley, and seen his library, laboratory, and philosophic

pursuits, with so much ease and cheerfulness carried on, reported him to all

his friends as the most happy of men, and most to be envied ; but Mr. Burke

did not see, and would BOt perhaps have relished, his Sunday work, which

lives at Birmingham, on a small fortune, but preaches fre

Iquently ; and though have said nothing to him on the subject,
I think he would prefer a respectable situation as a minister to

his present way of life. At present his health is but indiffer

Ient, but in general he is very well ; and think constant and

full employment would be of service to him. He is well qua

IIlified to give such lectures as do to young persons, and

think would choose to do it. He was educated at Warrington

Iwhen was there, and is of a very studious turn. He is the

author of a very ingenious short-hand, and several very good

pamphlets in favour of religious liberty.

  I am now on a journey for health or pleasure along with a

gentleman of my congregation, Mr. Russell, whose name you

will see in my sermon at Birmingham. I shall be three Sun

days absent, and shall get as far as Southampton ; but we shall

not stay long at any place. If you will direct to me at Mr.

Johnson's, in London, your letter will find me.
   The last edition of the " Historical View," &c.,J is the se

cond, twice as large as the first, and it is sufficiently argumen

tative, as well as historical.

                                    To Rev. C. Wyvill.*

Rev. Sir,                                          Birmingham, Feb. 14, 1782.

   I think myself much honoured by your note, and the com
munication of the Address. I am far from making myself a

Ijudge in political matters, but cannot help approving the

spirit and object of it, and hope that by these publications men

may be prepared to exert themselves with judgment and effect

whenever the state of things shall be favourable to it. At pre
sent what you call " a pause of astonishment," is, in this part

of the country, a pause of indifference. But the time must
certainly come when the subject' will force attention.f

  Though I cannot promise you much success at present, I

think it right to have such pieces as this Address in the way

of those who ought to read them, and therefore shall be ob

liged to you for a few copies of it.+

   * Rev. Christopher Wyvill had early relinquished his preferments in the

Established Church, though he never, I believe, publicly renounced her

communion. He was the intimate friend of Lindsey and Jebb ; like them,

the uniform advocate of ecclesiastical reform, though more conspicuous as

your publications, and think your reply to Mr. Sturgesf a

master-piece, and you write with that conciseness and force

I conceive that you design to mention the close of our

friendly debate in a postcript to your third letter.* As I had

not the least expectation that a controversy would ensue on
what I took the liberty to throw out in my Harmony, I sub

mit it to  you whether    a note might not be properly  subjoined
to your                                                 was occa
           words, " this   controversy was begun"--It

sioned by the remarks the Bishop made in his Harmony of the

Gospels, on the duration which I assign to our Saviour's

ministry.

  I freely confess that writing further on the subject of our

amicable controversy, would not only be uninteresting to me,

but tedious. At first I found the discussion of the point

neither unpleasing nor unprofitable. I was led to review my

Iown notions with care, and to state them with precision.

had the advantage of considering with much more attention

than I should otherwise have done, every "jot and tittle" of

Ithe gospels which related to the matter in dispute, and had

the satisfaction of frankly acknowledging my errors whenever

I felt myself confuted. But I fear that men new in controversy

are too apt to be guided by a spirit of refutation, and I am dis

posed to think that experience alone can teach a controversial

ist to conduct himself throughout with strict propriety and

decorum. I am happy, however, that you express yourself so

well satisfied with my general manner of acquitting myself,

Iand can truly say in return, that I was often struck with the

learning, ingenuity, and liberal spirit of my antagonist, and

that I consider him as a diligent investigator and sincere lover
of truth.

   You will do great honour to my late publication by giving

it an attentive perusal. I shall be happy to be favoured with

your sentiments whether any thing is wanting to the integrity
of the subject, and whether you observe any material omissions

in the several inductions of particulars. Indeed, hints of any

kind from you will conduce much to the improvement of my

book. 1 well know that in some points we maintain different

conclusions, and speculative men will always differ in many

charity to those who disagree with us.*

                  From Dr. Franklin.

       Dear Sir,              Passy, June 7, 1782.
I received your kind letter of the 7th of April, also one
of the 3rd of May. I have always great pleasure in hearing

from you, in learning that you are well, and that you continue

Iyour experiments. I should rejoice much if could once

more recover the leisure to search with you into the works of
Inature.
          mean the inanimate, not the animate or moral part
of them. The more I discovered of the former, the more I
Iadmired them. The more I know of the latter, the more am
Idisgusted with them. Men find to be a sort of beings very

badly constructed, as they are generally more easily provoked

than reconciled, more disposed to do mischief to each other

than to make reparation, much more easily deceived than un

deceived, and having more pride, and even pleasure, in killing

than in begetting one another; for, without a blush, they

assemble in great armies, at noon-day, to destroy, and when

they have killed as many as they can, they exaggerate the

number, to augment the fancied glory.

   In what light we are viewed by superior beings may be

gathered from a piece of late West-India news, which possibly

has not yet reached you. A young angel of distinction being

sent down to this world on some business, for the first time,

had an old courier-spirit assigned him as a guide. They

arrived over the seas of Martinico, in the middle of the long

day of obstinate fight between the fleets of Rodney and De

Grasse. When, through the clouds of smoke, he saw the fire

of the guns, the decks covered with mangled limbs, and bodies

dead, or dying, the ships sinking, burning, or blown into the

air, and the quantity of pain, misery, and destruction, the

crews yet alive were thus, with so much eagerness, dealing

round to one another ; he turned angrily to his guide and said,

" You blundering blockhead, you are ignorant of your busi
ness. You undertook to conduct me to the earth, and you

Ihave brought me into hell." " No, Sir," says the guide, "

have made no mistake. This is really the earth, and these

are men. Devils never treat one another in this cruel manner.

They have more sense, and more of what men (vainly) call

humanity."

  But, to be serious, my dear old friend, I love you as much

as ever, and 1 love all the honest souls that meet at the London

Coffee House. I only wonder how it happened that they and

my other friends in England came to be such good creatures
Iin the midst of so perverse a generation.

I shewed your letter to the Duke de la Rochefoucault, who

thinks with me, that the new experiments you have made are

extremely curious, and he has given me, thereupon, a note

Iwhich Iinclose, and request you would furnish me with the

answer desired.

Yesterday the Count du Nord* was at the Academy of

Sciences, when sundry experiments were exhibited for his enter

tainment, among them one by M. Lavoisier,f to shew that the
strongest fire we yet know is made in a charcoal, blown upon
with dephlogisticated air. In a heat so produced he melted

platina presently ; the fire being much more powerful than

Jthat of the strongest burning mirror.

Dear Sir,              Birmingham, June 9, 1782.
I am so very confident that you will not ascribe my not
writing to you to any want of friendship, that I am perhaps in

Iduced to trespass too much upon your patience. However,

am always happy to hear from you, and hope you will not

omit writing whenever you have any thing to communicate to

me. T shall not fail to do the same, when I think it really im

  I can say nothing about Mr. Palmer that I have not said

already. You will never find any man perfect, or without
some disagreeable peculiarities; but if you will be content with

a man of very considerable ability, of a studious turn of mind,

an excellent composer, and with a voice and delivery much

superior to mine, together with the most unexceptionable con

duct, you will find them in Mr. Palmer. As to politeness, he

Iis no way deficient, and has as much of it as think a student

and a minister ought to have. In my opinion, you will hardly

find a man more to your own liking than he is. Indeed, as he

can live very well independent of preaching, I hardly think he

will listen to an invitation to Exeter, were it not that your

climate and neighbourhood to the sea would probably be more

favourable to his health than this. He is obliged to visit the

sea pretty often.

  As you wish to know what I am about, I will tell you all
the particulars that I think will interest you. 1,1 have just

printed oft' seven " Additional Letters to a Philosophical Un

believer," in answer to one Mr. Hammon, a professed Atheist.*

2, I am likewise printing two sermons, preached at meetings of
ministers, one " dh Habitual Devotion,"t part of which you

heard me deliver at Exeter,J and the other printed, but not

This has been so much expected, that I much fear it will dis
Iappoint my friends when they see it. However, have done
the best I could; and I think I have shewn, satisfactorily
enough, when and by what means every thing that I deem to

be an innovation in the original system took place. My trea

also sending to the press a new edition of my Disquisitions and

wish, for all the use that I could make of the philosophy of

Jthe apostolical age, you will find in my " Disquisitions."
But the divisions at Corinth seem to have been similar to those

which prevailed in the schools of philosophy in general, one

man boasting of one teacher, and another of another, without

supposing any great difference among them.

   Dear Sir,                           Birmingham, Oct. 12, 1782.

I was very happy that you had the goodness to go to Mr.

Christie's at my request, and that the journey proved so

agreeable to you. Mr. Christie, indeed, seems to be a most

excellent man, and certainly he has great fortitude in entering

with so much spirit on the scheme I ventured to recommend

by laying less stress on liberal education; and with proper

grand apostacy. His position is, that Christianity is able to subsist by its

own energies, which I believe to be true. But that these energies are to be
found, pure and uncorrupted, in any religious society as such, I believe not.

Religious society may be edifying on some occasions, and to a certain degree.

But you must seek for the operation of the genuine Christian energies, in

the honest, intelligent, and impartial individual, who, in his practical exer

cises of this kind, must not look up to his church or his sect, either for light

or consolation. The Scriptures are his only resource, without the interpre.

tations of his bishops or his elders : and from thence, simple and unlearned
as he may be, he may derive ' the answer of a good conscience towards

God,' not to be had merely from church membership, which is too often a

belong not to his class) have had great advantage in meeting with absurd
antagonists, bad reasoners, and not masters of their subject. But Mr.

I like the plan of the work you have in view, and think

that having got rid of your school, &c, you will have leisure

for it. A history of the Reformation at large would be a more

useful work still.

of it. In the " General Conclusion" of my " History of the

Corruptions of Christianity," I give a challenge to Mr. Gib

best for plants, which would render it fit for respiration. Such
air would be yielded in abundance by volcanoes, from calca

plants before there were any land animals.*

be sufficient for this purpose, as I only wish you to note either
any thing materially wrong, or any capital oversight. It is not

yet properly arranged, and very inaccurate in many respects.*

                   To Rev. Joseph Bretland.I
       Dear Sir,
                                               Birmingham, Nov. 11, 1783.
I thank you for the trouble you have given yourself to

transcribe so much from Przipscovius,% though a reference

would have been sufficient, as I have the work. But that you

could not know, and I should not have found it myself. I

think Przipscovius has no authority for supposing that any

Jews left the Ebionites, and joined the Gentile Christians.
Indeed, it is my opinion, that, as Jews, they are to be distin

guished by their peculiar rites and ceremonies to the end of

the world. §

  I expect to print off my letter to Dr. Horsley this week.
You will then see on what ground I stand, and perhaps it

might have a good effect if you and others of my friends should
give me some assistance. A translation of Przipcovius, or
extracts from him, would, I think, be very useful ; and your

remarks in your last were very judicious, and would do good.

sey to Mr. Turner, Jun., " Oct. 18, 1783," in connexion with the previous

con''trOovuerrsfyrie: nd Dr. Priestley has been driven out to sea by the adverse

power, and violent storms and tempests conjured up against him since the

dat"e  of your letter ; but he  will ride out  of them all triumphantly.        is
       His answer to the first   very unfair   attack of the Monthly Reviewer,

temperate and manly, not only defending his subject in every material point,

but illustrating it still further. I have no doubt but this last renewed

assault, from the same hand, but with less plausible pretences, will be easily

repelled. But it is to be lamented, though it cannot be remedied, that the

Reviewer speaks to thousands every month, but who looks into a theological

controversial pamphlet? Still, however, I have no doubt but the truth, which

Dr. Priestley defends, will come out more, and, perhaps, soon, entire from

this opposition. The Reviewer will be noticed in an appendix to a very

masterly account,  which    the doctor   has   oaflrewahdicyhdrIahwanveuspe,enof"DrO. rHigo.rslMeyS'.s

Remarks on the Reviewer* would do well for the public

papers, to counteract the extensive spread of the Review. But
Iall this must be left to every person's own judgment.

perfectly easy as to the issue of this business, but time will be

requisite.

  I am in haste now, and therefore hope you will excuse a

short letter, and please to deliver the inclosed to Mr. Manning.

     Dear Sir,                                     Birmingham, Nov. 11, 1783.

      Dr. Priestley is, at present, over head and ears in his experiments, and

taken up, as to theological matters, with the work cut out for him by Dr.
Horsley and the Reviewer. From this last review of Mr. Cappe's excellent

and just piece of criticism, as well as from the whole of their conduct, it

appears that it is resolved, if possible, to run down Dr. Priestley's work.

We shall, however, soon see his reply to both, and some efforts made to

                    To Rev. Joshua Toulmin.*

Dear Sir,                   Birmingham, Nov. 26, 1783.
II hope you will not take it amiss that have not written

to you sooner, as you cannot think it owing to any want of
respect, but only of time, and because nothing material de

pended upon it.

  IMr. Foot's piece I have, and I thank you for a sight of Mr.

Barker's, and shall return it by Mr. Johnson. I cannot say
Ithat find any thing materially new in it ; but the impression

that the same arguments make on different minds is very

great, and is a humbling consideration to us all.

   I have desired Mr. Johnson to send you a copy of my Letters
to Dr. Horsley, and at your leisure shall be glad of your

thoughts on the subject. I am informed that Mr. Badcock is

the writer in the Monthly Review, and think it probable.

        Dear Sir,          Birmingham, Aug. 12, 1784.
The expiration of franks reminds me of what I ought to
have done long ago ; but really I have never been so busy in
my life, and therefore have hardly written to any body. I am

now just finishing for the press my Reply to Dr. Horsley.t

only the choice of different methods of exposing the same
Ithing. In about a month imagine my piece may be ready

the moderns.

  I do not wonder at your affliction on the death of your ex
cellent mother ; but I think it is impossible that you should
want any argument for consolation that I can supply. I cannot

say but that the doctrine of an intermediate state would be

more consoling than that of sleeping in the grave ; but as the

Scriptures say nothing of  presume, with you, that there

discussion ; and as it will be open to any query or difficulty
relating to religion, and it is wished that the writers should
conceal their names,* it is hoped that many persons may

derive great assistance from it in their inquiries. A particular

account of the plan of the work may be seen in the Introduc
tion to it.f

* This very fair proposal, according to the approved method of duly

estimating the force of argument, non quis, sed quid, immediately called

forth the following vituperation           against anonymous            s"ignthaeturlaens gufraogme           an un-

          this the conduct of free, ingenuous inquiry,

ism, and the insidious slyness of present Presbyterianism ? Will Dr. Priest

ley set his own name to every sentiment he holds forth in print ; and will he

invite assassins to stab religion in the dark ? Let Dr. Priestley reflect how

he can answer, not to his Saviour, for he has disavowed him, but to his

God and Judge, for this insidious         conduct."                     some of the professors                of our
   P. Q. R. concludes by desiring
                                          " to awaken
pure and holy religion to enter the lists in defence of ' the faith once de

livered to the saints ;' and without regard to establishments, creeds or con

fessions, tell the undecided or deluded multitude whether the truth is in
Priestley or Jesus." Gent.Mag. LV. 1 12.

The following remarks of Philuleutherut soon appeared on the other

sid"e: If P. Q. R. knows Dr. Priestley, I think he would not, and if he does
not know him, I am sure he should not, talk in a manner that excites an

"indignation and contempt, which it is very difficult to suppress.

should have written to you before this time, but I think
I have never been more busy in my life; but I am now a little

at leisure, having finished my larger History of Opinions con

Icerning Christ, and even transcribed it for the press ; but

have not yet looked into the work you favoured me with, or
Iany other modern writer.
                                                     have composed the whole from

original writers, to whom I have not less than 1500 references,
Iand about 1000 translated passages.
                                                                     think my labour well

bestowed. The whole will make two volumes in 8vo.

  I have the most abundant evidence for every thing that I
Ihave advanced in my late controversy, and think shall throw

much new light on the opinions of ancient times. Some things

that are very new, or of a doubtful nature, I shall previously
insert in the Repository, which I suppose you will see. At
Ipresent the sale is trifling, hardly sufficient, believe, to pay
for the advertising ; but I shall not be discouraged. I thank

you for the article you sent me.f

  I shall be much obliged to you if you will take my English
Grammar under your own care, as if it was your own, and

make whatever additions or alterations you think proper ; and

Iif you choose, will write you a short letter, which you may

insert in the preface, requesting it as a favour that you would

do so. I cannot attend to these matters now.
  I hope to be favoured with more matter proper for the Re

pository from you and your friends. At present the contri
butors are but few. All the signatures in the first number are
my own, except Christophilos* This for your own satisfac
tion. In No. 3, 1 am considering the miraculous conception,

about which you wished me to be cautious. When it is

finished, I shall like to know what you think of the argument.
You will probably have a good deal more under the signature
of Pamphilus. What think you of Christophilos? I expect

great things from him.

  I propose to set out for London on Monday, and wish you

would write to me there. Direct for me at Mr. Johnson's, 77,

St. Paul's. I shall stay, if all be well, about three weeks.

  I have had no answer from Mr. Taylor, of Portsmouth, to

my challenge in the Repository.f I wish much for some

The MS. contains a copy of old Mr. Wesley's diary, and

letters written by his daughters to the distant members of the

family, relating to some strange noises* heard in the house, all

fin the hand-writing of Mr. Samuel Wesley. Not long before

my removal from Calne, I lent it to some person who visited

  If I have not written to you of late, it has been owing to
Inothing but the necessity am under of writing as few letters
Ias possible. Indeed, never write to any person but on some

particular business. There are few persons of whose critical

Isagacity I think more highly than I do of yours, and shall be

thankful for your communications for the Theological Repo
Isitory, which have opened again. But hitherto the sale will
Inot pay for advertising.
                           shall, however, venture another

IThough am obliged to write as few letters as I possibly
Ican, you see do not entirely forget you, and I write with the

not fall a second time, if it can be supported by proper mate

least for the present.

Dear Sir,                 London, April 21, 1786.
I give you this line to inform you that I am just arrived in
London and shall be very happy to see you if your business

should call you hither in a fortnight, or perhaps three weeks,

which is the utmost extent of my stay in London. I shall also

be glad to see you at any time in Birmingham, but I shall

have more leisure here ; and this approaching summer I pro

pose to make an excursion, which will probably be sudden,
and I do not know which way.

The papers with which you favoured me are all safe at Mr.

Johnson's, directed for you. They were submitted to my

privy council, but though much approved, were not thought to

be sufficiently original or important, considering the precarious

state of the Repository; so that we must, in the first place,

make room for things of the greatest consequence. We have

no wish on any other account to decline the discussion of the

fquestion concerning baptism.

       Dear Sir,                                          Birmingham, June 13, 1786.
   I am much obliged to you for the favour of your letter,

though, using a different short hand, I was not able to read it.

My friend Mr. Scholefield, who writes the same short-hand,

read it to me. He will not betray the secret you mentioned,

Ithough would not advise any person to publish any thing
under the idea of its being a secret long. I had heard of your
intention before, though I do not recollect from whom. I

hope, however, this will not make you lay aside your design. As

your scheme is not Athanasianism, Arianism, nor Socinianism,

II wish much to see it well explained, as really have no idea

what it can be.

   Not seeing any letter of yours in the Gentleman's Magazine,

I concluded that you would write a pamphlet, and therefore

                                      as you will see, in paragraph subjoined
have referred to                  it,                     a

concerning John the Baptist.* In my opinion, it throws great
light on the whole of the Gospel history.

  Dr. Price, I believe, will publish a volume of sermons, in

which will be some on the person of Christ;! but he is slow

in all his proceedings. Mr. Cappe's Psalms, I hear, are printed

in a good large type. 1 expect them in October.

  I have not seen Dr. Toulmin " On the Eternity of the

World," nor have I yet read our friend Toulmin's piece on
Baptism.? I meant no particular discovery in what I said in

do not mention it.*

                   To Rev. Joshua ToulMiN.f

      Dear Sir,                           Birmingham, Oct. 6, 1786.

  I thank you for your excellent answer to Mathetes^ It will

appear in the next number of the Repository, along with a

supplement, by Mr. Bretland, to his former remarks §. They
are both quite in point, and yet neither of them supersedes

the other. The same will probably be the case with your

answer to Eubulus. || You will observe that several answers to

the same thing do very well ; and I think that, as the con

ductor of the work, I shall do well to avoid entering into a
direct controversy in it myself, if I can well avoid it.

  I am glad that my " History," and " Letters to the Jews,"

have given you any satisfaction. I find they are much noticed
by that people in this country, but I do not expect to make

any converts soon: their prejudices against Christianity are

deep-rooted.

  I shall be obliged to you for the piecelf you mention on the
satisfaction of Christ, especially if it be short. I do not see

what you can make of the Life of Biddle. There appears to

me to be no materials for it. But you must be a better judge

than I am. I have no doubt you will make something useful

of it.

  IWe have been very happy in your son's company, and

should rejoice exceedingly to have such a neighbour. I do

not know any young minister so promising as he seems to be.

I expect great things from him, especially as supposed, he
                                          if,

   I am now busy in writing a continuation of my " Letters to
a Philosophical Unbeliever." They will probably be printed

the next winter or spring.

   I am just returned from an excursion to the North, from

which my health has derived considerable advantage.*

             To Rev. C. RotheRam.f

Dear Sib,                       Birmingham, Oct. 23, 1786.
According to my promise, I send you a copy of my cor
Jrespondence with Mr. Gibbon, and some sermons of Mr.

Graham's.

  I think I likewise promised you a copy of one of Mr. Bad-

cock's letters to me, that you might compare his former sen

timents and conduct [with] his present.'§ This, if I can get
it done to-morrow, shall go with this parcel ; if not, at some

future opportunity.

  II returned home quite free from any indisposition, and,
thank God, continue quite well. Since my return, I have

applied to my " Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever," and

hope to have them ready for the press in a few weeks.

  I do not find that any Jews in England will reply to my Let

ters to them, though I am told they are universally read among

Ithem ; but they say shall probably have an answer from a

Jew at Vienna. I am happy, however, to have gained the

attention of the Jews ; and if it be kept up, some good may in

time come of it.

  I beg my respectful compliments to Dr. Ainslie, and also to

your niece, though unknown. ||

                               To Dr. Price.*

Dear Friend,                              Birmingham, Jan. 7, 1787-

I have received the valuable present of your sermons,f and
cannot express how much I admire the greater part of them,

especially the first ; but indeed, in every thing that relates to

candour, I never expect to find your equal. The discourse on
the resurrection of Lazarus is very excellent. I wish all our

unbelievers would read it.

These sermons of yours are sure to be universally read, and

cannot fail to make a great impression ; and as your defence of

Arianism is calculated to strike the generality of your readers,

who are now attentive to the subject, we Socinians cannot but

think ourselves called upon to make some reply ; and though

you may not choose to enter into the controversy, others may

be induced to take it up.

   Your very particular and highly respectful notice of mej

by which I think myself highly honoured, will be thought to
be a call upon me to say something in defence of what I
have advanced ; and as you have no object but truth, I am
Iconfident you will not be displeased if address a friendly
Iletter to yourself, at the close of some that have written to
Dr. Horne. It is so seldom that controversy is conducted

with decency and propriety, as becomes Christians, that I

think a fair opportunity of giving a specimen should not be

omitted. We have already given one example of this, which

I hope has had its use ; and you may be assured that this letter
will not be inferior to any thing that I have ever written in

personal respect.

  I am glad to have an opportunity of writing in a respectful

manner to Dr. Horne,§ and at the same time I address the

dour appears to be such as will not suffer him to evade any fair inference

from his opinions." Again, as "a highly valued friend, and one of the

ters are very serious, and, though without any just cause, will
perhaps give more offence than any thing that I have yet pub

lished of this kind.

  I am printing my " Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever,"

but we are hindered by the reprinting of the former letters,

Iin order to make the whole one volume. With this work
I Ihave taken a good deal of pains ; and yet cannot say that

am at all sanguine in my expectations from it. Unbelievers

will not read these things. However, if the faith of believers,
who will read, be strengthened, a good end will be answered.

the Repository, in Mr. Palmer, who was buried on Monday

4-02 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

cannot now look back to the date of the subscriptions, for
which I am much obliged to you ; but I think it wrong to take
Iof Dissenting ministers.
                                                         think to finish this volume, and

then make a longer pause, that the sale may, if possible, indem

nify me. It is a scheme that I will not abandon if I can keep

it up.
I have printed those Letters to Unbelievers which relate to
Ithe evidences of Christianity.*
                                                                    believe I shall set about

compiling a set of Psalms on my return from London.

  I can give you no particular advice about your Sunday-
schools. I have reprinted my small catechism, with some im

provements. Gastrellf will not at all answer your purpose.

I hear that young Mr. Toulmin is about to print an excellent

scriptural catechism. Mr. Lindsey has seen it.

  I shall be very happy to see your answer to Mr. Lamport.j

             To Rev. T. Lindsey.§

    Dear Friend,                                         Birmingham, March 20, 1787.
I take this opportunity, by means of Mr. Kenrick, to in
close a letter for Mr. French, at Ware, which I beg you would

forward to him, together with a copy of my Letters to Dr.
Horne, &c I also inclose Mr. Tayleur's and Mr. F

letters. How carefully the latter avoids giving his opinion on

the subject of Arianism !

  I have a letter from Mr. Robson, of Newcastle, that will
please you ; but as I wish to shew it to Mr. Russell, I will
bring it with me. I now fully intend to be with you on Tues
Iday next, and shall call upon you before go any where else,

getting out of the coach at the turnstile, or rather in Oxford

Street, where I remember the coach always waits a long time.
I Ineed not say that promise myself much pleasure from our

interview; but we must not forget that there is no earthly

happiness that is not subject to disappointment and alloy.

  I wish you would inform Mr. Johnson that I have not yet

The Repository will be printed off this week, but it will

sufficiently appear that the very bold article is not mine, by
Iother articles that are so.                    shall have two, one on " Difficul

you speak of in London. We in the country think they must

be men of strong minds indeed, who can believe that any mere

man is naturally impeccable or infallible ; but, as you say, more
of this when we meet.

  I Ihave lately composed two sermons, which intend to
Igive you. have another on the anvil, and intend to compose

more, a kind of suite, on the spirit and influence of the gospel.
I hear that Dr. Horsley is publishing on the subject of the
ITest Act.
                   hope he will be properly and speedily answered.
I wish Mr. Walker, of Nottingham, would do it. He would

printed another number, to be published the first of September.

be satisfied with your answer, and that of Mr. Bretland, and

he would do himself great credit under the same signature,            I if,

II     hope you would receive mine by Mr. Kenrick soon after

believe he has done all he can in the business, so that must

take its chance. Our disappointment!: will at least give occa

eyes of the more sensible part of the public, and may in time

make our adversaries ashamed. As to the thing itself, would

am not much concerned about it.

there should be some things to remind Dissenters that they

are not of this world. In too many particulars they are suffi

ciently conformed to and favoured by it.

II    do not envy the bishops and Dr. Horsley their present

triumph. They have not the peace and satisfaction of mind

that we have and                  too much to expect to enjoy bur ad

406 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

IIYou will perhaps smile at a work think may possibly

undertake, merely because it is much wanted, an Ecclesiastical

History, at least of some of the first centuries. All that we

have are on Trinitarian principles, and impress all readers in
Ifavour of them.
                               think, too, it may be so drawn up, as to be

sufficiently interesting, and not very long or tedious. When

I Isee you, shall talk with you about this, and some other

schemes.*

        Dear Friend,                                                Birmingham, May 6, 1787.
I hope you received the packet I sent you by Mr. Johnson,
                               I have just received a letter from
inclosing a letter to you.
                               in which he says " the Undergra
Mr. Hinton, of Oxford,
duate's Letterf is much extolled," which is the very thing I

wished to hear, as it gives a greater propriety to an answer.

I would not have you hurry yourself at all, but I think you

should be readyj in about a month. It should not, I still think,

be printed here, because, as it is anonymous, it will then be laid
to my door. I wish also you would be rather sparing in your

compliments, lest it should be said on discovery that we play

into one another's hands.

Ithough cannot say that I think a letter to the Gentleman's

Magazine would have been less proper, and it would have been

less expensive. My former declaration was annexed to an

advertisement of a book, therefore shewed less alarm than the

present, and there is, in truth, less cause for it. A more

Ipeevish and ill-judged performance than Mr. Howes's hardly

ever saw. I shall be in no haste to reply ; and the more the

adversary triumphs in the more satisfaction will give me.

       Dear Friend,                     Birmingham, June 11, 1787.
   I take the opportunity of Mr. Finch's going to town, to

give you these few lines.
   IOn Sunday sent you a letter for the Gentleman's Magazine,
Iwhich, hope, has come to hand, and shall be glad to know
Iwhether it can be inserted.*
                                        think also to advertise my

History on the cover of the Monthly Review, with a short

notice respecting Mr. Howes. I shall send it to you in time.

By proceeding in this manner, one pamphlet in the course of

the year may answer our purpose, perhaps better than more.

It will shew that we are not disturbed with hasty censures,

and trust to serious argument. Mr. Howes is certainly entitled

to no sort of respect.§

  I have received David Levi's Letters. They are below my
Iexpectation ; so much so, that hardly think it will be worth

I have been rather unfortunate, twice together, in sending

parcels which arrived just after you had set out on a week's

excursion. In neither case, however, was it of much conse

quence. By this time I hope you have received my second
set of " Letters to the Jews."+ with the accounts of the presents

to send one to Mr. Maseres.§

two of them composed by nobody knows whom, and nobody knows where.

My creed is derived from my Saviour, and the time when and the manner in
which it was uttered, gives it a title to pre-eminence. A few hours before
his death, in an address to his Father, Christ says, ' This is eternal life, to
know thee, the only true God ; and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.' This

is my creed, and happy would it be for the Christian world if it had been

I hope you will inform me.

  I have so much to do in printing, that I shall not be able
Ito leave Birmingham these three months. After this shall

perhaps take a ride, with Mr. Russell, to Bristol and South
Wales, to call upon my son Henry, who will be with Mr.
Estlin, and to see Mr. Morris, who has written to me twice,

to desire that something may be done to establish an Unitarian
Iinterest at Swansea,* where he lives.
                                           do not fancy the man ;

but Mr. Russell thinks favourably of him. He proposes to

give a hundred pounds towards building a place of worship.

Perhaps, on finding that things are not yet ripe for that, he

may do something in another way. Mr. Russell is intent on

a subscription to support the cause in general, and will cheer

fully give twenty pounds a-year, or more, if it be wanted.

        Dear Friend,                         Birmingham, July 27, 1787.

I have received the two tracts for Mr. Russell; but not
IMr. Wiche's piecef for myself. If you call again, dare say

you will still find it at Mr. Johnson's. The great Doctor's,
Iwhich, at your recommendation, sent for, is a poor business

indeed. Mr. Madan's, which he sent me, is the most violent

Jand menacing that I have yet seen.

The Bishop of our diocese was here last Sunday, confirming,

and to each person confirmed, he gave a small tract on con
Ifirmation, and another against Socinianism, and myself (as
Iam told) in particular.
                                             have not yet seen it.

tells him that the time will come when he would give the whole world for

one glimpse of this great mystery of godliness. In short, he sentences the

poor Doctor to pains and penalties in this world, and to eternal damnation

in the next." Mon. Rev. LXXVII. 419.

                           To the Same.

      Dear Friend,                     Birmingham, Aug. 26, 1787.
I now think it a long time indeed since your last, which

was from Richmond, and in which you said you hoped to be

in London in ten days, and should then write again.

  The Archdeacon had, indeed, an euthanasia,* and I find his

friend, the Bishop of Carlisle, died about the same time, and

about the same age.f They have been useful men in their

day, and you justly observe, none are without their failings,

Iand least of all great minds. This see confirmed, and I am

sorry to see it so much so, in Beausobre's History of the Re

formation,J which I have read through with peculiar satis

faction. Luther had great defects indeed, and of a very dis

agreeable kind, especially envy, and dislike of other Reformers.

He wished all to follow him, and was angry if they went one
step farther. His behaviour to Carlostadt§ and Zuinglius.H &c

is inexcusable. But he had great and good qualities notwith

standing, and would, I doubt not, have been an intrepid martyr.

ought to hare done him the more justice. But pride, envy, and malice,

enter especially into the soul of those men, who, uniting fortunate issues

with great talents, are desirous of bearing rule every where, and cannot

endure the smallest contradiction. This is what Zuinglius has experienced
from Luther and his followers." History, I. 266.

   Zuinglius, it appears,  had offended    th"e   self-importance  of the German
reformer, by counselling    Christians to        call no man on    earth, master."

His"  language       (Opera, I. 38,)  is thus rendered  by Dr-   Macaulay:    Let him
      Let no        man inquire of     another whether    he is  a Lutheran.

how far he is pleased, how far he is delighted, with the Word of God. Let

416 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

  Beausobre is far more satisfactory than Sleidan ; but I am sorry

· that he goes no further than the year 1530. He certainly
   meant to have written more. The last volume is particularly

   interesting.*

     To-morrow I and my wife set out on a journey to Castle-
  head, where I spent a month about this time the last year,
  and from which I returned so much recruited. I hope for the
  same benefit now, though I have not so much to complain of
  as I had then ; and yet 1 have some unpleasant symptoms. I

   propose to be absent three Sundays, which is near a month,

  and shall write to you when I have been there about a week.
  In the mean time, I shall be happy to hear from you (Castle

   Head, near Lancaster). Then your letters will be peculiarly

  Iacceptable, as shall be almost out of the world, and hear

  nothing. I do not mean, however, to be quite idle. On my

 Ijourney the last year, wrote the greatest part of my " Letters
  Ito a Philosophical Unbeliever," and though do not intend to
  Ido much, hope to find time to do something, at least in

   reading.

    I shall be glad to see the Archdeacon's posthumous pieces,
  especially the Memoirs of himself ;f though I hope there will

  be nothing about me in them. I am sorry to see you left out
  in the management of that affair ; though I doubt not we may

   confide in the prudence of those who have the trust,

     I really never read Mr. Christie's sermons, they were so

  wretchedly printed. Your own Catechist would be a much

  better thing to distribute, and extracts from your other writ
  ings. In a letter from Mr. Palmer in Scotland, you will see
  he corresponds with Mr. Robinson, of Cambridge, as an avowed
  Unitarian. But he ought to make a public declaration, after

  what he has written. 5

fRayner's present fully compensates for all that I expect to

find deficient in the subscription to my experiments, this year;

Iand I shall write to her the next pacquet make up for you.

In the mean time, please to present my most thankful acknow

ledgments.

  Your account I really cannot allow, as I know of no debt for
my pamphlets. You will allow me then, when I see you, to

Irectify this. When give you so much trouble about them

before publication, it would be hard indeed to pay for them

afterwards.

  IOn the day you wrote to me, you would receive, hope, my

MSS. &c The sheets of the Lectures I would not have you

return at all, and only at your entire leisure; within about six

Iweeks from that time, wish you to peruse them. It is a
Itask I ought not to impose upon you ; but am got into the

habit of considering you as a part of myself, and, on that

account, may sometimes lay too much upon you.

   You will find your queries answered in the letter inclosed in

the parcel. I shall send the numbers of the BibleJ as they are

printed, and hope you will not he displeased with it. Their

want of paper gives me more time. What I have done has
given me such a taste for the work, that I could almost resolve

to publish a corrected translation of the whole Bible. But
when you see what I have done, we will talk about this and

other projects.§

                                 To Rev. J. P. Estlin.*

      Dear Sib,                                    Birmingham, Nov. 22, 1787.
I am much obliged to you for the information you gave me
about my son.f I think myself happy in having him under

your care, in more respects than one, and hope it will be a

means of improving our acquaintance. Whenever you can

Imake it convenient to you, hope you and Mrs. Estlin will

always make my house your home, and perhaps in some vaca

tion you may contrive to spend some time with us.
I am printing the Lectures on History, which you heard (I
jsuppose) at Warrington.                           When they are out of the press, I

shall beg your acceptance of a copy, as also of some Letters

I am printing to Dr. Geddes, Dr. Price, and others, on the

controversy relating to the person of Christ.

  At present I am very busy in my experiments, and have

lately made some that are very interesting with respect to the

theory of Chemistry ; but this, I believe, is a subject that you

have little time to attend to.

  I beg my respectful compliments to Mrs. and Miss Estlin. §

422 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEV.

                        To Dr. Price.*

      Dear Friend,               Birmingham, Dec. 4, 1787.
I was happy to find that you had relieved yourself from the

burden of the academy. I always said it was a thing that you

ought not to have undertaken.f It is a kind of work that suits

only men in younger life, and men of good health and spirits.

  In about a month I shall have printed off my " Lectures on
History and General Policy," which I delivered at Warring
If Iton. had been near you I should gladly have read some

parts of them to you, as you are a much better judge of the

Isubject than I can pretend to be. The first opportunity
Ihave, shall beg your acceptance of a copy.

   I received the copy you was so obliging as to send me of the

third edition of your treatise on Morals.J I was glad to find

subjoined to it the argument a. priori, though you know it does

not give me satisfaction. I wish, however, that every thing

may be fairly laid before the public, and then valeat quantum

valere potest. You have certainly done Dr. Clarke ample jus

tice, much more than he did himself, on this, as well as other

subjects.

  I have just finished the printing of my annual controversial

pamphlet, consisting of " Letters to Dr. Geddes," yourself, and
" the Candidates for Orders in the two Universities." It is a

great pleasure to me to address a candid opponent ; and I am

confident I have said nothing that can displease either Dr.

Geddes or yourself. We unavoidably see things in different

lights ; and whatever be the cause of the mistake, there is little

probability of our ever discovering it in ourselves. Others

must see it for us ; and to enable them to do  it,

                                                       I

Iwill be the last Arian antagonist I shall have.
                                                             am very

severe upon Mr. Howes, and also on the Undergraduate, who

IIis said to be Dr. Horhe ; but received the information after

had written my reply.

  I forget what experiments I gave you an account of in my

last. I have lately determined two things of considerable con

sequence ; one is           that very great proportion of the weight
                     is,    is a
of fixed air water. This have ascertained by the loss of
                                  aI
water in the production of fixed air from terra ponderosa, whichII

will not give any without water.

   The other, which               of more consequence,  is,  that by the

decomposition of dephlogisticated and inflammable air, (the

former from manganese, and the latter from iron with water,)

I  get very little water, but considerable quantity of acid,

which appears to be the vitriolic.           shall next use other kinds
                                           have also other things in
of pure and inflammable air.

did not sufficiently consult the propriety and delicacy that the

did it with respect to all, as I have no other resource to maintain

me, I must give almost my whole time to teaching^, in some

form or other, and could do nothing for the public at large.
IBut do not like to think or speak of any thing unpleasant.

I confide in a good Providence, and generally look to the bright

side of every thing. And being engaged so far as I now am,
I shall devote what remains of the active part of my life to
whatever public service I am qualified for. As I consider
Mrs. Rayner's kindness as procured by you, I shall always
consider you and Mrs. Lindsey as my best friends ; and if I

have been of any use in the world, you are the cause of it.

  I cannot think of undertaking the translation of the Bible
without you. IIndeed, see so many passages in the Hagio-
grapha and the Prophets, that I can make nothing of, that I
am much discouraged, and yet I would willingly give three or
four years to the business, if I thought I should do any good.

When I see you, we will talk farther about it. I will get
Merrick on the Psalms without troubling you. I see Lowth

and Blayney quote Darell on the Prophets. Is there any such

book ?

  Please to send a copy of the pamphlet to Mr. Constable. I

am now about some important experiments, and shall write to

Dr. Heberden about them soon.

  When I look back, and see what I wrote last night, I am

ashamed to have said so much about myself.

PRINTED BY GEOIIGE SMALLFIELD, HACKNIY.  ,

                       PREFACE.

  The epistolary part of this biography has so extended,
as to preclude, were I prepared to attempt it, a recapi
tulation of the controversies in which Dr. Priestley en
gaged, the various censures to which his writings gave
occasion, and the final determinations of his own judg
ment, especially on the most important questions of
human interest. No small satisfaction on all these points
may, however, be readily obtained, from numerous pas
sages in the twenty-five volumes of his Works, and, above
all, in the Memoirs and Correspondence. Yet it is scarcely
possible not to regret, with Mr. Priestley, that his father's
important occupations during his last days, and his sub
sequent rapid decline, should have prevented the per
formance of his purpose, to leave behind him a farther
Continuation of his Memoirs, including "a summary
of his religious opinions," and " a statement of all
that appeared to him essential to the Christian belief and
the Christian character."

   To Mr. Priestley's own Continuation I am too much
indebted, not to employ the earliest occasion of com
plying with his request, on accepting the former part of
this biography. After saying, " 1 still hope to be able to
publish an uniform edition of the whole of my father's
Works," he adds, very kindly, " no one can feel more ob
liged to you than I do for collecting in one edition all my
father's theological works ; nor have I suffered the idea
that it might be the means of delaying the execution of
my own plan, to lessen the sense of that obligation."

                                        AS

IV PREFACE.

                                                                                            t

Mr. Priestley, however, thus proceeds : " We differ in
our views as to the propriety of publishing his Correspon
dence ; and as your remarks have a tendency to injure
me in the esteem of many persons, whose good opinion I
value, may I request you, in the second part of the Me
moirs, to state that you are satisfied of the propriety of
my conduct ?"

    That satisfaction I beg leave most unequivocally to
express, or rather to repeat ; for, in the former Preface,
 I fully designed to be so understood, when describing
Mr. Priestley's " sense of propriety" as " the only hin
drance to a compliance with my request ;" and I trust
 that to my " remarks" will not be generally imputed an
 injurious " tendency." It appears, indeed, that Dr.
 Priestley's own practice would powerfully influence his
 son's determination, which I took the liberty to regret.
 After saying, " the greater part of the letters which my
 father received, prior to the riots at Birmingham, were de
 stroyed," Mr. Priestley adds, " what was a sufficient in
 timation to me, he destroyed all the letters he had received
 from Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Belsham to the end of the
 year 1802." Few readers of this biography, I trust,
 will regret the very different practice of Dr. Priestley's
 correspondents ; though there have been too many in
 stances, and some very modern, which may appear to
 confirm the judgment of Sir Henry Wotton, who in
 scribed over his fire-place, optimus secretariorum.

          CHAPTER I.

             (1787-1791.)

  The Memoirs in which Dr. Priestley had related,
with characteristic simplicity, the most important and
influential occurrences and occupations of a greatly va
ried life, from infancy to his .54th year, have been found
to afford the most attractive and interesting passages to
the former part of this biography. The reputation
he had now acquired, from his researches in experi
mental philosophy, amidst still more favourite pursuits,
was thus described by a very competent observer :

  To enumerate Dr. Priestley's discoveries, would, in fact, be
to enter into a detail of most of those that have been made
within the last fifteen years. How many invisible fluids,
whose existence evaded the sagacity of foregoing ages, has he
made known to us! The very air we breathe he has taught
us to analyze, to examine, to improve; a substance so little
known, that even the precise effect of respiration was an
enigma, till he explained it. He first made known to us the
proper food of vegetables, and in what the difference between
these and animal substances consisted. To him pharmacy is
indebted for the method of making artificial mineral waters,
as well as for a shorter method of preparing other medicines ;
metallurgy, for more powerful and cheaper solvents ; and che
mistry, for such a variety of discoveries as it would be tedious
to recite; discoveries which have new-modelled that science,
and drawn to it, and to this country, the attention of Europe.

  It is certain that since the year 1773, the eyes and regards
of all the learned bodies in Europe have been directed tp

this country, by his means. In every philosophical treatise
his name is to be found, and in almost every page. They all
own that most of their discoveries are due, either to the repe
tition of his discoveries, or to the hints scattered through his
works.*

   I shall now anticipate the period of Dr. Priestley's
emigration, and of his final settlement in America, to in
troduce the very short Continuation of his Memoirs,
finished at " Northumberland, March 24, 1795, in
which," he adds, " I have completed the sixty-second

year of my age."

   (188.) When I wrote the preceding part of these Memoirs,
I was happy, as must have appeared in the course of them, in
the prospect of spending the remainder of my life at Birming
ham, where I had every advantage for pursuing my studies,
both philosophical and theological; but it pleased the Sove
 reign Disposer of all things to appoint for me other removals,
 and the manner in which they were brought about was more
 painful to me than the removals themselves. I am far, how
 ever, from questioning the wisdom or the goodness of the ap
 pointments, respecting myself or others.

    (189.) To resume the account of my pursuits, where the
 former part of the Memoirs left it, I must observe that, in the
 prosecution of my experiments, I was led to maintain the doc
 trine of phlogiston against Mr. Lavoisier,f and other chemists
 in France, whose opinions were adopted not only by almost

    * ^indicia: Priestlc'iatue, addressed " to the youth of the two Univer
  sities," ( 1 788,) pp. 67--69, where the passage is thus introduced by Mr.
 Lindsey :

     " When, in 1 787, 1 asked one who will be allowed a most capable judge,
  well known to the philosophical world by his own discoveries, how he would,
  In a few words, express our common friend's merits in philosophy, the next
  time I saw him he gave me the following sketch."

     Mr. Belsham attributes this sketch, no doubt on sufficient authority, to
  "Mr. Kirwan, the present (1812) venerable and learned President of the
  Royal Society of Ireland." Mem. of Lindsey, p. 198.

  guillotined in 1794," (aged 51,) under Robespierre's " reign of terror."

all the philosophers of that country, but by those in England
and Scotland also. My friends, however, of the Lunar So
ciety,* were never satisfied with the anti-phlogistic doctrine.
My experiments and observations on this subject were pub
lished in various papers in the " Philosophical Transactions."f
At Birmingham I also published a new edition of my publica
tions on the subject of Air, and others connected with it, re
ducing the six volumes to three, which, with his consent, I
dedicated to the Prince of Wales. J

   (190.) In theology, I continued my " Defences of Unita-
rianism,"§ until it appeared to myself and my friends that
my antagonists produced nothing to which it was of any con
sequence to reply. But I did not, as I had proposed, publish
any address to the bishops, or to the legislature, on the subject.
The former I wrote, but did not publish. I left it, however,
in the hands of Mr. Belsham, when I came to America, that he
might dispose of it as he should think proper. ||

   (191.) The pains that I took to ascertain the state of early
opinions concerning Jesus Christ, and the great misapprehen
sions I perceived in all the ecclesiastical historians, led me to
undertake a " General History of the Christian Church to the
Fall of the Western Empire," which accordingly I wrote in
two volumes octavo, and dedicated to Mr. Shore.1T This work
I mean to continue.**

  (192.) At Birmingham I wrote the " Second Part" of my
" Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever," and dedicated the
whole to Mr. Tayleur, of Shrewsbury,ff who had afforded the
most material assistance in the publication of many of my

able, I should not have been able to publish them at all.*

   (193.) Before I left Birmingham, I preached a funeral ser
mon for my friend, Dr. Price,* and another for Mr. Robinson,
of Cambridge, who died with us on a visit to preach our annual
charity-school sermon.* I also preached the last annual ser
mon to the friends of the college at Hackney.g All these
three sermons were published. ||

   (194.) About two years before I left Birmingham, the ques
tion about the " Test and Corporation Acts" was much agi
tated both in and out of Parliament. This, however, was
altogether without any concurrence of mine. I only delivered
and published a sermon on the 5th of November, 1789,11 re
commending the most peaceable method of pursuing our ob
ject. Mr. Madan, however, the most respectable clergyman
in the town,** preaching and publishing a very inflammatory
sermon on the subject,tt inveighing in the bitterest manner
against the Dissenters in general, and myelf in particular, I
addressed a number of " Familiar Letters to the Inhabitants of
Birmingham" in our defence. This produced a reply from
him, and other letters from me.JJ All mine were written in

last of them I introduced a farther reply to Mr. Burn, another
clergyman in Birmingham, who had addressed to me " Letters
on the Infallibility of the Apostical Testimony concerning the
Person of Christ," after replying to his first set of letters in a
separate publication.*

   To these very scanty notices, by Dr. Priestley, of
the events which had engaged his attention, and the
different pursuits in which he had been occupied du
ring several years, I am happy to add a variety of infor
mation from his numerous letters. Of these, that very
large proportion, written to Mr. Lindsey in the unre
served confidence of an assured friendship, will, I trust,
be found peculiarly interesting.

spectable information, how cordially Mr. Burn, in 1821, appeared to unite
for general Christian purposes with Unitarian Dissenters. On a late very
public occasion that gentleman thus candidly censured the spirit into which
he had been occasionally betrayed in this controversy :

   " Whatever might have been the defects of his own conduct in the earlier
periods of his life, he now felt himself better established in the principles of
his religion than at any former period. Yet, had he to live his past life over
again, he should have to correct the asperity of feelings and expressions
which it was his misfortune to have used, in his controversies with a late
respectable and highly-talented individual (Dr. Priestley). Whatever degree
of error there might have been in that procedure, he begged to say, that it
did not arise from any disrespect to that highly-respected individual, but
from what he then considered to be his duty " See " Low Bailiff's Dinner,"

I expect to get him a pretty large order for our library.

    I think I never troubled you with the mention of an affair
 which has made a great noise indeed here, and in the neigh
 bourhood, for six months past, and which was decided yester
 day at the annual meeting of the subscribers to the library.
It was a motion to exclude all books of controversial divinity.
, Much has been written and published on the subject, and I
 wrote an address to the subscribers, which, as it may amuse
you, I will send you a copy of, the first opportunity I have.f

    The clergy have exerted themselves to the utmost in every
 way possible, and yesterday they mustered all the force they
 could raise. The chief speakers were the rector of the prin
 cipal church on one side, and Mr. Russell on the other; and
 though no measures were concerted by us, the motion was re
jected by about two-thirds of the company present, so that the
 high-church party is thoroughly humbled, and we triumph.
 The rector went about the town canvassing for votes on the
 occasion ; and till the votes were collected, neither myself, nor
 any of my friends, expected to succeed.J

   I hear of no converts among the Jews ; but a learned Jew
of Koningsburg is translating my Letters into Hebrew, and we
shall print them here. He has sent me the numbers for three
years of a periodical work, designed to promote literature
among the Jews. It is in Hebrew, with a small part of it in

   As to what is quoted from Jewish Cabalists about the pre-
existence or miraculous conception of Christ, the Jews una
nimously say we mistake them. There is evidence enough, in
all ages, of the Jews in general, learned and unlearned, be
lieving no such thing. That the Messiah (whom they in
general consider as another Moses) may make some change in
their law, it is very possible that many of their writers have
advanced. The Tolder Jesohu I have. It is only an idle story,

I inclose a letter from Mr. Johnson, to which you must

Dear Friend,                          Birmingham, Sept 29, 1 788.

It is a sore disappointment, both to me and my wife, that

you do not come to Birmingham. Indeed, many others, as

well as we, expected great pleasure from the interview. 1

cannot but say I was a little apprehensive of it when I went

to the sea. But October is often as pleasant travelling as any

time of the year, except that the days are short. However, I

shall not urge you at present, but shall hope to arrange better

another year. You must come about the time of our charity

sermon, or a month later, when the days are the longest.

I beg you would return my thanks to your quondam Catho

lic friend for his present. My wife and I were much amused

with what he reported for Mr. Coghlan. Many persons, as

well as my wife, were, no doubt, much pleased with Mr.

Berington's sermon, on the occasion you mention ; but all

agreed, that whatever favourable impression was made upon

them by the sermon, was effectually done away by the exhibi

tion of the mass.

I am amused with Mr. Harrison's violence. There would

certainly be a persecution of us if the times were favourable,

but happily they are not, and such things as these deserve not
the least notice.

  I cannot well help subscribing to Dr. Geddes, but I should
be surprised if his subscription of a thousand be ever full.* If
he would listen to me, I would advise him to publish his trans
lation, first, in one volume, and his notes afterwards. How
ever, I shall forbear sending my subscription some time, and
may give him my advice along with it ; and, if he find that
subscriptions do not come in as he expected, he may be the
better disposed to listen to me.

   The first opportunity I have I will send you a letter I have
just received from Mr. Hutton, co-pastor with Mr. Taylor, of
Dublin,f representing the state of things there with respect to
free inquiry. I saw him a year ago, and liked him much.
He appeared to me as zealous for the Divine Unity, and every
thing good ; but, for want of books, he can do nothing where
he is. Nothing of mine or yours is to be had in Dublin. I
was thinking it might do well to send him some books.

men are rare, and much wanted. I like Mr. Frend's piece §

Dear Friend,           Birmingham, Oct. 20, 1788.

You will think it a long time since I wrote to you, but I

have been to pay Mr. Tayleur a visit at Shrewsbury, from

which I returned last night. My wife accompanied me, and

I hope we are both the better for the excursion. We found

the old gentleman quite as well as I expected, and had, I

believe, mutual satisfaction in the interview, though it would

have been greatly heightened had you and Mrs. Lindsey been

of the party.

Mr. Tayleur's generosity has no bounds. He insisted on my

accepting another hundred pounds. He seemed much pleased

with the preface to my edition of the Life of Marolles, &c,*

which I now send you.

When I wrote last I did not care to mention it, as I was in

hopes it would be very transient, but I was in great pain, in

consequence of passing some gall-stones. However, it kept

increasing, and for the greatest part of the week following I

was not capable of writing, reading, or any thing. I reco

vered : but, on Tuesday last, I had another fit at my daugh

ter's, on the road to Shrewsbury, and had thoughts of return

ing ; but, happily, it went off, and I was able to pursue my

journey. At present I feel tolerably well, and, with care,

hope to do well ; but I must live chiefly on vegetables.

Since my last, I have given almost all the time I could to

some experiments relating to Phlogiston, and have drawn up a

third paper to send to the Royal Society.f However, I do

every day more or less at my Church History, and think I

shall easily finish one 8vo. volume to send you, in long hand,

against my April visit. At least, I shall do my endeavour. I

   At Shrewsbury I heard an alarming account of Mr. Tow-

interesting intelligence you send me. I shall be glad to receive

give us more concern than enemies. I now fulfil my promise

Towgood's venerable father, daily expecting his own decease, " in full age

of his only son, in his 60th year. He was a gentleman of distinguished pub

been done.

   I also send you a new edition that I have printed of the

please you. As the printer has taken the expense upon him
self, I wish you could take a few, as you think you can dis

As my complaint, without being violent, continues, I must
employ an amanuensis, which is some expense, though not
great. I thank God that my supplies have always exceeded
my wants, which encourages me to do all I can without regard
to expense. My time and labour I give with cheerfulness, and
am happy in being able to give it.

   I shall spare no pains with my present work, and hope to

should be a loser by this publication ; and yet such is the un

things in my Ecclesiastical History, as I shall have a particular

it. I have even introduced all the particulars, though abridged,

To the Editor of the Gentleman's Magazine.

Mr. Urban,  Birmingham, Dec. 24, 1788.

I beg leave, through the channel of your Repository, which

comes into the hands of most men of letters, to inform my

friends and the public, that though I proposed to make an

annual reply to all those who should controvert what I have

written, and have undertaken to defend, against the doctrine

of the Trinity, I see no reason to make any publication of the

kind at the close of this year, because it has produced nothing

that appears to me to require any answer. Nothing has been

advanced by any of the writers who have appeared in favour

of this doctrine, in reply to my repeated assertions, that it was

not the faith of the primitive church, that it arose from the

principles of Platonism, which were adopted by the philoso

phizing and learned Christians, and made its way very slowly

among the unlearned; and, also, that the present system of

orthodoxy on this subject was formed by degrees, and was not

completed till after the council of Nice.
   I would observe farther, that no Arian has as yet attempted to

controvert what I have maintained, viz. that their doctrine was

unknown to both the learned and unlearned Christians till

about the time of Arius ; and of this I shall produce much

additional evidence, (shewing that what is now called Arianism

had no existence till the latter part of the reign of Constantius,)

in my " History of the Christian Church till the Fall of the
Western Empire," which is nearly ready for the press.

   The Trinitarians, who are principally concerned to support
what they have maintained in this controversy, are Dr. Hors-
ley, Bishop of St. David's; Mr. Howes, of Norwich ; and Dr.
Geddes ; all of whom have been frequently called upon, in a
manner that appeared to me to be the best calculated to engage
them, to produce whatever they may have to allege against
what I have advanced with respect to each of them, and they
have all had time enough for the purpose.

   Dr. Horne, the Dean of Canterbury, 6tands particularly
pledged for a large work on the subject. He, indeed, required
lime, but time sufficient has been given him ; so that, if nothing
come from him very soon, it will be concluded, that, upon
second thoughts, he found himself engaged in a business to
which he was not equal : but then it will become him, as an
honest man and a lover of truth, frankly to acknowledge this.
However, the impartial public will easily perceive the real
situation of all these gentlemen, whether they have the in
genuousness to own it or not, and will be influenced in form
ing their opinions, on the question in debate, accordingly.

   Things being in this situation, I shall wait another year; and
if nothing then appear deserving of particular notice, I shall
close this controversy with the serious address which I pro
posed to make to the bench of bishops, and to the public, on
this interesting subject.*

You expect originality where it is not to be had. In a

general history many things must be said which have often

been said before, and cannot be said better. For example, a

brief account of the principal writers is absolutely necessary in

all the periods of the history, as well as a particular account of

all, in the earlier periods ; but those I shall profess to take, for

the most part, from Cave or Dupin.

I now send the remainder of the work, and a few additions,

I am doing, beginning with Nicephorus.|| I hope you will be

him, and therefore do not desire you to be in any hurry about
it. I have already so far looked into Fleury, or Sueur, as to see
that I made no great omissions, and to be directed to autho
rities ; and for some things, I have, at present, quoted the
former, till I can verify what he has given, by some early
writers; but some common-place matters I shall probably
leave, as quoted from him. They will not make many pages.

I shall professedly take from Basnage. With all this there

be troubled on the subject of this translation in the present

all the interpretations of the passages of Scripture usually
alleged on the Arian and Socinian controversy, ancient and

ment which in any way related to the person of Christ, and to arrange them
under different heads, beginning with simple p re-existence, and advancing
through the various intermediate steps to the doctrine of the proper Deity
of Christ. Under each text was introduced the comment of one or more
learned and approved Trinitarian, Arian, or Unitarian expositors, in the
commentator's own words, and, in general, without any additional, or, at
least, doctrinal comment of the compiler's own." Calm Inquiry, (Pref.)

   I annex our plan for a new translation of the Scriptures.
Any assistance you can give us, with respect to any part of
the Old or New Testament, will be thankfully received, and
you may send them to Mr. Liudsey.

   I am much obliged to you for the extract of the book from
Holland. I shall examine it at my leisure. I shall soon begin
to print my Church History. I beg my respects to Dr. Farr,
and am glad to hear that you have got so valuable an addition
to the circle of your acquaintance.*

             To Rev. J. Bretland.!

Dear Sir,                      Birmingham, May 12, 1789.

A number of my philosophical friends having dined with

me yesterday, I produced the black substance which you sent

me, and we examined it. It appears to be a real coal, of

that kind which burns without smoke or smell ; and all agreed

it is an encouraging circumstance to persevere in searching for

coal of a more complete kind.

You will see by the annexed the plan of a translation of the

Scriptures. My part is the Hagiographa. Mr. Dodson en

gages for the prophecies, Mr. Lindsey for the New Testament,

and Mr. Frend for the historical books. But I mention this in

confidence, as it is not intended that the names should be

known. Mr. Dodson will write to Mr. Moore, J to engage his

assistance. As we four were together, we chose to undertake

for the whole, by ourselves or friends, rather than make any

unnecessary delay in waiting for the concurrence of others.

It is reported that Mr. Kenrick§ inclines to Unitarianism,

acknowledging that he finds no trace of the doctrine of pre-

existence in the gospels, or book of Acts. Do you know whe

ther this be true ?||

Dear Friend,             Birmingham, May 14, 1789.

I thank you for the account of the business of Friday last,f

and rejoice that it was so favourable to us. None of us, I

imagine, expected that we should have a majority of votes.

Mr. Fox must, I think, recover his popularity with the Dis

senters, and Mr. Pitt must certainly lose ground with them.

W. Vaughan says there were thirty new votes. If so, I should

hope that we shall carry the point in the House of Commons

the next time we apply.

I shall be glad to see the paper you talk of sending us, es

pecially if it contain a good account of Mr. Pitt's speech, though

I have no thought of animadverting upon it. 1 hope, however,

that something will be written by some other person, (and, in

my opinion, another letter to him would be as proper as any,)

on the occasion.

Mr. Walker says he has sent me his MS. Travels to France.

I shall be much obliged to you if you will inform him, by the

penny post, (Mr. Adam Walker, George Street, Hanover

Square,) that I have- not received his MS., and wish that he

would inquire about it.

1 shall get the number of plans you want, printed the first

opportunity, and send you them. 1 cannot by any means enter

into your idea of absolute secresy in this business, which, after

all, if we apply for any assistance, cannot be kept secret. What

is printed does not say that it is to be executed, and no names

appear ; and, in my opinion, much more good than harm will

accrue from such reports as may be expected to get abroad on

the subject. It will shew that we are in earnest, and will not

put it into any man's power to frustrate the scheme.

If we expect to publish the work, iind have it actually cir

culate, so as to be of any use, without its being pretty well

I beg leave, through the channel of your Magazine, to ac

quaint my friends and the public that I have seen the Bishop

of St. David's new edition of his " Tracts in Controversy" J

with me, and pledge myself to shew, in my " Defences of Uni-

and Disquisitions" contain nothing more favourable to the doc

trine of the Trinity, or more to his own advantage as a scholar,

than his original Letters to me. ||

Dear Friend,                         Birmingham, July 22, 1789.

The time you and Mrs. Lindsey passed at Birmingham ap

pears now as a pleasant dream, which I hope, however, will

often be repeated, before we awake in a state where, I trust,

we shall separate no more.

  After the agreeable relaxation which you gave me, I have
applied pretty closely to my different pursuits. To the article
of Constantine I have added remarks on what Mr. Gibbon says
of the causes of his conversion,* which, I think, you will not
dislike. I shall read his History very carefully, as far as it
coincides with mine, and shall add other remarks, if any occur.

   In philosophy I have several experiments of particular con
sequence, especially relating to respiration, f

   My wife continues pretty well. She is now at Barr, with
Mrs. Galton, and I am about to go and dine and spend the
evening with them. There I am to meet Mr. Berington,J
and a relation of his, who is a bishop among the Catholics.

   The disturbances in Paris, of which you will have heard,
give us much uneasiness on account of William, who is in the

Dear Sir,                  Birmingham, July 25, 1789.

have been very sorry to hear that you had declined it on any

account.^

I shall be thankful for any assistance you may be able to

procure me in the translation of any part of the undertaking,

to undertake part of it yourself. There are too many of us

   I rejoice in the account of your safe return to London, and
that you and Mrs. Lindsey are so much better for your
journey.
   I have nearly completed the arrangement of the new edition
of my philosophical works, and a friend of Mr. Keir's will
mention to Mr. Fox the affair of the dedication. There is
time enough for it ; I am sorry, though, that you did not see
Mr. Lee on the subject.
   I thank you for your various articles of news, collected on
your journey, and hope you will soon find something worth
sending from London.

have not seen Mr. Belsham, but hope he will assist us in my
department; but when I have rid my hands of what is now
upon them, I shall stick close to it.^

Lady Hewley's trustees. As Mr. Shore is one,§ I send it

doing it till he find his staying with them will be disagreeable
to the congregation. At present he has only received an
anonymous letter, complaining of his change of sentiment,
which, he says, gave him pleasure, as a proof that he had
spoken so as to be understood. He gave me other pleasing in
stances of the progress of Unitarianism that had come to his
knowledge.

   Mr. Bakewell says they shall introduce an Unitarian Liturgy,
in the use of which several, now members of the Church of
England, will join them ; but I think, from his account, that
much will not be done while their present minister is living.
I was much pleased with Mr. Bakewell, who has both a philo
sophical and theological turn.

Dear Friend,                   Birmingham, Aug. 31, 1789.

I have only Rigaltius's edition of Tertullian, which, I believe,

is very common. If Mr. Hamiltonf has it not, and wishes to

see it, it is at his service.

My Letters to Dr. Horsley are now transcribed, and I wish

to get them into your hands as soon as possible. But, as you

will hardly be in town till the latter end of the week, I will

keep them till I can send those to Mr. Barnard and Dr.

Knowles along with them.

I know you will not like the Letters in their present state;

but their asperities will be rubbed off, and many improvements

may be introduced, before the time of publication. I could

not well repress my indignation at the time of writing.

On Tuesday next I have agreed to set out for Castle-Head,

with my daughter and Mr. Finch, and may stay three weeks.

I wish, therefore, you would write to me there, and let me

know what you think of my Letters in general. Particular

remarks you may reserve till you return them after my return.

You will note what I say of his Newton, &c.,* and, if you can,
get me the necessary authorities. I really think so insolent a
writer should be exposed.

   You must not expect any thing materially new in these
Letters, and I think they will probably be my last Defence of
Unitarianism.

   You must not despair of yourself, though you perceive a
failure in your memory. I do the same.f However, spare
yourself. You will last the longer. I am far from being a close
student. I never fatigue myself in the least, and generally
could do twice as much as I do. But I, purposely, relax a
little, as I advise you to do.

   I have the translation much at heart, and doubt not we shall
have a very good one. I thank you for the Letters. They are
in Mr. Russell's hands, and to-morrow I shall send them to
Mr. Tayleur.J

Dear Friend,           Birmingham, Sept. 7, 1789.

You have made me very easy and happy by your approba

tion of my treatment of Dr. Horsley. Be assured, however,

that it will be much improved before it go to the press.

Since I wrote last, I have added some Letters to Mr. Haw

kins, which, I think, will close my pamphlet. I was in hopes

to have sent you the whole ; but there remains one letter to be

transcribed, on the doctrine of the Trinity ; though much will

not remain to be said after what Mr. Clarke has addressed to

him.§

There is something very particular in his case with respect

to me. His patron is Bishop North, and he stands a good

chance for great preferment. He courted my acquaintance

almost as much as Mr. Badcock, and told me he had subscribed

as articles of peace, and, if it had been to do again, he believed

he should not do it. When I was writing my " History of Early

Opinions," he procured me books from the cathedral library at

Worcester.

Opinions," that you need not trouble Mr. Johnson about them-

Dear Friend,                Castle Head, Sept. 21, 1789.

I am concerned at your frequent indispositions; but as you

are subject to feverish complaints, I hope you will be able

both to guard against them, and manage yourself better in

them. I am glad to hear you are so well recovered from this

last attack. I keep in very good health, and am the better for

the journey and the exercise I have here.

We leave this place on Thursday, and propose to spend

Sunday next at Manchester, in our way home; so that your

next should be directed to Birmingham, where I hope to

arrive in the middle of the next week.

I am much pleased that you do not dislike the Letters to

Dr. Knowles and Mr. Hawkins. The other letter to the latter,

which I had not time to get transcribed, and which relates to

the doctrine of the Trinity, I am pretty sure will not displease

you.

Having sufficient leisure in this place, I have written my

Address to the Bishops, and at my return shall have it tran

scribed and sent to you, along with the third letter to Mr.

Hawkins.

Having dispatched these little things, I shall sit down to the

translation, which I have at heart more than any thing I ever

 undertook. If I was not sufficiently interested before, this
Letter to the Bishop of Norwich,* (for which I thank you,)
 would have done it. His shameful conduct is well exposed,
 though the Letter is, in some places, rather obscure, as irony is
 apt to be. If he be capable of feeling, he must be miserable, as
 he deserves to be. I shall not forget this business in my Address
to their Lordships. But what I have yet done is only a rough
outline, such, however, as I wish to put into your hands before
I proceed to finish it. For I wish to execute this piece with
the greatest care, as I think it will close the controversy, and
will, I hope, draw some attention.

   I am sorry for the difference between Mr. Palmer and Mr.
Robson, though not for the consequences of it, hisf leaving
Newcastle. I think you will do well to acquaint him with
our scheme of translation, and ask his assistance. But, unless
a person be stationary, and have access to books, he cannot do
much. He may, however, assist by his remarks on particular
passages. I hope we shall do without many more hands than
are now engaged. We had better take another year than em
barrass ourselves with intractable people.

   I am concerned at the account you give me of the affairs of
France. The courtiers here will triumph in it ; but I hope
the best, as the people in general are in favour of liberty, and
the king cannot, I should imagine, find many to carry on a
war.J

shall have no objection to give you a few anecdotes, with

send was written in answer to one of mine, in which I had

          To Ret. T. Lindsey.J

Dear Friend,                     Birmingham, Oct. 8, 1789.

I send you something for the Gentleman's Magazine, occa

sioned by Mr. Badcock in the last. If you see Mr. Nicholls,

you may tell him it is not fair to publish letters of the dead§

respecting the living, unless he admit of replies, and that it is

for his credit to be impartial.

At my return I found a letter from Mr. Tayleur, with a bill

of <£150, for the expenses of my Ecclesiastical History. I told

him I apprehended it would be considerably too much, and

that I should consult with you, and did not doubt we should

dispose of the overplus to his satisfaction. How unboundedly

generous Mr. Tayleur is ! I may well afford to give my books,

when they are paid for before-hand.

Before I took my journey, I ordered twenty-five copies of

my " History of Early Opinions" to be sent to you. I am

really desirous of giving a great part of the impression. I

cannot consider them as my property, and only wish to place

them where they may be of the most use.

You will be pleased to be informed, that at Manchester I

met with two Unitarian street-preachers, men of good sense

and great zeal, who had read hardly any thing besides the

Bible; nothing of mine or yours. They are Baptists, fourteen

in number, not more than two months' standing. One of them

had been in Mr. Wesley's connexion. As they had hired a

building for their meetings in the winter, and were at expense

in travelling to preach in the neighbouring towns, &c, I gave

them five guineas. They are all working men. I was exceed

ingly pleased with their conversation. They told me of another

society of the same kind in York, of sixty members, and others

are forming in different places. Young Mr. Toulmin was with

me, and gave them some of my small pieces, and I promised to

send them other books. The name of one of them is John

Laycock, and of the other,  Burton. Two others of their

friends were also preachers. They spake with great fluency

and propriety.*

   · The late Mr. David Eaton, (see M. R. (N. S.) III. 357; Christian Refor

mer, XV. 1 96, 227, 345,) whom I have a pensive pleasure in recollecting, for his
attachment to the progress of Christian truth and human improvement, as
well as for our long-continued friendly intercourse, gave, in 1805, from his
" own personal knowledge,'' an account of this interview. Referring to Dr.
Priestley's " visit at Manchester," Mr. Eaton says,

   " Far from being entirely engrossed by the rich and great, the attentions
that were paid him, or the invitations which he received, he was employed
in making strict inquiry into the state of religion in that populous town.
Amongst the different sects and parties that were named, there was one
described as highly dangerous, who denied Christ, &c. The doctor, from
experience, being well acquainted with the language and prejudices of igno
rant declaimers, who, without knowledge or inquiry, abuse every thing that
is contrary to their own received notions, was only the more desirous of
knowing their true character. He obtained the address of their leading
man, and speedily dispatched a note, inviting him to come and see him the
next morning.

   " At the time appointed, John Laycock (the name of the person invited)
made his appearance, and was very cordially received by the doctor, who
learnt from their history, that they were a number of poor persons who had
seceded from the Methodists on Unitarian principles, and were now using
their best endeavours to make their sentiments known. This information
could not but delight the doctor, who, it is well known, ardently desired and
longed for the time when scriptural, rational views of religion should be
received, and be propagated among the lower orders of society, by plain,
popular preaching. After he had inquired into their numbers, mode of pro
ceeding, place of meeting, &c, he declared himself highly gratified with the
conversation; he praised their zeal; he exhorted them to exemplary conduct
and steady perseverance ; and, in conclusion, begged their acceptance of a
ten-pound note towards fitting up their meeting-room." Mr. Eaton adds,

   " This secret, but meritorious action, never likely to be known, and per
formed to a few poor persons, who were entire strangers to him, is no less
an evidence of the doctor's ardent, disinterested love of truth, than of the
intrinsic goodness of his heart." Univer. Thcol. Mag: IV. 23. On " the
society in York," see Mr. Eaton's " Narrative."

   I think it will be right to ask the assistance of Mr. Garn-

approve of this, give my respects to him, and desire him to
undertake Proverbs or Ecclesiastes. I rejoice to hear of the
new edition of the Duke's pamphlet,f and of the progress you
make in your second part of Vindicice.

   I rejoice exceedingly in your account of Mr. Belsham and
the academy. Dr. Barnes has eighteen pupils, five for the
ministry. Mr. Harrison having resigned, he and a mathemati
cal tutor do every thing. He cannot conceal his jealousy of
Mr. Hawkes's Unitarian chapel, which I doubt not will answer
very well in time. I preached there both parts of the day.

to print in December, so as to publish in January. Mr. Dod-

of this kind that I have not seen, especially Halifax's sermon

good part of the impression of the " History of Early Opi
nions," and in this he will assist me. The sooner they are
disposed of, the better.

   You will have seen what we have been doing here as Dis
senters. It is all Mr. Russell's. He drew up the Resolutions
and Letter; and by an admirable address, and conciliating
manner, carried it through to universal satisfaction. Whatever
he may say, I had no merit in the business, but that of ap
proving and concurring. I inclose what we think proper for
the papers, as you and Mr. Heywood* shall direct.

   I had not heard of Mr. Watson's pamphlet, and wish you
would send it me. I thank you for Mr. Lloft's.f All these
things draw attention. Your account of the sermon of the

injuring them more to encourage them. Put a wafer into the

you please, I will send them, volume by volume, as they are

and when civil tyranny is all at an end, that of the church
will soon be disposed of. You saw what is now taking place
in Flanders when you were there ; but I hope the revolution
will be less bloody than you then foreboded. Our court and
courtiers will not like these things, and the bishops least

Dear Sir,  Birmingham, Oct 24, 1789.

I shall soon send to the press my Defences of Unitarianism

for this year. I reply to Bishop Horsley, Mr. Barnard, Mr. J.

Knowles, and Mr. Hawkins. 1 take it for granted that this

will be the last publication of the kind that I shall have occa

sion to make, as I see no prospect of any thing material coming

out. I shall therefore close the controversy with an Address

to the Bishops, &c, the next year. Let others then take it

up. I have just heard by Mr. Lindsey that Mr. Watson has

published an excellent Letter to the Bishop of St. David's.

I have desired him to send it to me. I am glad that young

men are so ready and so well qualified to exert themselves in

the cause of truth. I hear of many that promise well.

   Among the ministers Mr. Belsbam's example has had a
great effect, at least in lessening the confidence of some of the
stoutest Arians. You had heard nothing of Mr. Kenrick's
becoming a Unitarian, but I hear of it from other quarters,
and believe it. If it be so, and he can keep his ground, would
it not be better for the two congregations to separate ? It is
an awkward kind of connexion.

he will undertake Ecclesiastes, as he seems to have no great

objection to it. Give my compliments to him again, and re

quest it of him. I perceive that he was the author of the

enter sufficiently into the argument.

them sufficiently intelligible and just. The language of these

fallen upon him. I, myself, gave more offence to many Dis

writings on the subject formerly.

Dear Friend,                           Heath, Nov. 18, 1789.

Having a little leisure, I cannot employ it more agreeably

to myself than in writing to you.

It was very fortunate that Mr. Frend met my son at Frank

fort. He is very happily situated in an agreeable family, and

with agreeable acquaintance, particularly a Mr. Miles, who,

he says, is uncommonly civil to him, from his respect to me.

I do not know him, but Mr. Frend does, and was to send him

some of my publications.

A new antagonist has announced himself, and almost as un

expectedly as Mr. Badcock. It is Mr. H. Croft, the com

piler of the new Dictionary of the English Language, who has

often called upon me, and written to me on that subject, and

to whom I gave a quantity of materials which I had collected

for a large work on the structure and present state of our lan

guage, when I was at Warrington.*

In a very civil letter, he informs me that he is " reprinting a

book against the Socinians of the last age, corrected in the

way he means to correct the quotations in his Dictionary, and

that to this he subjoins a letter to me, which he hopes will be

in time to be noticed in my Christmas publication." I am

very glad that he has made choice of this kind of book, as it

may draw some more attention on the subject. His own views,

I suspect, are preferment. I had always considered him as a

mere belles-lettres man.

I have sent a part of my Defences to the press. There are

many important additions, which, I hope, you will not dislike.

I shall send you the sheets as I have opportunity. I want the

opinion on Horsley's Newton, about which I wrote to Dr.

Price ; but have had no answer.

Mr. Russell would send you my sermon. I hope you will

find it plain, and not violent. Mr. Heywood has sent us a

most excellent pamphlet, which must by all means be pub

lished, but will not be proper to be done here, as it will be

ascribed to me, and will be considered as personal, with re
spect to Mr. Pitt.

   I sent you two copies of the History, that you might send
one to Dr. Heberden, or any other friend. I am glad that you
and he like it. It will encourage me to proceed, though I
shall suspend a year at the least.

   P. S. If Mr. Russell send copies of my Sermon enow, send
in my name to Mrs. Rayner, Mr. Dodson, Dr. Price, Dr.
Kippis, Mr. Belsham, Mr. Salte, Mr. Radcliffe, and my friends
in general.*

To Rev. Thomas BelshAm.f

Dear Sir,            Birmingham, Nov. 18, 1789.

I rejoice exceedingly at the accounts I hear from several

quarters of your reception in the Academy, and the prospect

it affords of your being eminently useful there. I hope it will

long continue and increase. You will make me happy by in

forming me occasionally how you go on.

You were so good as to promise to procure for me, if you

could, a correct account of what the Bishop of Peterborough

(I think i( was) said on the subject of the Trinity at Daventry.J

I have a very convenient place for noticing it in my Defences

for the present year, which I have sent to the press, so that

there is no time to lose. If I do not hear from you on the

subject, I shall give the best account I can recollect from your

conversation^ and the opinion was so very singular, that I

think there could not be any great danger of mistaking it.

In these Defences I notice Bishop Horsley, Mr. Barnard,

Dr. Knowles, and Mr. Hawkins. Another, however, has just

announced himself, requesting to be noticed, Mr. H. Croft, of

Oxford, compiler of the Dictionary of the English Language.

His letter to me is only now going to the press.

I sent you the first and part of the second volume of my

History. I hope to finish in about a month. In the second

part you will see, I flatter myself, Some new light thrown on
the history of Arianism.

   I am much obliged to you for your reference to Mr. Palmer's
remarks on distinctions in the Deity. I have quoted almost
the whole of it, but have subjoined some remarks on the in
dwelling scheme.*

   I have printed a "sermon preached on the fifth of November
on the Corporation and Test Acts, of which Mr. Lindsey will
send you a copy.f

             To Rev. T. Lindsey4

Dear Friend,             Birmingham, Nov. 25, 1789.

I have received the parcel very safe, and thank you for

your care of the particulars. I observe, however, that you in

London often see things in a very different light from us in

the country, and you do not sufficiently consider that, large as

London is, the country is larger. You look upon such a pub

lication as the Gentleman's Magazine with contempt, and

think a man disgraced by writing in it; but it does not appear

so here, and we think it a great convenience (of which much

use may be made) to have access to a place in which we are

sure to meet with our opponents, and can write what will be

read by literary persons, and be preserved. We, therefore,

think it good policy to make that use of it, and to keep the

editor in good humour, and engage his impartiality by proper

civility.

I own that I partake much of the sentiments of country

readers, and have no idea of being disgraced by any thing that

answers a good purpose. To comply with your opinion, I

shall for the present not send the letters to the Magazine,

though I feel no conviction from your reasons. The papers

you have, about the apparition are not worth sending to Mr.

Wesley. They are the others, more serious ones, relating to

his setting out on his religious career,§ that it might import

him to see.

    I thank you for the various and valuable information con
tained in the letters you have sent me, and shall return them
the first opportunity. Mr. Garnham is a valuable part of our
corps, as, I hope, Mr. Frend will also be.

   We shall not fail to print Mr. Heywood*s pamphlet, though
not as by our Committee. When we shall have printed my
Letters to Bishop Horsley, which is the first part of my De
fences this year, I shall stop the press for that. It is now in
the hands of the printer.

   The other piece, I perceive, is Dr. Aikin's. I know his
hand-writing. I like it much ; but think it rather extraordi
nary that he should write in this strain, as he was one that was
most offended at my former publications of the same kind.
At that time there was a violent cry against me in Lancashire.
I shall write to Ben Vaughan about Horsley's Newton.

   I have put Mr. Dodson's Isaiah into the hands of Mr.
Hawkes. I think I shall like it much ; but I do not like his
inserting the passage concerning John the Baptist,* merely
because he takes it for granted that the quotation of the Old
Testament in the New must be accurate ; and I wondered at
his supposing that our Saviour's walking before his sepulchre
should be the subject of prophecy, t But these are trifles.

   The two pamphlets, for which I thank you, are poor indeed.
However, I think to reply to them (anonymous) in our small
tracts. I wish we could be sure that they were from the
Bishop of Salisbury. Pray who is he, as also the Bishop of
 Peterborough ?

   I expect my wife on Friday. I feel very solitary.J

   · Dr. Priestley refers, I apprehend, to Mr. Dodson's note on ch. xl.,
where he says,

   *' As we have the irrefragable authority of John the Baptist, and of our
blessed Saviour himself, for explaining the exordium of the prophecy of the
opening of the gospel by the preaching of John, and of the introducing of
the kingdom of the Messiah, why should we not be satisfied that the exor
dium of the prophecy hath no other object than these?" New. Trant.

        Dear Friend,         Birmingham, Nov. 29, 1789.

I am glad that you liked my sermon, in which I wished to

say nothing violent, such as some people would expect from

me. In my animadversions on the Letters to the Dissenters at

Devizes, I shall say some stronger things ; but in this my name

will not appear. Dr. Aikin's piece and mine will probably

make our second number.

I will send you and Mr. Belsham copies of the Letters to

Horsley. A good deal is added since you saw them ; but as

every thing is in the same spirit, I hope you will not disap

prove them. I have made the longest additions to the Letters

to Mr. Hawkins ; and those, I am pretty confident, you will

not dislike.

Mr. Morgan has an idea of something much more than I

want, which was nothing more than an opinion in one or two

sentences, such as I could justify, if it should be necessary.

However, that part is now printed, and I have said so little,

that I fancy I am in no danger of having said too much.

I am obliged to Mr. Lloft for his good opinion ; but there is

no hero among us besides yourself. We only talk and write,

which is a very easy business, compared with what you have

done. Does he intend to say any thing more to Dr. Knowles?*

In less than a month I hope to send you the remainder of

my History, the index to which is now in hand. My philo

sophical workf will, I hope, be finished before my usual time

of visiting the metropolis.

You said you would write to Mr. Cappe about our transla

tion of the Scriptures. If you did, what answer did he give ?

Will he do any thing ? As I believe he is a pretty good He

brician, perhaps he would undertake some part of the Old

Testament ; but if we wait another year, we are enow. I have

made a beginning of the Psalms. There is rather more to do

than I expected, but this will only make me labour the more

at it.

   Mr. Bretland says that Mr. Reynell, at Hackney College, has
papers of his great uncle's, that may be of use in our transla
tion. If you see Mr. Belsham, tell him I will write to him
when I send him the Letters to Bishop Horsley, towards the
end of this week. There is an awkward erratum in my sermon,
" advocates," for adversaries. This will be noticed in the
copies that are not yet sent out.

   I long much to see Dr. Price's sermon, I hear so much of it
from all quarters. I hope it will come soon. I rejoice that
the cause of liberty seems to go on so well in Brabant and
Flanders. I hope the Emperor will let them alone, and pur
sue his advantage against the Turks, in which I rejoice also.*

Dear Friend,         Birmingham, Dec. 4, 1789.

I rbjoicb exceedingly in the very promising state of things

in the College, and doubt not but that it will improve more

and more. To you, who contribute so essentially to it, it will

be an abundant reward. I hope that your reading the New

Testament along with the senior class is with the knowledge

and approbation of Dr. Rees, as every possible cause of offence

should be avoided.

I had an account of the answers to my History of Corrup

tions, in Holland, at the timej and was promised a more par

ticular account when they should be published ; but my cor

respondent is since dead. What Mr. Vanefteu§ proposes will

certainly be very agreeable to me. It might perhaps answer

very well to publish translations of all the pieces. This is

what I should wish most of all ; and if you have any commu

nication with Mr. Vaneffen, I should be glad if you would

inform him of my wishes in this respect.

                       To Rev. T. Lindsev.§

Dear Friend,           Birmingham, Dec. 4, 1789.

I send, but with fear and trembling, my Letters to Bishop

Horsley, as many things are added since you saw them. How

ever, I have done my best. The mottos|| you will disapprove;

but Mr. Hawkes and Mr. Berington like them; and as this is

probably the last, the whole will now in that respect be uni

form. Nothing is so vague as taste. If the argumentative part

be right, the rest signifies but little. No two men see other

things in the same light; and every man's own taste in these

things changes. I am sure mine often does, and in a short

time.

As to my History, I am sure I attend more to the style than

I used to do in my former publications ; so that, if it be faulty

in this respect, I cannot help it. I never used to read the

proofs from the press more than once, now I read them as

carefully as I can, twice. As to the authorities, I also used my
best judgment, and never spared my labour, except where it
would have been thrown away, and therefore might be better
employed. If I pursue the History, it must be less from origi
nal writers, because I neither have them, nor can I possibly
get them. But no history of any extent can be written
strictly from originals. A man must confine his views to a
small compass, indeed, if he do that ; and yet there are many
useful compilations. One of Church History is particularly
wanted.

   You raise my curiosity to the highest pitch about Dr. Price's
sermon.

   Mr. Croft's printed letter* is not controversial, but compli

Dear Friend,         Birmingham, Dec 10, 1789.

I am much revived by your letter. 1 am glad that you do

not dislike the additions to the Letters to Bishop Horsley. I

have no doubt of your approving the additions to the Letters

to Mr. Hawkins.

If you see Mr. Belsham, I wish you would desire him not to

shew my History to any body, till the cancelled leaves be re

printed ; except Dr. Price should ask for it.

Last night I received and read his sermon. It is, indeed,

most excellent. I was moved, even to tears, towards the con

clusion. His friends need be under no apprehension. The

court will be galled, but they will never hurt him. I hope

it will be reprinted in a cheap form, to distribute through the

country. If you see him, do mention this to him. It may have

as great an effect as his tract on Civil Liberty. J Now is the

subjects, while the advocates for tyranny are overawed.

   As you think my shoulders pretty broad, and used to bear a
good deal, you load me with every thing. As to mentioning
the translation, I dare say I have no more to charge myself
with than others. I have only mentioned to a few, whom,
with your consent, I wished to engage, except a few particular
friends, chiefly here, who promised not to speak of it again,
and I do not think that they have. However, I told you it
would be impossible to keep it a secret, and I see no inconve
nience at all, but an advantage, in all that you say has tran
spired about it. You see the thing in a different light, but
that cannot be helped. When I proposed a year, I did not
really expect that it would be dispatched so soon. Another
year will do very well.*

Dear Sir,                           Birmingham, Dec. 19, 1789.

I am inclined to think that Mr. Watson is not the author of

the " Letter to the Bishop of St. David's," but rather the person

you allude to, whose name I do not now recollect. Mr. Lind-

sey thought it best not to send my letter to the Gentleman's

Magazine, so that it may not be amiss to send yours. I may

write to more advantage some time hence, if it be necessary.

I have no person to recommend to the place you mention.

You had better write to Mr. Belsham about it. I have heard

nothing farther about the Unitarian street-preachers.J

tionary, if it be the latest edition, De la Croix, 3 vols. But
look at it, and see if it be a good thing. If it be the De la

work.

   I have just received the packet you gave to Johnson, for
which I am much obliged to you. That from Mr. Lloft con
tained his Remarks on Dr. Knowles.* I have almost read the
Letter to the Bishop of Chester. It is very well done. The
body of the clergy seem to be more orthodox than they were
in the last reign, and more bigotted. We see what a court
and an establishment can do. But, though we fight under
great disadvantage, we must not be discouraged. Truth is
stronger than all.

   The clergy here have appointed a meeting of all the clergy
in the diocese, to oppose the Dissenters' application. They
will, probably, do something violent, and expose themselves ;
but they are very inveterate. When we see in how many
cases reason has no effect at all, we cannot wonder at the slow
progress of Christianity.

will see our booksellerf is broken, and nobody will sell them.

pared for the continuation of my Church History, though I
shall not sit down to it till after we have done the translations.

   1 do not suppose that Bishop Horsley will feel much from
my animadversions ; as I do not suppose he will read them.
But I do not write for him, or such as he is.

  We are printing Dr. Aikin's tract,f to which I have subjoined

not to meet in London this year, but to reserve themselves for
some greater occasion, only to be in readiness when called for.
In the mean time our union will be perfecting, and our strength
increasing. Our exertions have not, I hope, been without their
effect with you, as well as in other parts of the country.

   The clergy and Tory friends of the establishment are meeting
in many places to oppose us. They will certainly do some
thing violent, of which a good advantage may be taken. 1

you do not name him. Also send the Defences to Dr. Williams,

of Sydenham. He sent me the anecdote about the Welsh Dis

no time for me to do any thing more, before the discussion in
the House. What is done now must be done by persons on
the spot; and I am glad to find there is no want of good
writers.

   I send my letter to Mr. Vaughan, open, that you may see
some curious specimens of the bigotry of the people in this
place. All arises from the encouragement given by the court,
and, notwithstanding what we talk, and I believe, of the in
creasing light of the age, great numbers who will not read are
no better than the partizans of Sacheverel, and would think it
a glorious thing to extirpate the Dissenters. I am amused
with the idea of Mr. Fox having been mentioned in my pulpit.

   A clergyman of this town, a very popular man, has addressed
a printed letter to me,* and I think to take some notice of it, as
I find it is much read, and some may read what I shall say to
him who will read nothing else of mine.

Dear Friend,                      Feb. 26, 1790.

I return the letters you were so good as to send for my

perusal. They have given me much pleasure. Notwithstand

ing some appearances of darkness in the atmosphere, I think

that, on the whole, the face of things is very promising. I

send, also, a letter 1 had from Mr. Robinson, in answer to

mine, inviting him to preach our charity sermon, as I think it

will please you. His desertion of orthodoxy, and Mr. Bel-

sham's of Arianism, are great triumphs, and, I doubt not,

stagger many.
   I told you of a local controversy with a very popular clergy

man in this town, which 1 could not well avoid. I send you

a few copies of my Letters on the occasion, which you will

give as you think proper, not forgetting Mrs. Rayner, whom it

may amuse for an evening. I am much pleased with all her

verses, as well as with every thing else that she does. I

rejoice that she retains so much spirit, and so cheerful a dispo

sition as these pretty verses shew, at her time of life. May she

retain them to the last, and long ! I begin to think with plea
sure of our approaching interview in Titchfield Street. More
agreeable hours I do not wish to spend than many that I have
spent there.

  Would Mr. Belsham object to publishing the sermon he
delivered at your place, together with that excellent one you
heard from him in Leather Lane ?*

  Since I wrote this, Mr. Walker, of Nottingham, is come, in
order to arrange matters for the meeting at Tamworth, to-mor
row, and I must spend the day with him.

   The spirit of party here is astonishing. Mr. Russell says,
measures are taken to ring the bells and illuminate the town,
on the expected event of Tuesday next; and, in that case, we
apprehend the mob will be instigated to do mischief. We
think to apply to Mr. Garbett, Mr. Boulton, and a few others,
to prevent it.

   I am glad to hear of the intention to answer the two bishops,
with respect to the Hints.f That from HorsleyJ is most im

Dear Friend,  Birmingham, March 11, 1790.

A ride I took to Heath has prevented my writing sooner,

notwithstanding several very acceptable letters from you.

" Observations upon the Expediency of Revising the present English Version
of the Four Gospels, and of the Acts of the Apostles," among " the attempts
to recommend an improved translation of the Bible," he proceeds to censure
" the modern History-Professor," because " of Dr. Priestley and another
man, who answers to the name of Wakefield, he speaks with applause."
Apt. pp. 72, 73.

   Of Mr. Lindsey the Apologist says, (p. 34,) " The reverend gentleman, in
hopes of restoring ' the truth of the Divine unity, now almost lost beyond
recovery,' has opened a shop in Essex Street, where he retails Ids new
discoveries in divinity to all who are disposed to come and buy."

   In 1 794, Dr. Symonds published " Observations upon the Expediency of
Revising the Present English Version of the Epistles in the New Testament;
to which is prefixed, a Short Reply to some Passages in a Pamphlet entitled
An Apology, &c." He says,

   " Those who are unacquainted with my former essay, would possibly con
clude that I had employed a page or two in a panegyric on Dr. Priestley ;
whereas I mentioned his name but twice, and then merely on the article of
style, without the least reference to points of doctrine. I am an utter stran
ger to Dr. Priestley, and to almost all his theological works, except his
Harmony of the Gospels, which the nature of my undertaking led ine to con
sult, and in which, indeed, I found so many passages in our present version
improved in respect to' the language, that I freely confess I should have cited
more of them if they had come within the plan of my remarks. If a late
good Archbishop did not disdain to request an avowed Socinian to pray for
him, shall I be debarred from shewing, lp. 72,) that Dr. Priestley has placed
in its true light a very important passage in St. Luke's Gospel, which had
been misunderstood, or, at least, misrepresented by King James's transla
tors ? But it seems that it is a daring impiety in me to commend Dr. Priest
ley, even where commendation is justly due.

   " But if I be liable to censure for having commended Dr. Priestley in my
Essay, how shall I stand acquitted of a much more heinous charge, to which
1 freely acknowledge I have been long exposed in my public character? For
ever since his Lectures upon History were published, I have constantly re
commended them to the young students of our university as the best book in
its kind which had fallen within my observation ; and though I may dissent
from the doctor in a few particulars, which must unavoidably happen amidst
such a variety of matter, yet I should have deserved worse treatment than I
received from the Apologists, if I had withholden my approbation of so judi

cious and useful a work.
   " In regard to Mr. Wakefield, I had never seen him when I wrote my

   With this you will receive a Second Letter to the In
habitants of Birmingham. A first you would have before.
They gain a good deal of attention, and the more, I perceive, by
a mixture of pleasantry, which I fear you will not like. My
Letters to Mr. Burn were thought too serious and angry.

  I was very unwilling to have any controversy with the
clergy in this town ; but as they have been the aggressors,
(especially in their mutilated extracts from my preface to Mr.
Burn,* an exact copy of which you will see in Woodfall's
Diary,) I shall now keep the ball up, and not do it by halves.
However, as I do not publish all at once, I can desist when
ever I please. I have two more letters composed, and intend
a third, which will probably close the whole. After this, if
it be thought worth while, I can publish an improved edition
of the whole. Please to send Mrs. Rayner copies of them, as
they may serve to amuse her.

   I am glad to find that the second part of your Vindiciw is in
such forwardness. I hope that by the time of my coming to
London it will be finished. I have no doubt of its doing much
good, like the former part.

   I thank you for your account of the proceedings in the

Essay, nor any of his works, except his Commentary on St. Matthew's Gospel,
and a few philological tracts ; Imt these afforded such proofs of the elegance
of his taste, and extent of his learning, that they convinced me of his right
to lay claim to a very high rank in the republic of letters. It is unnecessary,
however, to defend Mr. Wakefield, who is much more aide to plead his own
cause. I shall only add, that since he professes to have derived some assist
ance from my observations, imperfect as they may be, I feel little pain from
the venom of our Apologists. I would rather even be traduced than praised
by writers of their temper and judgment." Pre/, pp. xxii. --xxvi.

cause of the repeal was presently exposed in a short pamphlet, entitled,

tant of Birmingham, respecting the Passages extracted from the Preface to

and Members of the House of Commons, previous to the Debate on the
Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts." See Analyt. Rev. VI. 569.

House.* By all account, the arguments were in our favour,
and to this every thing must eventually give way.f I think
remarks on all the speeches would be an useful publication. I
may, perhaps, do it in my Familiar Letters, if I should con
tinue them. Mr. Pitt certainly said nothing to any purpose,
and Mr. Burke's conduct, I think, best accounted for by his
leaning towards the court, and not# to Popery. Mr. Fox has
either read very little indeed, or his compliments to Mr. Burke
were very extravagant. Mr. Hawkes says that Mr. Burke was
very little attended to. Next to him sat Mr. Burn, who, on
your going out, took your seat.

satisfaction, and at the same time have real effect. Mr. Walker

are uncommonly abusive and insolent. The same spirit exists
here; but I think some wiser heads restrain it. On the day
the news arrived of the event of Tuesday's debate, they began,
to ring at all the churches; but soon ceased, and there was
no illumination. At Warwick they rung all day, but no mis

My Young Friknds,  Fairhill, March 16, 1790.

The pleasure I have received from your very sensible and

affectionate address is only equalled by that which I have

always had in the course of my attendance upon you in the

vestry, which exceeds that which arises from the discharge of

every other part of my duty as a Christian minister, and in all

of them I experience greater satisfaction than I derive from any

other studies and pursuits whatever.

To see such happy fruits of my laboursf as your letter pro

mises, will add to the enjoyment of the whole of my future

life, and even brighten my prospect beyond the grave. For

what society can I wish for there in preference to that of those

whom, I may flatter myself, I have been in some measure the

instruments of training up for that better state ?

Having laid so good a foundation, I hope you will proceed

to build upon it, by continually adding to your stock of useful

knowledge ; and doubt not but that the more attention you

give to Christianity, in the principles and evidences of which

1 have been more particularly careful to instruct you, the more

you will value it. You will never forget, that the use of all

knowledge, especially such as I have endeavoured to commu

nicate to you, is virtuous conduct/ and that to be useful to

others in this world, is the only way to be happy in another.

it amiss to be reminded, that youth is the only season for lay

to your age, and not yet enfeebled and depraved by commerce

   You will do me the justice to believe me, when I assure you
that your generous and very unexpected present is what I should
have returned, if I had not believed that in doing this I should

Dear Friend,  Birmingham, March 22, 1790.

We have seen nothing of Mr. Walker on his return to Not

tingham, and how the Address to the Nation is to be managed

I know not. I do not wish to be responsible for any thing of

the kind. I certainly shall do no such thing as Mr. StoneJ

advises. It would in every view be wrong. I had much

rather write a second letter to Mr. Pitt ; but I do not mean to

do even that, but confine myself to the Familiar Letters I am

now in the course of writing and publishing here.

Mr. Madan has advertised a Letter to me in reply to them,

against Thursday next, and on that day my third set of

Letters are also to be out. I shall certainly send you or Mr.

Johnson a parcel by that night's coach, and a copy of Mr.

Madan's Letter. The controversy is a good deal attended to,

and so far operates to my advantage; but Mr. Madan was

most highly respected, and has many friends.

I sent Mr. Johnson a short letter for the St. James's Chro

nicle, requesting the insertion of my Letter to the Members

of Parliament, and desired him to apply to you for a copy of

it. I fancy, by a letter that I received yesterday, that it has

found its way into some other evening papers.

He can neither write nor read; and some High-Churchmen
making him drunk, got his consent to the letter that Mr. Burke
flourished away upon.* I doubt not he will get a correct ac

I rejoice greatly that your work is in so great forward

ness, as I have no doubt of its doing much good, as every thing

of yours has.

You take it for granted that Dr. Withers is the author of

Theodosius; but would it not be better to leave a line at Buck-

land's, or his successor's, according to the direction in the book ?

It is eagerly recommended by the clergy here, who now do

every thing they possibly can to injure me. f hear it is a

measure of the clergy in general to prosecute me in the Spiritual

Court, but on what ground they will proceed I cannot ima

gine. I think they will be better advised. Mr. Madan has

published the most peevish and malignant letter to me that

you can conceive. I shall notice it in my Familiar Letters,

another number of which I propose to publish before I leave

Birmingham. The controversy excites universal attention.

Dear Friend,  Birmingham, April 6, 1790.

I rejoice that the time of our annual interview, especially

in Titchfield Street, is now so near as Tuesday next, Deo

volente. I wish I may find you as well as I hope you will find

me, finely recreated and enlivened by controversy. But, se

riously, your illness has given me some concern. You ought

now to indulge yourself in more frequent excursions and va

cations from public service. I shall certainly do so, if I can

afford it, at your age. There is a time for all things, and rest

naturally follows labour. As I now enjoy the latter, I expect

in time to have as much enjoyment of the former.

With this, you will receive the fourth part of my Letters ;

but I find I write faster than you have leisure to read or hear.

Mr. Burn has announced his speedy reply. The clergy are

exasperated to the greatest degree; but I have just heard that,

after a solemn consultation, they have dropped their scheme

of the Spiritual Court. You will see, by what I now send,

that I am not intimidated, and do not lose my temper, as they

do theirs.

One number more will probably finish what I think of say

ing at present ; and as my subject will be chiefly the present

state of things in the Church of England, I hope to be assisted

by you and my other friends in London. For this purpose I

shall put down a few queries for yourself and others to

answer. We send the Letters to Mr. Johnson. Take what

you want.f

Dear Friend,             Birmingham, May 9, 1790.

On Friday, about noon, I thank God, I arrived safe at my

habitation, where I found my wife tolerably well, and every

thing also as well as I could expect.

I have heard very little about the dispute with the clergy,

my wife not troubling herself much about the matter. Some,

however, of the church party boast of Mr. Burn's last Letter

as unanswerable ; but there must be more sense among some

of them. In the course of the week I propose to write the

fifth and last number of my Familiar Letters, and then I shall

stick close to our translation, the effect of which I contemplate

with much satisfaction.

The approaching war,* I fear, will draw off some part of

the attention that would have been given to these subjects; but

every thing, we cannot doubt, has its uses in the great plan of

Providence, and the same end may be brought about by very

different means.

Mr. Robinson, I hear, is writing something more particu

larly pointed against the Church of England. Indeed, I can

not help thinking that the eyes of men in this country ought

to be opened to the gross abuses of it, more, in several respects,

than those that now prevail in Popish countries, in consequence

of which, it appears to me, that the lower officiating clergy

are more respected there than they are here.

Let me know particularly the state of your health, as I can

not but be anxious about it, and every thing that concerns you.

Remember us both very affectionately to Mrs. Rayner and

other friends.f

thing of this kind till he should go into the country, I was in

strenuous exertions.

Joseph, and Mr. Chambers, to see Warwick, and are to return
to-morrow evening.

   I greatly admire Mr. TVs spirit and zeal, but I cannot ap
prove of his plan. Neither Christianity nor the Reformation
was carried on in that way, but more silently and naturally,
like the growth of corn, to which our Saviour compared the
former. So ostentatious a method of proceeding would en
gage our opponents in similar measures, and excite a spirit of
party, which is hostile to free inquiry ; besides, the relief of
sufferers, publicly held forth, would draw endless claimants,
to whom no satisfaction could be given. Assistance in par
ticular and well-known cases may still be given. Books may
be distributed, and lay-preachers, who want but little money,
may be encouraged, without making much noise. The very
apparatus and correspondence necessary for such a scheme as
Mr. T.'s would alone be very expensive, and the same money
may be much better employed.

    I have received the Bishop of Llandaff's tract; and as I
have dropped much of my scheme, I want no more books.

 all the defects of the Church establishment, without sparing,

A friend here has suggested that the best method of re

futing Theodosius, i. e., so as to derive the greatest advantage

from the circumstance, will be to prosecute the author for a

libel. The decision of a court of justice, he thinks, would sa

tisfy those who will never read any thing, and may prevent

similar things in future. Ask Mr. Lee's opinion, and give me

your own. I do not like the idea, as a punishment of the

author. The question is, which method will do the greatest

good; and the letter in the Magazine, and my own Familiar

Letters, may do very well, though not all that might be wished,

It is, no doubt, a thing of a very atrocious nature.

6S MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

Mr. Robinson, who preached our charity sermon on Sunday
last, was found dead in his bed on Wednesday morning, at Mr.
Russell's. He was much enfeebled in body and mind, but
had been bent on taking the journey, and exerting himself to
the utmost. His disorder the physicians call angina pectoris.
Two nights he was with us, and on Monday evening he had a
fit, from which I thought he would hardly have recovered.
However, he was much better the next day, when he dined
with Mr. Hawkes, and after dinner was in remarkably good
spirits, and entertained us with many stories and anecdotes.
He ate a hearty supper, and went to bed seemingly in good
health ; but it was evident that he had another fit soon after
he went to bed, and that he expired in it, for he was almost
cold at nine o'clock the next morning.

   He was by no means fit to preach ; and though he was not
at a loss for words, he rambled into many things quite foreign
to the subject, dwelling much on Unitarianism at both meet
ings, though they were different sermons. He used no notes.
I have composed a sermon on the occasion of his death, which
I shall preach next Sunday.* We expect letters or messen
gers from Cambridge, but expect to bury him here.f

   I am very glad that you propose to omit the creed,^ and to
make a discourse on the occasion. Your example will give a
sanction to the measure every where else.

   Mr. Robinson said he never felt so sensible a relief to his
mind as when he read what I published on the miraculous
conception. He had always doubted the story, but never
ventured to mention his suspicions to any body. He was cor
recting some of the last sheets of his " History of Baptism,"
which, I dare say, will be a curious and valuable work.

   I was not much struck with the Observations on Prophecy
in the last number of the " Commentaries."? I was pleased

Do not forget Mr. Radcliffe.

There can be no doubt of Mr. Robinson's change of senti

ment, whether it should appear in his writings or not. He

had been a cautious man, and forebore to announce his change

of opinion to his congregation; but I hope he never deceived

them. There was, however, something I cannot account for

with respect to his former opinion of the divinity of Christ;

unless he held the indwelling scheme, for he said, in my hear

ing, he always thought the doctrine of the Trinity an absur

dity. On this supposition, however, I cannot vindicate his

writing that book. || I hear he was uncommonly eager to read

before your present of it arrived ; and he sat up all night to

read it, and was much agitated by it.

He was, also, more affected than he ought to have been by

the reception he met with among his old friends, after his

change of opinion was known. He complained to me, that

among all his former friends in London, he had only two sub

scribers to his book. He had, no doubt, been too fond of

popularity, which is too often the case with those who have

the power of being so. However, his well known change of

sentiment cannot fail to have a considerable effect.

I was much pleased with my journey to Nottingham. The

meeting was harmonious. A number of good resolutions

passed, and a letter was agreed on, which will soon be printed.

Among other things, the regium donum,f was properly men

appeared so very different from what one would imagine from

Dear Friend,  Birmingham, July 2, 1790.

Your remark on my sermon is very just, and if it were to

print, I would alter it. However, though Mr. Robinson did

not preach against the Trinity openly in his own pulpit, he

managed in such a manner as to make the greatest part of his

congregation Unitarians,f and the change in his sentiments

was so well known as to have a great effect upon many at a

distance. He ought, certainly, to have made a public recan

tation of his book ; and, in time, I hope he would have done

it. But to this he was, no doubt, too reluctant. You have

seen Mr. Toulmin's sermon, to which is annexed a fuller his

tory of him. Dr. Rees's is also expected to be printed.

Dear Friend,                         Warwick, July 13, 1790.

Yesterday I preached a Sunday-school sermon in this

place, to a very crowded audience, among whom was Dr. Parr.

To-day he is to attend the ordination service of Mr. Field. I

preach, and Mr. Belsham, who has not yet arrived, gives the

charge. He then dines with us ; and to-morrow I and Mr.

Russell, with some others, are to dine with him in our way

home. We called upon him in our way hither. He was not

at home ; but Mrs. Parr, seemingly a very sensible woman,

received us in his library, which consists of, she said, six

thousand volumes. It is, indeed, an immense collection for a

private clergyman, and cost, she said, more than twoJ thousand

pounds, exclusive of many presents.

He seems to have made out who Junius was, a Mr. Lloyd,

whose natural son he had the care of. He is since dead ; but

a brother of his, a canon of Norwich, (1 think,) a particular

acquaintance of Dr. Parr, is living. He was a man in public

office, devoted to Mr. Grenville, who was supplanted by the

Duke of Grafton.

I am eager to ask Mr. Belsham what he has done with Job.

I have finished the Psalms, and am engaged with the Proverbs ;

I mean the first rough copy, to determine the general sense.

But I have made many marks of absolute uncertainty, as Dr.

they are very many. I have begun to reprint my Familiar

Dear Friend,          Birmingham, July 16, 1790.

Dr. Parr seemed to be very much pleased with Mr. Bel-

sham, whose charge he heard. He dined with us ; and the

next day we dined with him, at his own house. Mr. Belsham,

who stayed after us, had much conversation with him, and was
much entertained.f He has just breakfasted here on his way to
Cirencester, and he will return while you are here, and it will
suit him, he says, much better than to come sooner, as was

first intended.
   Dr. Parr was studiously civil, and very open. He has now,

certainly, no measures to keep with the high-church party
though he did not directly declare himself an Unitarian.

   I much fear that Mr. Toulmin's workj will not sell to any
great extent. The orthodox have a zeal in these matters that
we have not. I heartily wish well to it, and shall do all I can

to promote it.
   I had much, rather Mr. Wesley's Life had been written by

the elder, than the younger Mr. Hampson.§ The latter is in
the Church, and therefore cannot write some parts as we should

wish them to be written.
   I shall be glad to see Dr. Edwards's sermon, and the other

things you talk of bringing with you. I hope to have finished
my part of the translation before you come.

I rejoice exceedingly in the near prospect of seeing you

life than in my interviews with you. The time of your coming

will, every way, suit us.

If you see Mr. Dodson, tell him it will by no means do to

much nearer to the phraseology of the present version than

they do. We must content ourselves with departing from it,

only for the sake of some real improvement.

Dear Sir,                 Birmingham, Aug. 12, 1790.

Your account of the university at Cambridge has given me

great satisfaction, and has rectified some mistakes that I was

under on the subject. You own, however, that much refor

mation is wanted, and certainly =£50,000 per annum might be

better appropriated for the purpose of education, and the pro

motion of literature, though it must be owned that the same

sum in private hands is in general not employed near so well.

I see in it no such provision for teaching theology, as there is

for teaching mathematics, &c. ; and certainly the advantages of

the university, whatever they are, ought to be open to all the

country, and not confined to the members of the Church of

England. You must excuse our railing a little at that we

cannot come at.

I am sticking pretty closely to our translation, as I hope you

do. Besides my proper part, Psalms, Proverbs, and Eccle-

siastes, I fancy I shall have something to do with the prophe

cies, except Isaiah, which Mr. Dodson will take care of.§ He

thinks it will be sufficient if we take the versions of Blayney

and Newcome for the rest ; but I am of a different opinion.

Shall you find time to divide this task with me, so as to take

Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Minor Prophets, with Daniel ? If

you can, take your choice, and I will take one of the other

judges as you. I wish Unitarians could come to any solid and satisfactory

faith about the interpretation and rendering of the preface to St. John's

thus exposed :

" If persons have strength of mind not to be frightended by names, and

be capable of attending to things only, the strongest objections to the doc

trine of necessity will not affect them. If they be unequal to this, they had

better desist from the consideration of the subject, and content themselves

with popular ideas and popular language. Only let them cease to censure

what they do not understand, and what they see does no real harm.

" When young necessarians, who wish to prolong their lives, shall neglect

the necessary means of preserving them, by taking wholesome food or poison

promiscuously ; or when they shall carelessly throw themselves down pre

cipices, or walk indifferently where there is danger and where there is

none, I shall then acknowledge that the doctrine of necessity, simply consi

dered, has, indeed, dangerous consequences. But if necessarians, whether

virtuously or viciously disposed, take the same care of themselves in these

respects as other people do, I shall say that, if they do not pay the same

rational attention to their conduct in a moral respect, so as to guard against

inconveniences equally foreseen, whatever else be the cause, their inattention

and misconduct did not arise from their being believers in the doctrine of

necessity." W. IV. 258, 259.

Dear Friend,     Birmingham, Aug. 29, 1790.

Every expression of your much-valued friendship gives me

particular pleasure ; and I hope our correspondence will never

be wholly discontinued as long as we live. I have, indeed, no

idea of greater happiness than what will result from the society

of such persons as you are, in another world.

I most sincerely congratulate you on the glorious effulgence

of liberty in France, and especially on the share that is, with

so much justice, ascribed to you, with respect to the liberty,

both of that country and America, and of course of all those

other countries that, it is to be hoped, will follow their exam

ple. I do not know any man who appears to have lived to

better purpose.

   § " Genuine Copy of the Introduction to a Toust, proposed by Dr. Price,
on Wednesday, the 14th of July, at the Feast for celebrating the first Anni
versary of the Revolution in France:
   " Gentlemen, the subject of the toast I am going to propose to you,
appears to me very important. In consequence of five wars in which we
have been involved since the Revolution in 1688, the kingdom is now bend
ing under a heavy load of debts and incumbrances, which render it incapa
ble of meeting another war without the utmost danger; for certainly there is
a limit, beyond which if we go, in adding to our debts, ruin must follow;
and one more war may bring us to that limit.
   " A long period of peace, therefore, to give us time for the redemption of
our debts, is necessary to our security, and, perhaps, even to our existence.
In France there is a disposition to unite itself to us by an alliance for main-

80 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

times great effects, and such I cannot help auguring from this.
But I do not wonder at the hatred and dread of this spirit of

taining and perpetuating peace. Such an alliance would be an union between
the two first kingdoms in the world, for the noblest purpose.

   " It would be an effect worthy of that union of philosophy to politics, which
distinguishes the present era of the world. It might save Britain. It would
bless the world, and complete the hopes of all the friends of human liberty and
happiness. I can say, from very respectable authority, that there has been
a design formed in the National Assembly of France to make a proposal of
such an alliance to this country. O heavenly philanthropists ! well do you
deserve the admiration, not only of your own country, but of all countries.
You have already determined to renounce, for ever, all views of conquest,
and all offensive wars. This is an instance of wisdom and attention to human
rights, which has no example. But you will do more ; you will invite Great
Britain to join you in this determination, and to enter into a compact with
you for promoting peace on earth, and good-will among men.

   " Gentlemen, such are the fruits of that glorious revolution which we are
this day celebrating. It promises a new and better order in human affairs.
The passions of kings and their ministers have too often and too long involved
nations in the calamities of war ; but now, (thanks to the National Assembly
of France,) the axe is laid to the root of this cause of human misery ; and
the intrigues of courts are likely to lose their power of embroiling the world.

   " In this kingdom we have been used to speak of the people of France as
our natural enemies; and, however absurd, as well as ungenerous and
wicked, such language was, it admitted of some excuse, while they consisted
only of a monarch and his slaves : but now, with a spirit that astonishes
mankind, and that makes tyrants tremble, they have broke their yoke, they
have asserted their rights, and made themselves as free as ourselves. In
doing this tee have been an example to them; they are now become an exam
ple to us ; and we have reason to expect that they will soon crown their
glorious work, by calling upon us to meet them, not, as formerly, in the
fields of blood, at the command of a despot, but on the sacred ground of
liberty, to embrace us as brethren, to exchange vows with us of eternal
amity, and to settle the terms of a confederation for extending the blessings
of peace and liberty through the world. Thus united, the two kingdoms
will be omnipotent : they will soon draw into their confederation Holland,
and other countries on this side the globe, and the United States of America
on the other ; and when alarms of war come, they will be able to say to con
tending nations, Peace, and there will be peace.

   " I have, therefore, thought that it would be worthy of this respectable
company, on this most animating and joyous occasion, to express its wishes
of success to the proposal I have mentioned, by drinking the following
toast :

   " An Alliance between France and Great Britain, for perpetuating peace,
and making the world happy." Single Leaf.

   " The notice taken in France," says Mr. Morgan, " of the speech made

usurpation, and I hope the time is approaching when an end
will be put to all usurpation, in things civil or religious, first in
Europe, and then in other countries.

   When shall we see the Life of our venerable friend Dr.
Franklin ? The public will be impatient for it, and, after your
revisal, it will, I am confident, be highly useful and edifying.

                     To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,             Leeds, Sept. 22, 1790.

We arrived here late last night, when I received the favour

of your letter, and this morning I had the second.

We have found our excursion exceedingly pleasant, far

beyond my expectation, especially at Buxton, where I made
some agreeable acquaintance, and where I found some exer
cise, even as a preacher.

   We arrived on Saturday evening, and the next day, after
dinner, the company at the White Hart desired me to give
them a sermon, which I did, and many persons from the other
houses, though the notice was short, attended. In the course
of the following week, when it was understood that I meant to
stay another Sunday, I had a deputation by General Stratton,
and a Mr. Sligo, from Leith, from the company at the Crescent,
where were several of the nobility, and the Provost of the

university of Dublin, to give them a sermon. I desired them
to name their own time, and they appointed the morning, after
the prayers, which they said I had no occasion to attend, as

there was a room adjoining to the Assembly Room, where the
service was.

  Having no sermon that I thought proper for so mixed an
audience, I composed one on the resurrection of ChristJ (one
that I shall probably preach at Essex Chapel, if all be well,
the next time I see London). There was a large audience, and
I was never heard with a more fixed attention, except that
some ladies of quality, who were behind me, I was told,
behaved with some levity, talking to one another all the time.

Mr. Burgh, Mr. Grattan, and many persons of note, were there,
who, if I may judge by their language and circumstances,

were much impressed. A young man of a pleasing counte
nance and manner, but whose name I do not know, was very

particular in his acknowledgments, and said he should consider
the opportunity he had had of hearing me on that subject as the
happiest circumstance in his life. An elderly clergyman was
particularly attentive, and ejaculated his approbation to all
that were near him. The officiatingclergyman, however, and
many others, were much offended at my being requested to
preach ; but many, the most prejudiced, I was told, were
greatly impressed in my favour. On the whole, I thought it a
happy opportunity, as some wavering believers were present,
whose faith I have reason to think I confirmed.

   The provost invited me to dine with him, after the service,
at the grand hotel, as it is called, and I had a great deal of free
conversation with him, especially about his regulations in the
university. By his own account, he has great merit in his
conduct of it. He is said, I find, to be one of, the most
rapacious of men,* and to have not less than seven thousands
per annum of the public money. To me he exhibited
himself as one of the most disinterested of men, and the
most public-spirited, a friend of reformation in church and
 state, &c, &c, &c. It is something, however, for men to
 avow right maxims, as it shews they are not quite out of
 fashion. The archbishop's lady, and some others, refused to
 attend when I preached ; though there were several clergymen
 present.

    I find Mr. Shore here; and on Sunday I dine with him at
 Mr. Simpson's. I called on Mr. Turner in passing through
 Wakefield, and expect him here to-night, to stay over to-mor
 row. I fancy I shall be here two Sundays. My wife, as well
 as myself, are much the better for this excursion, so that I
 hope not much time will, on the whole, be lost.*

that satisfaction once more before I leave this place.

   Presently after my last was sent off, I heard the melancholy
fate of Mrs. Russell, from his brother, and another relation.
We were at Buxton when it happened, and the accident was
much talked of, but no names were known, and we little ima
gined that they were in that part of the country. Mrs. Russell
will be much missed, indeed ; but the manner of her death
will no doubt make the event much more distressing. His
brother says that they all bear the affliction better than could
have been expected. It must, however, be severely felt.
I immediately wrote to him, but hastening home on the ac
count would answer no material purpose, and his brother de
sires I would not think of it.

   Mr. Wood's congregation* is in a fine state, containing many
young people, to whom he gives proper attention. He has
not, however, such zealous seconds as I have in Mr. Russell.
He cannot establish a library, though he has attempted it.

   Mr. Turner was with us yesterday. Last Sunday they had
a candidate for the office of his assistant, Mr. Johnson,f sent
down by Mr. Belsham, who is likely to be accepted. The
congregation, I hear, is tiling but those at Halifax and Brad

To Miss Russell.*

Dear Miss Russell,                         Leeds, Oct. 1790.

Your affecting letter, which I could not read without many

tears, abundantly repays me for any pains I may have taken

to instil Christian principles into the minds of the young per

sons of the congregation, as it shews that in some, at least, it

has had its full effect. It also proves to myself that Chris

tianity is not a mere speculation, but of the greatest prac

tical use on the most serious and trying occasions. I find it so

to myself now, as well as at other times.

As to death, I have habitually considered it as no great evil,

except in particular circumstances, and in your case there i9

much to alleviate your sorrow; and in the midst of judgment

we should not forget our mercies. Such an excellent woman

as your mother truly was, would, no doubt, be much missed at

the latest period of life ; but what we may suppose to have re

mained of life was of far less value to herself or others than

the preceding. In several respects you and your sister can well

supply her place; and it is a call to exertion, which you will

no doubt improve, both with respect to your father and brother.

As to her sufferings, I have little doubt they were much less

than persons commonly have in lingering sickness. It is only

the manner and the suddenness that shock us so much.

Above all, you should think of how much more consequence

it is to you and the world that your father is spared, the most

valuable part of whose life is probably yet to come, whose

zeal as a Christian, and activity as a public character, may be

of the greatest use. I see, by the state of the congregation here,

the importance of such a person. Mr. Wood has as much zeal

as myself, but he has no Mr. Russell to second, or rather to

lead him, as I have; and for want of this, though his lectures

succeed pretty well, be has not been able to establish a con

gregational library. He even printed a recommendation of it,

and gave a copy to every person of much consequence, with

that I thought useful, and it was instantly done, in the com-
pletest manner.

  My wife, who desires to be most kindly remembered to you,
is but poorly, but better than she has been. However, we
hope to arrive at Fairhill on Friday. Mr. Dawson, who is
going to Bristol, accompanies us. With my earnest prayers
for the best interest of all the family, and my most affectionate
respects to your father and sister, (to whom indeed I consider
myself as writing no less than to yourself,) I am, &c*

Dear Sir,                Birmingham, Oct. 13, 1790.

I meant to have written to you in the course of the last

week, but I was desirous of sending at the same time more of

the printed sheets of my work^ than I found I could get ready

for the purpose.

I now send a few, including the defence of Dr. Price,§

§ And his Discourse, Nov. 4, 1789 {supra, p. 41). See W. XXII. 179--

183 ; 522 --524. In answer to " a letter from the district of Quimper, con

veyed by the Duke de la Rochefoucauld," Dr. Price thus writes, " Oct. 14,

1/90," on the subject of this Discourse :

" Gentlemen, the letter which has been conveyed to me by your excel

lent fellow-citizen and co-patriot 'M. de la Rochefoucauld, brought me a tes

timony of your approbation, on which I set a high value. Such notice con

fers a greater honour than any that titles can give, or kings bestow. Accept

my thanks for thus encouraging the attempts of a feeble individual to serve

the best of all causes.

" The discourse delivered on the 14th of July, at the feast in London for

celebrating the Anniversary of the glorious Revolution in France, and which

you have thus honoured, was indeed an emanation from a heart warm with

zeal to promote peace and philanthropy among nations, and with an ad

miration of that disdain of slavery which now pervades your country, and

which has produced there a revolution unparalleled in history, to which

philosophers and virtuous men arc now looking as a noble burst of the

human mind from the fetters of slavery and superstition, and the com

mencement of a general reformation in the governments of Europe. May

Heaven prosper the great work, and grant that no adverse event may in

terrupt its progress, or prevent its happy completion !

which I wish you to shew him. I have informed him that it
is in your hands. I hope to send you all the remainder the
latter end of this week.

  I send a few copies of my edition of Collins. As few were

printed, I must not make many presents.
   I like the plan of " the Christian Miscellany,"* but much

doubt its success; every thing of a similar kind, at all liberal,

having failed.
   P. S. Several of us have looked through Mr. Burke's work,

and we cannot find the passage in which he charges the Dis

senters with the riots in 1780.f

   " Hitherto the world has groaned under despots ; and the best interests of
society have fallen a sacrifice to their passions and follies. We are now
seeing the dawn of better times ; and the example of France is likely to in
crease it into a glorious effulgence. From the instruction there given, the
world will learn, that, as subjects of government and law, all men are equal ;
that in every state the majesty of the people is the only sacred majesty ;
that all civil authority is a trust from them ; that its end is not to take away,
but to establish liberty, by protecting equally all honest citizens ; and that
the governing power in every nation ought to be, not the will of any man or
classes of men pretending to hereditary rights, but the collected wisdom of
the nation drawn from the general mass, and concentered in a National
Assembly, by such modes of election, and such an extension of its rights, as
form a part of the new constitution of France."

   In a note, probably on the publication of the letter, Dr. Price adds,
   " The government of Britain would be nearly such a government as is
here meant, and its constitution all that the writer of this letter can wish to
see it, were the three states that compose it perfectly independent of one
another, and the House of Commons in particular an equal and fair repre
sentation of the kingdom, guarded against corruption by being frequently
renewed, and the exclusion of placemen and pensioners."

      Dear Friend,
   Notwithstanding your approbation of what you have
already seen of my Letters to Mr. Burke, I am not without
apprehension on shewing you the remainder.
   The passage alluding to Mr. Pitt* is printed as corrected by
yourself or Mr. Heywood ; but if you expect I should ever
get favour with him or his friends, you are certainly mistaken.
Bishop Watson told me he would never forgive; nor am I
solicitous about it. The preface will shew me no great party
man, by my allusion to the coalition.f
   I must give a considerable number of this work, and do you,
as usual, supply my defects, for which purpose I shall send
you a separate parcel.

Dear Sir,        Birmingham, Oct. 17, 1790.

Your excellent Charge is now in the printer's hands. I

think myself particularly happy in the circumstance of my

sermon accompanying this piece of yours ; and if it was my

turn to pay compliments, I should say something more on the

occasion.

I most sincerely wish, on many accounts, that a greater field

of exertion could be procured for you ; and in time, I have no

doubt, your own wishes and mine on this subject will be gra

tified. I cannot, however, agree with you in saying that

theology is only nominally superior to other sciences. I am

more and more sensible of its greater dignity, and this dignity

will of course be reflected on the person who teaches it.

   I am glad to find you do not forget Job. Having nearly
dispatched my proper part, I am about to undertake Jeremiah

peculiar difficulty in them, I had rather put one of them into
another hand; and since I have been acquainted with Mr.
Wakefield, it gives me concern to leave him out in a business
of this nature. Suppose you were to sound him on the sub
ject, and let him know how I feel about it.

   I shall send Mr. Lindsey the discourse I delivered at Bux

proper for the occasion ; and foreseeing it, I composed it then.
Considerations that are quite familiar to us who make the

from Sweden, accompanied by Mr. Wadstorn, whom we saw

could not treat it with much respect, and they went away
much disappointed, leaving me a note, which I shall take
some opportunity of sending you, and various books on the
subject of Swedenborgianism, than which nothing can well be
more absurd.

   These people increase in this town, and have built an ele

Rev. Sir,              Quebec, Oct. 18, 1790.

A few days ago I was favoured with a very friendly letter

from Mr. Lindsey, of London, with a parcel of books, including

a copy of your Ecclesiastical History, for which, he informs

me, I am obliged to you. I should judge myself not only de

ficient in duty, but should also do violence to the feelings of

my heart, did I not testify the sincerest gratitude for such an

obliging attention from a person whose character and merits

I so highly esteem.
   Had I thought myself entitled to seek a more intimate ac

quaintance than I hitherto could boast, with a person of your

eminence in the world of letters, I should certainly have en

deavoured to make myself known to you before this time.

From the acquaintance I have been endeavouring to cultivate

with your valuable writings for a few years past, 1 conceived

a very great desire (if Providence should ever put it into my

power) of seeing the man to whom I felt myself so much in-

debted, or, if that could not be, of at least testifying my obliga
tions in some other way. I would, in consequence, have re
quested the honour of exchanging a few letters with you, had
it not appeared to me a request too selfish on my own part,
and only calculated to call off your attention from more
important objects, and give you trouble, without any profit or
entertainment.

   But, as your goodness and obliging condescension, of which
I am still more and more convinced, may perhaps incline you
to take so much trouble, in order to gratify a desire which
your writings have excited, should you be so good as hereafter
to rank me in the number of your friends, and favour me with
your countenance and advice, 1 shall reckon the circumstance,
which first made my name known to you, as one of the most
fortunate circumstances of my life.

   I will not trouble you farther at present ; but if you give me
leave, I shall be happy at some future period to open to you
my situation and sentiments, in hopes of improving by your
instruction and advice.*

Dear Friend,    Birmingham, Oct. 18, 1790.

The parcel about which you express some concern arrived

very safe, presently after I had dispatched my last, and much

am I obliged by the contents, which shall all be disposed of

according to your directions. I hope you will make a still

more liberal use of my two Histories. Now is the time to

make an impression, and nothing should be spared that tends

to confirm it.

Your last work cannot but do the greatest good ; it contains

so masterly and scholar-like a proof of Justin Martyr being

the very first who started the idea of Christ being the Logos,

which is the corner-stone of the Trinitarian system. I had

only surmised it ; but you have proved it. J

Yesterday we did, at a full meeting of the subscribers to our

you. We gave a hearty and unanimous invitation to Mr.
Berington to preach our annual sermon on the subject. I was
directed to write to him, in the most respectful manner, ex
pressing our approbation of his liberal treatise on the subject,
and the pleasure it would give us to set an example of persons
of different persuasions meeting on the common ground of
Christianity and benevolence.

   I expect this will make some noise, but I hope it will have
a good effect. It is a thing that I had talked of rather lightly
some time ago, and was surprised when Mr. Russell proposed
it to me, quite seriously, as the real wish of all that he had
conversed with on the subject. Mr. Blythe expressed his
most hearty concurrence.

You say not a word, in your last, about what required the

speediest notice, in mine to you, from Leeds, viz. the tract

therefore, you will delay no longer, but by Mr. Lindsey send

it to me as soon as possible, unless you be clearly of opinion,

that, on maturely considering the subject, it will not answer.

In that case we shall soon finish here.

I cannot help smiling at all you say, of the difficulties in

your province of the translation. I would very thankfully

exchange with you. I am sure I might complain with as

much eloquence, and as much truth as you do, on the subject

improved and an improvable version ; and with the helps that

we all have, or may procure, a little plain good sense, with a

all the rest. As to making few changes in the present trans

candid notice of what I have written on the subject of the
Miraculous Conception ; but I have no thoughts at present of
writing any more on the subject, at least till he has considered
more of my arguments than as yet he appears to have done.
I shall be most glad to encourage him all in my power, with
respect to his reply to Dr. Edwards, whom I may perhaps
briefly notice ; but I wish to have the subject considered more
at large, than I shall be disposed to do it. Now is the time to
bring forward the evidences of Christianity, in every point of
view ; and I wish it to appear, that the greatest enemies of the
corruptions of Christianity stand forth the most strenuous

aristocrats to subvert the French government, but has no doubt

of their being unsuccessful.

In compliance with your wishes, I have cancelled the whole

of the last letter, though the sheet was printed. The pre

ceding letter will make a sufficiently good close. I have also

cancelled the leaf where our ministry are said to be unfavour

able to the French Revolution, and another that Dr. Price

pointed out, where the 6th of October is put for the 14th of

July, having also made some other alterations in it. The other

passages I really think are trifles, and may be changed in a

new edition, if there be any.

answer no good purpose; though, tired as I am of the busi

ness, having done thus much, I would not fail to do more, if I

I beg you would express my most grateful acknowledg

ments to Mrs. Rayner, for her unceasing bounty to me. I

shall not fail to write to her in my next parcel, which will

contain some copies of the new edition of my Letters, and the

tract of Lord Somers.J

I have just received from Mr. Hartley his Life of his father.§

I cannot say I admire the composition, but it may do pretty

well. I shall suggest to him a few additions.

I am glad to hear that Mr. Lee is again entering into public

life. I hope he will be of some use to his country, though my

expectations of him are not what they formerly were.||

Dear Friend,                                               1791.

Wishing to send you a few copies of the third edition of

my Letters to Mr. Burke, I take the opportunity of sending Mr.

Thompson's book.*

I believe your intelligence has led me into a mistake respect

ing the National Assembly. I am assured that the present

members cannot sit in the next ; but my information came too

late for the third edition.

Having done with this business, I am now taking up the

translation, to which I shall stick till my journey to London.

By the way, desire Mr. Johnson to send me what Dr. Geddos

has published.f

                   To Dr. Price.J

My dear Friend,                     Birmingham, Jan. 27, 1791.

I am very happy to find that I have given you satisfaction

with respect to Mr. Burke's gross abuse of you.§ These

things do not, however, I hope, give you any material dis

turbance. They are the necessary consequences of any man's

distinguishing himself, let him conduct himself in the best

manner possible ; and there is no field in which a man is ex

posed to more serious hatred than that of politics. This must

always nearly affect the governing powers ; and there arc

many depending upon them in all departments. I have sinned

beyond forgiveness in many respects, but happily I am not apt

to be disturbed at censure from any quarter, when I know it

to be ill-founded. With respect to the Church, with which

you have meddled but little, I have a long time ago drawn the

sword, and thrown away the scabbard, and I am very easy

about the consequences.

As to the Memoirs, || you may as well keep them till I come.

You will be so good as not to mention them to any person

whatever. I wish you would write yours as much at large,
and not confine yourself to a preface.

   I wish much to see Dr. Franklin's Life, and hope it will be
published by itself, and not merely annexed to his works,
where it will be comparatively of very little use.

   I rejoice with you that the French Revolution goes on, to all
appearance, so well, and I hope the example will be followed
in other countries. I also rejoice that the Russians are so
near Constantinople. That is the only war that I wish to
go on.*

             To Rev. T. Lindsey-t

Dear Friend,                       Birmingham, Feb. 8, 1791.

I have received, through Dr. Kippis, the invitation you led

me to expect, to preach the annual sermon for the new col

lege, but I have declined it, thinking it would be wrong to

invite me before Mr. Wakefield, as hitherto the tutors only

have preached on that occasion, and that it would be impos

sible to say any thing new, and to the purpose, after what had

been already done by others, hinting also that, being still very

obnoxious to many, my preaching at all might do the cause no

good.

I wish also not to appear forward, as I am thought to be,

to catch at every opportunity of exhibiting myself, and throw

ing out bold and insolent things before the public ; and some

such things I should be tempted to say, if 1 did preach this

sermon, in present circumstances.

If, however, it be your opinion that such things might be

said with propriety and effect, as necessary to be laid stress

upon, considering the opposite maxims now taught in our

Universities, and the sermons of churchmen, alluding to the

sanction given to Mr. Burke's principles in the letter of

thanks from Oxford, and the Bishop of Chester's sermon, &c,

&c, shewing the state of things when the Universities were

founded, how they suited those times, but not these, and the

improbability of any change being made in old systems, from

which so many derive emolument, &c, &c, I should have no
great objection to the business. You should see my discourse
in good time, and you know I always listen to your admo
nitions.

   In this case, I leave it to you to inform Dr. Kippis of
my consent; but I think that, when my reasons are con
sidered, you will allow the force of them. To deliver com
mon-place matter on education would not do. It would dis
appoint every body on such an occasion. I leave the whole
business to you. Dispose of me as you think proper.

   Tell Mr. Johnson he should send me the answers to Mr.
Burke, that have come out since mine, as well as those before
it, and the Reply to us all. How does the third edition sell ?

   I should think that Dr. Kippis's lectures may be given by
Mr. Belsham and Mr. Wakefield jointly. When I was at
Warrington I taught the languages, and taught all Dr. Kip
pis's lectures besides.*

              To the Same.

Dear Friend,                    Birmingham, Feb. 13, 1791.

I thank you for mentioning my situation to the Duke of

Grafton; but till I hear from you again, I own I do not see the

propriety of thanking him for his intention. It looks like

catching at his favours, and binding him to the performance

of what he may not have absolutely promised.

I have seen the " Vindication" of Mr. Burke,f For sophistry

and impudence I never saw any thing equal to it. Part of it,

I think, must have been written by himself. Such defences

will do no service to any cause with men of sense ; but it will

please the many admirers of Mr. Burke's own book.

Here I receive yours, and one from Mr. Belsham. My an

swer to him on the subject of the sermon I send open to you.

It will give me a little time.

      Dkar Friend,  Birmingham, Feb. 16, 1791.

I shall think myself happy if my Letters to Mr. Burke

have done any service to the common cause of civil and reli

gious liberty, and especially if they have given any pleasure to

yourself. Every friend of liberty is interested in defending

you, who are the great champion in the cause.

My memoirs are not to be published till after my death, and

what I wished you to do was something of the same kind, as

you would then write with greater freedom, and a greater con

fidence of an unprejudiced perusal. However, any sketch of

your own life, written by yourself, will be very useful.

I am concerned to hear of the difficulties attending the New

College, but have not as yet any clear idea how they have

arisen. Whatever they be, I hope they are not insurmount

able.

I am invited to preach your annual sermon, but have rather

wished to decline it, thinking that the preference should have

been given to Mr. Wakefield, and that it would be difficult to

find any thing that would be new, and at the same time

proper for the occasion, after so many had gone before me.

However, I have since thought of a subject, and if no other

person be applied to, shall not object to my appointment. It

will lead me, however, to say several very strong things on the

subject of civil and religious liberty, which may not please

some of the hearers. I shall send the discourse to Mr. Lind-

sey, who will shew it to you for your opinion beforehand.

I have received your generous benefaction, and that of Mr.

Brown, to whom I beg my compliments and thanks when you

see him. It gives me, however, real concern to take from

you.

I like much the introduction to the plan of the Unitarian

Society, and hope much good from the thing itself. If any

ever want it, and my discourse on the resurrection will not

satisfy them.

Dear Friend,                  Birmingham, March 7, 1791.

I have just received an alarming account, from Mr. S.

Palmer, of Dr. Price's illness, occasioned by a neglected cold.

I flatter myself, however, that as I heard from you by the

same post, and you had been at Mr. Vaughan's, that, if there

had been much danger in the case, you would have heard of

it, and have mentioned it. You will not fail to give me all the

intelligence you can procure concerning a thing that interests

us so much. Next to yourself, I should feel the loss of him

the most sensibly.

I thank you for the trouble you have taken about my com

missions. I shall have occasion to send you another paper for

the Royal Society, to be given to Dr. Ileberden.

I have heard nothing about my sermon, but I infer from a

letter of Mr. Belsham's to Mr. Russell, that I am expected to

preach. If so, I wish you would send me the sermon, as soon

as you can get it, with your remarks. I have put down several

hints for improvement.

I have no confidence in any clergyman's writing the life of

Mr. Wesley properly, and it is a thing of some consequence.

The father would have done it better.J

I hope care will be taken to prevent the repetition of the

riots, in 1780, and that nothing will prevent the relief of the

Catholics. We have formed a strong resolution in their favour,

I hope to do in person ere long.

I forgot to send the inclosed along with my paper for the

this to Dr. Heberden, or Mr. Planta. I have now completed

an important, and, I believe, decisive set of experiments, and

they will lead to several others.

subject, and pointed out some things that require correction.

the edition cancelled, or will it be sold in France and America,

I am very sorry that by a mistake the letter containing the

paper for the Royal Society was put into the post office, and

not sent in Mr. Russell's packet. I put you to expense of

postage enough, without this addition.

Your letter, with the inclosure from his Grace,f came safe,

and yesterday I wrote him a line of thanks. But these thanks

are as much due to you as to him ; for, without your kind

suggestion, it would not have been procured. But there

would be no end of recounting my obligations to you and Mrs.

Lindsey.

I have received the whole of my College discourse, with

your remarks, to which you may be sure I shall not fail to pay

attention. I forget the day on which it is to be delivered; but

I have laid my plan to leave Birmingham on the 11th, and stay

three Sundays, as usual. The next week I go to Manchester,

and spend one Sunday.

I hope the curious proviso? in the bill for the Catholics will

be noticed both in the House and out of it. Suppose that on

this occasion what I have said of it in the preface to my last

Defences,§ were put into some public paper, or shewn to Mr.

Fox. Mr. Berington says he cannot yet find out how that ex

to do it, and inform me of it.

Dear Friend,   Birmingham, March 25, 1791.

I should have written several days ago, but I meant to

send an improved copy of my paper for the Royal Society, and

having made more experiments, I have not yet completed one

to my mind, but I think you may depend upon receiving it on

Monday, together with the sheets of the Life of Wesley, which

I like very much. It will, no doubt, be superior to any life of

him, and they need not doubt of a sale. But I would advise

them, by all means, not to publish any volumes separately, but

the whole at once. The inconvenience and loss attending the

publishing volumes separately, is greater than any person could

imagine. If they take this advice, I shall have time to draw

up a letter for their use, though I shall probably send it along

with the sheets, as a few lines will be sufficient.

I rejoice that Dr. Price has a chance of recovering, though I

fear his situation will be painful, as well as hazardous, for some

time to come.

I have deferred going to Manchester till the middle of the

next week, at the request of my friends there. I am particu

larly requested to preach my Buxton sermon, on account of

some reports given out by the Dean of Middleham ; but of

what nature I do not know. I am told they are curious. One

of the clergy, it seems, who was at Buxton at the time, was so

provoked at my being asked to preach, that he got leave of the

Mr. Watt,§ and that I should bring the sheets of the Life of

   Your account of Dr. Price gives me much concern. He
was so much affected at the condition of Mr. Burgh, who was
three years tortured by the stone, and died of it,* that he will
be much distressed at the thought of having it himself. I
doubt with you whether, if his frame would bear it, he would
have the courage to submit to the operation,f We must all,
however, submit to the will of God, who removes us when and
how he pleases. All we have to do is to do all the good we
can, while our powers are continued to us.

   I can hardly think that the ministry will be so weak as to
let the Catholic BillJ drop, after patronizing it so much as they
have done. They will deserve every insult.

return to Birmingham, and on the Monday following, if all be

from me again till you see me, which will be, as usual, as soon
as I arrive, so as to get to Mr. Vaughan's before evening.

June, 13, 1/82," says of England, " The change in the sentiments of the

nation, in which I see evident effects of your writings, with those of our

deceased friend Mr. Burgh, and others of our valuable club, should en

courage you to proceed." Mr. Morgan adds,

" The death of this amiable and excellent person had happened a few

weeks before. He was the author of several valuable works on moral and

political subjects, and in all of them proved himself the stedfast friend of

virtue and liberty. His last publication, under the title of Political Disqui

sitions, though written under the excruciating agonies of the stone, abounds

with the most important information on the extreme defectiveness of the

national representation." Mem. of Price, pp. 95, 96.

Mr. Burgh, like Jebb, Cartwright, Granville Sharp, Sir W. Jones, and the

Duke of Richmond, had ably advocated universal suffrage, against which

there has been so much railing, and so little reasoning. Of any less ex

the Jews,+ though you do not mention them. I am never

quite satisfied, however I may like any thing myself, till I have

your imprimatur.

The letters relating to Mr. Wesley will all be printed this

week, and published some time in the next. I demur about

offering the publication to the Methodists, as they may consi

der it as an insult, which I am far from intending.

I am much inclined, from Mr. Russell's account of Mr.

Wakefield, to send Harry to him for about a year, after he has

done with Mr. Estlin. I wish to make him a scholar, and

though I shall take the care of him myself, before he goes to

any academy, to give him a knowledge of philosophy and che

mistry, it is so long since I taught the languages, that I should

not do it to proper advantage ; and, till he be a little older, he

will be better from home. The expense is my only objection;

but the time will not be long, as he will be well grounded by

Mr. Estlin.

I am concerned at the difficulties of the French, as I hoped

those of that kind, especially, had been over.

persisted that the fact was as she stated ; in order, therefore, to ease her
mind, the doctor good-humouredly told her to call upon him the next day,

   " Agreeably to his request, the unhappy woman was punctual in her
attendance, when the doctor, with a smile, informed her that he truly pitied
her situation, but he hoped that he should be able to afford her some relief.
His electrical apparatus being in readiness, with great gravity he desired the
woman to stand upon the stool with glass legs, at the same time putting into
her hand a brass chain connected with the conductor, and having charged
her plentifully with electricity, he told her, very seriously, to take particular
notice of what he did. He then took up a discharger, and applied it to her
arm, when the escape of the electricity gave her a pretty strong shock.
' There,' says she, ' the devil's gone ; I saw him go in that blue flame, and
he gave me such a jerk as he went off. I have at last got rid of him, and I

his friends at Birmingham."--Communicated by Mr. W. Matthews.

     Rkv. Sir,
  1am not able to read the letter you was so good as to write
to me, as I use a different short-hand, but Mr. Scholefield read
it to me.
  I am far from saying that it is impossible that Christ may
have pre-existed ; but I say it is both unscriptural and impro
bable that it should have been for the purpose of creation.
While he was on earth, he declared that he could do nothing
of himself, but that the Father within him did the works.
He himself, therefore, could do no more than Moses or any
other prophet ; and of what use could Moses have been in the
creation of the world, if he had pre-existed ? That God should
perform a miracle at the dictation of a man, may be of use
as a part of the divine mission of that man, but the other could
not have been of any imaginable use.
  If that part of my History of Early Opinions relating to
the Gnostics could be of use for the purpose you mention, I
am far from having any objection to you or any other person
making that use of it ; but I have too many other pursuits to
attend to it.^

   I inclose a copy of my Political Tract,* which will not be
printed off till I hear from you. There is nothing in it that
is at all objectionable, being the calmest discussion of im
portant subjects. We are forming a Constitutional Society
here, similar to that in Manchester, and I inclose the rules
and principles of it. We propose to have two annual dinners,
viz. the 14th of July and 4th of November.

   Our anxiety during the King of France's escape, and our
joy on his capture,f cannot be described. I hope the new
consitution is now effectually established, and that all attempts
to overturn it will be in vain. The high-party here are mor
tified in the extreme. They would have had France involved
in a most ruinous civil war, for the imaginary rights of one
man. A majority, I fear, of Englishmen are in these senti
ments, so that we are far indeed behind the French. In spite
of all we can write or do, an attachment to high maxims of
government gains ground here, and the love of liberty is on
the decline. Such is the influence of the court. Nothing but
public difficulties will open our eyes.

   I rejoice in the prospect of seeing you and Mrs. Lindsey this
summer. I really should not know how to do without it.
While Mr. Tayleur lives, at least let us never neglect to see
him annually. His time, and indeed ours, cannot be long.
Let us often meet, and encourage one another. The enemy is
powerful, though we must not despair.

to omit it entirely, than alter it any more. When shall we
see what Mr. Belsham§ wrote, to add to it ?

   I now enter, though with unavoidable reluctance, on
that period of Dr. Priestley's history, when, like holy
men of old, whose faith and patience have been the
worthy objects of Christian imitation, he endured severe
" trials of cruel Blockings," and of irreparable " wrongs,"
yet cherishing towards his bitterest persecutors the le
nient spirit of his divine Exemplar, " Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do.'** Still further
to aggravate those heavy inflictions, he had too much
reason to complain, in common with his fellow-sufferers,
of their country's tardy and imperfect justice.

   Forty years have elapsed, since Birmingham was thus
disgraced, not only throughout Great Britain, but to the
extent of the civilized and scientific world. Happily,
during the interval, the civic character of that great mart

priesthood the mantle of a Curtis, or even of a Madan,^
has not descended ; and one of her clergy, who survives
that period, has done honour to himself, amidst a very

with Dr. Priestley among the infelicities and indiscre
tions of his earlier days.*

   After describing the paper-war with the clergy of
Birmingham, who had hitherto brought to the combat
only " words that burn," the Memoir thus proceeds :

   (195.) From these small pieces I was far from expecting
any serious consequences. But the Dissenters in general being
very obnoxious to the court, and it being imagined, though
without any reason, that I had been the chief promoter of the
measures which gave them offence, the clergy, not only in
Birmingham, but through all England, seemed to make it their
business, by writing in the public papers, by preaching, and
other methods, to inflame the minds of the people against me ;
and on occasion of the celebration of the anniversary of the
French revolution, on July 14, 1791, by several of my friends,
but with which I had little to do,f a mob, encouraged by some
persons in power, first burned the meeting-house in which I
preached, then another meeting-house in the town, and then
my dwelling-house, demolishing my library, apparatus, and,
as far as they could, every thing belonging to me.J They also

J " A person who was in his library during the demolition of the house,"

thus writes to Dr. Priestley : " The road for half a mile of my approach was

strewed with your books, the mob were carrying others away, and there were

not above twelve octavoes on the shelves, when I entered the room, the floor

of- which was totally covered, two or three inches deep, with torn leaves,

chiefly manuscript." W. XIX. 5/8.

Mr. Arthur Young, in his "Tour through Warwickshire," before he

had become a courtly alarmist, and an apologist of the Inquisition, (see W.

XXII. 523, note,) thus indignantly refers to these transactions :

" Seeing, as I passed, a house in ruins, on inquiry I found it was Dr.

Priestley's. I alighted from my horse, and walked over the ruins of that

laboratory which I had left home with the expectation of reaping instruc

tion in ; of that laboratory, the labours of which have not only illuminated

mankind, but enlarged the sphere of science itself; which has carried its

master's fame to the remotest corners of the civilized world ; and will now,

with equal celerity, convey the infamy of its destruction to the disgrace of

the age, and the scandal of the British name.

courts and parliaments ! These are the pulpit principles that have scrawled
Church and King on all the barns and stables that I pass. These are the
principles that instigated a mob of miscreants : I beg pardon, of ' Friends
and Fellow-churchmen,' attached to Church and King, to act so well for
the reputation of this country." To " Friends and Fellow-churchmen" Mr.
Young annexes the following explanatory note (see W. XIX. 553) :

   " Called so, in an address to the mob, while engaged in their plundcrings
and burnings, in the same hand-bill that speaks of the king's taws. May not
that address be translated into plainer English : You are a set of honest
fellotcs, engaged in a good cause, which, however, you have pushed a tittle
too far ! What a miracle after, that the whole town was not plundered and
burnt!" See Major Cartwright's "Commonwealth in Danger," (1795,)
Appendix, pp. 155, 156.

   Cowper to " Rev. W. Bagot. Weston, Aug. 2, 1791. You live, I think,
in the neighbourhood of Birmingham. What must you not have felt on the
late alarming occasion? You, I suppose, could see the fires from your win
dows. We, who only heard the news of them, have trembled. Never, sure,
was religious zeal more detestably manifested, or more to the prejudice of
its own cause." Letters, (1806,) III. 340.

  · " July 19. The Methodists and followers of the late Countess of Hun

tington have all been protected. In the beginning of the riots, the mob
went to some of their houses, and questioned them concerning the doctrines
they professed, and on their declaring for Church and King, they were as
sured that they should remain unmolested. The church people walk about
as usual, without the smallest apprehension of danger.

  " During the whole of those transactions, the populace have continually
shouted, ' God save the King ; Long live the King and the Constitution in
Church and State ; Down with the Dissenters ; Down with all the abettors
of French rebellion ; Church and King ; Down with the Rumps ; No Olivers ;
No false Rights of Man.' " Lond. Chron. LXX 64.

  t " This morning an express arrived at the Secretary of State's office
from Birmingham, with an account that a great number of persons, to
the amount of some hundreds, who were in opposition to the Revolu
tionists, had assembled on Thursday last before the house where the
Society dined, aud broke all the windows. They then pulled part of the
house down, and proceeded to the different meeting-houses, which they laid
level with the ground. After which, they broke into the house of Dr.
Priestley, took every thing out, burnt his books, drank the wine, and other
liquor found in his cellars, and, when the express came away, were demo
lishing the house to the foundation. The whole town was in an uproar, and
the greatest confusion and riot prevailed. A messenger was dispatched to His
Majesty at Windsor with the above particulars." Ibid. July 14-- 16, 1791.

118 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   (106.) Being in some personal danger on this occasion, I
went to London ; and so violent was the spirit of party which
then prevailed, that I believe I could hardly have been safe
in any other place.

   (197.) There, however, I was perfectly so, though I con
tinued to be an object of troublesome attention, until I left the
country altogether. It shewed no small degree of courage and
friendship in Mr. William Vaughan to receive me into his
house, and also in Mr. Salte,* with whom I spent a month at
Tottenham ; but it shewed more in Dr. Price's congregation,
at Hackney, to invite me to succeed him, which they did,
though not unanimously, some time after my arrival in
London.f

   (198.) In this situation I found myself as happy as I had
been at Birmingham ; and, contrary to general expectation,
I opened my lectures to young persons with great success,
being attended by many from London ; and though I lost some
of the hearers, I left the congregation in a better situation than
that in which I found it.

   (199.) On the whole, I spent my time even more happily at
Hackney than ever I had done before, having every advantage
for my philosophical and theological studies, in some respect
superior to what I had enjoyed at Birmingham, especially from
my easy access to Mr. Lindsey, and my frequent intercourse
with Mr. Belsham, professor of divinity in the New College^
near which I lived. Never, on this side the grave, do I ex
pect to enjoy myself so much as I did by the fire-side of Mr.
Lindsey, conversing with him and Mrs. Lindsey on theolo
gical and other subjects, or in my frequent walks with Mr.
Belsham,§ whose views of most important subjects were, like
Mr. Lindsey's, the same with my own.

   (200.) I found, however, my society much restricted with
respect to my philosophical acquaintance, most of the mem
bers of the Royal Society shunning me on account of my re
ligious or political opinions, so that I at length withdrew my
self from them, and gave my reasons for so doing in the pre
face to my " Observations and Experiments on the Generation
of Air from Water," which I published at Hackney;* for,

   " The conversation upon these occasions usually turned upon some in
teresting subjects. Upon one occasion the topic of discussion was the
second advent of Christ; and Dr. Priestley, who had studied the Apocalypse
with great attention, inferred from the state of the world, compared with
the language of prophecy, that the second personal appearance of Christ
was very near at hand. ' You,' says he, ' may probably live to see it ; I
shall not. It cannot, I think, be more than twenty years.' "

  On this fond expectation, and some equally hasty conclusions of other
pious and learned investigators of the Apocalypse, Mr. Belsham justly re
marks " how grievously the most enlightened minds may err, when they
attempt to apply the language of prophecy to passing events !" Mem. of
Lindtey, pp. 375, 876, note. See W. XV. 513--515.

   * In 1793, with a " Dedication to the Members of the Lunar Society.''
(See I. 339.) In " the preface," Dr. Priestley refers to his Appeal, where
he had " said that notwithstanding what had passed with respect to the re
peated rejection of Mr. Cooper," whom he " and several others, the most
scientific members of the Royal Society," (see W. XIX. 503--505,) had
" recommended," he " should not quarrel with the institution." He then adds,

  " This was my real intention at the time ; but the Society, by rejecting
another respectable candidate, who had the most ample testimonials in his
favour, merely on account of his supposed political principles, has shewn
a fixed determination to reject any candidate whose political principles they
do not approve ; and this has made me conclude that any communications
from me would be unacceptable to them. I therefore shall not trouble the
Society with them, but adopt this less eligible mode of publication.

  " Since, however, the friends of philosophy in this country must separate,
on the ground of religion and politic/, things entirely foreign to our pro
fessed object, which is natural science, may the separation have no farther
consequence than that of producing a generous emulation who shall most
advance the common cause of science, the friends of church and king, as
they affect exclusively to call themselves, or the friends of liberty, among
whom, at all times, and in all circumstances, I shall be proud to rank myself.
We are, it is true, but a small minority, but not deficient, I trust, in ability,
activity, and energy, qualities which will always make men respected, though
oppressed." The preface thus concludes :

  " Having objects enow of my own, I have always carefully refrained
from putting my sickle into any other man's harvest ; but if any person,
seeing the track that I am in, choose to step before me, and anticipate me

 with the assistance of my friends, I had in a great measure
 replaced my apparatus, and had resumed my experiments,
 though after the loss of nearly two years.

    (201.) Living in the neighbourhood of the New College, I
 voluntarily undertook to deliver the lectures to the pupils on
 the subject of " History and General Policy," which I had
 composed at Warrington," and also on " Experimental Philo
 sophy, particularly including Chemistry," the " Heads" of
 which I drew up for this purpose, and afterwards published.f
 In being useful to this institution, I found a source of consi
 derable satisfaction to myself. Indeed, I have always had a
 high degree of enjoyment in lecturing to young persons,
 though more on theological subjects than on any other.

    (202.) After the riots in Birmingham, I wrote " An Appeal
 to the Public" on the subject, and that being replied to by the
 clergy of the placed I wrote a " Second Part," to which,
 though they had pledged themselves to do it, they made no
 reply ; so that, in fact, the criminality of the magistrates, and
 other principal high-church men at Birmingham, in pro
 moting the riot, remains acknowledged. Indeed, many cir
 cumstances which have appeared since that time, shew that
 the friends of the court, if not the prime ministers themselves,
 were the favourers of that riot, having, no doubt, thought to
  intimidate the friends of liberty by the measure.

     (203.) To my Appeal I subjoined various " Addresses" that
 were sent to me from several descriptions of persons in

 in any thing that I have in view, he is very welcome. The field is suffi

  more numerous than we are.

    " As the time that 1 have to devote to these pursuits is very uncertain, and
  will probably not be long, I wish to make the most of it ; and as the generous
. friends of science have enabled me to resume these pursuits, I wish to con
  vince them that their confidence in me has not been misplaced. Least of all
  would I be deficient in gratitude to that Being who is the Author of all good,
  and to whom, according to my motto, (Deus nobis hcec otia fecit,) I ulti
  mately ascribe the means and the leisure that I enjoy to prosecute these

England and abroad ; and from them I will not deny that I
received much satisfaction, as it appeared that the friends of
liberty, civil and religious, were of opinion that I was a sufferer
in that cause. From France I received a considerable number
of addresses ; and when the present National Convention was
called, I was invited by many of the departments to be a
member of it; but I thought myself more usefully employed
at home, and that I was but ill qualified for a business which
required knowledge which none but a native of the country
could possess, and therefore declined the honour that was pro
posed to me.*

  (204.) But no addresses gave me so much satisfaction as
those from my late congregation, and especially of the young
persons belonging to it, who had attended my lectures. They
are a standing testimony of the zeal and fidelity with which
I did my duty with respect to them, and which I value
highly.

  (205.) Besides congratulatory addresses, I received much
pecuniary assistance from various persons and bodies of men,
which more than compensated for my pecuniary losses, though
what was awarded me at the assizes fell two thousand pounds
short of them ; but my brother-in-law, Mr. John Wilkinson,
from whom I had not at that time any expectation, in con
sequence of my son's leaving his employment, was the most
generous on the occasion. Without any solicitation, he imme
diately sent me five hundred pounds, and afterwards trans
ferred to me ten thousand pounds, which he had deposited in
the French funds, and until that be productive, he allows me
two hundred pounds per annum.

worship,* they made a great impression on many of our young
men, and in his preface he reflected much on the character of
Dr. Price,f On both these accounts I thought myself called
upon to reply to him, which I did in a series of " Letters to
a Young Man." But though he made several angry replies,*
I never noticed any of them. In this situation I also answered
Mr. Evanson's " Observations on the Dissonance of the Evan
gelists, in a Second Set of Letters to a Young Man."§ He
also replied to me,|| but I was satisfied with what 1 had done,
and did not continue the controversy.

   (208.) Besides the Sermon which I delivered on my ac
ceptance of the invitation to the meeting at Hackney ,1f in the
preface to which I gave a detailed account of my system of
catechising, I published two " Fast Sermons," for the years
1793 and 1794, in the latter of which I gave my ideas of
ancient prophecies, compared with the then state of Europe ;
and in the preface to it I gave an account of my reasons for leav
ing the country.** I also published a " Farewell Discourse."ff

   (209.) But the most important of my publications in this
situation were a series of " Letters to the Philosophers and
Politicians of France on the Subject of Religion."JJ I thought
that the light in which I then stood in that country, gave me
some advantage in my attempts to enforce the evidence of
natural and revealed religion. I also published a set of " Dis
courses on the Evidences of Revealed Religion,"§§ which I
first delivered by public notice, and the delivery of which
was attended by great numbers. They were printed just
before I left England.

When I wrote my last, little did I foresee what soon after

happened ; but the will of God be done.

The company were hardly gone from the inn,J before a

drunken mob rushed into the house, and broke all the win

dows. They then set fire to our meeting-house, and it is

burned to the ground. After that they gutted, and, some

say, burned the old meeting.

In the mean time, some friends came to tell me that I and

my house were threatened, and another brought a chaise to

convey me and my wife away. I had not presence of mind to

take even my MSS. ; and after we were gone, the mob came

and demolished every thing, household goods, library, and

apparatus. Indeed, they say the house itself is almost de

molished, but happily no fire could be got,§ so that many

things, but I know not what, will be saved.

We thought that when it was day, the mob would disperse,

and therefore we kept in the neighbourhood ; but finding

they rather increased, and grew more outrageous with liquor,

we were advised to go off, and are now on our way to Heath.

My wife behaves with wonderful courage. The recollec

tion of my lost MSS. pains me the most, especially my Notes

on the New Testament, which I wanted only five days of

getting all transcribed.|| But, I doubt not, all will be for

As Mr. Lindsey has a cover for you, I take the opportunity

of giving you a line myself. I thank God that myself and

family are safe: but since, as far as I know, all my sermons

are gone, I beg you would send me those of Mr. Graham,§

Birmingham at present, and once thought of going to Castle-

Head, where I should have had the pleasure of seeing you ;

but it is rather too far off.

I give you joy of the increase of your family, and hope your

happiness will never meet with such an interruption as I have

had ; but I find no want of health or spirits, and my friends

depends upon yourself, and I much fear your health will suffer
by your constant exertions. I hope, however, you are apprized
of this, and that you are not insensible how much depends
upon your valuable life. May God preserve you, and give a
happy termination to this affair!

   On Wednesday I dined with Mr. Sheridan, in order, as he
said, to meet Mr. Fox, who, however, was not there, but
desired Mr. Sheridan to tell me that he was ready to take the
matter up in the House of Commons in whatever manner we
should think proper. They conceive that the encouragement
given by the court to the high-church party was intended to
crush Mr. Fox, and those who took our part, and to intimidate
both them and us. I cannot, however, think that there is
much in this, and I am very unwilling to connect our cause
with that of any political party, as, upon the face of it, it is
evidently of a purely religious nature. I therefore differ from
most of our friends here, and wish, with you, to shew no dis
trust of government, since our end will be answered, whether
they appear in earnest to redress our grievances or not. Our
tribunal is our country and the world ; and before this our
court, as well as ourselves, must appear, and we cannot doubt
an equitable decision.

   The same bad spirit pervades the whole kingdom, though
the storm was, I doubt not, directed to break out here. Had
Dr. Price been living, it is taken for granted that Hackney
would have suffered as much as Birmingham, and that the
College would not have been spared. Mr. Walker's* letter,
which I inclose, and which 1 wish you to preserve, will shew
you the spirit that prevails at Manchester, and we have similar
accounts from all the west of England. It is, indeed, an
alarming crisis that things are come to. But we cannot doubt
that a wise and good Providence superintends and directs the
whole. I long to be with you on many accounts. Mr. Keirf

advisable to defer it, till the legal inquiry be over.

From the Protestant Dissenters in Great Yarmouth.

Rut. Sir,                      Yarmouth, July 29, 1791.

We, ministers and members of the Three Denominations of

Protestant Dissenters in Great Yarmouth, beg leave to express

to you the interest we take in the late calamitous events which

have befallen you. Differing in various matters of opinion,

we all agree in warm admiration of your high abilities, your

zealous researches after Christian truth, and your distinguished

exertions in the cause of civil and religious liberty. These

qualities, which have made you the peculiar mark of the ven

geance of bigotry, render your safety and welfare proportion-

ably dear to us.

Whilst we lament your losses, not only as those of an indi

vidual, but of the public, we receive a consolation in the magna

nimity with which you have borne them, and in the testimony

this event has given to the world, of the difference between

the temper and conduct of those who support a good cause,

and of those who oppose it.

What will be the final result of so atrocious an act we pre

sume not to pronounce ; but one good effect from it we think

we can foresee, that of drawing closer the bands of union and

amity amongst all the different bodies of Dissenters, who must

henceforth feel that they have a common concern in each

other's welfare and security.

We request you to convey our cordial sentiments of condo

lence to your fellow-sufferers, and remain, with sincere esteem

and every good wish, Rev. Sir, your friends and fellow-

christians.f

inform you that I hear your precious MS. is safe. There has

been a general wreck, but some planks are got to shore, though

what they are I have not as yet had any distinct account.

Had I had any idea that the mob meant any thing more

than to insult me, I might have carried off all my most valua

steadily pursued by some cool heads among the many drunken

ones.

My wife and I were playing at backgammon, after supper,f

when the alarm was given us ; and a friend brought a chaise

to take us immediately away. I hardly slept for four nights.

Two of them I was in a chaise, or post-coach, and the other

two on horseback. This was owing not so much to my own

apprehensions of danger, as to those of others.

   They all feel how much loss the sciences have experienced
by the destruction of those labours which you had prepared
for their aggrandizement. It is not you, Sir, who have reason
to complain. Your virtue and your genius still remain un
diminished, and it is not in the power of human ingratitude to
forget what you have done for the happiness of mankind.
They only ought to be unhappy whose guilty conduct has led
their reason astray, and whose remorse has already punished
their crimes.

   You are not the first friend of liberty, against whom tyrants
have armed the very people whom they have deprived of their
rights. These are the only means which they can make use
of against him whose disinterestedness of mind, whose eleva
tion of soul, and whose purity of conduct, equally shelter him
from their seductions and their vengeance.

   They calumniate such a person, when they can neither inti
midate nor corrupt him. They arm prejudices against him,
when they dare not arm the laws; and that which they have
done in regard to you, is the noblest homage that tyranny dares
to render to probity, to talents, and to courage.

   At this present moment a league is formed throughout
Europe against the general liberty of mankind ; but, for some
time past, another has existed, occupied with propagating, and
with defending this liberty, without any other arms than those
furnished by reason, and these will finally triumph.

   It is in the necessary order of things that error should be
momentary, and truth eternal. Men of genius, supported by
their virtuous disciples, when placed in the balance against
the vulgar mob of corrupt intriguers, the instruments, or the
accomplices of tyrants, must at length prevail against them.

   The glorious day of universal liberty will shine upon our
descendants, but we shall, at least, enjoy the aurora; and you,
Sir, have contributed not a little to accelerate that happy event
by your labours, by the example of your virtues, by the indig
nation which all Europe feels against your persecutors, and by
the interest and the admiration which a misfortune has excited,
that, although it may wound, cannot subdue your soul.

   I am, with an inviolable and respectful attachment, Sir, and
my very illustrious associate, your humble and most obedient
servant.*

                              To M. CONdoRCET.

      Sir,
   I am more than consoled for my losses in finding that the
members of the Academy of Sciences have done me the honour
to interest themselves in my affairs, and especially in observ
ing that the friends of philosophy are, what they ever ought to
be, the friends of general liberty. With us there is an exam
ple of the enemies of the one being also the enemies of the
other. Having always been an avowed advocate of public
liberty, civil and religious, which led me to write in defence of
your late glorious revolution, the great body of the clergy in
this country, and many of those who call themselves the
friends of the king, have long been my enemies; and, in
accomplishing my ruin, they have not spared the instruments
of that science, my application to which gave some degree of
weight to my labours in another field.
   But do not, Sir, suppose that these friends of the Church and
King are the English nation. They are no more than a fac
tion, whom a failure in the way of argument has rendered
desperate. The sober part of the nation think more justly,
and equally disapprove their maxims, and the methods they
take to enforce them. The English nation, in general, respect
the French ; and though too many of them are, at present,
under a temporary delusion, will vie with you in every thing
truly liberal, in whatever can contribute to the honour and
happiness of the country at home, and to its living in peace
and good-will with all its neighbours, and especially with
yourselves, whose exertions in favour of universal liberty, and
universal peace, will for ever endear you to us.
   Assure my brethren of the Academy, that, honoured by their
choice of me for an associate, and by their generous sympathy
on the present occasion, I shall not fail, while my life and my

faculties are continued to me, to resume my philosophical pur
suits, and endeavour to shew our common enemies that a
genuine love of science, and of liberty, is inextinguishable,
except with life, and that unreasonable and wicked opposition
tends to animate, rather than depress, the mind that is pene
trated with it.

   In perfect confidence that whatever is true and right will
finally prevail, and that every mode of opposition will only
contribute to their more complete establishment, I subscribe
myself, with respect, Sir, their and your very humble servant.*

From the Society of the Friends of the Constitu
                   tion, SITTING AT THE JaCOBINS.

      Sir, Paris, 1791.
   Many learned societies have already offered you, and will
yet offer you, the tribute of their sensibility on the loss which
science has suffered by the attack made on your property, in
its most precious particular, your cabinet and manuscripts. In
times less troublesome, this loss, afflicting to all classes of men,
would even have affected many of those who have now had
the cruelty to rejoice in it, and who have entertained against
your political principles a hatred, which perhaps they do not
feel towards you personally. You are the victim of the inter
est which you have taken in the cause of human nature,
triumphant in the greatest revolution which ever occurred.
   You have interrupted the course of your labours and dis
coveries in physics, to justify the French nation against the
absurd charges brought against them, and multiplied by their
oppressors, who are driven from a land of liberty. The cries
of their despair, their exaggerated reproaches, their calumni
ous imputations, had, for a moment, spread delusion over
neighbouring nations. They desire to interpose between them
and France a cloud, which, in passing, should obscure, if not
totally conceal from their view, the glory of the French
revolution.
    You, Sir, penetrated this cloud, and drew from it some

sparks of light, which, since, have not ceased to illuminate the

nations. One of your writings has victoriously repulsed the

attack of one of our most unjust detractors.* From this your

name, already dear in Europe, to all those who cultivate the

arts, or who improve their reason, becomes particularly dear

to Frenchmen. The Society of the Friends of the Constitu

tion were able to reckon one friend more ; and, recently, on

the news of the misfortune which has happened to the sciences

and to the world, more than to yourself, they united, with zeal

and affection, an emotion of indignation against those who ex

cited the criminal attack, already punished by the noble and

touching letter which you addressed to your fellow-citizens,f

and which, without doubt, is expiated, in part, by the re

morse of the most of them.

The ignorance of the people is the patrimony of tyrants; but

it ceases. Repentance succeeds, and presently it chastises, on

the heads of those who instigate to crimes, the crime of draw

ing forth popular delusion. The victim foresees the instant of

vengeance, without permitting himself to hasten it. He con

soles himself in seeing the diffusion through his country, and

through Europe, of the generous principles of sociability, the

power of which, every day augmented, is manifested in the in

numerable testimonies of an universal interest in his calamity.

  We believe, Sir, that we enter into the secret of your cha
racter, in persuading ourselves that it is under this point of

view alone that these testimonies of an affecting esteem cannot

be indifferent to you. They are proofs of the progress of these

social ideas, of the public spirit which calls a free people to

the practice of the virtues requisite to the maintenance of

liberty, which, strengthening at home, concurs in spreading it

around, and even, perhaps, in perfecting it among those nations

who enjoyed but an incomplete freedom.

In fine, these testimonies announce the development of that

philanthropic patriotism, which regards all felicity ; an idea so
superior to the conceptions of despots and slaves, as to be the

object of their contemptible derision, but which posterity will

bless as the happy fruit of that philosophy, too modern, which

reckons the illustrious Priestley among its most ardent propa
gators.*

     To the Printer of the Birmingham Gazette.

      Sir, 1791.
   I do not now write to complain of my sufferings in general,
but of one in particular, which may in some measure be
alleviated.
   Private letters are a species of property peculiarly sacred.
No person of honour will even look in a letter not directed to
himself; and yet many of mine, I understand, are circulated,
read, and detained from me, without any regard to decency or
justice. A stranger picked up two that had been written to
me by a late bishop, and instead of sending them to me, he
sent them to the present bishop of the same see, who, also, in
stead of sending them to me, sent them to the son of the late
bishop, from whom I had just received them.
   To have private letters (which are often improper to be
seen by one's nearest friends) exposed to every impertinent
eye, is one of the most painful circumstances in my situation.
L hope, therefore, that even enemies, who have any regard to
their character, will send any letter of mine that may fall into
their hands, sealed up, to those who will convey them to me
with the least expense. There are dishonourable, as well as
honourable, methods of annoying an adversary.
   It may be necessary to inform some persons that no one can
detain 'or destroy the property of another, (and letters are
property,) without being subjected to an action. If any private
papers be sent to a Secretary of State,f and he be bound by
the rules of justice and honour, he will return them, or, at
least, copies of them, to the person whose property they are.J

     Rev. and Dear Sir,
   We, the afflicted and sorrowing members of the New Meet
ing Society, in the midst of the anguish and anxiety which is
inseparable from our present calamities, have greatly regretted
that we could not, before this day, assemble together to confer
upon the deplorable situation of our congregational affairs, and
the measures necessary to be pursued in consequence of our
persecutions. Being now met together for this purpose, we
immediately embrace the opportunity of addressing ourselves
to our well-beloved pastor, and beg to assure you how tenderly
and affectionately we sympathize with you in the present
season of severe trial and affliction ; and that, in the spirit of
Christian love and affection, we most tenderly condole with
you under your personal, unmerited, and painful sufferings.
  Little did we conceive that the exemplary diligence with
which we have seen you, for the space of eleven yearg, incul
cate upon us and our children every thing that was good and
virtuous, could be followed by such a dreadful catastrophe as
we now feel and contemplate. Whatever misconceptions our
neighbours may have unhappily adopted respecting your vari
ous publications, we dare appeal to them, and we testify to
the world, that your pastoral cares and labours have uniformly
tended to every thing that becomes the Christian, or can adorn
the man, to a sincere and fervent piety towards God, and to
peace and universal good-will to all mankind, without any dis
tinction of sect or party.
  You have uniformly taught us to respect the government
under which we live ; and in the devotional service of every
Lord's-day have never failed to offer up our united prayers for
the Divine blessing upon the king, his royal family, and all
that are in authority under him ; so that from whatever cause
it may be that you have been marked out for persecution, and
for the grievous calamities to which you are still exposed, we

are sensible it cannot originate in any part of your pastoral
labours, which all those strangers who have occasionally
joined us (without some of whom scarce a Lord's-day has
passed) must witness, as well as ourselves, have been con
ducted in the true spirit of the gospel, in a spirit of love and
peace ; and though distinguished by an ardent desire to pro
mote the cause of truth, yet still more uniformly directed to
inculcate the great and primary duties of sincere piety towards
God, and universal benevolence towards all mankind.

   Accept, dear Sir, our unfeigned testimony to your exem
plary diligence, your eminent abilities, your unremitted zeal,
your distinguished humility, your unquestioned sincerity, and
your uniform love of peace, Christian forbearance, and mode
ration ; and permit us to assure you how affectionately and
tenderly we sympathize with you under your present suffer
ings, and how sincerely we wish their removal. And although
you are not immediately returning to us, yet we look forward
with pleasure to those happier times when you may resume
your pastoral labours here, with safety and satisfaction.

    In the mean time we earnestly recommend you to the Divine
protection and favour, imploring Him to watch over, to guide
and bless you, and, in due time, to restore you to us, who are
in the bonds of Christian love and affection, reverend and
ever dear Sir, your sincere and affectionate friends.*

       My Christian Brethren, London, Aug. 4, 1791.
    Your affectionate letter has given me not only consolation,
 but joy. I rejoice to see the effects of those principles in
 which it has been my business, and that of my excellent col
 league, to instruct you ; and the situation in which we now
 are is peculiarly adapted to try their force, and to shew the
 world that religion is not a business of mere speculation, but
 that it is capable of supporting the mind and directing the
 conduct in the most trying circumstances.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIKSTLEY.  135

   I rejoice that after being an example to other congregations,
of purity of Christian doctrine, and excellence of discipline,
you are now an example of patience and fortitude in suffer
ing; firmly maintaining the principles for which you suffer,
and yet preserving your good-will towards the authors of your
sufferings ; not forgetting that there is the hand of God, as
well as that of man, in every thing that befals us; and pray
ing that God would forgive your enemies and turn their
hearts.

   Be assured, that in the height of my sufferings, I would not
(even without any respect to futurity) have exchanged my
feelings with those of our persecutors, in the moment of their
greatest exultation over us; for I never lost the feelings of
pity and benevolence towards them, while I was the object of
their hatred and execration. I have even found, as I doubt
not yourselves have also done, that these Christian sentiments
are more easily exercised in great trials than in little ones, as
they more effectually call forth the principles from which they
proceed.

   I rejoice that you are about to re-establish the affairs of our
society, and I only wait your summons to assist you in that
necessary work. Your call will be to me an intimation of my
duty ; and then committing my life to Him who gave it, and
who will not suffer it to terminate unseasonably, I will in
stantly attend you, and resume the functions of the office with
which you have honoured me. I know no satisfaction equal
to that which has ever accompanied the discharge of such
duties as those I owe to you.

   Let what we have mutually suffered teach us the uncer
tainty of every thing in this world, and the value of those
principles which enable us to look beyond it, and not only to
bear, but to rejoice in tribulation, to esteem it an honour to be
" counted worthy" to bear reproach, to incur loss, and even' to
lay down our lives for the pure faith of the gospel. May your
tribulation work patience, and patience experience, and expe
rience hope, even that hope which maketh not ashamed.

   Finally, may God preserve and keep you. May your suffer

           To Mr. Russell.f

Dear Sir,                       London, Aug. 5, 1791-

If you think proper to print the letter to the congregation,

which I sent yesterday, you had better omit the following

clause : " then committing my life to Him who gave it, and

who will not suffer it to terminate unseasonably." It will be

better not to intimate my idea of danger. I fear, however, it

will be long before men's minds be in a proper state for my

return, and notwithstanding my wishes and yours, both should

be sacrificed to a greater object. Nothing would affect me

more than a separation from you, whose affection and confi

dence is my greatest pride ; but that may become a duty, and

should be submitted to. Nothing can well prevent our occa

sional intercourse here, or, I hope, our everlasting union here

after. I am writing my Appeal to the Public.

The circulation of my private correspondence through the

town, which my wife mentions, is an unpleasant circumstance,

though nothing unfavourable to my character or conduct can

be inferred from it. A proper advertisement in the newspaper

might, perhaps, make people ashamed of such conduct, and

collect the letters, and the remainder of the Memoirs of my own

Life. I leave this to you, who are on the spot. I should be

glad if Mr. Thompson would send me a weekly account of the

books and papers collected. Mr. Lee is now leaving town,

and I shall be glad to send my letters in future in your packet

from Mr. Rogers. When I know what books are preserved, I

can pretty well make out a list of all the most valuable ones

that are lost or damaged, and give a catalogue of every thing of

  By all means take care of yourself, for more difficult times,
which, I fear, await us all in this country.

  I am at a printer's, and write on such paper as I find
there.*

             To the Same.

Dear Sir,    Tottenham,t Aug. 8, 1791.

It gives me great concern that so great a share of this great

burden occasioned, though innocently, by myself, should fall

upon you, if not endanger your valuable life, while I am out of

the way, and can bear no part of the burden, and run no part

of the risk. As to all that our enemies can write in answer to

my letter, or otherwise, I do not think it worth while to take

any notice of it at present. My Appeal to the Public, which I

have now written, will suffice for the purpose. At least, some

friend of ours on the spot may answer shortly for me, if neces

sary. I lament that shocking spirit of party (which my wife

describes in stronger terms than you do) that seems not only

to prevail, but to increase. Mr. Keir thinks it will increase

still more, in consequence of taking affidavits against the

magistrates, which, however, he thinks absolutely necessary.

A Mr. Shove, a counsellor on the home circuit, called on

me on Saturday to shew me a supplement to the Maidstone

neicspaper, containing a letter, written, as he can prove, by

Mr. Noble, including another to him, from some person at

Birmingham, on which he wishes to found a prosecution of

Mr. Noble, and he promised to write to you on the subject.

He left the paper with me, and I inclose it. It may, at least,

throw some light on the proceedings with you. Please to

return it, as I shall make some use of it in my AppeaLJ It was

written by an approver of the business.

I am glad that one of the copies of my Memoirs is preserved.

The other, in long hand too, must take its chance. I wish,

however, you would read it. It has been seen by Mr. Lind-

   I wish you would send me all the MS. papers, in long and

ton's, and with them, if they have been preserved, Sweden-
borg's Universal Theology, and his Treatise on the Last Judg
ment. I want something to do, and can recompose and print
my Letters to the Swedenborgians. Those letters, fairly copied
for the press, I fear, are all lost ; but if any single leaves be
found, let them be sent, as also any of my Translation of the
Psalms, &c, written in the margin of leaves cut from Pearson's
late Bible.

tus, with the valuation f I cannot do it till I have a catalogue

From the Young People of the New Meeting.

Honoured Sir,               Birmingham, 1791.

The common principles of humanity would, after what has

recently occurred, incite us to communicate our feelings to you.

But we feel urged to it by far greater motives. We have seen

the great apostle of civil and religious liberty driven from

among us. We have seen the precious labours of a great part

of his life destroyed by a lawless mob. We have seen his

apparatus and library share the same fate. We have seen this

valuable member of society in the greatest danger of falling a

victim to popular fury ; and, not yet having persecuted him

sufficiently, we are frequently hearing the vilest invectives

against him, who is so highly deserving of our gratitude for

his personal and unwearied efforts, to enlighten our minds on

the great subject of religion, and whose philosophical labours

               · Orig. MS.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  139

have been so justly extolled throughout every part of the
civilized world.

  To attempt a description of what we feel on reflecting on
these circumstances would be as difficult as it would be pain
ful. To assure you that we feel extremely for you, would be
supposing you unacquainted with us. But, Sir, there is one
circumstance which much heightens our sorrow. We cannot
think of your abilities without respect, we cannot feel the
effects of your labours without indulging an ardent wish that
we may still continue to experience the happy effects of your
instructions. But when'we recollect the indignities you have
felt, the trials you have had to support, and the irreparable
loss you have sustained, our fears are alarmed lest such com
plicated distress should lead you to seek an asylum, which,
Sir, to our inexpressible sorrow, Birmingham hath not afforded
you. On the other hand, knowing the Christian dispositions
you possess, and the knowledge you have of the human mind,
we are convinced that many palliatives will suggest themselves,
which, to a mind like yours, will have considerable influence.

   Young as we are, we cannot but hope and expect that the
flame which ignorance and bigotry have kindled, will be soon
extinguished by an increase of knowledge, and that genuine
Christianity will so far take possession of the hearts of our
fellow-townsmen, that they will look upon the persecution you
have suffered at their hands as a sin against the purest of the
gospel precepts. Many, very many, we trust, agree with our
selves in wishing your return. Indulge us, then, kind Sir,
in this fond hope. Should it, however, be delayed, may we
shew our mistaken neighbours, that although Priestley is gone,
he sowed good seed before his departure, that it fell into good
ground, and that it now flourishes in the blade, and promises
a plenteous harvest. May we prove it to them, that argument
armed with fire and faggot may produce a temporary shock,
but that it finally strengthens our cause ; that it forces us to feel
the great justness of it, and produces actions natural to such a
conviction. We trust we shall always follow your great exam
ple, in candour and moderation, not losing sight of that Chris

140 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

tian fortitude you have so uniformly displayed since we have
had the happiness of your residence among us.

   Accept, dear Sir, our warmest expressions ofc gratitude for
the great and lasting services you have rendered us, as Chris
tians, as members of civil society, and as citizens; and be
assured it is with the greatest respect we subscribe ourselves,
honoured Sir, your affectionate pupils.*

To the Young People of the New Meeting.

My Young Friends,                London, Aug. 12, 1791.

I could not read your very affectionate address to me

without tears ofjoy. You were ever the most pleasing part of

my charge, and this address is a proof that the affection I had

for you, and the pains that I took in instructing you, have not

been thrown away. Your example will encourage other

Christian ministers, who hear of it, to follow mine. The

great object of my lectures, in all your classes, was to give

you a just knowledge of the principles of religion, as the only

solid foundation of proper sentiments and good conduct, and I

shall want no consolation under my unmerited sufferings, while

you continue to feel and to act as you do.

The unsettled state of the congregation, and the consequent

discontinuance of our lectures, you will consider as a trial of

the principles you have already acquired. Give a proof of

their strength by a steady attention to every means of improve

ment that is yet in your power.

The enemies of our Christian liberty have destroyed an ex

cellent library, provided for your use: but your zeal and libe

rality will supply you with resources of the same kind ; and

let the more opulent among you assist those who are less so.

Re-peruse the works which I composed for your use, and such

others as can be repurchased of those which the enemy has

deprived you of. Shew them, that by destroying books they

cannot destroy the effects of reading them ; that the love of

truth, of virtue, and of liberty, which you have imbibed, can

never be eradicated, and that lawless power can never subdue
fixed principles.

   What I more particularly wish, in your present situation, is,
that those who are the best instructed among you, would
supply my place in undertaking the instruction of others; and
many of you, I am well satisfied, are sufficiently qualified for
it; and assure yourselves of the Divine blessing on the weakest
well-meant endeavours.

  Young as you are, I trust you are too well established in
Christian principles to have your faith in a wise superintend
ing Providence at all shaken by the calamitous events which
have been permitted to befal us. Christianity did not lose,
but gain ground by persecution. It is a state excellently
adapted to recall to our minds, and to strengthen our regards to,
our future and better prospects, while it loosens a dangerous
attachment to the things of time and sense.

  The ways of God are unsearchable by us. But be assured
that nothing can materially harm you, if you be followers of
that which is good. If I be restored to you, which is my
most ardent wish, our mutual satisfaction will be doubled by
this interruption ; and if not, it will add to the ardour of your
wishes, as it does to mine, to meet you where the violence of
the adversary can never separate us any more.

   I am, my young friends, in the faith and hope of the gospel,
your affectionate pastor.*

From the Congregation, Mill-Hill Chapel.

Rev. and dear Sir,  Leeds, Aug. 14, 1791.

We, the Protestant Dissenters of Mill-Hill Chapel, in Leeds,

cannot rest satisfied in a silent sympathy with you on the losses

you have lately incurred from the violence of party rage.

While all the sincere friends of rational liberty and good

order are roused to an honest indignation by outrages which

have disgraced our country in the eyes of enlightened Europe,

care,* feel a personal interest in your welfare ; and as from
this intimate connexion with you, we have had a better op
portunity of becoming acquainted with your real character
than many others have enjoyed, we the more readily embrace
this opportunity of bearing our special testimony to its exem
plary excellence. An interval of more than eighteen years has
not effaced from our memory the good principles you incul
cated upon us, and the affectionate care which you uniformly
manifested for our advancement in every virtue. It was, in a
peculiar degree, the object of your attention to impress upon
the minds of the young such sentiments as are best calculated
to produce the peaceable and useful citizen in all the depart
ments in life, which many of us, who were then only rising to
maturity, and are now the heads of families, gratefully ac
knowledge.

   We also recollect with pleasure, that when you instructed
us in the reasons of a Protestant Dissent from the established
church, you were careful to guard us against the rancour of an
intolerant spirit, and to form us to the genuine temper of that
divine religion which enjoins peace on earth, and good-will
towards men. And though you always esteemed it your duty
to oppose what appeared to you the erroneous opinions and
superstitious practices of individuals or bodies of men, you
 were so far from entertaining a hostile disposition to their per
 sons or property, that you were solely actuated by a regard to
 their best interest, for which, however they might think you
 mistaken, they ought to have felt themselves obliged.

    Rejoicing in the support which you derive from the ample
 resources of your own mind, especially those which are the
 result of a good conscience, and earnestly wishing you every
 good, we remain, Rev. and dear Sir, your affectionate friends,f

Committee of the Revolution Society, subsequent to the atro-

cious riots which have taken place at Birmingham, to express
our concern and regret at those acts of lawless violence by
which you have been so great a sufferer, and which have re^
fleeted such extreme dishonour on this age and on this nation.

   It might have been presumed, that the most ignorant and
lawless savages would not have been induced to commit such
depredations on the house and property of a man of such dis
tinguished merit as yourself, to whom the whole scientific
world has been so eminently indebted, and in whose works
those principles of equal liberty have been asserted and main
tained, which would protect even the lowest of the human
species from violence and oppression. As a political writer,
you have been employed in disseminating the most just and
rational sentiments of Government, and such as are in a very
high degree calculated to promote general freedom and hap
piness.

  The conduct of the Birmingham rioters implied in it a com
plication of ignorance and brutality, which it is astonishing to
find, at the present period, in such a country as Great Britain.
Nothing but the most execrable bigotry, united to ignorance
the most contemptible, could lead any body of men to sup
pose that such acts of violence as were lately exercised at Bir
mingham against yourself and other respectable Dissenters in
that town and its neighbourhood, could be justified by any
difference of opinion. We hoped that the age had been more
enlightened ; that it had been universally admitted that no coun
try can be possessed of freedom in which every man is not allowed
to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience,
and in which he is not permitted to defend his opinions. We
hoped also that the principles of Civil Liberty had been so
well understood, and so universally adopted, that few would
have been found in this country who would not sincerely have
rejoiced in the emancipation of a neighbouring kingdom from
tyranny, and in such events as are calculated to promote
general liberty and happiness.

  It is with exultation and triumph that we see the success
of the late just, necessary, and glorious Revolution in France;
an event so pregnant with the most important benefits to the

144 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

world, that not to rejoice in it would be unworthy of us as
freemen, and as friends to the general rights of human nature ;
and to ascribe to the commemoration of the French Revolution
the late devastations committed at Birmingham, would be to
insult the understandings of mankind.

  We are sorry to find that so many of our countrymen still
need to be instructed in the first principles of civil and reli
gious freedom ; but we still hope that the period is not far
distant when the common rights of mankind will be univer
sally acknowledged ; when civil and ecclesiastical tyranny
shall be banished from the face of the earth ; and when it will
not be found practicable to procure any licentious mobs to
support the cause of an ignorant and interested intolerance.

   We again express our deep concern at the iniquitous riots
which have lately happened at Birmingham; at the acts of
violence and injustice which have been exercised against you
and your friends, and at the loss Science and Literature have
sustained in the destruction of your books, manuscripts, and
philosophical apparatus.

   We rejoice in the security of your person, notwithstanding
the malevolence of your adversaries; and at the magnanimity
with which you have sustained the injuries that you have
received.

   Permit us to entreat you to convey our cordial and affection
ate condolence to your fellow-sufferers in the cause of freedom
and public virtue. As to yourself, we desire to testify in the most
public manner the high sense we entertain of your merit; and
we beg leave to subscribe ourselves, with great respect and
regard, Rev. Sir, your most obedient and most humble
servants.*

  The Society reply, Feb. 4, 1792,
  " The sympathetic cordiality expressed by you at the unmerited treatment
which the pious and scientific Dr. Priestley has met with, canuot but be
most grateful to us, who consider him one of the greatest luminaries of the
age ; and that he was so in fact, is plainly acknowledged by the fanaticism
under which he has suffered, which ever rages with more and more violence,
in proportion to the merit and importance of the object of its fury. His
sufferings, therefore, are in the highest degree honourable to him. That
they are consolatory, however great they may be, and pleasing to him, as a
strenuous lover of truth, you yourselves, Gentlemen, roust be convinced of,
by his triumphant assertion, which you have noticed in your letter, ' That
the authors of the criminal violence against him had done more in four days
for the progress of reason, of toleration, and of philosophy, than all the
writings of the wisest men had been able to effect in two centuries.'
  " And yet, Gentlemen, we must confess to you that it is shameful that
such atrocious acts should have been committed by any people under any
denomination of Christians at the end of the eighteenth century. That they
should be perpetrated and countenanced in England, which boasts of its
freedom, its knowledge, and its humanity, is abominable. In short, as no
excuse can be attempted for the palliation of the iniquity of the scene
exhibited at Birmingham on the 14th of last July, let us turn our eyes with
horror from it, and conclude, for our encouragement to persevere in what
is right, in the words which philosophy dictated to the glorious sufferer in its

      Dear and respected Sir,
   Permit us to indulge our feelings in again addressing you.
   When assurances of gratitude and attachment are not neces
sary, there is a gratification in expressing the prevailing senti
ments of the heart ; and when you, Sir, are the object, we feel
no common ardour. We have too much confidence in your
goodness, and have had too many proofs of your affectionate
regard to our happiness, to imagine you will think us trouble
some.
   We have received your affectionate and animating letter.
Our tears spoke our feelings. We cannot express them. Lan
guage is feeble and inadequate. But we will bind your in
structions to our hearts. While we remember whose pupils
we have been, we cannot act unworthily. We can never
sufficiently express our sense of the obligation you have con
ferred upon us, but we dwell upon the subject with too much
pleasure to omit any opportunity of renewing it. To you, Sir,
we are indebted for the desire of improvement. You have
given us habits of employing our leisure hours in the cultiva
tion of our understandings, in pursuits that afford delight and
advantage, and which are calculated to raise us higher in the
scale of being. The love of virtue you have implanted in us
by precept and example. We will guard and cherish it; and
while we enjoy the fruits of it, our souls exulting shall bless
you. You have deprived adversity of its sting, and have
enabled us to extend our views with satisfaction beyond the
world, by impressing our minds with the strongest evidence of

                   · Correspondence of the Revolution Society.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  147

the great truths of Christianity. These advantages, Sir, we
have received from you. We feel their importance, and will
diffuse them as far as our influence extends. It shall be our
grand object to endeavour to follow your example in a firm
adherence to what we believe to be the cause of truth, in pre
serving our minds open to conviction, and in the cultivation of
fortitude, patience, and charity. We have, indeed, no slight
trial of the latter, when we behold the enlightened and bene
volent friend of all mankind, whose life has invariably exhi
bited, and whose instructions have ever enforced, the practice
of every mild and gentle virtue, treated with a cruelty which
would disgrace a barbarous age. But we will remember our
principles, the principles, Sir, we have imbibed from you, and
will say, in the language of philosophy and Christianity,
Deluded men, we pity you. May your hearts be turned, and
your errors forgiven!

   Your sufferings, Sir, have been great, but we have much
consolation in knowing that your mind is still greater. The
man who can review a life like yours, and say, It has been
mine, possesses the noblest sources of joy. You have formed
to yourself a sanctuary which no storm can reach. The
venomed dart must rebound and wound the breast which
aimed it. While the vices of mankind present a melancholy
picture to your view, and call forth emotions of sorrow, in a
heart benevolent as yours, you will remember how many have
been made virtuous and happy by your means, and that no
lawless power can destroy the works you have given to the
world, or prevent their operation in promoting the best inter
ests of man.

   The violence of a mob, or those who chose to act by such
instruments, can only give additional lustre to a character
known, admired, and revered, by the wise and liberal in every
part of the civilized world. But' eminent talents and distin
guished virtue seldom fail to excite, in narrow and interested
minds, the despicable passions of envy and fear; and the igno
rance of mankind affords, alas! an ample field for them to
work upon. The page of history which the recent event is
destined to fill, will exhibit a strong contrast in human nature.

Posterity will pause with astonishment when they find that
the same age which witnessed your generous exertions in the
cause of truth and of mankind, produced such savage ferocity.
Happy would it be for many if the cloud which will hang
over their memories were the dark veil of oblivion. But the
brightness of your character will render the deformity of theirs
conspicuous.

   Your proposal that the classes should continue to meet has
given us much satisfaction. We shall all rejoice in any occa
sion of giving or receiving instruction. We hold the advan
tages we have received too dear to neglect any opportunity of
extending and improving them. We have this day met to
consider of the best means of carrying it into execution. The
different circumstances under which we now assemble, cannot
fail to impress our minds in a very powerful manner ; but we
trust they are impressions which will have a favourable influ
ence on our future lives. We have requested Mr. Blythe to
supply your place in the senior class till your return; and
when he is desirous of it, we shall willingly relieve him from
the fatigue of reading. Mr. Hawkes we have requested to
give us his presence in the noon class, and to take only so
much business of it upon him as is agreeable to himself; since
many of us will gladly give him any assistance in our power.
They have, in the most affectionate manner, complied with our
wishes, and next Sunday the three classes re-commence in
their usual form, every thing previous to their meeting being
settled.

   We have had a very full meeting, and many who were
obliged to be absent have requested to put their names to this
address, as a testimony of their gratitude for your kind letter.
But we hope, Sir, the time will soon arrive when you may
again appear among us in the same venerable and endearing
character in which we have so often beheld you. To be
separated from you is an evil we are ill-disposed to bear. We
will hope this trial is not in reserve for us. Should infatuation,
however, extend so far, our enemies shall find that they can
never separate you from our hearts, that our gratitude and
attachment has a basis too strong for them ever to shake, and

posing my Appeal. It is about the size of' my Letters to Mr.

Burke, and, I think, finished, except the fair transcript for

the press. I have thought it right to speak with great free

At the same time, I wish to be on my guard not to pass the

bounds of decency and propriety ; and in this your cooler and

better knowledge of the world, would be of the greatest use to

me. However, I shall not print any part of it till you have

seen it. Mr. Russell, and my friends in general, wish that I

would not defer the publication unnecessarily, and therefore I

shall be ready.

Not to offend the clergy and the court is impossible, and

therefore that is no object with me. Whatever justifies us

will, of course, condemn, and therefore irritate them. It is

not doubted by anybody that I converse with, that the mea

intimidate and quiet us, by shewing us our absolute depend-

ance upon them. Mr. Russell owns he never had less satisfac

in Birmingham and the neighbourhood,* and that the foot
soldiers would not act against the rioters, though he thinks the
horse would. He wishes the ministry would withdraw all the

evening at the Union Tavern, and at the sign of the Church, in Church

The streets were very turbulent during the whole night, and the dreadful
huzza, so alarming in the late troubles, again assailed the ears of the peace

 as Heaven has been pleased to give on an average to Esquimaux, than a Dis
 senter, with the understanding of a Priestley or a Locke. Since the riots, in

 greater. I have been informed by the faculty, that his experimental discove

    '' A clergyman attended this outrage, and was charged with examining,

We cannot avoid expressing the interest we feel in your late

sufferings from a deluded populace.

However some of us may differ from you in several doctrinal

opinions, we are well convinced of the integrity of your charac

in the cause of religious and civil liberty. In this cause we

respect you as a confessor; and admire the magnanimity

and meekness, equally honourable to the man and the Chris

The approbation of your own mind, the esteem of the friends

of freedom, and the persuasion that your personal misfortunes,

under the direction of a wise and benevolent Providence, will

finally prove conducive to public good, will, we doubt not,

still continue to afford you support, and enable you to rejoice,

even in tribulation.

Sincerely wishing you every blessing which Heaven can

     From the Philosophical Society at Derby.

      Sir, Sept. 3, 1791.
   We condole with yourself, and with the scientific world,
on the loss of your valuable library, your experimental appa
ratus, and your more valuable manuscripts ; at the same time we
beg leave to congratulate you on your personal safety, in hav
ing escaped the sacrilegious hands of the savages at Bir
mingham.
   Almost all great minds, in all ages of the world, who have
endeavoured to benefit mankind, have been persecuted by
them. Galileo, for his philosophical discoveries, was impri
soned by the inquisition ; and Socrates found a cup of hem
lock his reward for teaching there is one God. Your enemies,
unable to conquer your arguments by reason, have had recourse
to violence. They have hallooed upon you the dogs of un
feeling ignorance and of frantic fanaticism. They have kin
dled fires like those of the inquisition, not to illuminate the
truth, but, like the dark lanthorn of the assassin, to light the
murderer to his prey. Your philosophical friends, therefore,
hope that you will not again risk your person amongst a people
whose bigotry renders them incapable of instruction. They
 hope you will leave the unfruitful fields of polemical theology,
 and cultivate that philosophy of which you may be called the
 father, and which, by inducing the world to think and reason,
 will silently marshal mankind against delusion, and, with
 greater certainty, overturn the empire of superstition.

    In spite of the persecution you have sustained, we trust that
 you will persevere in the exertions of virtue, and the improve
 ments of science. Your fame, already conspicuous to every
 civilized nation of the world, shall rise, like a phoenix, from
 the flames of your elaboratory with renovated vigour, and
 shine with brighter corruscation.*

From the New Meeting Congregation.

Rev. and dear Sir,      Birmingham, Sept. 5, 1791.

The affectionate terms in which you accept our letter of

condolence, and the assurance you give us that it afforded you

consolation and joy, have caused us a lively satisfaction.

Your desire to concur with us in our endeavours to re

establish the affairs of the congregation, has awakened our

anxiety for the season when we may urge your return to Bir

mingham; and although that period has been thus long pro

tracted, yet we think it our duty to remind you that we exer

cise a cheerful reliance upon your kind declaration that you

only wait our summons.

The sincere affection we bear you, and the conviction we

possess of the value and importance of your life to the cause of

truth, and the world at large, will not permit us to consent

that you shall be exposed to any unnecessary hazard on your

return hither, before the time of tranquillity and safety. Pre

vented by these motives, and these alone, from requesting, in

the most affectionate terms, that you would resume in person

your pastoral charge, we assure ourselves that the interval they

occasion will not be permitted to operate in any sense to our

disadvantage.

Our endeavours to procure a suitable place to assemble in

for public worship, until our own is rebuilt, though not alto

gether so successful as we could wish, will not be discontinued

till the object is fully attained ; in the mean time, we have the

pleasure of assembling in Carr's Lane each Lord's-day, with

our brethren and fellow-sufferers of the Old Meeting congre

gation ; and we learn with unspeakable satisfaction, that the

junior part of our society, profiting by your advice and corre

spondence, are already assembled in regular classes, and are

conforming to your wishes in endeavouring to continue the

important business of religious instruction among themselves,

agreeable to the plan you established, so that your labours are

still flourishing among us, even in our present state of disper

sion and persecution; and we hope and trust it will not now

be long ere your own judgment, and that of your friends, will
concur in affording us a renewal of those personal exertions by
which we have heretofore been so much edified, and from the
continuance of which we promise ourselves so much future
advantage.

   We rejoice in the continuance of your health, and in the
frequent accounts we receive of your uninterrupted cheerful
ness, and offer our fervent prayers to the Almighty that your
eminent abilities may long be spared, and your health and
cheerfulness be prolonged with them. With sentiments of
the sincerest respect, we remain with unalterable attachment,
Rev. and dear Sir, your much obliged and very affectionate
friends and servants.*

Rev. Sir,                             Exeter, Sept. 7, 1791.

Being assembled to transact the usual business of our half-

yearly meetings, we think ourselves bound, though several of

us differ from you in opinion on various subjects, to seize the

opportunity which this circumstance affords us, of uniting in

an address to you on the occasion of your late sufferings and

losses.

We sincerely lament the destruction of your most valuable

property, and reflect with sympathetic concern on the scenes

of danger, anxiety, and distress, in which you must have been

involved ; at the same time we are highly thankful to God

that your important life is preserved. From the fruits of your

indefatigable labours, which have rendered your name so justly

famous through the learned world, we conceive no small ho

nour to be derived to the body to which you belong, and of

which on that account, as well as many others, we have reason

to glory that we also constitute a part. May a kind Provi

dence continue to protect you, and to afford you means and

opportunities of resuming your interrupted pursuits with un

disturbed tranquillity and comfort !

  While it grieves us to observe that any of the inhabitants of
this country should discover even the smallest symptom of a
persecuting temper in these enlightened days, and that a per
son of your very distinguished eminence and worth should
become the marked object of popular violence, we heartily
congratulate you on being able, in so trying circumstances, to
display to the view of the public the exercise of the most
difficult and magnanimous virtues. By this conduct you de
monstrate the power of faith and a good conscience to support
the righteous under the calamities of life, and the efficacy of
Christian principles when made subjects of habitual meditation,
and fixed in the heart, to suppress all desire of revenge. We
thank you for holding up to the attention of mankind a pattern
so deserving of universal imitation, and so well adapted both to
disarm the resentment of your enemies, and to impress every
reflecting and candid mind with a conviction that neither you
nor your brethren, though advocates with you for civil and
religious liberty, entertain a single wish unfriendly to the
safety, peace, or enjoyment, of any one human being.

   It affords us great pleasure to hear that you have already re
ceived* a letter of condolence from some of our brethren of
different religious sentiments and denominations, couched in
terms expressive of warm affection and esteem. We would
flatter ourselves that this noble example of a truly liberal
spirit and behaviour will be followed by many others, and
that one beneficial consequence of the late riots at Bir
mingham will be the establishment of a closer union, and of a
more general and friendly intercourse, among Dissenters of
every description.

   Requesting you to assure your fellow-sufferers that they par
take with yourself in our cordial commiseration and most be
nevolent wishes, we remain with great respect, Rev. Sir, your
affectionate fellow-labourers in the cause of our common
Lord.f

156 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

To thk Members of the Ppilosophical Society at

Gentlemen,                  Derby.
                                         London, Sept. 21, 1791.

I feel myself greatly encouraged in my present sufferings,

fjcom the effects of bigotry, by the sympathy expressed by you,

and by other liberal friends of science here and abroad.

It will be a new thing in the world if any thing truly va

luable lose credit, or have a less rapid spread, in consequence

of persecution. If any thing will bear to be viewed and exa

mined, it must derive advantage from whatever draws atten

tion to it; and such, I am confident, is the cause in which 1

suffer.

In consequence of this, far from being discouraged, I feel

myself more animated than ever; and I am at this very time

setting about the re-establishment of my philosophical appa

ratus, and resuming all my former pursuits.

Excuse me, however, if I still join theological to philoso

phical studies ; and if I consider the former as greatly superior

in importance to mankind to the latter. But as these different

pursuits have never yet interfered with, but promoted each

other, be persuaded that this will continue to be the case.*

From the Students, New College, Hackney.

Rev. Sir,                   Hackney College, Sept. 20, 1791.

When various societies are expressing their sense of your

great merit, and sorrow for your late sufferings, we hope that,

without any violation of modesty, we too may appear among

the number ; and, young as we are, yet dearly loving truth

and liberty, avow our warm attachment to their distinguished,

their persecuted advocate.

The loss which the world of science and of letters must sus

tain in the destruction of your MSS., and interruption of your

studies, we deeply feel and deeply lament ; for how can we

be lovers of our brethren, or even of our ownselves, without

deploring every hindrance of labours, excited by no sordid

views, but intended to enlighten and improve mankind ? We
presume not to appreciate these labours. Whatever be their
value, they are sanctified by their object ; and our indignation
must be roused when any daring hand violates the retirement
of a person thus employed.

   Yet we are sure that your studies, though for a while inter
rupted, will be soon resumed. We are confident that your
future publications will display the same manly spirit, will
contain the same open avowal of what you deem important
truth, which has ever characterized your productions ; for you
sought not the applause of the multitude : you cannot, then,
be disappointed at finding them ignorant of your value; and
is not the hatred of all the hireling advocates of corruption a
proof that your labours have been successful ? Why should
they wish to extinguish the light, if it did not exhibit their
own deformity ? Your friends have long acknowledged the
justice of your reasonings, but their judgments might be par
tial. This testimony of your enemies, however disagreeably
expressed, is liable to no exception. They would not hate you
if they did not fear you.

   Another circumstance, which must have alleviated your
sufferings, is the steady attachment which so many of your
friends have displayed. Not a few have publicly expressed
it ; and doubtless there are many others who, formerly content
with admiring your writings, will now extend their admiration
to your character; and, powerful as those arguments maybe
by which certain of your philosophical opinions are supported,
will acknowledge that their practical influence, displayed in
your conduct, affords an argument still more forcible.

   You have, Sir, one farther consolation. Though lawless
violence may destroy your writings ; may destroy yourself, it
cannot extinguish that spirit of inquiry; it cannot eradicate
those generous sentiments which you and the other enlight-
eners of Europe have excited. We trust that multitudes
have; that multitudes will imbibe them. We trust that our
love of truth and liberty flows not from the wild and irregular
enthusiasm of youth, but is the effect of conviction and prin
ciple. Our bosoms glow with the idea of one day pursuing,

with however unequal steps, the course which you have
pointed out ; of entering, even in the lowest capacity, that glo
rious phalanx, which, in contending for the rights, contends
for the happiness of man. We earnestly hope that neither the
blandishments of pleasure, nor the frowns of power, will be
able to retard our progress. We earnestly pray that nothing
this world can offer, may draw us from the path of duty ; for
that path, we are convinced, leads to heaven.*

. To the Students at the New College, Hackney.

Gentlemen,  London, Sept. 22, 1791.

Your Address, as that of young men of sufficient age to

think with justness, as well as to feel with ardour, gives me

peculiar pleasure, as it holds out a certain prospect that the

cause of truth and liberty will not want supporters, when all

those of my age shall have finished their course.

You see, in the riots at Birmingham, how naturally a failure

in argument leads to violence, and also how certainly that vio

lence defeats its own end. A hierarchy, equally the bane of

Christianity and of rational liberty, now confesses its weakness ;

and be assured that you will see either its complete reforma

tion, or its fall. Be it your ambition, my young friends, to join

the small but noble band of those who by action, or, what is

more honourable, as well as more effectual, by suffering, main

tain the rights of all men, civil and religious. Whether you

be destined for speculative or active life, you will not want

opportunities of distinguishing yourselves in this glorious cause;

and of youth we generally expect a generous ardour in favour

of whatever is true and right, independent of private interest,

or of that of any particular portion of the human race.

As good citizens, study the welfare of your country ; but

look beyond that to those great principles which will ensure

the happiness of all Europe and of all mankind. Such prin

ciples as these now excite general attention ; and your tutors

will give you every assistance that you can want in the discus-

sion of them. Shew, then, by your superior intelligence and
activity, the superiority of your advantages over those of other
institutions, which, instead of expanding the mind, by en
couraging freedom of inquiry, effectually fetter its powers by
a sworn attachment to a particular system, formed in an age of
universal and acknowledged barbarism. W here the sons of those
institutions are diffusing their darkness, do you bring your
light ; assured that the same grand luminary which has arisen
on America, France, and Poland, and which has taught them
all universal toleration in matters of religion, will illuminate
the whole world ; and that, in consequence of it, all mankind
will be free, peaceable, and happy.

  Give me leave to close this Address with reminding you
how much the credit of the College depends upon the diligence
and good behaviour of you who are students in it, and of the
connexion which the good of your country and of the world
has with the credit of that institution.

   With sincere affection, and every good wish, I am, Gentle
men, your very humble servant.*

         From the New Meeting Conohegation.

     Dear and Rev. Sir, Birmingham, Sept. 22, 1791.
  We, the subscribers and members of the New Meeting So
ciety, being assembled together for the purpose of conferring
upon the rumour of an unexpected impediment in the way of
your return to us, desire to assure you of the deep and poig
nant concern these rumours give us. The bare apprehension
of your leaving us is deeply affecting to us all. Sudden and
violent as was the first onset of the persecution and troubles
with which you and ourselves were lately assailed, we saw it
necessary that you should retire for a season ; and we not only
acquiesced in your retirement, but rejoiced in your enjoying
that safety at a distance which a deluded populace appeared to
deny you here ; but the thought of these violences operating to
the final dissolution of our happy connexion, as pastor and

people, is really more distressing to us than all our other suffer
ings and calamities, multiplied and severe as they are; and we
cannot but sincerely and earnestly deprecate such an event.

   Indeed, Sir, we can truly assure you that there is no plea to
be urged, there is no assurance to be given, there is no induce
ment to be offered, by a people whose hearts are full of vene
ration, respect, and gratitude, which we cannot, which we do
not, now urge and offer to you as the genuine dictate of the
most ardent, sincere, and fervent affection. We cannot de
scribe how much our feelings are interested ; we cannot tell
you how earnest, how sincere, and how fervent our desires are
for your return, and how much our best affections are moved
upon this truly important and interesting occasion ; but we
know we may safely rely upon your own feelings to do us
justice ; we know you will feel for us, and also for those who
are the dearest to us, when we entreat you to recollect your in
valuable usefulness among them, and the happy fruits which
have been already seen to result from your exemplary assi
duities and labours there. But we will forbear ; for although
we would be serious and earnest, we would not be importunate.

    We shall, therefore, urge you no farther. We know your
candour, we trust your goodness, and would rely upon your
well-known serious and pious mind for the acceptance of this
our sincere and well-meant application. Persuaded you will
not deem it an intrusion, we offer no apology. On the con
trary, knowing and feeling ourselves that it is the dictate of a
pure affection and ardent attachment, we doubt not but you
will receive it as such, and that as it is the genuine result of
our zeal and sincerity in the most important of all concerns,
it will operate with you accordingly.

    Hoping that you may speedily return among us, resume your
pen with renewed vigour, and your labours with increasing
success, we remain, with the sincerest affection, respect, and
attachment, Rev. and ever dear Sir, your friends and fellow-
christians.*

Dear Sir,                      Wycombe, Sept. 29, 1 79 1 .

I go to London to-morrow, and shall immediately apply to

Mr. Bell, and get from him what assistance I can in drawing

out the account of my losses.

I have desired Mr. Thompson to get me copies of the two

Addresses to the King, and the first letter of the congregation

to me. I shall be obliged to you if you will assist him in it.

I shall soon write to the congregation, but I was unwilling to

send a final answer till I was fully determined in my own

mind, which I can hardly say I am yet. If you had a place

where 1 could preach, I would yet see you settled before I

finally quitted Birmingham ; but, in your present circumstan

ces, my coming would answer no end. I wish it was possible

to keep up something like a connexion with Birmingham,

though I should be at Hackney, by visiting you occasionally ;

but that cannot well be. I do not like the idea of being driven

off, or abandoning a charge in which I was so happ}'. But, all

things considered, I think more good will arise from my suc

ceeding Dr. Price, if that should take place, than from any

other scheme.

Dear Sir,                      London, Oct. 3, 1791.

I send you two Addresses, transmitted to me by Mr. Toul-

min. Another from the same persons came to myself. Though

my spirits do not sink in consequence of any thing I have

suffered, and I do not repent of any thing that I have done that

may have been the occasion of it, I cannot help feeling, and

sometimes very painfully, both for the congregation in general,

and some individuals in it, especially yourself and family ; for,

go where I will, I "shall never find such a friend as you have

constantly been to me, nor indeed do I ever expect to find a

man so worthy of my esteem. Whatever I did at Birmingham

   * The friend to whom I was indebted (supra, p. ill, note ||) and who
'* was an indignant witness of the destruction of Dr. Priestley's library,
manuscripts, and apparatus," has taken occasion thus to recollect him as a
Christian instructor :

   " Though differing in religious opinions, I was in the habit of associating
with those who regularly attended the instructions of Dr. Priestley ; and had
I formed my notions of him, or estimated his character, from the represen
tations which I often heard from the pulpit in the church, I must indeed have
deemed him ' the demon of heresy ;' but happily I had been accustomed to
exercise my own faculties in the pursuit of truth Much as I had heard and
read about Dr. Priestley, I did not know his person till the year 1788, when
curiosity induced me to accompany a friend to hear a lecture which he de
livered on a Sunday afternoon. [See I. 353.] Amongst various other
designations, we had been told that he was ' a deluded visionary,' and ' a
proud and haughty scorner ;' but we discovered such a delineation to be
unjust, having no resemblance to reality.

   " When we entered the place, we found a man of about the middle stature,
slenderly made, remarkably placid, modest, aud courteous, pouringVout,
with the simplicity of a child, the great stores of his most capacious mind to
a considerable number of young persons of both sexes, whom, with the
familiarity and kindness of a friend, he encouraged to ask him questions,
either during the lecture or after it, if he advanced any thing which wanted
explanation, or struck them in a light different from his own. The impres
sion made upon us was so strong, that we never failed afterwards to attend
on such occasions in order to profit by bis lessons, and we frequently went
to hear him preach, until he was driven from the town in 1791.

   " His lectures were peculiarly instructive, and the general tenour of his
sermons was practical, urging to the cultivation of universal benevolence,
the earnest pursuit of knowledge, and the most unrestrained free inquiry
upon all important subjects. He was the most unassuming, candid man I
ever knew ; and never did I hear from his lips, either in lecture or sermon,
 one illiberal sentiment, or one harsh expression concerning any persons who
 differed from him, not even of the individuals who were so much in the prac
 tice of abusing him and traducing his character."

 ameliorate the Intellectual and Moral Condition of the Working Classes at
 Birmingham. By William Matthews," (1830,) p. 11, note. In a letter

count of my classes, and for this purpose shall be obliged to
Miss Russells to furnish me, if they can, with a second copy
of the subjects of their exercises.

   How I shall be disposed of here I cannot tell. There are, I
hear, many orthodox females at Hackney, who will not approve
of my being invited to succeed Dr. Price, and in that case I
believe a Unitarian chapel will be built for me, and this I shall
like as well.

   Perhaps you may have heard that I preached last Sunday,
for the first time, to a congregation of Calvinistic Baptists at
Araerehara, near Missenden, who unanimously requested it,*
and the Sunday following I was invited to preach at two other
similar places, one an Independent congregation at Beacons-
field, near Mr. Burke's; but I was obliged to be in London.
This could not have taken place before the riots, so that some
good has been done by them.

   I am glad that you do not disapprove of my not returning
to Birmingham. Indeed, the more I think of it, the more I am
satisfied that I shall be better placed here, though you know
it is a thing that I was far from wishing. As you do not think
it necessary, I shall defer my answer to the congregation some
time longer.

that I am more than consoled for my sufferings by their ge
nerous sympathy, and that of my other friends in all parts of
England, and especially those which I receive from persons
of a persuasion different from my own.

   The present is the triumph of bigotry ; but it cannot be
lasting, though favoured, as it evidently is, by the court. At
Birmingham the spirit of party is, I fear, as high as ever,
which would make my return not only hazardous, but pro
bably hurtful on the whole. The people will sooner come to
their right mind in my absence from them. I have therefore
taken a house at Hackney,* though without any certain pros

Dr. Price's late congregation ; but many of the elderly people,

the means of bringing them into trouble.f

To the New Meeting Congregation.

My dear Friends,      London, Oct. 8,1791.

I never felt myself in a more painful situation than the

present, in consequence of sitting down to answer your two

most affectionate Addresses, inviting me to return to the exer

cise of my ministry among you, after having been driven away

by lawless violence.

Not only on my leaving Birmingham, but some time after

my arrival in London, I had no idea but that of a temporary

retreat, thinking that the violence of party spirit, having had

its triumph, would be satisfied, and that perhaps, repentance

succeeding, I might resume my functions with more advantage

than before ; but every account that I have received having re

presented the spirit of party as more inveterate than I had ima

gined it to be, so that in all probability my return would only

inflame it, and, in consequence of this, my situation, if safe,
would be uncomfortable, and perhaps hurtful, it is my deli
berate opinion that it will be better for some other person less
obnoxious to popular prejudice to take my place, and that I
may be more usefully fixed in London, or its neighbourhood.

   I hope I need not assure you that it is with the greatest
regret that I at length, after much hesitation, have come to
this resolution, in forming which, considerations of a more
private nature, but to which no man is or ought to be wholly
insensible, have likewise had their influence.

   Never, I believe, was any Christian minister more happy in
his situation than I have been with you. My sentiments con
cerning you are not only those of respect and affection, but of
pride. It has been my boast that no congregation that I have
been acquainted with was so candid, so well-informed, and so
ready to adopt whatever their ministers recommended to them
for their edification, and that, in consequence of it, your re
gulations were the best adapted to form intelligent and serious
Christians. Our example was looked up to by other and dis
tant congregations, who were excited to form themselves upon
our model. I had also perfect liberty, which few Dissenting
ministers have, to follow all my favourite pursuits of every
kind, and to preach and write, without the least hazard of
giving offence, whatever I thought proper. I had, therefore,
no other wish than to live and die among you.

   But as I hope the good that has been done will never be un
done, owing especially to the almost unprecedented zeal and
excellent spirit of the young people among you, whose Ad
dresses will for ever endear them to me, and whose example,
wherever it is known, must contribute to instruct and warm
others, I have the less regret in now signifying my intention of
resigning my pastoral charge, but not till I have seen your
affairs in some measure re-established, and some prospect of
your being able to do as well without me ; and as some time
must be fixed, I mention Christmas next.

   As soon, then,' as you shall have provided a place in which
I can officiate, L shall with peculiar pleasure resume my func
tions among you, and continue them till the time above-men

tioned ; and if it please God that I should die in your service,
I shall not (seeing no apparent cause of apprehension, such as
would justify my flight from my proper station) think it will
close unseasonably with respect to myself or the world.

   I am, my friends and fellow-christians, your affectionate
pastor.*

From Dissenters of Bristol and Bath.

Rev. Sir,     Bristol, Oct. 10, 1791.

We, the undersigned Protestant Dissenters of the cities of

Bristol and Bath, being deeply affected by the calamities which

have lately befallen you and our brethren in Birmingham, beg

leave to express to you the sentiments we feel on the occasion.

Differing as we do in opinion on various points of specula

tion, we unite in lamenting that a spirit of bigotry, which

would have been a disgrace to the darkest ages of Christianity,

should have discovered itself in this country at the close of

the eighteenth century, and particularly that its fury should

have been principally directed against a person whom we pre

sume every other country on the globe would be proud to call

its citizen.

Sincerely sympathising with you on the losses you have

sustained, losses which we consider as of a public, and not

merely of a private nature, we feel some alleviation of our

anxiety in the reflection that your life and health are preserved,

and that the world, which has received so much improvement

from your writings, has now an opportunity of improving by

the example which you have exhibited of firmness and mag

nanimity in the most perilous circumstances.

We fervently hope that these outrages, so disgraceful to the

age and country in which we live, will prove the expiring

efforts of the spirit of persecution, and that they will finally

be productive of good, by exciting a general abhorrence of the

principles from which they proceed, by effecting a closer union

among Dissenters of different denominations, as engaged in one

common cause, and by diffusing a spirit of inquiry into the
nature and foundation, and an ardent zeal for the extension, of
religious and civil liberty.

   We request you to convey our sentiments of sympathy and
attachment to our brethren and your fellow-sufferers in Bir
mingham, and are, with cordial respect, Rev. Sir, your sincere
friends and Protestant Dissenting brethren.*

From tub New Meeting Congregation.

Rev. and dear Sir,     Birmingham, Oct. 24, 1791.

Your truly interesting letter of the 8th instant has deeply

affected us. We are grieved to an excess at the separation it

announces, and the apparent necessity of our acquiescing in it,

and in your own deliberate opinion that it will be more for

the general good to have some other person fill your place

here, and that you may be more usefully employed in London

or its neighbourhood.

It is with the most painful reluctance that we yield to this

truly humiliating conclusion, without importuning you with

our entreaties that you would reconsider it, and resume your

first purpose of speedily returning to us; but seeing it your

deliberate judgment, and knowing the circumstances which

surround us, we patiently resign our wills, and, urging you no

farther, most devoutly pray our heavenly Father that your

prospect of greater usefulness may be realized ; that many souls

may yet be added to your faithful ministry ; that your glorious

career of usefulness and benevolence may long be continued ;

and that your final removal from it to the realms of light may

be serene and happy.

You will permit us to add, that the apprehensions which

we have been recently informed some of our wisest and best

friends entertain for your safety, should you prosecute your

intended return to us, necessarily compel us to make a farther

sacrifice of our anxious desires to see you here. We are in-

deed truly sorry to abandon the prospect of your promised
return, though it is but for a few weeks; but we should be
wanting in affection towards yourself, and in respect to the
general good of mankind, were we not to attend to these ap
prehensions. Indeed, Sir, we speak very sincerely, when we
declare that we bear you too sincere and fervent an affection ;
that we have too great a value for your peace and safety ; are
far too anxious for your preservation from insult, to consent
that you should upon the present occasion expose your person
to the hazard of it.

   Give us leave, then, with hearts full of respect and affection,
to entreat you to forego for the present your purpose of visit
ing us as our pastor; and let us repeat the assurance conveyed
by our first letter, that when the season of perfect tranquillity
and safety approaches, we shall most cordially hail your re
turn to us for any period your other important connexions and
engagements may admit. In the mean time, anxious to main
tain an intercourse with you, and desirous of your aid and
concurrence in our choice of a suitable person to assist your
worthy coadjutor, the Rev. W. Blythe, we request that if you
know of any gentleman whom you think suitable for us, and
whom you have reason to expect would wish for such an es
tablishment, you will favour us with your nomination of him.

   We are, with the liveliest sentiments of gratitude, respect
and affection, dear and Rev. Sir, your truly affectionate friends
and fellow-christians.*

           To Rev. J. Bketland.f

Dear Sir,                      London, Oct. 27, 1791.

I wrote to you before, on the receipt of the Address from

the ministers of your district.^ As their meeting is half-

yearly, I did not think they would expect a formal answer.

1 beg therefore you would give my respects to them indivi

dually, and assure them that I feel myself much encouraged

by the sense they express of my sufferings, and those of my

friends at Birmingham, and especially that, notwithstanding a

considerable difference in sentiment, they are sensible that, as
Dissenters, we have a common cause, and have an equal claim
for protection, while we behave as good subjects.

  The congregation at Hackney have not yet agreed to invite
me, about one-third opposing it, chiefly from apprehension of
tumults, and wishing to stand well with their friends in the
establishment. I imagine, however, that this difficulty will
be overcome, and that I shall receive the invitation after the
next Sunday.

  I have ordered a copy of my Letters to the Swedenborgians
to be sent to you, and hope you have received it. My " Appeal
to the Public on the subject of the Riots in Birmingham" is
nearly printed, but will not be published till about the meeting
of Parliament.

  I proposed, in answer to the last Address from the congre
gation, to go and preach to them till Christmas, but this they
declined for fear of tumults.

  P. S. Give my respectful compliments to Mr. Tremlett,
with thanks for his Bible and letter. I have lately received
fourteen out of sixty-four leaves of my translation. Though
torn and trampled upon, they will be useful to me.

  My best respects to your good father.*

          To the New Meeting Congregation.

     My Christian Friends, London, Oct. 28, 1791.
  It adds not a little to my affliction, occasioned by my vio
lent expulsion from a congregation to which 1 have so much
reason to be attached, to be deprived of the satisfaction I pro
mised myself from my proposed visit to you, and doing what
might be in my power towards your future settlement ; but
I am more concerned on account of the reason you assign for
it, as it argues a continuance of that malignant, persecuting
spirit which has been the cause of all our sufferings. What
must be the government of a country, nominally Christian, in
which such outrages against all law and good order cannot be

restrained, and in which a man cannot be encouraged by his
best friends to come to the discharge of the duties of a peace
ful profession without the apprehension of being insulted, if
not murdered !

   Do not, however, think that any thing strange or new has
happened to us. The enemies of the primitive Christians fre
quently let loose a licentious populace upon them, when they
did not think proper to proceed against them by law ; and for
this purpose they raised such calumnies against them as made
them be considered as the very pests of society. 1 trust you
are so well grounded in the principles of your religion as not
to be discouraged at this, or any thing else that has befallen us.
Though the enemy has burned our places of public worship,
and lighted the fires, as I have been informed, with our Bibles,
they cannot destroy the great truths contained in them, or de
prive us of the benefit of our Saviour's declaration, " Blessed
are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall
say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for my sake."

   Be assured that from the interest I take in your welfare, I
shall not fail to mention to you any person that I may hear of
who shall appear to me proper to succeed me.

   Hoping that you will soon be provided with such a person,
and that in consequence of being built up in our holy faith we
shall have a happy meeting in a better world, for which all
the discipline and trials of this life are excellently fitted to form
us, I am, my friends and fellow-christians, yours affectionately.*

Rev. Sir,                         Hackney, Nov. 7, 1791.

We, the Committee of the congregation of Protestant Dis

senters assembling at the Gravel-pit Meeting, Hackney, have

been deputed by a general meeting to invite you to accept the

office of co-pastor to that society, on the vacancy occasioned

by the death of your valued friend, and our highly-esteemed

pastor, the late Rev. Dr. Price.

  We feel a peculiar satisfaction in conveying these sentiments
to one who, whilst he has so ably distinguished himself as the
firm asserter of civil and religious freedom, has discharged the
important duties of a pastor with so eminent a degree of zeal
and usefulness.

  We earnestly hope you will accept this invitation, and that
the connexion between us may long continue, and prove a
source of happiness to yourself, and improvement to the
society.

  That the Divine blessing and favour may crown all your
labours among us, and mankind at large, is the ardent prayer
of, Rev. Sir, your most obedient and humble servants.*

To the Committee of the Gravel-pit Congregation.

     My Christian Friends,
  After having been driven by violence, highly disgraceful
to the Government under which we live, from a situation on
every account most pleasing to me, and my connexion with
one of the most flourishing and respectable congregations in
the country being thereby broken, I think myself happy and
honoured by an invitation to succeed my most valued friend,
and your late excellent pastor, the Rev. Dr. Price.
  My only wish is, to have it in my power to exert myself
most effectually in what appears to me the most proper and
most important duties of the pastoral office, especially in the
particular attention that I wish to give to the younger part of
the congregation, according to the plan that I pursued at Leeds
and Birmingham.
  With my best wishes and prayers for our mutual edification,
I am, my Christian friends, your very humble servant,f

you in opinion, have, with a noble generosity, publicly declared
their esteem for your character and virtues, and sympathize
with you in the cause of truth, it would ill become us to be
silent, who agree with you in the chief of those sentiments
which have, though most undeservedly, rendered you obnox
ious to many.

   We lament that in the Established Church, to which some
of our number belong, blest with the labours and writings of
Locke, of Newton, of Hoadley, of Clarke, and of Law, who all
of them maintained the Divine Unity, and the sole, unrivalled
majesty and worship of the single person of the Father of the
universe, for which you have so boldly stood forth, there
should have been those in our day who have so far degene
rated from their fair example, and the precepts of the gospel,
as to copy the manners of the darkest ages of Christian barba
rism, in burning places of divine worship, and habitations of
peaceful men, of different religious sentiments from their own.
And, not content with destroying your house, your library, and
curious philosophical apparatus, together with the precious
fruits of many years' study, in various branches of science, a
loss to the whole world, have threatened to cut short the
thread of a life constantly devoted to the glory of the Creator,
and the benefit of mankind.

   With still deeper concern has it filled our minds to observe
many in the metropolis, and in different parts of the country,
from narrow prejudices and various unworthy motives, wholly
insensible of the enormity of this burning and destroying spirit,
for the sake of religion, if not rejoicing in it, when exerted
against Dissenters of a certain class, not considering its fatal
consequences, and how soon, if not completely quelled, the
same lawless spirit may be let loose upon themselves.

   It is our ardent prayer, illustrious sufferer, that you may be
supported, as hitherto, through the hard conflict to which you
have been called; and may continue to exemplify the true
Christian spirit, by your magnanimity and pity for your deluded
adversaries, and by your habitual cheerfulness, which is the
natural attendant on integrity and benevolence.

   And our hope is, for our country's honour, that your parti

cular losses will be amply compensated, and that in no long
time all the wise and good throughout the nation will unite
their endeavours to remove the principal source of religious
animosities, by their earnest and unremitted exertions to obtain
from the legislature the equal and impartial protection of law
to every good citizen, of whatever mode of faith or religion.*

Dear Sir,                                       Nov. 11, 1791.

I cannot express what I felt in reading the excellent letter

from the congregation ; it breathes so excellent a spirit, and is

so judicious in all respects. I inclose my answer; and as it is

of consequence that all the congregations, in our peculiar cir

cumstances, be acquainted with them, and that the town in

general should be apprized of the temper we are in with respect

to them, I should think it advisable not to insert them in any

public papers, but to have some printed copies taken of them,

to be shewn where it may be proper. If you approve of this,

send me a proof. You need be in no hurry about this; but I

wish you would set about rebuilding the meeting-house im

mediately, so as to have it ready before winter.

We hope you have copies of all the affidavits you send

hither. I hope to inclose a copy or two of an excellent little

poem, sent me by a person of considerable consequence, but

whose name must not be mentioned, to get inserted in the

newspapers.

I expect addresses from other Dissenters, besides those of

Yarmouth.^ There, and in other places, the Dissenters are

arming to defend their houses, but not the meeting-houses,

which I think a proper distinction^ The ministers, I am told,

have heard of this, and are much alarmed.

I am busy in writing my Appeal to the Public You shall

see what I write, and the proper time for publishing will be

about a month hence.

manuscripts, otherwise I fear they will be destroyed. I hope

   Hearing by Mr. Galton that my wife is in much better health

better days than ever, thanks to your wonderful exertions.

To the Unitarian Society.

My Christian Friends,          Clapton, Dec. 7, 1791.

From your affectionate address I receive consolation of a

kind peculiarly grateful to me. It is that of brethren engaged

in the same cause. For it is sufficiently evident, that it is my

avowed opposition to the doctrine of the Trinity, (which, as

affecting the Object of worship, we think it our duty to enter

our protest against,) that has rendered me peculiarly obnoxious.

But this popular odium, and this degree of persecution, should

not, as you are well persuaded, give us any alarm ; as it is

neither new, nor without obvious uses. This situation seems

necessary, in order to draw a sufficient degree of attention to

.our principles, and without which we cannot expect to see the

complete prevalence of such great truths as those for which

we are contending. Neither Christianity itself, nor any im

portant reformation of it, was ever fully established without a

similar process.

Persecution without law, as in the riots in Birmingham, has

been as common as persecution according to the forms of it.

By this means, those who have some respect for the more

liberal principles of the age, may think to screen themselves

from the odium which has fallen on direct persecution for

conscience' sake. In this manner were the primitive Christians,

the Waldenses, the Albigenses, and the first reformers from

Popery frequently treated ; a licentious populace being insti-

                  · Orig. MS.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.                     175

gated by the most atrocious calumnies to fall upon them, and
to commit such unexpected ravages, as are more grievous than
the known penalty of any law.

   We need not be surprised that this persecuting spirit has
shewn itself in some members of the Church of England, not
withstanding the valuable labours of the great men you men
tion, whose principles, had they been duly attended to and
followed,* would have ensured universal toleration. For, with
men who give but little attention to the essentials of religion,
this spirit arises, of course, in every civil establishment of it,
Heathen, Catholic, or Protestant, since all persons possessed of
power will naturally have recourse to it, when they perceive
other methods of promoting their cause to fail. And all per
sons in power are not so far instructed by the light of the pre
sent age, or the experience of the past, as to see the miserable
policy of such measures. They are the first suggestion of cha
grin, though they are sure to end in disappointment.

   Let us, my brethren, in the most gloomy prospects, console
ourselves with the consideration, that every instance of perse
cution will render it more odious, and therefore accelerate its
final cessation; that ignorance is the proper cause of all wrong
conduct, and of this among the rest; that the time is coming
when all men, fully enlightened with respect to their relation
to each other, and to God, their common parent, will feel as
brethren, and be disposed to love and befriend each other, not
withstanding any difference of religious opinion or practice;
and, therefore, that what has happened at Birmingham should
make us more assiduous to diffuse that light which is sure
to be attended with such desirable consequences.

   With this cheerful prospect I subscribe myself, my Chris
tian friends, your brother in the faith and hope of the gospel.f

to the address you transmitted to me from the Dissenters in
Bristol and Bath.* As they are not a body that ever meet, I
did not think it necessary to write a formal answer to them. I
beg, however, that if you see any of them, you would inform
them that I was particularly glad to receive such an address,
especially as from persons whose opinions on subjects of theo
logy are different from mine. It shews that, notwithstanding
these differences, we are still more attentive to the great prin

think are of infinitely more importance than those with respect
to which we differ.

no doubt will be approved. As his province of lecturer in ex

power for the purpose. Harry will not be too young to
attend some lectures there, and I shall attend to the rest of
his education myself. I have directed him to acquaint us
by what coach he comes, and at what inn and what time we
are to expect him.

having been much depressed with the account I had received
of the probability of his being rejected. The charge of three
ministers, in addition to your other great expenses, must, no
doubt, be heavy ; but you have, I doubt not, considered the
uncommon urgency of the occasion, and that the eyes of the
country, and, in some measure, of all Europe, are upon you.
I feel more interested for your conduct and success than when
I was with you, and I now feel more proud of you than ever.
Never was money expended to better purpose than it is at this
time with you ; and when the history of the late transactions,
and of your conduct, goes down to posterity, it must be to
your immortal honour. Indeed, the importance of your con
duct appears but imperfectly at present.

   On this account I particularly wish that your spirits may
not sink, and that you would not be intimidated from doing
yourselves that justice which the laws of your country hold
out to you. Mr. Johnson, of Kenilworth, says, the court for
merly hated the Dissenters, but that if they do not prosecute
 the magistrates, they will despise them. This Mr. Galton tells
me. However, I would fain know by a spirited letter, such as
 no person can write better than yourself, whether the ministry
 will make any use of the affidavits you have sent them.

    After this you can take your own measures, and consider
 how far you may avail yourselves of the strength of opposition,
 which they are certainly ready to give us; and the critical
 state of Ireland will make the court less haughty in their
 behaviour to us. But if we shew no degree of spirit, these
 circumstances will avail us nothing. A public trial is desira
 ble, if for no other purpose, that the affidavits may be pub
 lished. Then the country at large will be the judges, and, in
 time, do us justice. All the Dissenters here that I converse
 with hold this language. Now is not the time to feel intimi

     Sir, Hatfield, Feb. 1792.
   We, the Committee of Protestant Dissenters of the county of
Essex, lately appointed in behalf of their civil interests, take
the first opportunity to assure you that we join our brethren,
the Dissenters of England, and the friends of justice and
humanity in general, to deplore those barbarous efforts of
party-spirit and licentious cruelty which have disgraced the
town of Birmingham, and will dishonour the annals of our
country, while the history of the eighteenth century shall be
remembered.
  We peculiarly regret that a citizen, whose life is devoted to
pursuits the most laudable and important, should suffer an in
terruption of his labours, distressing to an active mind, and so
detrimental to the interests of society. At the same time, we
cheerfully confide in the wise arrangements of a benevolent
Providence, which overrules the vices of men for the most
valuable purposes, and, to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge,
can employ even the desolating rage of bigotry and ignorance.
  You have felt, Sir, the superiority of Christian principles in
an hour of accumulated distress, and we hope your life may be
long preserved to triumph over the malice of your enemies
and to improve the world by your valuable writings ; for
though we differ from you on a variety of interesting ques
tions, yet we are united by the most ardent wishes to promote

the extension of civil and religious liberty, and to encourage
that freedom of inquiry which must eventually produce the
universal acknowledgment of truth, and the perfection of the

human character.*

                               To Ms. Rutt.

      Sir, Clapton, Feb. 17, 1792.
   I beg you would return my thanks, in the most respectful
manner, to the Committee of Protestant Dissenters in Essex,
for their very acceptable address to me. It is more particu
larly pleasing to me, as a proof that difference of sentiment on
subjects of considerable importance in religion, does not always
lessen a regard to the common principles of Christianity and
humanity; which, indeed, are of infinitely more value than all
those with respect to which we differ.
   With such sentiments as those contained in this address, all
Christians may consider one another as brethren, and feel a
common interest in all that befals them ; and this will gradu
ally tend to lessen party-spirit in this world, and fit us for
meeting in a better.f

   This address I communicated to Dr. Priestley, having been appointed a
delegate from the Dissenters in Essex, to promote with others from the
different counties, and in concert with the Committee of the Deputies in
London, the repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts.
  At the first meeting of this Association, Feb. 1, 1792, an address to Dr.
Priestley was proposed, besides one to the other sufferers in the Birmingham
riots. This address I had the honour of advocating, (see M. R. XVII. 229,)
though, to secure unanimity, by conciliating a few well-meaning alarmists, it
was at length resolved to present only one address, in which Dr. Priestley
was mentioned in terms of the highest respect. See Appendix to the Appeal;
W. XIX. 439, 568.
   I recollect, with no small satisfaction, that on this occasion commenced a
most agreeable and instructive personal intercourse, which I enjoyed during
many years, with the late Rev. T. Belsham, who had been chosen a delegate
by the Dissenters in the county of Worcester.
   The illiberal spirit which now began to prevail in the court and the parlia
ment, soon interrupted the proceedings of the Deputies and Delegates, and
the question of the Repeal was postponed for more than 30 years.

Dear Sir,  Clapton, Feb. 18, 1792.

By the advice of our friends in the House of Commons, the

Anti-trinitarians in London have agreed to present the inclosed

petitionf to Parliament this session, and we hope to have the

concurrence of the friends of free inquiry (among whom may

be even Trinitarians) in some of the principal towns in the

country. I depend upon your activity to get it signed by as

many as you conveniently can in Bristol and its neighbour

hood, so as to be returned in a fortnight. You will direct that

   t For the repeal of the persecuting statute, (9 and 10 William III.,) enti
tled, " An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Blasphemy and Pro-
faneness," a relief, (though unhappily limited to Christians,) which, in 1813,
my friend, Mr. William Smith, M. P. for Norwich, had the honour of
effecting. See W. X. 438, 495 note.

  This repeal was proposed by Mr. Fox, May 11,1 792, and refused by a ma
jority of 79. (N. A. Reg. XIII. 770 I then heard, and Dr. Priestley heard,
the most just and liberal sentiments, conveyed in the most attractive form by
the honourable mover. " Mr. Burke's ingenuity," as Mr. M'Corinick
observes, " whatever the subject of debate might be, whether religious or poli
tical, coidd always find means of introducing his favourite topic, the French
revolution." On this occasion he mourned, with rancorous eloquence, the
fall of " the King's castle at Paris," and performed a part, only second to
his exhibition of the famous dagger-scene ,. especially maligning the Unita
rians, because " they talked of virtue, and of human bliss," as likely to be
advanced, eventually, by a popular rising against the Bourbon despotism.
Nor did the political manager suffer this celebrated performer to quit the
stage unrewarded.

   " It is true, Mr. Burke had not then actually begun to receive any of his
pensions of £3, 700 a year, but his first pension of .£1200 a year for his own
life, and that of his wife, though dated Sept. 24, 1 795, was made to commence
Jan. 5, 1793; and the other two pensions of .£2600 a year for three lives,
were to commence July 24, 1793, though the patents, for very obvious
reasons, are dated October, 1795. The two last pensions he sold for .£2700.
Yet this is the incorruptible patriot," adds Mr. M'Cormick, " who declared his
devotion to the public service, not expecting or admitting any reward what
soever." Mem. of Burke, (1798,) pp. 348, 361. It excites no surprise that
Mr. Burke's family would have silenced by an injunction this too faithful
biographer. See his advertisement.

Dear Sir,                   Clapton, April 25, 1792.

I am very happy to hear that Mr. Edwards discovers so

proper a disposition, and hope he will now go on to your sa

tisfaction. I had rather that you should revise what he writes,

than Mr. Scholefield: but the only thing of real importance is

the discussion of the facts ; and by all means give Mr. Ed

wards the particulars for this purpose. They will do for mine

afterwards. I will take care to get the article from your paper

into the Morning Chronicle and Star, if 1 can.

Some measures should be taken about the application to

Parliament; but as it is now thought that the House will not

break up soon, there may be time enough. I do not see why

some further indemnifications should not be applied for, espe

cially by those who have received nothing, as Mr. Coates, and

others, who have had much too little ; but you should by all

means come yourself and see Mr. Pitt, in order to get back

the affidavits, and be at some absolute certainty about our

expectations from the court. If we delay and apply to oppo

sition too late, we shall be despised by all parties.

Yesterday I saw Mr. John Lawrence, and am glad to find

that he can sufficiently exculpate you with respect to Dudley,

little as that affair amounts to; but it shews the poor shifts the

party is driven to. Mr. Madan being made a bishopJ (if the

report be true,) sufficiently shews the disposition of the court,

and should be considered as a signal of hostility by all Dissen

ters. Time may come, and not be far distant, when the court

may want our assistance. §

selves from their present despondency, I approve your resolu

tion of retiring from the scene for a time, though the idea of

your final emigration is more than I can well bear, so inti

municate what you write on public affairs, and provided I know

your sentiments, I do not care through what channel they come.

I have written to M. Francois on the subject of my citizen

I have nothing to say that I care who sees.*

   I lament with you the horrid violences committed in France,

Rochefoucauld, t I cannot believe he was concerned in any
plot in favour of the king; but let me know what is said, and
what you think on the subject. I hear those violences are now
at an end. It fact, nothing so outrageous can continue long.

   I rejoice that on the whole affairs wear so good an aspect,
and that the foreign enemy does not appear to be formidable.
Both M. Francais and my son agree with you in this. I hope
you received a letter I wrote to you some time ago, and which
I committed to the care of your brother. I shall now con
sider the politics of France more particularly, and communi
cate my sentiments occasionally through M. Francois to the
Conventional Assembly; and in order to form a better judg
ment, shall be happy to be instructed by you with respect to
the state of facts and opinions in France. Do you think that
the French could bear to be excluded from being spectators
of the Assembly ? If they could keep their debates to them
selves, and publish only the results of them, as was done by the
American Congress, it would add greatly to their dignity^

Dear Sir,  Clapton, June 22, 1792.

My first account of the business at Parisf was from the

public pape-s. I had no expectation of any such thing ; but

if it had been my own wish and procurement, what harm

was there in it ? This country is not likely to be a desirable

situation for any child of mine, and therefore it is natural for

me to look for a settlement for them elsewhere. On the other

hand, it is natural for the people of Birmingham to be offended

at whatever throws a reflection upon them, and they must

expect much more exasperation of the same kind.

I am sorry for the mistake between you and Mr. Belsham,

who says he had no idea of your expecting an account of the

debate* from him, as he never undertook to do it. It is now

too late.

written while the dismal scene, in which you were so great
and undeserved a sufferer, was recent, you preserve the same
cheerful and benevolent spirit that distinguishes every thing
you have written, and even that pleasant humour that always
delights me in your works. I think it cannot fail to do good
with those who are capable of reading with candour; and
some I hope there are of that class in all places, Birmingham
itself not excepted. You will, however, excuse a few remarks.

  First. You are too complimentary to myself.*
  Second. You are candid, I think, to an excess, and seem to
consider all religions as alike, which will make many persons
imagine you are an unbeliever. Two opposite systems cannot
botli be true ; and whatever any man deem to be important

cation to the Lovers of Riot." When Mr. Hutton, in 1798, prepared his
Life for a posthumous publication, he thus introduced the Narrative :

  " This year began prosperously, as many had done before it. My family
loved me ; were in harmony. I enjoyed the amusements of the pen, the
court, [of Requests,] and had no pressure upon the mind but the declining
state of health of her I loved. But a calamity awaited me I little suspected.
The riots in 1791, which hurt my fortune, destroyed my peace, nearly over
whelmed me and my family, and not only deprived us of every means of
restoring to health the best of women, but shortened her days.

  " I wrote a History of that most savage event at the time, with a view of
publication, but my family would not suffer it to see the light. I shall now
transcribe with exactness the manuscript copy." The Narrative thus con
cludes :

  " We have now taken a concise view of the rise and propress of a species
of punishment inflicted on innocence, which would have been insufferable for
the greatest enormities ; and with a tear I record the sorrowful thought,
that there appeared afterwards no more repentance on one side than there
had been faults on the other." Mr. Hutton adds,

  " I entered Birmingham July 14, 1741, as a runaway apprentice, a for
lorn traveller, without money, friend, or home ; and that day fifty years
began those outrages, which, when a wealthy inhabitant, drove mc from it,
and left me in a more deplorable state of mind than at the former period."
See " Life of William Hutton," (1816,) pp. 150-213, 216.

  As a " Preface" to " the Riots in 1791," in " History of Birmingham,"
(Ed. 3,) Mr. Hutton says, " I have celebrated that industry, civility, and
peaceable turn, which does honour to a people ; all founded in fact ; but now
we enter upon bigotry, licentiousness, disorder, insult, rapine, burnings, and
murder. I am exceedingly sorry this is also true," History, (1806,)

should not condemn the spirit of proselytism.* You cannot,
indeed, do it without condemning the conduct of the apostles
and reformers in all ages.

  If you think there is any thing worth your notice in this
remark, you will shorten one part of your work, which I think
will well bear it.

ers. There was an ostensible and plausible reason for attack

   * Dr. Priestley must refer to a digression commencing with an expression
of surprise, *' that men of a liberal education should persevere in the ancient
mode of quarrelling for religion ;" then, proceeding to declare " that every
religion upon earth is right," that " the different modes of conducting
worship are only ceremonials, which are in themselves indifferent," and con
cluding with the following passage :

   " However just might have been Dr. Priestley's sentiments, yet had he
not promulgated them on one side, and party violence opposed them on the
other, perhaps the peace of my life had never been wrecked in the dreadful
tempest of ninety-one, but I bad continued upon an equal footing with my
fellow-townsmen. If the doctor chooses to furnish the world with candles,
it reflects a lustre upon himself, but there is no necessity to carry one. It is
the privilege of an Englishman to walk in darkness if he chooses." Life,

pp. 164--168.
   Mr. Hutton had before observed, that " to dispute with the doctor was

deemed the road to preferment. He had already made two bishops ; and
there were still several heads which wanted mitres." Ibid. p. 161.

   Having remarked that " if one religion merits a preference to another,
that preference ought to arise from an extension of benevolence," Mr.
Hutton adds, " This character, I am told, belongs to the disciples of the
celebrated Emmanuel Swcdenborg, for they with open arms enfold the
whole human race, and treat them as brethren." Ibid. p. 166.

   f As expressed in the Appeal, adding, " Mr. Hutton suffered the ex
treme of injustice himself, for nothing but his unwearied endeavour to pro
cure justice for others," having become " obnoxious to the lower classes of
the people on account of the strict and exemplary discharge of his duty in
the Court of Requests." W. XIX. 393, 495, 496. Mr. Bage thus writes to
Mr. Hutton, " Elford, Jan 24, 1793 :"
, " In Dr. Priestley's late publication he makes just and honourable men
tion of thee. I am pleased to see the good doctor in print on any subject
except theology ; but at present nothing from him will be attended to. No
man's ear is open to any thing but damn the French, and damn the Presby
terians. I abstain from all society, because respect for my moral prin
ciples is scarcely sufficient to preserve me from insult, on account of my

  As a minister of religion, the object of my most ardent de

Being, the Father and Friend of mankind, whose providence
directs all events, may destroy the machinations of your ene

Dear Sir,  Clapton, Oct. 5, 1792.

I have read your letter to me with great satisfaction, and

think it will make a very proper addition to my Appeal. I

shall be happy in every thing that tends to shew and perpe

tuate our friendship. The letters from Mr. Scholefield, Mr.

T. Hawkes, Mr. Galton, and Mr. H. Hunt, are arrived. The

effect they have had you will hear of in my answer to Mr.

  · Rabaud " read two other letters from Dr. Priestley. The one was a

request to the National Convention to permit him to decline the honour of
sitting among them ; the other was an answer to a letter sent him by M.
Roland, informing him of his election. In this letter he congratulated the
minister on his great talents and activity, and, above all, on his conduct
during the stormy moments of the French Revolution. He exhorted him to
continue his exertions against the internal enemies of the State, while his
brave countrymen were fighting upon the frontiers in defence of liberty.

  " These letters were much applauded, and ordered to be inscribed in the
prods-verbal (Sept. 28) ; and in answer to his letter addressed to the As
sembly, the President was charged to inform him that the Convention would
receive with pleasure any reflections which he might be pleased to transmit
to them." Lond. Citron. LXXII. 325. For Dr. Priestley's Letter " to the

Scholefield, which I fear will offend all the Quietists ; but for
that there is no help. Mr. Edwards's fourth number I like,
and am sorry that he does not publish it ; for, as you observe,
there is no asperity in it, so that I should have thought the
very tamest of them might have borne it.

   I have not yet read the various additional documents you
have now furnished me with, but I shall set about it imme
diately, and I imagine I shall have improved my piece with
them, so as to be able to begin to print in about a fortnight,
and the printing will take about a month, as I see no occasion
to be in any hurry. Indeed, as I told you, I do not wish to
publish till about Christmas, when every thing relating to the
indemnification, &c, shall be settled. Besides, by that time,
I hope the aspect of things in France will be clearing up, and
much depends upon that, in every case in which civil or
religious liberty is concerned. At present there is great cause
to hope the best ; but some things, I was going to say, " do not
look well ;" but I have this moment been called out by Mr.
Vaughan, to say that the treaty between the King of Prussia
and Dumourier (from which we began to think unfavourably
of the latter) is terminated, without their coming to any agree
ment, and the Prussian camp is breaking up. Of what is
likely to follow we are ignorant ; but as nothing but distress
made the king propose the conference, that distress is not
likely to be lessened. A few days must now decide much.

   Be assured I will not keep the account of the trials* more
   · On the too frequent conduct of these trials Mr. Hutton complains, in
his Narrative,' that "by the false lenity of the court, villany became trium
phant. Some of the sufferers' witnesses were injured in their property,
others personally abused, and others threatened with death. Thus," he
adds, " order is inverted, we are making large strides towards anarchy, and
are perfectly ripe for another tumult."
   After relating several instances of decisions in direct opposition to well-
attested facts, Mr. Hutton relates that " a gentleman soon after this, hunting
with Mr. Corbett's fox-hounds, was so sure of killing the fox, that he cried,
' Nothing but a Birmingham jury can save him.' " Life, p. 207.
  While this note is passing through the press, a gentleman, who, at the
period of the riots, resided near Birmingham, in the Methodist connexion,
and had traversed the ruins at Fairhill, has favoured me with the following
communication, in answer to my inquiries :

pose. Before I have printed my work, I imagine you will be

and 1 have seen a letter from Mr. Stone, dated " 1 o'clock, 2nd
Oct., Hall of the Convention. This moment the news is arrived
that the Prussians have raised their camp and are in flight.
They [have left 5000 sick in the hospitals, and have lost
between two and three hundred men. The French army is in

bility that they can escape being taken."*

 Sunday morning, 20th July, 1791. Mr. Rowley" (the minister) "detailed
 to us the outrages during the preceding week at Birmingham, of which he
 bad been an eye-witness ; and they were horrible in the extreme. But what
 shocked me most, was the hearing so mild and good a man, blinded by pre
 judice, impute the disgraceful transaction to the Unitarians themselves, and
 as a certain act of God'sfiery vengeance, for their inculcating the damnable
 doctrines ofSocinut. Dr. Priestley and his damnable errors, came in for his
 share of abuse, and great astonishment was expressed at his not clearly seeing
 the Trinity in Unity, and all the glories of gospel-grace.

   " I reflected on this declnmation afterwards, and I remember being
 severely checked for expressing a desire to see some of the writings of that
 great man. I could not, however, reconcile myself to the evident approba
tion exhibited, in narrating the brutal ferocity thus displayed, in whicli
ruffians of the most unprincipled cast, encouraged by villains of a higher
 station, to their everlasting disgrace, were seen to destroy, without remorse,
the invaluable property of their truly respectable neighbours. That the
mild, charitable, and humane Rowley, should coolly approve of these out
rages, and attribute them to the judgment of God, for a mere difference of
religious sentiment, all this seemed to my mind very extraordinary, and I
sought in vain to account for it, on Christian principles. But this bigotry
was too prevalent at the period, and the Methodists, I must candidly avow,
were as violent on this subject as any other classes of society. But there
were exceptions to be found among them. I will instance one.

  " In 1 793 I resided in Birmingham, and the celebrated Mr. Bradburne
was the preacher. I went to hear him one Sunday evening, when he en
larged upon the atrocities alluded to, with vehement disapprobation. ' The
curse of God,' said he,7,' hangs over your town, for the infamous treatment
Dr. Priestley experienced among you.' I could have embraced him for the
justness of his exclamation ; it was so consonant to my feelings. R. Dome."

Dear Sir,  Clapton, Nov. 17, 1792.

I deferred writing to you, thinking to send you a com

plete copy of the second part of my Appeal ; but this I find I

cannot do till the next week. I know it will not please many,

and perhaps may require some alterations.

I thank you for the MS. I have read about half of it; but

it is so low and scurrilous, that I do not know that I shall take

any further notice of it. I suspect Mr. Clutton,* the author of

this, to be the author of a piece just coming out, called a

whole-length picture of me, with the extracts from my publi

cations annexed to it.f It is the extreme of malignity which

French found upwards of 300 horses half eaten." N. A. Reg. XIII.

  " Oct. 13." Dr. Priestley was brought into strange company, by an
advertisement announcing a theological opponent, in the author of " Essays
in Divinity and Physic, proving the Divinity of the Person of Jesus Christ,
and the Spiritual Sense of Scripture;" also on " Trying of Spirits, Cause
and Cure of our Sovereign's late Illness, Animal Magnetism, and Magic.

the Test Laws, which was said to have been " peculiarly violent." To
Mr. Clutton, also, had been " generally ascribed" a " Letter by Some
body" to Dr. Priestley, on his " Address to the Subscribers to the Birming
ham Library." (See supra, p. 6.) This Letter appears to have abounded
in unjust imputations, expressed in language peculiarly scurrilous. See
W. XIX. 464, 589, 590, note.

Priestley, copied from his own Writings. Mens cujusque, is est quisque.

   Then followed, " Nov. 24. This day was published, price 1*., a Small
Whole Length of Dr. Priestley, copied from his Printed Works ; or, a Free
Account (in consequence of a Free Inquiry) of his Style, his Politics, his

sis ; and an Appendix of Extracts from the Writings of Dr. Priestley, which
were read in Court, at the Assizes at Warwick." Lond. Chron. LXXII.

   In the Appeal, Part ii., Dr. Priestley exposes the unjust and illiberal use
 of these " extracts" by his " adversaries' counsel, Mr. Hardinge, the queen's
 solicitor," while " the judge endeavoured, in vain, to check his violence."

will give them other objects, and, in time, humble them
sufficiently.

   I am glad to find by Mr. Hunt, that no great difficulty is
apprehended from the collection for the damages. Other
persons, however, I find are full of apprehensions for the con
sequences.

    I am much affected by the offer of your generous benefac

 the late riots, and of your respect and attachment to me,
 which," you kindly say, " neither time nor distance can
 diminish." You must, however, permit me to say, that as I
 neither want any evidence of your attachment, nor any pecu
 niary assistance, I cannot accept of it. The generous friends
 of liberty in other parts of the country, which did not suffer
 by the riots, and some of them members of the establishment,
 liave already indemnified me for my pecuniary losses, and
 besides the heavy expenses incurred by you all, in consequence
of the riots, the losses of many of you in them have far ex
ceeded mine; though, as becomes Christians, you bear it with
out repining, and even with joy, from a full persuasion of the
goodness of the cause in which you suffer.
  It must give you the greatest satisfaction, as it does me, to
perceive that this cause has been considerably promoted by the
riot, by evincing the malignity of our adversaries, and the evi

confusion into society with which ours are ignorantly charged,
and by discovering your own truly generous and Christian-like
conduct under their abuse and violence.

   The truly liberal and peaceable members of society already
do us justice in their opinions of us and our adversaries, and
in time, as our case shall be more discussed, and better under
stood, we cannot doubt but that this justice, which we value
more than any thing of a pecuniary nature, will be universally
done us, and then the cause which has lately been grossly in
sulted and oppressed will be every where triumphant.

   Be assured that wherever that Providence, which overrules
all things, shall place me, which we cannot doubt will always
be for the best, my best affections will be at Birmingham, and
I shall always feel much interested in your prosperity. Whe
ther I ever meet you there, which was once my earnest wish,
is not material ; but I trust that those dispositions and that
conduct which persecution cannot fail to invigorate, will in
sure our meeting in a state in which the wicked will cease
from troubling, and where we shall still provoke to love and
to good works, and mutually promote our virtue and happi
ness as we have done in this. With the greatest gratitude
and the most earnest prayers for your happiness here and here
after, I am, my Christian friends, yours most affectionately.*

Though I am happy to hear that you are in so great mea

do not hear from you, and of your coming hither, as you gave

us reason to expect, before this time. I wish to see you on

many accounts. Indeed, the times are very critical, and re

quire the united councils of all the friends of liberty. I fear

the worst, as the court party are triumphant every where, es

pecially on account of the repulse of the French armies, and

the distracted state of France, from which indeed every thing

is to be feared.

that was found in the Treasury, and lately put into my hands,
and to observe upon it, that I had no pupils at Birmingham
besides those of my congregation, to whom I taught nothing
but theology, without ever mentioning to them the subject of

politics.
   The indifference with which Mr. Williams speaks of the

riots at Manchester is not a little remarkable. How far " the
rabble," as he calls them, may be depended upon, you may
judge from the following facts. In the town of Dudley, in
which not long ago Mr. Paine and myself were burned in
effigy, and with some circumstances peculiarly shocking, on
the apprehension of something that would [bear] hard. on
the nail manufactory, a riot was lately apprehended, though
the swearing-in of a hundred more constables prevented it;
but the cry among the populace was Paine for ever, and No
King.

   I also think it right that you and Mr. Fox should be in
formed that one Matthew Jones, clerk to Mr. Brooke,* used
 the following expressions in the presence of eleven or twelve
persons at the White Hart Tavern in Holborn, in September
 or October last : " Damn the Presbyterians ; damn the rascals ;
 I led the loyal fellows from the Hotel to the New Meeting."
 Of this I am promised a regular certificate, though not of ano
 ther anecdote of which Mr. Russell informed me, but which
 he says he knows to be true, viz. that Lady Aylesford,f being
 brought to bed not long after the riots, said to the person who

 are about ten out of eleven of them firm loyalists, to be depended upon at
 all times : of the single men and rabble there is also a very great majority to
 be relied on. The only people there from whom any thing is to be appre
 hended are some young men brought up under Priestley.

Dear Sir,                        London, April 30, 1793.

Your letter affects me very much, and makes me earnestly

wish to see you ; but while I give lectures at the college, I

cannot conveniently leave it till the vacation ; besides, such is

the state of the country, increasing in malignity against every

thing liberal, that it is best for me to keep quiet at home, and

neither expose myself or my friends by going any whither.

I perceive your resolution, and approve of it, and I take it for

granted that I shall very soon be compelled to adopt the same

measure.

I do not wonder at your leaving Birmingham. Your merit

is too great to be forgiven, and your associates unworthy of

you. I rejoice, however, that there are two such men as Mr.

Jones and Mr. Edwards to support the same cause. I wish

much that his Fast Sermon may be printed. Nothing is ever

gained by timidity. I shall print mine^ and I hope you will

not find it deficient in any thing that you used to approve in

my writings.

There is no news but what you will see in the papers, but a

general and increasing alarm at the numerous bankruptcies,

and the obstinacy of the French. You will see my apprehen

sions in my sermon. Every thing indicates a beginning of

troubles in Europe. I wish my friends, especially my young

ones, safely out of it. As to such as myself it is of little con

sequence whether we go or stay.

           To ReV. J. BReTlAnd.f

Dear Sir,                        Clapton, June 10, 1793.

I thank you for yours by Miss Tucker, with whom 1 am

much pleased, and who regularly attends my class. As you

and I can only differ in judgment, in consequence of seeing the

same thing in different lights, nothing, I am persuaded, will

ever happen to diminish our mutual esteem and good-will. I

am concerned, however, to hear of your resignation of your

charge as minister of the Mint Meeting, in which your use

fulness seemed to be continually increasing, especially as 1

cannot enter into your reasons, as they are reported to me.

Nothing, however, can be objected to you, but an excess of

scrupulosity, which is always to be respected, at the same time

it may be regretted by your friends, who are sorry to see you

excluded by it from a situation of great usefulness^ when they

see no other open to you.

As I understand that your resignation is accepted, will you

permit me to recommend to your congregation Mr. Belsham,

of our college. Its continuance here is rather problematical.

If we must lose him, I wish it may be to your gain, and he

will make a valuable addition to your society. The more I

see of him, the more I see reason to esteem him, and he has

appeared to great advantage in the character of both minister

and tutor. In the latter, it is my real opinion that the Dissen

ters never had his equal.

What the fate of the college will be does not yet appear, and

to-morrow there is to be a public dinner§ of its friends, and

some time ago I thought better of its aspect, and now I am not

without hopes. I wish, however, to secure a pleasing retreat

for Mr. Belsham, in case of the worst happening ; and if the

college be removed, I do not think he will be disposed to fol-

   I should be more concerned to part with Mr. Belsham, but
that I consider my stay in this country as very uncertain. All
my sons will soon, I hope, be in America, and I shall probably
follow them. In all events I am, dear Sir, yours sincerely.*

Dear Sir,           Clapton, June 13, 1793.

Any memorial of our past friendship would give me a pe

culiar satisfaction, as there are few things in the course of my
life that I reflect upon with more pleasure ; but the present of

a volume of your sermons,* which I havejust received, is doubly

acceptable to me, as they present to me the traces of your

mind and excellent disposition, which always charmed your

friends. These, I perceive, are of a practical nature, and I

doubt not I shall find them excellent ; but I hope we shall be
favoured with another volume at least, of a critical nature, in

which you particularly excelled. They were your valuable

criticisms that gave occasion to the " Theological Repository,"§
to which your papers gave a distinguished value.

   My fate has been very various since I was in your neigh

bourhood, and is likely to be more various still. All my sons

are going to America, and if they get well settled, I shall pro

bably follow them, but I do not wish to do it soon, as my si
tuation here is very agreeable to me ; but such is the increas

ing bigotry of the high-church party in this country, so justly

and so kindly, with respect to myself, lamented by you, and

such are the difficulties that I fear this country will be in

volved in, that such persons as I am may be glad to get out of

it, and happily there is a country that can afford us an asylum.
If this fail there is another, in which I shall hope to meet you
and all my Christian friends, to be separated from them no

more. With this hope I remain, my dear friend, yours most

affectionately. ||

           To Mr. Russell.*

Dear Sir,                   Clapton, June 17, 1793.

I am much affected with the perusal of your letter, as it

shews the state of your mind to be less happy than I wish it

to be, and as it has revived some ideas that, though accom

panied with useful reflections, are rather painful. I was in

deed singularly happy in my situation, and chiefly in conse

quence of your contributing so much to make it so; and my

present situation, though I have many things to be thankful

for in it, is far from being what Birmingham was, and chiefly

for want of such a friend and leader in the congregation as

you were. But this change with respect to you is much more

to your disadvantage, and I sincerely feel for you and your

amiable daughters. To advise, however, what to do, is im

possible. No man can judge for another in such a case as

this, and least of all can I, who am undetermined how to act

myself.

Had I been unsettled, as I was when I left Birmingham, such

is the aspect of things at present, that I should not stay in the

country ; but having a settlement, and a sphere of employment,

I do not think it advisable to abandon it till my sons be settled

in America, when I hope to end my days with them. It is very

possible, however, as the aspect of things is getting continually

worse, as far at least as it concerns me, that I may be glad to

remove even the next year, though I do not wish to go so soon.

If I should go, your daughters should not want a home or pro

tector in that country, while I could find one myself. Were

I in your case, I think I should not decline the offer you men

tion, as in case of a wish to remove, it would not be difficult

to disengage yourself. Once, indeed, I had flattered myself

that I should have had the happiness of seeing you near me,

and still will not give up the idea of seeing you and your

daughters sometimes. If you have no objection, I shall pay

you a short visit soon, though I had rather see you here. I

fipd I cannot go to Heath.

I hope you have been as happy at Paxton as I have been at

Wooton, where I ride out every day, and do not find one un

pleasant circumstance. On the contrary, there seems to be a

degree of liberality in this place that I should not have ex

pected to find in any other part of the kingdom. On Sunday

the meeting-house was crowded ; and among other persons of

note were the Mayor and his son, who afterwards drank tea at

Mr. Chandler's, where I was, and Mr. Pitt, the member of

Parliament, who that evening came to Mr. Russell's, and gave

me a general invitation to dine with him, &c. Mr. Russell

also meets with every mark of respect from all ranks of peo

ple, not excepting the clergy, one of whom dined here since I

came.

I have employed myself every morning in enlarging my

answer to Mr. Evanson,§ and writing a long and serious pre

face, which I hope you will not dislike. I have other additions

to make, occasioned by another perusal of the work, and, on

the whole, think that my answer will be nearly as large as his

book. I can hardly repress my indignation at the contemp

tuous manner in which he treats the books of the New Tes-

tament,i| but I hope you will not have much fault to find with

me on this account.

   I leave this place on Friday, having heard that Joseph will
be the next day at Clapton, ready to embark with Mr. Cooper
from London, in about a fortnight.

   As far as I can learn, there are few people who approve of
the war in this part of the country. I have seen two clergy
men who condemn it much ; and one of them, in giving me an
account of Mr. Frend's trial, approved of the proceedings
against him. He has sent me the printed trial; and I think
the Vice-Chancellor's speech will operate in favour of free
inquiry ; for when is the time to inquire, if not at the Univer
sity ? To say that they should not meddle with religious con
troversy there, is to say they must not engage in it at all.*
This, I should think, must strike every body.

   * The Vice-Chancellor was Dr. Milner, President of Queen's College
and Dean of Carlisle. At the conclusion of his speech he " addressed the
junior part of the University," whom he thus advised :

   " Beware of entering into religious controversies at this period of your
lives. Frequent the service of God, according to the established forms. At
present take it for granted that our forefathers had some good reason for
steadily adhering to and supporting these venerable institutions. It has not
been my way to take things for granted, but it is not your time to become
parties in controversial matters of religion."

   On " it has not been my way to take things for granted," Mr. Frend asks,
" Has not Dr. Milner subscribed the Thirty-nine Articles; and is there a man
in the University who supposes that he ever gave himself the trouble of
investigating them ; and would not he himself be offended with any one
who should assert that he believed them i"

   See " An Account of the Proceedings in the University of Cambridge
against William Frend, M. A., Fellow of Jesus College, for publishing a
pamphlet entitled Peace and Union," (1793,) p. 186.

   Dr. Milner's prurient advice to the juniors of hit University " in divinity
to keep the road, and to follow the great wheel of the church," (the resolu
tion of Sir Thomas Browne,) had been shrewdly proposed, in 1721, "to all
gentlemen schoolboys who are designed for the University of Oxford," thus :

   " Your only safe way is to carry along with you consciences chartes
blanches, ready to receive any impression that you please to stamp upon
them. Never, therefore, explain your opinions, but let your declarations
be that you are Churchmen, and that you believe as the Church believes.
For instance, you have subscribed the Thirty-nine Articles, but never ven
ture to explain the sense in which you subscribed them, because there are
various senses, so many indeed that scarce two men understand them in the
same. Suppress, as much as possible, that busy spirit of curiosity, which
too often fatally exerts itself in youthful breasts ; but if (notwithstanding all

   Give my particular respects to Mr. Reynolds, and also to
Mr. and Mrs. Cappe, when you get to York, and to Mrs.
Blackburne at Richmond. I am anxious to hear of Mr. Lee,
but fear you will hardly find him alive.* If you do, remember
me kindly to him. Direct to me at Clapton, where I shall be
sometime perhaps printing my work, though I shall like to
make an excursion afterwards.

                         To the Same.

Dear Friend,             Clapton, Aug. 5,1793.

I hope that by this time you have received the letter I

wrote to you from Gloucester,f though you had not when you

wrote yours.

If you feel a void, I feel a greater. I have no satisfaction in

going to town now. It seems quite empty since you are not

there, and it gives me some idea how I should feel in case of

your death. Mr. Belsham's society is some relief to me, but

be feels much as I do, and to-morrow he goes to Bedford.

I am now, however, a great deal occupied about the de

parture of my sons for America. Mr. Cooper goes with them,

and Mr. Walker, who has not yet left London, will follow.

I cannot express how much I feel for him. If he should go

to Manchester he is threatened with being arrested, and sent

literally in irons to Lancaster, with every insult. He has,

therefore, after signifying his intention to go thither, now sent

word that he will appear at Lancaster, to answer any charges

they can have against him. There appears to be a determina

tion to ruin him, and thereby break the spirit of the friends of

reform at Manchester. J

Mr. Belsham has a letter from Mr. Kenrick, giving an ac-

your non-inquisitiveness) the strong beams of truth will break in upon your
minds, let them shine inwardly ; disturb not the public peace with your

private discoveries and illuminations ; no, if you have any concern for your
welfare and prosperity, let Aristotle be your guide absolute in philosophy,
and Athanasius in religion." Tcrrce-Filius (1754), PP- 167, 168.

count of the trial of Mr. Winterbotham for seditious expres
sions in two sermons. He was found guilty, in both cases, on
the evidence of two very illiterate persons, against the testi
mony of a great number of his respectable hearers, that he
bad not used any such language as was ascribed to him.* This
is indeed alarming, and calls for the interference of the Dissen
ters as a body. Mr. Cook, of Cambridge,f has also been con
victed, on the evidence of the most infamous persons, of se
ditious words spoken three years ago. There was nothing
worse than this in the reigns of the Stuarts.

   Mr. Russell is now here, and inclines to go to America, not
withstanding his present very agreeable situation at Gloucester.
I think I shall be drawn into the vortex, though not imme
diately. My principal objection is leaving you behind. I do
think I could do more good there than I can here; but I shall
at all events wait the report of my sons.

   I began to print my Reply to Mr. EvansonJ last Wednesday.
Mr. Dodson was here yesterday, and still wonderfully struck
with Mr. E.'s work,§ though I think Mr. Belsham and I stag
gered him a little. I wish I could convey a copy of my reply
before you return.

frends in general, if you meet with any such. ||

I am happy in the thought of so much of your absence from

London being expired, though I hope you enjoy that absence,

and on this account I enjoy it too. Mr. Belsham is also on a

journey, and I imagine you will return about the same time.

We are much alarmed with the apprehension of a war with

America. It is the opinion of most, that this event, disastrous

as it must be, will take place, and on this account Joseph's wife
has determined to go with him. I hope a good Providence
will attend them.

   Every thing I see or hear inclines me more to think of fol
lowing my sons, if they should find a desirable situation for
me, though, considering my age, I am not much concerned
about it, provided they be out of this country, and do well
elsewhere.

  1 have had a good deal of communication with Mr. Dodson
relating to my answer to Mr. Evanson, whose part he is, in
many respects, still inclined to take. I have on this account
made an appendix to my work, which however does not
entirely satisfy him. He is persuaded that Paul, in two pas
sages, refers to a written gospel, and that this was the gospel
of Luke; but to me this appears highly improbable.*

                           To Mr. J. GouGH.t

      Sir, Clapton, Aug. 25, 1793.
   I was highly gratified by the account you was so good as to
 transmit to me of the favourable manner in which the news of
the Revolution in France was received in America, especially
as at that time there were doubts entertained on the subject.
That many viewed it in an unfavourable light, with you I have
no doubt ; but that a revolution so nearly resembling your own
should not be thought a joyful event by the Americans in ge
neral, I could not be brought to believe. Your letter made
me quite easy on the subject, and enabled me to satisfy my
friends.
   Since that time there have been more revolutions, as they
may be called, in France; all, however, I am willing to think,
favourable to liberty and happiness, though at the time I and
all my friends were disposed to forebode ill, as our particular
friends were the sufferers. The last constitution seems now to
give universal satisfaction, the insurrection seems to be nearly

suppressed, and as to their foreign enemies they make light of
them ; indeed, they have only served to rouse and unite them.

   We have been alarmed with the apprehension of a war with
America, but I hope there will be wisdom on your side of the
water, though little I fear on ours, to prevent it. Both coun
tries must be materially injured by the event, and neither of
them could be a gainer.

   I send this by my sons, who are going to find a settlement
in your country, all I have, (three,) and then I shall expect
to follow soon. I cannot give you an idea of the violence with
which every friend to liberty is prosecuted in this country.
Little of the liberty of the press on political subjects is now
left, and the country goes heartily with the court into all their
measures, so that nothing but general calamity, which I fear
is approaching, will open their eyes. The source of all this
evil is want of knowledge in the lower, and some, not of the
lower, orders of the people. The French are wisely providing
against this evil by a system of public instruction. Here, even
Sunday-schools begin to be reprobated, as making the common
people too knowing.*

               To Rev. T. Lindsey.

Dear Friend,                          Clapton, Sept. 7, 1793.

I am glad to hear, by your letter received yesterday, that

you and Mrs. Lindsey are well, and enjoy your excursion so

much ; but I am more particularly pleased to find that you are

now moving towards London, which to me seems empty with

out you. Yesterday, however, Mr. Belsham returned, so that

I am better off than I have been.

I cannot say that I have any distinct recollection of Mr.

Logan. However, please to give my respects to him. I must

esteem every body that receives you.

I have not failed to send a copy of my book to the Duke,f

and I think I directed Johnson to send one to Mr. Shore. J Either

with him or with the duke you will be sure to see it. I con
sulted with Dr. Blackburne about sending you a copy, but he
could not hit upon any plan that was feasible.

   At Leeds you will probably find our old acquaintance, Dr.
Dawson. Mrs. Dawson has just called, and says that he is
there. He seems carefully to keep out of my way ;* and he
will not, I should suppose, be very fond of coming in yours.
How strangely, interest and other motives warp men ! But
without these things, which try men, it would not be known
what we were.

   We have just heard from the voyagers, who, in the late
stormy weather, the wind being against them, have been off
Portsmouth, and we suppose they are there still, as the wind
continues in the same point. They were all very well, and in
good spirits.

   I have received a ring, on account of Mr. Lee's funeral,f and
intend to write to the widow.

  I have advice that the money to be paid on account of the
riots will be delivered to the sufferers this week.

Priestley, when publishing, in 1783, " The Necessitarian, or the Question
concerning Liberty and Necessity stated, in Nineteen Letters." A reviewer
remarks,

   " Dr. Dawson hath particularly exposed the fallacy of the common ob
jections to Necessity, drawn from a supposition of its being inconsistent
with merit, and hath, we think, fully established bis proposition, that the
will is always impelled by motives, and that it is the quality of an act that
constitutes the ground of merit or demerit, from whence arises a conscious
ness of acting well or ill, the approbation or disapprobation of our own
minds.

My valued Friends,  Clapton, Nov. 16, 1793.

There are few things I more regret, in consequence of my

removal from Birmingham, than the loss of your society. It

both encouraged and enlightened me ; so that what I did there

of a philosophical kind, ought injustice to be attributed almost

as much to you as to myself. From our cheerful meetings I

never absented myself" voluntarily, and from my pleasing re

collection they will never be absent. Should the cause of our

separation make it necessary or expedient for me to remove to

a still greater distance from you, I shall only think the more,

and with the more regret, of our past interviews.

  * See supra, p. 205. The sequel of this political persecution, one of the
many which distinguished William Pitt's " reign of terror," is thus recorded :

   " On Wednesday last came on, at Lancaster assizes, the trial of Thomas
Walker, Esq., of Manchester, and nine other persons, for seditious practices,
in arming men, and providing ammunition, in order to assist the enemies of
Great Britain. After a trial of six hours, they were most honourably
acquitted.

   " The principal witness was committed by the court, for perjury, he not
only prevaricating in the course of his examination, but it being proved that
he had previously acknowledged that he had been hired and bribed to give
evidence against Mr. Walker." Oracle, Monday, April 7, 1/94.

         MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  911

   It is now more than two years that I have been deprived of
your society, and that I have been under the disagreeable ne
cessity of intermitting my philosophical pursuits. With the
assistance of my friends I have now resumed them, and it is
with particular satisfaction that I dedicate the first fruits of
my labours* to you.

   You are no strangers to the ostensible causes of those dis
graceful riots which drove me from your neighbourhood, and
j'ou know my perfect innocence with respect to them. Had I
really been what the populace, who demolished my library
and apparatus, my house and every thing belonging to me,
were taught to believe, viz. a fomenter of sedition, and an
enemy to the peace and constitution of my country, symptoms
of it must have been perceived in our frequent interviews.
But you know that neither politics nor religion were ever the
subjects of our conversations. Philosophy engrossed us
wholly.

   Politicians may think there are no objects of any conse
quence besides those which immediately interest them ; but
objects far superior to any of which they have an idea en
gaged our attention, and the discussion of them was accom
panied with a satisfaction to which they are strangers. Happy
would it be for the world if their pursuits were as tranquil,
and their projects as innocent and as friendly to the best inter
ests of mankind, as ours. It is, however, a noble consideration,
that the order and final happiness of the universe will not be
interrupted by any thing that they can devise or do, while
there is one Infinite Mind superintending all things, and
bringing good out of, and by means of, all the evil that they
can contrive or produce.

   In the character of a minister of religion I never appeared
with you, but as such (now that I am perhaps taking my final
leave of you) permit me, though in religious persuasion differ
ing from you all, to commit you to the protection and blessing
of that great Being, whose we are, and whom, I trust, we all

MEMOIRS OF Oil. PRIESTLEY.  91.1'

    So little as you have at any time interfered in national poli
 tics, it is but too obvious that the outrageous violence which
 you have experienced, and the atrocious calumnies which have
 been circulated with such unexampled industry to injure your
 character, and to render your residence in your native country
 unpleasant, and even unsafe, are entirely owing to that manly
spirit with which you have avowed and defended what you
firmly believed to be the pure and rational doctrines of the
gospel, and to that truly Christian zeal with which you have
entered your protest against those prevailing errors by which
the religion of Jesus has been corrupted and debased.*

   But you, Sir, have instructed us, both by your doctrine and
example, to refer events to a higher cause, and while we re
gard with pity the conduct of men who, under the cover of
 religious zeal, are gratifying their own perverse passions, we
also view them as instruments, under the direction of a supe
rior Power, for the accomplishment of purposes the most dis
tant from their own intentions, and we bow with humble ac
quiescence to the all-wise, disposing will of Heaven. The
history of the Christian church from its first origin, through
the revolutions of successive ages, has taught us this lesson,
that it is the order of Providence that religious truth should be
promulgated and confirmed by the sufferings of its most en
lightened and most zealous advocates. In this part of the world
you, Sir, have kindled a resplendent light, which no length of
time, nor violence of opposition, will be able to extinguish ;
and you have been honoured as the instrument of diffusing
religious knowledge beyond almost any individual in later
ages. We anticipate, therefore, with pleasing hope, the ex
tensive success of your future labours in America. Favoured as
we have been with your rising and your meridian lustre, we
ought not to envy our brethren in the Western continent the
benefit of your evening ray.

   Hitherto, Sir, you have been our pattern in every meritorious
exertion in the investigation of religious truth, in every thing
open and courageous in the profession of it ; and when you are
removed to a distant region, we trust that you will occasion
ally hear that your illustrious example has not been so long
exhibited before us in vain. We shall think it our duty upon
every proper occasion, and at all hazards, to avow our attach
ment to the genuine truths of the Christian religion;* and if
in the discharge of this duty we should be exposed even to
severer persecutions than those which you have encountered,f
we hope that our conduct will not disgrace the honourable
cause in which wesuffer.J

   We, Sir, rejoice with you in the assurance of the ultimate

Knowing the near approach of your departure from this

country, we cannot but think we should be guilty of a cul

farewell.

We have beheld, with mingled indignation and regret, that

spirit of persecution which kindled the flames of ninety-one,

spreading through the realm its baneful influence, and pur

suing into his retreat the friend and ornament of his country.

A spirit which was thought, in this country at least, to be

for ever extinct, inspiring its barbarous violence into a lawless

mob, drove you from this place, and broke those bonds which

form the sacred connexion of a pastor with his flock.

Wanton in malice, the same spirit has continued to persecute

you with private molestation, and with public calumny. The

prostituted abilities of Mr. Burke have industriously seized

each public occasion of exciting against you the public odium.t

while the dark, assassinating spirit of anonymous abuse has
been busy in the public prints, and found means to assail and
wound the tranquillity of your most private retirements.

   From a country where you have met with injustice instead of
reward, with calumny and persecution instead of praise and
esteem, we cannot wonder you should depart.

   The hope that in America you will find that Asylum which
is here denied you ; the confidence that a free country will re
ceive a veteran son of liberty with all the respect that is due
to his worth ; the belief that those who have fought and bled
for their own rights, will reverence one who has been de
prived of his/ the certainty that the implacable enemies of
liberty will never permit you in this country to enjoy repose;
and the strong suspicion that they would gladly seize an oppor
tunity to aim not only at your personal freedom, but at your
life itself, reconcile us to the prospect of your departure, by
demonstrating its necessity.

   Wherever you go, renown will attend you. In England
alone are you calumniated. In every other land each grateful
science will crowd around, and offer a garland to him whose

Liberty will warmly welcome you to any of her dominions.
Virtue and Religion will hail, with joyful smiles, the arrival of
their intrepid champion, their ardent votary.

   We have, on a former melancholy occasion, expressed our
sense of the services you rendered us. We expressed less than
we felt, and we again send you our thanks. While tyranny
will rejoice, while bigotry and superstition will clap their
hands at your departure, all that have been enlightened by
your labours will give, in the tribute of a silent tear, more
than those powers, with all their boasted influence, can bestow
on their most favourite vassals.

   Though you depart, your labours remain. The propagation
of truth is silent and slow, but it is irresistible. The seed that
you have strewn around will not lie buried in the earth for
ever. It is arising, and it will arise, till it ripen into a glorious
harvest.

   To your talents, your integrity, and love of truth, we shall,

while we live, bear testimony. We rejoice that of these no

you to reflect that no virtuous effort you ever made can possibly
be lost, it shall be some consolation to us that we have en
joyed, that we do still enjoy, so many of their effects.

   Though the waters of a wide sea will soon roll between us,
your example, your precepts, your principles, shall not be
absent. These shall continue present in our minds, and shall

Dear Sin,  Clapton, March 26, 1794.

I am concerned to find by your last Intelligencer that some

person, willing to appear my friend, has ascribed to me a

valuable improvement in the method of gilding, to which I

have no pretension. It was practised long before I went to

Birmingham, and I believe belongs to Mr. Boulton. Of him,

at least, 1 first heard of it. By rectifying this mistake as soon

as possible, you will oblige, dear Sir, yours sincerely.

   P. S. Give me leave to express the satisfaction I weekly re
ceive from the temper and spirit of jour paper, from which it
may be hoped that much good will accrue to this country.

         From the Society of United Irishmen.

      Sir, Dublin, March 28, 1794.
   Suffer a society which has been calumniated as devoid of
all sense of religion, law, or morality, to sympathize with one
whom calumny of a similar kind is about to drive from his
native land, a land which he has adorned and enlightened
in almost every branch of liberal literature, and of useful
philosophy. The emigration of Dr. Priestley will form a
striking historical fact, by which alone future ages will learn
to estimate truly the temper of the present times. Your
departure will not only give evidence of the injury which phi
losophy and literature have received in your person, but will
prove the accumulation of petty disquietudes which has
robbed your life of its zest and enjoyment ; for, at your age,
no one would willingly embark on such a voyage; and sure we
are, it was your own wish and prayer to be buried in your
native country, which contains the dust of your old friends,
Saville, Price, Jebb, and Fothergill. But be cheerful, dear
Sir ; you are going to a happier world, the world of Washing
ton and Franklin.
   In idea we accompany you. We stand near you, while you
are setting sail. We watch your eyes that linger on the white
cliffs, and we hear the patriarchal blessing which your soul
pours out on the land of your nativity, the aspiration that
ascends to God, for its peace, its freedom, and its prosperity.
Again do we participate in your feelings on first beholding
nature in her noblest scenes and grandest features, on finding
man busied in rendering himself worthy of nature ; but, more
than all, on contemplating, with philosophic prescience, the
coming period, when those vast inland seas shall be shadowed
with sails; when the St. Lawrence and Mississipi shall stretch
forth their arms to embrace the Continent in a great circle of

interior navigation ; when the Pacific Ocean shall pour into
the Atlantic; when man will become more precious than line
gold, and when his ambition shall be to Bubdue the elements,
not to subjugate his fellow-creatures ; to make fire, water,
earth, and air, obey his bidding, but to leave the pure ethereal
mind, as the sole thing in nature free and incoercible.

  Happy indeed would it be, were men in power to recollect
this quality of the human mind. Suffer us to give them an
example from a science of which you are a mighty master;
that attempts to fix the element of mind only increase its
activity, and that to calculate what may be from what has
been is a very dangerous deceit. Were all the saltpetre in
India monopolized, this would only make chemical researches
more ardent and successful. The chalky earths would be
searched for it, and nitre-beds would be made in every cellar
and every stable. Did not that prove sufficient, the genius of
chemistry would find in a new salt a substitute for nitre, or a
power superior to it.* It requires greater genius than Mr. Pitt
seems to possess, to know the wonderful resources of mind,
when patriotism animates philosophy, and all the arts and
sciences are put under a state of requisition ; when the attention
of a whole scientific people is bent to multiplying the means
and instruments of destruction ; and when philosophy rises in a
mass" to drive on the wedge of war. A black powder has
changed the military art, and in a great degree the manners of
mankind. Why may not the same science which produced it
produce another powder, which, inflamed under a certain
compression, might impel the air, so as to shake down the
strongest towers, and scatter destruction ?

   But you are going to a country where science is turned to
better uses. Your change of place will give room for the
matchless activity of your genius; and you will take a sublime
pleasure in bestowing on Britain the benefit of your future dis
coveries. As matter changes its form, but not a particle is

ever lost, so the principles of virtuous minds are equally im
perishable; and your change of situation may even render
truth more operative, knowledge more productive, and in the
event, liberty itself more universal. Wafted by the winds, or
tossed by the waves, the seed that is here thrown out as dead,
there shoots up and flourishes. It is probable that emigration
to America, from the first settlement downward, has not only
served the cause of general liberty, but will eventually and
circuitously serve it, even in Britain. What mighty events
have arisen from that germ, which might once have been sup
posed to be lost for ever in the woods of America, but, thrown
upon the bosom of nature, the breath of God revived it, and
the world hath gathered its fruits !

   Even Ireland has contributed her share to the liberties of
America ; and while purblind statesmen were happy to get
rid of the stubborn Presbyterians of the north, they little
thought that they were serving a good cause in another quarter.
Yes, the volunteers of Ireland still live; they live across the
Atlantic Let this idea animate us in our sufferings; and may
the pure principles and genuine lustre of the British constitu
tion, reflected from their coasts, penetrate into our cells and
our dungeons.

   Farewell, great and good man ! great by your mental powers,
by your multiplied literary labours, but still greater by those
household virtues which form the only solid security for public
conduct, by those mild and gentle qualities which, far from
being averse to, are most frequently attended with severe and
inflexible patriotism, rising like an oak above a modest man
sion. Farewell ; but before you go, we beseech a portion of

   " Muir, Skirving, and Margarott, and sheriffs officer, handcuffed, two

   " Farewell ! We may be starved, and you may fall by the civil sword ;

  The " sheriff's officer," (Grant,) having been convicted of forgery in
Scotland, his sentence of death had been commuted for transportation, by
the favour, as was understood, of Dundas (Lord Melville). I have met at
the captain's table, when dining with Mr Palmer, aboard the prison-hulk,
that plausible gentleman, Mr. Grant, who, as well as the captain of the hulk,
was probably obeying the directions of the higher powers, when tempting
their companions to some indiscretion, by proposing toasts the most un-
courtly, and daringly democratic. But a man must have been weak indeed,
not to have kept " the door of his lips" in such society.

  I had before observed symptoms of this state-crafr, so becoming the
ministerial artifice of Pitt and Dundas, on my first visit to Mr. Muir in
another prison-hulk, accompanied by that accomplished, but too soon lost,
learned advocate of freedom, Felix Vaughan. We there met Mr. Godwin,
who had lately presented to Mr. Muir his Political Justice, and whom the
captain of the hulk somewhat broadly complimented, by the information
that his mate was so fond of the work, that he would scarcely suffer the
volumes to go out of his possession.

  Mr. Palmer, as I have mentioned, (W. II. 2/3 ; XIV. 417, notes,) died in
1801, at Golam, one of the Ladrones, where he had been shipwrecked;
and imprisoned by the Spaniards, on his return from exile.

  A deserved tribute of respect to Mr. Palmer's memory was very lately
offered by his nephew, the present M. P. for Berks, on a public occasion.

faith.

   It is equally melancholy, that the most deservedly extolled
of civil constitutions should recur to similar modes of coercion,
and that hanging and burning are not now employed, princi
pally because measures, apparently milder, are considered as
more effectual. Farewell! Soon may you embrace your sons

Gentlemen,  Clapton, March 30, 1794.

Your affectionate address has given me much pleasure;

and I can assure you that the satisfaction you have received

from my lectures, has not exceeded that with which they

were delivered, and the discontinuance of them adds much to

the regret with which I leave this country. I have seldom

spent any time more agreeably to myself than in my Tuesday's

lectures on Histoiy, or my Saturday ones on Experimental

Philosophy. But this will be far short of the satisfaction I shall

receive from hearing that your characters and conduct in life

correspond to the advantages you enjoy in your education, in

hearing that you are virtuous and intelligent men, the friends

of religion and public liberty, an honour to your tutors, and a

blessing to your friends and the world. With every good

wish, I am, gentlemen, your affectionate tutor,f

very interesting recollections. Mr. Belsham, in the
biography of their common friend, has afforded me the
following valuable assistance towards describing the last
days of Dr. Priestley, in England, ere he retired from his
native land, for ever, yet fondly anticipating some occa
sion of return ; sed Deo aliter visum est.

   Though the venerable sufferer met with a few personal in
 sults at his first settlement at Clapton from some of the lowest
of the rabble, that spirit had entirely subsided; and had he
chosen to have remained at Hackney, it cannot be doubted
that he would have lived in equal security and tranquillity
with the rest of his fellow-citizens, admired, beloved, and re
vered, by a numerous, respectable, and continually increasing
circle of hearers, pupils, and friends. But the high spirit of
Dr. Priestley could not brook to hold his liberty and security
upon what appeared to him to be so precarious a tenure ; and
he therefore resolved to seek an asylum in a country where, if
civilization has not attained to so high a polish as in older
countries, thoughts and words and consciences are free ; and
no restraint is laid upon freedom of inquiry, latitude of dis
quisition, or openness of profession, upon the most important
subjects of religion or politics. It was not, however, without
much regret that this much-injured man bid adieu to his
native country, nor without indulging the fond hope that he
might eventually return and end his days in peace in the land
which gave him birth.
  On the 30th of March he delivered to a crowded auditory a
farewell discourse from Acts xx. 32. The subject of it was
the " Use of Christianity, especially in difficult times."*

  · Sec VV. XV. 552. I heard the previous sermon, delivered to a very

crowded audience, attracted, especially, as on preceding Sundays, by the
cariosity which the public prints had contributed to excite. Thus the
Oracle :

  " March 5. Dr. Priestley. Tbis gentleman, whose character and writings
have excited so much attention and curiosity, not only in his own country,
but throughout Europe, will this week embark for America.

  " At present there seems little communication of a literary kind between

22+ MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   Having finished what he had to say to his regular audience,
he closes his discourse with addressing a few hints of advice
to the numerous strangers which thronged to hear him upon
this interesting occasion. The introduction to this address is
most judicious and conciliatory. The peroration is beautiful
and appropriate, and strongly indicates the truly Christian
spirit of the venerable fugitive. " Whether then you come as
friends or as enemies, whether we shall ever see one another's
faces again or not, may God, whose providence is over all,
bless, preserve, and keep us ! Above all, may we be pre
served in the paths of virtue and piety, that we may have a
happy meeting in that world where error and prejudice will
be no more; where all the ground of the party distinctions
which subsist here will be taken away ; where every misun
derstanding will be cleared up, and the reign of truth and of
virtue will be for ever established !"

   Such was the posture of mind, such the dignity of spirit, of
this first of philosophers and of Christians, when taking leave
of a couutry whose reputation he had extended, and to whose
intellectual and moral improvement he had devoted his su
perior energies, but which, too little sensible of his pre-emi
nent worth, treated him with neglect, and refused redress to
his cruel and unmerited injuries; and, if she did not banish
from her shores the worthiest of her sons, at least denied him
that protection which is granted to the meanest subject of her
government, and which was essential to his security, and to

the two countries ; and we are, in a manner, ignorant of the state of the arts
and the productions of the press in America. The doctor, as a member of
two learned societies in England, and connected with some of their most
illustrious ornaments, will, it is to be hoped, establish a literary kind of
treaty, and interchange the improvements in philosophy and art of the new
world, in return for those of the old."

   " March 14. Dr. Priestley preaches his last sermon, previous to his de
parture for Philadelphia, on Sunday next, at Hackney."

   " March 17- Dr. Priestley retires to America, upon no political motives
whatever. He has too much philosophy to regard with uneasiness now the
political hurricane in which he was a sufferer. In America he will join a
 much-loved part of his family ; and apart from all contest, civil or religious,
 wind up a useful life with the meekness of a Christian, and the meditations
 of a philosopher."

          MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  995

the peaceable and successful pursuit of bis professional duties
and his philosophical inquiries. But the spirit of Christianity
carried him through all ; and Dr. Priestley, in the possession of
a good conscience, and in the exercise of the mild, forbearing,
forgiving spirit of the gospel, was more truly happy in his
mind, and more enviable in his exile, than the most violent of
his enemies and persecutors on their couches of preferment, or
their thrones of state.*

  My last interview with Dr. Priestley, two or three
days before his embarkation, was in London, at the
house of his friend, Mr. William Vaughan. He had, that
moriiing, been highly gratified by the presentation of a
handsome silver inkstand, on which I observed the fol
lowing inscription :

  To Joseph Priestley, LL. D., &c, on his departure into
exile, from a few Members of the University of Cambridge,
who regret that this expression of their esteem should be occa
sioned by the ingratitude of their country. f

 which I hare inserted, {supra, pp. 76, 81, J says,

   " The inscription was drawn up by our friend Tweddell, who, with me,
 waited on the doctor to present it to him."

  Mr. Godfrey Higgins, distinguished by his late learned works on Oriental
Antiquities, writing to me from " Skellow-Grange, Ferrybridge, May 4,
1818," says,

  "A few gentlemen of the University of Cambridge, of all ranks, justly
indignant that this great philosopher and most amiable man should be
banished his country by a Church-and-King mob, connived at, if not en
couraged by, the Government of that day, subscribed to purchase a piece of
plate, which was presented to him by William Frend, James Losh, the much
injured and lamented Tweddell, and myself.

recollect those of Edwards, LL. D., Sykes, Carrant, Grigby, Lister, Duval,
Smith, and Norlhmore.

   Dr. Priestley, I well remember, read to me, at the
same time, a pious and affectionate letter which he had
just received from William Skirving, one of the victims
of the ruthless Scottish law, who was then awaiting his
deportation* They were, personally, strangers, and their
theological creeds were, probably, not a little dissimilar.
But Mr. Skirving, who, as appeared from various pas

sages in the letter, was a diligent investigator of the pro
phetic Scriptures,f had been strongly attracted to some
of his correspondent's later speculations on that interest

ing subject.
   The preceding evening I had passed with Dr. Priest

ley, on the invitation of our common friends at Hackney*
once more to share his society, and to unite in the ex
 pressions of their affectionate farewell. Among those
 (a rapidly decreasing number) who still survive that

 parting, I am happy in the friendship and society of one
 who continues, and may he long continue, to interest and
 instruct the world. He has thus kindly favoured me with
 the recollection of his latest interview with Dr. Priestley :

 promised myself a very agreeable and improving intercourse, too soon
 interrupted by his departure on his travels, from which he never returned.
 He died at Athens, in 1799, aged 30, and was buried in the Temple of
 Theseus His Remains were published in 1815. See M. R. X. 612, 632. I
 have just read, in " the North American Review," (XXXIV. 93,) a saying of
 " Dr. Clarke, the traveller, that for the sake of Tweddell's society, he would
 have consented to black his shoes."

    · To New South Wales, where he died, not long after his arrival. I had
 an interview with this much-injured patriot in Newgate, when paying a parting
 visit to Mr. Muir. Over the fire-place of the apartment was the engraved
 portrait of Dr. Price, an appropriate genius loci, wherever Thomas Muir had
 sojourned, whether in a prison or a palace.

    f One of Mr. Skirving's letters, interspersed with scriptural allusions, was
 read by the prosecutors of Mr. Hardy, and drew from Lord Chief Justice
  Eyre the exclamation, " What does this mysterious man mean ? What is
  this tabernacle of righteousness, to be erected at once, without anarchy and
  confusion ?" Trial of Hardy, ( 1 794,) IV. 426. Perhaps, after all, " Gallio
  cared for none of these things."

My dear Sir,       St. James's Place, Feb. 25, 1832.

   No man, as you say, could be more amiable in his family
than Dr. Priestley, and he had his reward ; for no man could
be more beloved than he was there.

   I have, all my life, received delight from the works of the
great masters in painting ; but no picture of theirs ever affected
me half so much as a living one which I saw, a night or two
before his departure from this country. The way in which
his daughter hung over him, as he sat in his chair, I can never
forget. Though it is now near forty years ago, it is as present
to my mind as if it had been yesterday.

   The following is probably the last letter Dr. Priestley
wrote from Clapton. While thus bidding a final adieu
to the " plants of his hand, and children of his care," he
could not fail to indulge his " ruling passion,'' so often
discovered in the foregoing pages, a desire to advance the
most valuable interests of mankind by the religious in
struction of the rising generation :

The satisfaction I have received from your affectionate

address,* is only equalled by that which I have constantly

enjoyed in my attendance upon you in our lecture room ; and

this arose from my perceiving the real improvement you made

there, and the freedom of our conversations on subjects of such

importance as were continually before us. They are such as

are, indeed, most interesting to men, as rational and immortal

beings. The proper object of them was religious knowledge,

but I am most happy to find you fully sensible that the end of
all knowledge is practice, and the end of all religious know
ledge, religious and virtuous practice ; and that the benefit you
have received yourselves, you are desirous of extending to

others.
  To the satisfaction I have received from your improve

ment in knowledge, I therefore trust will be added the much
greater satisfaction that will occur to me from hearing of your
good and exemplary conduct in life, which will secure our
happy meeting in a state for which all instruction, and all the
discipline of this life, are intended to form us.

   Wherever I go, and whatever befals me, such accounts as
these will give me a pleasure of which nothing can deprive

me.

satisfaction from the lectures of my successor as you have
done from mine, provided you give equal attention to them, I
am, my young friends, your late affectionate pastor.*

Mr. Belsham says :

very deep impression upon a respectable and numerous audi

    The regret of Mr. Lindsey, on this final separation
from a friend, endeared to him by the most unreserved
intercourse, amidst the various fortunes of five-and-tvventy
years, cannot easily be overrated. His present anxieties
for his friend's personal safety were daily relieved by the
following communications:

To Rev. T. Lindsey.*

Dear Friend,                  Gravesend, April 7, 1794.

We were rather unexpectedly summoned by the captain to

be with him, here, at two o'clock in the afternoon yesterday, and

hence we met him, and all the company, expecting to sail

that evening. However, we are now actually about to take a

boat, and go to the ship, which lies at the Hope, about six

miles below this place.

, We spent an agreeable evening, all things considered, Mr.

Russell and Mr. Vaughan being of the party. The morning

is fine, but the wind is still west. When we get to the Downs

it is to be determined whether we go north, round Scotland,

or through the Channel. The Pegou sails at the same time,

and we hope to keep company.

Poor Sally is most affected, as Mr. Finch seems more deter

mined than ever not to follow us ; but she hopes that circum

stances may arise that will change his resolution. However,

that resolution will he governed by a will wiser than his or

ours; and this is my greatest consolation, especially in parting

with you and Mrs. Lindsey.

Trusting to Mr. Jones, who said he would take my thermo

meter to Gravesend himself, I shall be obliged to go without

it. I wish, however, you would see him, and desire him to

send it in Mr. Johnson's package, if it will bear that conveyance,

or else give it to Mr. Vaughan, who will send it by some pas

senger to New York or Philadelphia.

you please of any of my publications, and dispose of them as
you think proper.

   I shall write again from Deal, when the pilot leaves us.
Yours and Mrs. Lindsey's most affectionately.

   P. S. Give Mr. Russell copies of the two sermons and the
volume.*

              To the Same.

Dear Friend,                        Deal, April 9, 1794.

This I hope will be the last time that I shall write to you

from Old England. Yesterday we had a fair wind to carry us

off Margate. We lay to, the greatest part of the night, when a

fair wind sprung up to carry us, they say, within an hour of

Deal, by half-past eight, which it now is. Most of the pas

sengers yesterday were ill, my wife most of the day ; and I

did not wholly escape, though I am better than most of them.

To-day we seem to be all pretty well, just ready for breakfast.

The cabin passengers are only nine, and promise to be suffi

ciently agreeable, though almost all unknown to each other.

I have barely learned their names.

Mr. Lyon, who had but just time to speak to Mr. Russell on

the subject of our purchase of land, desires to have one share

with us, if the subscription be not full. He will be a valuable

associate, on account of his being an excellent farmer.

Our captain has just informed us, that if he falls in with the

fleet of merchantmen at Portsmouth, he will join them for the

sake of the convoy : if so, I will write from that place.

With my best wishes and prayers for our re-union, here or

hereafter, yours and Mrs. Lindsey's (in which my wife joins

me) most affectionately, t

              To the Same.

                            Friday evening, off Falmouth.

Dear Friend,                        [April 11, 1794.]

We came, in a very short time, opposite to the Start ; but

then, which was last night, the wind changed, and turned west,

so that on this account, and likewise apprehending a storm
from that quarter, we have just dropped anchor in Falmouth
road, where we shall stay till to-morrow morning, and then
sail or not, according as the wind shall be.

   On Wednesday evening we had a strong gale, which con
tinued all night, and part of the next day. This made all the
passengers very sick, and my wife and myself among them.
I could eat nothing till supper , but the next night was calm,
and we rose recruited, and all this day have been in very good
spirits, but much disappointed at not being able to proceed on
our voyage, when we had got further in three days, than the
captain says he got in three weeks and five days the last
voyage.

   We begin to be acquainted with all our cabin and many of
the steerage passengers, and like them very well. They are
all well-behaved, and good company. The only woman cabin
passenger is come from France, knows our friends there, and
seems well acquainted with the politics of the country.

  On the whole, I think we shall pass our time pretty well
during the voyage. I have much time for reading, and shall
be able to write. I am meditating a discourse on the causes of
infidelity, led to it by reflections on that of Mr. Cooper, and
other intelligent men.

  I think I shall nearly read my New Testament through,
before I get to New York, and I think I read it with more
satisfaction than ever. Unbelievers, I am confident, do not
read it, except with a predisposition to cavil.

  A person waits for our letters, and therefore I am, in haste,
yours and Mrs. Lindsey's most affectionately.*

  · Orig. MS. From Dr. Priestley's last communication, before his final

adieu to Europe, I cannot withhold the notice of an extraordinary assertion,
hy one who ought to have been better informed, that " the Royal Society
declined admitting him to their meetings, and that he was obliged to with
draw his name from its list of members." Encyclopedia Edinensis. By " Dr.
Brewster," (1830,) XVII. 154.

  The Royal Society of that day has been sufficiently discredited among
philosophic associations by the unworthy distinction of having seen the emi
gration and the decease of Priestley without an expression of regret for the
loss which science had sustained, or any grateful recollections of an illus-

   Among the papers of the late Rev. Robert Edward
Garnham, the intimate friend of Lindsey, and the occa
sional correspondent of Priestley,* were found trie fol
lowing lines :

          The savage, slavish Britain now no more
     Deserves this patriot's steps to print her shore.
     Despots and leagues and armies overthrown,
     France would exult to claim him for her own.
     Yet no 1 America, whose soul aspires
     To warm her sons with Europe's brightest fires ;
     Whose virtue, science, scorns a second prize,

     Ye storms, ye monsters, which the seas contain,
     Let him uninjured cross a placid main ;
     For never did your gentler breasts engage
     Passions so fell as sacerdotal rage.-f

   Mr. Coleridge, in his third Effusion, introduces the
second William Pitt as "yon dark scowler," who
had become " a foul apostate from his father's fame."
In the fourth Effusion, he returns to the Premier as " that
dark vizir," and thus appreciates the baneful influence of
Church and State, which so largely contributed to this
emigration :

                 Though rous'd by that dark Vizir, Riot rude
                 Have driv'n our Priestley o'er the ocean swell ;

triuus associate. Yet Dr. Brewster's story is evidently a fiction ; and such
a wrong as he has inadvertently supposed, even the church and the court,
in their unholy alliance, could scarcely have perpetrated. On the contrary.
Dr. Priestley's account of his latter relations with the Royal Society is well
known to have been perfectly correct. Sec supra, p. 119.

                 Calm io his halls of brightness he shall dwell ;
                 For lo ! Religion, at his strong behest,
                 Starts with mild anger from the Papal spell,
                 And flings to earth her tinsel glittering vest,
                 Her mitred state, and cumbrous pomp unholy ;
                 And Justice wakes to bid th' oppressor wail
                 Insulting aye the wrongs of patient Folly ;
                 And from her dark retreat by Wisdom won,
                 Meek Nature slowly lifts her matron veil
                 To smile with fondness on her gazing son.

  In his " Religious Musings, written on Christmas
Eve, 179+," the justly admired author resumes the
subject, and has thus afforded me an appropriate con
clusion of the present chapter. Nor, indeed, could
Priestley have been described more agreeably to him
self, or in a manner more becoming the distinction which
his talents and character had acquired, than as in the
train of Hartley, and amidst such an assemblage.

                                  The mighty dead
Rise to new life, whoe'er from earliest time
With conscious zeal had urg'd Love's wondrous plan,
Coadjutors of God. To Milton's trump
The odorous groves of earth, reparadis'd,
Unbosom their glad echoes : inly hush'd,
Adoring Newton his serener eye
Raises to heaven : and he, of mortal kind
Wisest, he first who mark'd the ideal tribes
Down the fine fibres from the sentient brain
Roll subtly surging. Pressing on his steps,
Lo ! Priestley there, patriot, and saint, and sage,
Whom that my fleshly eye hath never seen,
A childish pang of impotent regret
Hath thrill'd my heart. Him from his native land
Statesmen, blood-stain'd, and priests idolatrous,
Bv dark lies madd'ning the blind multitude,
Drove with vain hate : calm, pitying he retir'd,
And mus'd expectant on these promis'd years.*

Vinceret ant virtus nostra, aut sapientia, ccelo

At vos, o phocae immanes, rabidaeque procella:,

                                      (1794, 1795.)

   Mr. William Alltjm, writing from " New York,
June 6, 1794," to his friend, the late Rev. William
Richards, of Lynn, says,

   Your two letters were handed to me yesterday, and the day
before (the 4th) I had the high satisfaction of bringing Dr.
Priestley on shore.* He landed about five o'clock in the after
noon, and is received with a fervour of affection which no
king ever yet received, much less deserved.

   · " June 1. The Sansom, the ship in which Dr. Priestley embarked
from England, arrived at Sandy-Hook, where she waited for a pilot. Dr.
and Mrs. Priestley landed (the 4th) at the battery, in as private a manner as
possible, and went immediately to a lodging-house close by.

   " It was soon known through the city, and next morning the principal
inhabitants of New York came to pay their respects and congratulations ;
among others, Governor Clinton, Dr. Prevost, Bishop of New York ; Mr.
Osgood, late envoy to Great Britain ; the heads of the college, most of the
principal merchants, and deputations from the corporate body, and other
societies." See " An Excursion to the United States in the Summer of
1794. By Henry Wansey, F. A. S," Ed. 2, (1798,) pp. 71, 72.

  Dr. Priestley landed " a day too late" to meet a distinguished public
functionary, with whom, in Dr. Price's connexion, he had been formerly
well acquainted in England. Mr. Wansey mentions, " June 3, Mr. John
Adams, the Vice-president," having "just arrived from Philadelphia in the
stage." He adds,

   " Having a letter to deliver him from Dr. Priestley, I found him on board
the packet, just sailing for Boston. He is a stout, hale, well-looking man,
of grave deportment, and very plain in dress and person. He read the letter,
and requested me to inform the doctor that he should be glad to see him at
Boston, which he desired me to tell him he thought better calculated for
him than any other part of America, and that he would find himself very
well received if he should be inclined to settle there." Ibid. pp. 82, 240.

  I communicated to Dr. Foster that part of your letter re
specting Dr. Priestley. He intends to pay him a visit ; but
the Baptists, as a body, have not liberality enough to do it.
Several associated civil and political bodies have waited on
him ; and I have called a meeting of the English republicans
for that purpose.'

  The following letter, my friend Mr. Belsham very ob
ligingly placed at my disposal several years since, to serve
the present purpose. Mrs. Priestley has there agreeably
related various particulars of the passage from England,
which was unusually long, and of the reception which
Dr. Priestley and his family had found at New York :

Dear Sir,         New York, June 15, 1794.

I now sit down to fulfil my promise of writing to you, and

am happy to inform you that we are both very well, and much

pleased with New York, and the inhabitants, the little we

have seen of it.

Our voyage at times was very unpleasant, from the rough

ness of the weather ; but as variety is charming, we had all

that could well be experienced on board, but shipwreck and

famine. We had gales and squalls, and worked much of our

way against head-sea for three days. We passed mountains of

ice, larger than the captain had ever seen before ; and kept

watch two nights, fearing we might come too near some of

them. One day we saw water-spouts great part of the day.

I saw four at one time ; but, happy for us, they kept a proper

distance. We saw billows mountain-high, which by night

appeared all on fire, and sometimes by night we were illumed

around by the ship cutting her way through them.

One day we had a tremendous gale of wind, which took the

ship in full sail. This was a very awful sight, and made great

havoc with the sails, and carried away the top-sails. In this

gale, which lasted about half an hour with great violence, I

found myself more vexed than frightened, as I fancied it might

found among the papers of his friend Mr. Uichards.

have been much lessened by care. I cannot say that I ever
suffered much from fear, which I believe was owing to being
upon all these occasions fully employed by those who were
frightened, and various other things wherein any one may be
of use, if so disposed.

   Dr. P. bore the voyage much better than I expected. I had
prepared my mind for sickness, &c, but I was more severely
handled than the rest ; but at the end of three weeks I was able
to leave my bed, and recovered as well as I could expect, till
a few days before we got to land, when I felt as well as ever I
did in my life, and have been so ever since. -

   I wrote during the voyage thirty-two pages of large paper,
to send over, with all the occurrences that passed ; but now I
am got to land, it appears to me so trifling, though at the time
I wrote it I thought it might be entertaining, that I shall not
send it over.

   I have not much advice to give to such as make the voyage
as to what they should take out ; for my own part, if I must
take another voyage, I should lay in stores of what I could not
bear the sight of at land. As to mental provision, I would
wish every one to lay in a large store. Mine sufficed for my
self, but I had not the power to distribute it in the same man
ner as the eatables I took.

   I would recommend every one to have motives strong
enough to overbalance every inconvenience they meet with on
the voyage. I would also advise them to lay in a great stock
of patience ; and where so many are to be so long together in
so small a compass, they should make up their minds to bear
and forbear ; and I should think, for their own happiness,
they would wish to consult the good of those about them,
which would make them feel their own grievances less. 1
was hurt to see in general that none troubled themselves about
the sufferings of others.

   I like New York very much, and the people still more.
We have met with great civility from every body, and have
been in several large parties.* Dr. P. is wonderfully pleased

   * At one of these, a dinner-party, at Mr. Osgood's, Mr. Wansey says,

with every thing, and indeed I think he has great reason, from
the attentions paid him. I never felt myself more at home in
my life than since my arrival here ; nor have I seen any I am
more prejudiced in favour of, than Governor Clinton and his
family. Finding Dr. P. so much occupied, 1 went with my
daughter yesterday to spend the afternoon with them, and they
returned the visit this morning. Both he and Mrs. Clinton
seem excellent, worthy characters. We have been with the
first and most respectable people in the place, and much
pleased indeed with most we have seen, as you yourself would,
had you been with us. How I shall like Philadelphia, remains
to be tried, where we shall go as soon as we can possibly leave
this place. After we have staid a few days, we propose going
to Northumberland, to look about us there. At present, I can
say little about the country. Every thing has as yet been
pleasant and inviting. I have not yet seen Harry. He is at
Northumberland.

   It will give me great pleasure to hear from you. Give my
kind love to your sister. It will give me great satisfaction to
hear of her health and happiness, whether at present with
you, or at Exeter. I beg to be kindly remembered to all our
common friends, particularly Mr. Rickards's family. I often
think of you and my other friends, when I have time to think
at all ; but indeed we have been, and shall be for some time,
in a constant hurry, which must be an apology for this hasty
letter.

he met " Dr. and Mrs. Priestley, the Bishop of New York and his lady, M.
Genet, the late French ambassador, &c." He adds,

   " We had much interesting conversation after dinner, especially on po
litical subjects. I could not help remarking- that I was seated between the
Bishop and Dr. Priestley, the seat of war in England, but of peace and
civility here (no loaves and fishes in the way). When we retired to the
drawing-room for tea and coffee, conversation continued too interesting for
any one to propose cards, and about ten in the evening we separated."

   " Saturday, June 14." Mr. Wansey accompanied " Dr. and the two Mrs.
Priestleys to call on Dr. Prevost, the bishop, a pleasant, agreeable man, of
plain manners and good sense. No honours annexed to the office of
bishop in America. You neither address them as Lords, or Right Reverend
Fathers in God." Excursion, pp. 189, 190.

   Farewell, my dear Sir, and believe me your affectionate and
obliged friend,

                                                    Mary Priestley.*
   To Rev. T. Belsham,
 New College, Hackney.

   I now return to Dr. Priestley's Memoir, not without
a regret, of which, I trust, few readers will be insensible,
that it is for the last time. Having carried on the ac
count of his publications till he " left England," he thus
proceeds :

  (210.) As the reasons for this step in my conduct are given
at large in the preface to my Fast Sermon, I shall not dwell
upon them here. The bigotry of the country in general made
it impossible for me to place my sons in it to any advantage.
William had been some time in France, and on the breaking
out of the troubles in that country he had embarked for Ame
rica, where his two brothers met him. My own situation, if
not hazardous, was become unpleasant, so that I thought my
removal would be of more service to the cause of truth than my
longer stay in England. At length, therefore, with the appro
bation of all my friends, without exception, but with great re
luctance on my own part, I came to that resolution, I being at
a time of life in which I could not expect much satisfaction as
to friends and society, comparable to that which I left, in which
the resumption of my philosophical pursuits must be attended
with great disadvantage, and in which success in my still more
favourite pursuit, the propagation of Uniterianism, was still
more uncertain. It was also painful to me to leave my daugh-
ter,f Mr. Finch having the greatest aversion to leave his rela
tions and friends in England.

    (211.) At the time of my leaving England, my son, in con
junction with Mr. Cooper, and other English emigrants, had a

scheme for a large settlement* for the friends of liberty in
general, near the head of the Susquehanna, in Pennsylvania;
and taking it for granted that it would be carried into effect,
after landing at New York, I went to Philadelphia, and thence
came to Northumberland, a town the nearest to the proposed
settlement, thinking to reside there until some progress had
been made in it. The settlement was given up;f but being
here, and my wife and myself liking the place, I have deter
mined to take up my residence here, though subject to many
disadvantages. Philadelphia was excessively expensive, and
this comparatively a cheap place ; and my sons, settling in the
neighbourhood, will be less exposed to temptation, and more
likely to form habits of sobriety and industry. They will also
be settled at much less expense than in or near a large town-
We hope, after some time, to be joined by a few of our friends

   * In which, Mr. Priestley says, his father " had not, as erroneously re
ported, the least concern, nor was consulted in the formation of the plan."
Continuation.

  t " The scheme of settlement," says Mr. Priestley, " was not confined to
any particular class or character of men, religious or political. It was set
on foot to he, as it were, a rallying-point .for the English, who were at that
time emigrating to America in great numbers, and who, it was thought,
would be more happy in society of the kind they bad been accustomed to,
than they would be dispersed, as they now are, through the whole of the
United States. It was farther thought, that by the union of industry and
capital, the wilderness would soon become cultivated, and equal to any other
part of the country in every thing necessary to the enjoyment of life. To
promote this as much as possible, the original projectors of that scheme
reserved only a few shares for themselves, for which they paid the same as
those who had no trouble or expense either in forming the plan, or carrying
it into execution. This they did with a view to take away all source of
jealousy, and to increase the facility of settlement, by increasing the pro
portion of settlers to the quantity of land to be settled.

  " Fortunately for the original proposers, the scheme was abandoned. It
might and would have answered in a pecuniary point of view, as the land
now [1804] sells at double and treble the price then asked for it, without
the advantages which that settlement would have given rise to ; but the
generality of Englishmen come to this country with such erroneous ideas,
and, unless previously accustomed to a life of labour, are so ill qualified to
commence cultivation in a wilderness, that the projectors would most pro
bably have been subject to still more unfounded abuse than they have been,
for their well-meant endeavours to promote the interests of their coun-
trymcu." Ibid.

from England, that a readier communication will be opened
with Philadelphia, and that the place will improve, and be
come more eligible in other respects.

   (212.) When I was. at sea, I wrote some " Observations on
the Cause of the present Prevalence of Infidelity," which I
published, and prefixed to a new edition of the " Letters to the
Philosophers and Politicians of France." I have also published
my " Fast and Farewell Sermons," and my " Small Tracts"
in defence of Unitarianism ; also a " Continuation of those
Letters," and a " Third Part of Letters to a Philosophical
Unbeliever," in answer to " Mr. Paine's Age of Reason."

have much enlarged, and intend soon to print ; but I am chiefly
employed on the continuation of my " History of the Christian

   Thus finally concludes, as I had occasion to remark
at the commencement of this second volume, that most
interesting portion of the first, Dr. Priestley's auto
biography. I shall now proceed to arrange and illustrate
his remaining correspondence, continued till within a
few days of his decaase. The early part will strikingly
display his honourable reception in the new world, for
which, more than a century ago, the benevolent and pre
saging mind of Berkeley, to whom an episcopate could
add no renown, had anticipated a condition of society,

                 Where nature guides, and virtue rules,
                 Where men shall not impose for truth and sense

From the Committee of the Tammany Society.

     A numerous body of freemen, who associate to cultivate
  among them the love of liberty, and the enjoyment of the happy
  republican government under which they live, and who, for
  several years, have been known in this city by the name of
  Tammany Society, have deputed us a committee, to express to
  you their pleasure and congratulations on your safe arrival in
  this country. Their venerable ancestors escaped, as you have
 done, from the persecutions of intolerance, bigotry, and des
  potism ; and they would deem themselves an unworthy pro
 geny were they not highly interested in your safety and hap
 piness.

    It is not alone because your various useful publications
 evince a life devoted to literature, and the industrious pursuit
 of knowledge ; not only because your numerous discoveries in
 nature are so efficient to the progression of human happiness;
 but they have long known you to be the friend of mankind ;
 and, in defiance of calumny and malice, an asserter of the
 rights of conscience, and the champion of civil and religious
 liberty.

   They have learned, with regret and indignation, the aban
 doned proceedings of those spoilers who destroyed your house
and goods, ruined your philosophical apparatus and library,
committed to the flames your manuscripts, pryed into the se
crets of your private papers, and, in their barbarian fury, put
your life itself in danger. They heard you also, with exalted
benevolence, return unto them " blessings for curses ;" and while
you thus exemplified the undaunted integrity of the patriot,
the mild and forbearing virtues of the Christian, they hailed
you victor in this magnanimous triumph over your enemies.

   You have fled from the rude arm of violence, from the
flames of bigotry, from the rod of lawless power ; and you
shall find refuge in the bosom of freedom, of peace, and of
Americans.

   You have left your native land, a country doubtless ever
dear to you ; a country for whose improvement in virtue and
knowledge you have long disinterestedly laboured ; for which
its rewards are ingratitude, injustice, and banishment; a coun-

try, although now presenting a prospect frightful to the eye of
humanity, yet once the nurse of science, of arts, of heroes, and
of freemen; a country which, although at present apparently
self-devoted to destruction, we fondly hope may yet tread back
the steps of infamy and ruin, and once more rise conspicuous
among the free nations of the earth.

   In this advanced period of your life, when nature demands
the sweets of tranquillity, you have been constrained to en
counter the tempestuous deep, to risk disappointed prospects
in a foreign land, to give up the satisfaction of domestic quiet,
to tear yourself from the friends of your youth, from a nume
rous acquaintance who revere and love you, and will long de
plore your loss.

   We enter, Sir, with emotion and sympathy into the nume
rous sacrifices you must have made to an undertaking which so
eminently exhibits our country as an asylum for the persecuted
and oppressed, and into those regretful sensibilities your heart
experienced when the shores of your native land were lessening
to your view.

   Alive to the impressions of this occasion, we give you a
warm and hearty welcome into these United States ; we trust a
country worthy of you, where Providence has unfolded a scene
as new as it is august, as felicitating as it is unexampled. The
enjoyment of liberty, with but one disgraceful exception, per
vades every class of citizens. A catholic and sincere spirit of
toleration regulates society, which rises into zeal when the
sacred rights of humanity are invaded. And there exists a
sentiment of free and candid inquiry, which disdains the
shackles of tradition, promising a rich harvest of improvement,
and the glorious triumph of truth.

    We hope, Sir, that the great Being, whose laws and works
you have made the study of your life, will smile upon and bless
you, restore you to every domestic and philosophical enjoy
 ment, prosper you in every undertaking beneficial to mankind,
 render you, as you have been of your own, the ornament of
 this country, and crown you at last with immortal felicity and
 honour.*

To the Members of the Tammany Society.

Gentlemen,                         New York, June 5, 1794.

I think myself greatly honoured, flying, as I do, from ill-

treatment in my native country, on account of my attachment

to the cause of civil and religious liberty, to be received with

the congratulations of " a society of freemen, associated to cul-

vate the love of liberty, and the enjoyment of a happy repub

lican government,"

Happy would our venerable ancestors, as you justly call

them, have been to have found America such a retreat for

them as it is to me, when they were driven hither ; but happy

has it proved to me, and happy will it be for the world, that,

in the wise and benevolent order of Providence, abuses of

power are ever destructive of itself, and favourable to liberty.

Their strenuous exertions, and yours, now give me that asylum

which, at my time of life, is peculiarly grateful to me, who

only wish to continue, unmolested, those pursuits of various

literature, to which, without having ever entered into any poli

tical connexions, my life has been devoted.

I join you in viewing, with regret, the unfavourable prospect

of Great Britain, formerly, as you say, the nurse of science

and of freemen ; and wish, with you, that the unhappy delu

sion that country is now under may soon vanish, and that,

whatever be the form of its government, it may vie with this

country in every thing that is favourable to the best interests

of mankind, and join with you in removing that only disgrace

ful circumstance, which you justly acknowledge to be an ex

ception to the enjoyment of equal liberty among yourselves.

That the great Being, whose providence extends alike to all

the human race, and to whose disposal I cheerfully commit

myself, may establish whatever is good, and remove whatever

is imperfect from your government, and from every govern

ment in the known world, is the earnest prayer of, gentlemen,

your respectful, humble servant.*

          To Rev. T. Lindsey.*

Dear Friend,  New York, June 6, 1794.

I hope you received the letters I wrote from Gravesend,

Deal, and Falmouth. I now write from New York, where we

are safely arrived, after a passage of eight weeks and a day,

owing to our having had none but westerly winds, after we

got clear of the channel, till the last fortnight. We also found

the coast covered with a thick fog, very unusual at this time

of the year, so that we were three days before we could get

into the bay, after we reached the coast.

We had an excellent ship ; but the captain was not the man

he had been represented to me. He swore much, and was

given to liquor, and the crew very disorderly. However, he

made a point of behaving in his best manner to us, and is

naturally very generous and good-natured. Unfortunately, the

mate and he did not agree, and no care had been taken of the

water casks, so that the steerage passengers suffered much

in consequence of it, and we had many complaints ; and if the

voyage had been longer, the consequences might have been

serious.

Our society in the cabin was agreeable enough, though the

majority were aristocratically inclined ; but all in the steerage

were zealous republicans, and persons of good character, and

several of good property. In the steerage, also, there was

more religion than in the cabin, but they were universally

Calvinists, though the majority very moderate, as you will

suppose from their applying to me to perform divine service

to them, which I did with much satisfaction, when the wea

ther and other circumstances would permit, several in the

cabin joining us, though some of them were unbelievers, but

for want of information. This is the case with Mr. Lyon, a

most excellent man, who is now reading my Sermons on the

Evidences of Revelation, and, I hope, to good purpose. He,

address, and his answer thereto, and that the first opportunity had been taken
to wait on him, agreeable to their direction, the society resolved, unani
mously, the publication of their report." Ibid. p. 12.

 like thousands of others, told me that he was so much dis
 gusted with the doctrines of the Church of England, especially
 the Trinity, that he considered the whole business as an im
 position, without farther inquiry.

    The confinement in the ship would not have been disagree
 able if I could have written with convenience, but I could do
 little more than read. I read the whole of the Greek Testa
 ment, and the Hebrew Bible as far as the first Book of Samuel ;
 and, I think, with more satisfaction than ever. 1 also read
 through Hartley's second volume, and, for amusement, I had
 several books of voyages, and Ovid's Metamorphoses, which I
 read through. I always admired his Latin versification. If I
 had a Virgil, I should have read him through, too. I read a
great deal of Buchanan's poems, and some of Petrarch de reme-
diis, and Erasmus's Dialogues ; also Peter Pindar's poems,
which Mr. Lyon had with him, and which pleased me much
 more than I expected. He is Paine in verse. Though it was
particularly inconvenient to write long hand, I composed about
as much as will make two sermons on the causes of infidelity,
which will make a proper addition to the volume of my dis
courses. If 1 do not print them here, I will send you a copy.
Now that I have access to the first volume of Hartley, in the
fine edition Mrs. Lindsey gave me, I think I can improve what
I wrote. The second volume I had in the ship, was an odd
volume of the set that was destroyed in the riot.

   We had many things to amuse us on the passage; as the
sight of some line mountains of ice; water-spouts, which are
very uncommon in those seas ; flying fishes, porpoises, whales,
and sharks, of which we caught one; luminous sea-water, &c
I also amused myself with trying the heat of the water at
different depths, and made other observations, which suggest
various experiments, which I shall prosecute whenever I get
my apparatus at liberty. We had some very stormy weather,
and one gust of wind as sudden and violent as, perhaps, was
ever known. If it had not been for the passengers, many of
the sails had been lost.

   I had not much sea-sickness; but, owing to our wretched

246 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

cookery, had no appetite for any thing, till within a fortnight
or three weeks of our landing ; but then I was perfectly recon
ciled to every thing. My wife was really very ill a great part
of the time ; but at last grew very well, and looks better,
almost, than ever. On the whole, the voyage has done us no
harm, but good.

   Joseph and his wife had been waiting for us some time ;
they and their brothers very well, which is a great satisfaction
to us. We shall probably go with them to Philadelphia, before
we go any where else, as I hear there are proposals to be made
to me about establishing a new college in some part of Penn
sylvania, about which you shall hear more when I know more.

   I never saw any place that I liked so well as New York. It
far exceeds my expectations, and my reception is too flatter
ing, no form of respect being omitted. I have received two
formal addresses, to which I have given answers. More, I
hear, are coming ; and almost every person of the least conse
quence in the place, has been, or is coming, to call upon me.
This is rather troublesome ; but it shews the difference of
the two countries. Every thing that bore the name of king
or queen is changed, as streets, &c, &c ; and yet this is the
most aristocratical place on the continent. I am lodged in the
house which was the head-quarters of generals Howe and
Clinton, in view of the bay, which is the finest prospect that I
remember ever to have seen.

   This must be a glorious country,* and I doubt not of finding
a peaceable and useful establishment in it. When that is
accomplished, my only wish will be to have you, and a few
other Christian friends, to come and end their days with us.
 But we must not promise ourselves too much in this world.

   Say for me every thing that a grateful heart can dictate,
 both from myself, my wife, and my son, to Mrs. Rayner.

  From the Committee of the Democratic Society.

       Sir,
    We are appointed by the Democratic Society of the city of
 New York, a committee to congratulate you on your arrival
 in this country; and we feel the most lively pleasure in bidding
you a hearty welcome to these shores of liberty and equality.
    While the arm of tyranny is extended in most of the nations
of the world to crush the spirit of liberty, and bind in chains
the bodies and minds of men, we acknowledge with ardent
gratitude to the great Parent of the universe, our singular
felicity in living in a land where reason has successfully tri
umphed over the artificial distinctions of European policy and
bigotry, and where the law equally protects the virtuous citizen
of every description and persuasion.
   On this occasion we cannot but observe that we once esteemed
ourselves happy in the relation that subsisted between us and
the government of Great Britain ; but the multiplied oppres
sions which characterize that government, excite in us the
most painful sensations, and exhibit a spectacle as disgusting
in itself as dishonourable to the British name.
   The governments of the old world present to us one huge
mass of intrigue, corruption, and despotism. Most of them
are now basely combined to prevent the establishment of
liberty in France, and to effect the total destruction of the
rights of man. Under these afflicting circumstances, we re
joice that America opens her arms to receive, with fraternal
affection, the friend of liberty and human happiness, and that
here he may enjoy the best blessings of civilized society.
   We sincerely sympathize with you in all that you have
suffered ; and we consider the persecution with which you
have been pursued by a venal court, and an imperious, uncha
ritable priesthood, as an illustrious proof of your personal
merit, and a lasting reproach to that government, from the
grasp of whose tyranny you are so happily removed.
   Accept, Sir, of the sincere and best wishes of the society

248 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

whom we represent, for the continuance of your health, and
the increase of your individual and domestic happiness.*

To the Members of the Democratic Society.

Gentlemen,                           New York, June 6, 1794.

Viewing with the deepest concern, as you do, the prospect

that is now exhibited in Europe, those troubles which are the

natural offspring of their forms of government, originating, in

deed, in the spirit of liberty, but gradually degenerating into

tyrannies equally degrading to the rulers and the ruled, I

rejoice in finding an asylum from persecution in a country in

which these abuses have come to a natural termination, and

have produced another system of liberty, founded on such wise

principles as, I trust, will guard it against all future abuses ;

those artificial distinctions in society, from which they sprung,

being completely eradicated, that protection from violence

which laws and government promise in all countries, but

which I have not found in my own, I doubt not I shall find

with you, though I cannot promise to be a better subject of

this government than my whole conduct will evince that I

have been to that of Great Britain.

Justly, however, as I think I may complain of the treatment

I have met with in England, I sincerely wish her prosperity ;

and from the good-will I bear, both to that country and this, I

ardently wish that all former animosities may be forgotten,

and that a perpetual friendship may subsist between them.f

                               From Senex.

      Sir, Philadelphia, June, 1794.
  A stranger arrived in a new country, with whose opinions,
habits, &c, he has but that imperfect acquaintance which is
formed by literary correspondence, will be safer by preserving
a respectful distance from, than by an intimate union with, any
party, who may step forward and endeavour, by a flattering
address, to prepossess his mind in their favour.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  249

   Your answer to the Address of the Democratic Society of
New York is modest and decent ; it conveys ideas of peace
and harmony with all the world ; but differing from their ex
pectations : they hoped to have found in you the enemy of
those who had persecuted you ; they trusted that you were,
like themselves, unable to forget wrongs; that because you had
written and preached in favour of the unity of the Deity, you,
therefore, (with them,) were averse to the principles of Chris
tianity, inculcated in the sermon of Jesus Christ. (Matt. v.
9, 11, 12.)

   Your answer to them convinces a number of your friends
that they were and are mistaken in their ideas of your resent
ment. There are few men in America who will not be happy
in the acquaintance of a person distinguished as you are by
your researches in philosophy, and the moderation of your in
quiries into moral, natural, and revealed religion.

   You will reap in this western world a temporal enjoyment
of a well-earned reputation, if you preserve yourself from all
party spirit. But, Sir, you are in danger; a party is endeavour
ing to make a merit to themselves of your weight and influ
ence. Beware, Sir, of casting it into the scale on either side ;
preserve it for the good of mankind by your guarded conduct ;
and let us, who have only heard from a distance, see that your
virtues are truly Christian ; that though you express doubts of
the divinity of our Saviour, you believe the divine message
itself; and that persecuted in one city you flee to another, and
that only for peace and repose.

   Be assured, Sir, that there is no persecution here against
opinions, and that, however different yours may be from that
of the majority, you may write, print, or preach them, without
danger of persecution of any kind; and that while we are in
structed by those parts of your doctrines which with freedom
we imbibe, we shall never be angry because we cannot sub
scribe to those we reject, nor yet suspect you of being dis
pleased for the exercise of our free will.

dustry in the pursuit of knowledge useful to mankind, will

 duct, by coalescing with any party whatever, you will certainly
 diminish your fame, as much as the opposite party is pro|x>r-
 tioned to that which you shall adopt, and sink the great and
 well-earned reputation of your long life.*

                 From the Associated Teachers.

       Sir,
    The Associated Teachers in the City of New York, beg
 leave to offer you a sincere and hearty welcome to this land of
tranquillity and freedom.
   Impressed with the idea of the real importance of so valu
able an acquisition to the growing interests of science and
literature in this country, we are particularly happy that the
honour of your first reception has fallen to this State, and to
the City of New York.
   As labourers in those fields which you have occupied with
the most distinguished eminence, the arduous and important
task of cultivating the human mind, we contemplate, with
peculiar satisfaction, the auspicious influence which your per
sonal residence in this country will add to that of your highly-
valuable scientific and literary productions, by which we have
already been materially benefited.
   We beg leave to anticipate the happiness of sharing, in some
degree, that patronage of science and literature which it has
ever been your delight to afford. This will give facility to
our exertions; direct and encourage us in our arduous employ
ments ; assist us to form the man, and thereby give efficacy to
the diffusion of useful knowledge.
   Our most ardent wishes attend you, good Sir, that you may
find, in this land of virtuous simplicity, a happy recess from
the intriguing politics and vitiating refinements of the European
world ; that your patriotic virtues may add to the vigour of
our happy constitution, and that the blessings of this country
may be abundantly remunerated into your person and your
family.
   And we rejoice in believing that the Parent of Nature, by

those secret communications of happiness with which he uever
fails to reward the virtuous mind, will here convey to you that
consolation, support, and joy, which are independent of local
circumstances, and which " the world can neither give nor
take away."*

                To the Associated Teachers.

     Gentlemen,
  A welcome to this country, from my fellow-labourers in
the instruction of youth, is, I assure you, peculiarly grateful
to me.
  Classes of men, as well as individuals, are apt to form too
high ideas of their own importance ; but, certainly, one of the
most important is that which contributes so much as ours do
to the communication of useful knowledge, as forming the cha
racters of men; thereby fitting them for their several stations in
society. In some form or other, this has been my employment
and delight ; and my principal object in flying for an asylum
to this country, " a land," as I hope you justly term it, " of vir
tuous simplicity, and a recess from the intriguing politics and
vicious refinements of the European world," is, that I may,
without molestation, pursue my favourite studies. And, if I had
an opportunity of making choice of an employment for what
remains of active exertion in life, it would be one in which I
should, as I hope I have hitherto done, contribute, with you,
to advance the cause of science, of virtue, and of religion. f

satisfaction, the opportunity which your arrival in this city

presents, of bearing our testimony to your character and virtues,
and of expressing our joy that you come among us in circum
stances of such good health and spirits.

  We have beheld, with the keenest sensibility, the unparalleled
persecutions which attended you in your native country, and
have sympathized with you, under all their variety and extent.
In the firm hope that you are now completely removed from
every species of intolerance, we most sincerely congratulate
you.

  After a fruitless opposition to a corrupt and tyrannical
government, many of us have, like you, sought freedom and
protection in the United States of America; but to this we
have all been principally induced from the full persuasion
that a republican representative government was not merely
best adapted to promote human happiness, but that it is the
only rational system worthy the wisdom of man to project, or
to which his reason should assent.

   Participating in the many blessings which the government
of this country is calculated to ensure, we are happy in giving
it this proof of our respectful attachment. We are only grieved
that a system of such beauty and excellence should be at all
tarnished by the existence of slavery in any form ;* but as
friends to the equal rights of man, we must be permitted to
say, that we wish these rights extended to every human being,
be his complexion what it may. We, however, look forward
with pleasing anticipation to a yet more perfect state of soci
ety; and from that love of liberty which forms so distinguish
ing a trait in the American character, are taught to hope this
last, this worst disgrace to a free government, will, finally and
for ever, be done away.

   While we look back on our native country with emotions of
pity and indignation at the outrages which humanity has sus-

tained in the person of the virtuous Muir and his patriotic

countrymen have fallen, we desire to be thankful to the great
Author of our being that we are in America, and that it has
pleased him in his wise providence to make the United States
an asylum, not only from the immediate tyranny of the British
government, but also from those impending calamities which
its increasing despotism, and multiplied iniquities, must infalli
bly bring down on a deluded and oppressed people.

continuance of your health and happiness.*

                                  Ireland.

Gentlemen,            New York, June 13, 1794.

I think myself peculiarly happy in finding in this country

so many persons of sentiments similar to my own, some of

whom have probably left Great Britain or Ireland on the same

account, and to be so cheerfully welcomed by them on my

arrival. You have already had experience of the difference

between the governments of the two countries, and, I doubt

not, have seen sufficient reason to give the decided preference

that you do to that of this. There, all liberty of speech and

of the press, as far as politics are concerned, is at an end, and

the spirit of intolerance in matters of religion is almost as high

as in the times of the Stuarts. Here, having no countenance

from Government, whatever may remain of this spirit from the

ignorance and consequent bigotry of former times, it may be

expected soon to die away, and on all subjects whatever every

man enjoys the invaluable liberty of speaking and writing

whatever he pleases.

The wisdom and happiness of republican governments, and

the evils resulting from hereditary monarchical ones, cannot

appear in a stronger light to you than they do to me. We need

only look to the present state of Europe and of America to be
fully satisfied in this respect.

   The former will easily reform themselves; and among other
improvements, I am persuaded will be the removal of that
vestige of servitude to which you allude, as it so ill accords
with the spirit of equal liberty* from which the rest of the
system has flowed ; whereas no material reformation of the
many abuses to which the latter are subject, it is to be feared,
can be made without violence and confusion.

   I congratulate you, gentlemen, as you do me, on our arrival
in a country in which men who wish well to their fellow-citi
zens, and use their best endeavours to render them the most
important services, men who are an honour to human nature
and to any country, are in no danger of being treated like the
worst of felons, as is now the case in Great Britain.

   Happy should I think myself in joining with you in wel
coming to this country every friend of liberty who is exposed
to danger from the tyranny of the British Government, and
who, while they continue under it, must expect to share in
those calamities which its present infatuation must, sooner or
later, bring upon it. But let us all join in supplication to the
great Parent of the universe, that, for the sake of the many
excellent characters in our native country, its government
may be reformed, and the judgments impending over it pre
vented, f

To continue without fear of molestation, on account of any

sentiments, civil or religious, those pursuits which you are

sensible have for their object the advantage of all mankind,

We have now been here near a fortnight, and I begin to

expect to hear from you, which is the greatest satisfaction that

I expect in this country, but I sometimes think that every

thing here is so promising, and every thing with you so threat

ening, that perhaps even you and Mrs. Lindsey may be in

duced to end your days with us. To accomplish this, I should

at any time come over and fetch you. Indeed, the difference

between the aspect of things here and with you is not to be

expressed. I feel as if I were in another world. I never be

fore could conceive how satisfactory it is to have the feeling

that I now have, from a sense of perfect security and liberty,
all men having equal rights and privileges, and speaking and
acting as if they were sensible of it. Here are no beggars to
be seen,* and families are easily maintained by any kind of
labour; and whether it be the effect of general liberty, or some
other cause, I find many more clever men, men capable of con
versing with propriety and fluency on all subjects relating to
government, than I have met with any where in England. I
have seen many of the members of Congress on their return
from it, and, without exception, they seem to be men of first-
rate ability, though some of them plain in their manners.

   With respect to myself, the difference is great indeed. In
England, I was an object of the greatest aversion to every
person connected with Government; whereas here, they are
those who shew me the most respect. With you, the episco
pal church is above every thing. In this city, it makes a de
cent figure, but the Presbyterians are much above them, and
the governor, (Clinton,) who is particularly attentive to me,
goes to the meeting-house.f

dread, J and none of them have asked me to preach in their pul-

and hospitable ; a great sobriety of manners ; equality exemplified in its true
sense ; nor do I once remember to have seen a beggar or a ragged person."

  f Where, " June. 1," Mr. Wansey " heard Dr. Rodgers preach, and
afterwards administer the Lord's supper. ' I invite,' says he, ' all of you
to partake ; but none,' lifting up his hand, and throwing his palm outwards,
towards Governor Clinton's seat, where the Priestleys were, ' no, none of
those who deny the divinity of our Saviour.' " Excursion, pp. 70, 71.

   \ " June 15. Being Trinity Sunday, the divines preached almost uni
versally in support of that doctrine. The famous interpolated text [1 John
v. 7] was not forgotten. At Trinity Church I heard Dr. Beach from
these words, ' Acquaint now thyself with God, and be at peace with him ;
thereby good shall come unto thee.' In a very personal manner he applied

 pits.* This, however, does them no good. Several persons
 express a wish to hear me, and are ashamed of the illiberality
 of the preachers; and some are avowed Unitarians, so that I
 am fully pursuaded an Unitarian minister of prudence and
 good sense might do very well here. If I were here a Sunday
 or two more I would make a beginning, and I intend to return
 for this purpose. The greatest difficulty arises from the in
 difference of liberal-minded men here to religion in general;
 they are so much occupied with commerce and politics. One
 man of proper spirit would be sufficient to establish a solid
 Unitarian interest, and I am persuaded it will soon be done.

   As I am much attended to, and my writings, which are in a
manner unknown here, begin to be inquired after, I will get
my small pamphlets immediately printed here, and wherever I
can get an invitation to preach, I will go. With this view, I
shall carefully avoid all the party-politics of the country, and
have no other objects besides religion and philosophy. Phila
delphia will be a more favourable situation than this, and there
I shall make a beginning. It will be better, however, to wait
a little time, and not shew much zeal at the first ; and as my
coming hither is much talked of, I shall reprint my Fast and
Farewell Sermons.

   Ab it may serve to amuse you and Mrs. Lindsey, I will in
close copies of some addresses and my answers, and also some
letters from persons who are of a party opposite to the ad
dressers, but equally friendly to me ; and I find I have given as
much satisfaction to them by the caution I have observed in
my answers, as to the addressers, who, however, I believe, are
now well satisfied that I do not openly join any of their so
cieties, though at first I am informed they were very desirous
of it.

numerous, especially in the country, though the others pre
vail in the towns, especially here. The people of Vermont, on
the one hand, and those of Kentucky on the other, can hardly
be restrained from falling on the English and Spanish settle

   The presidentship of a collegef in North Carolina is vacant,

and equitable constitution of government, in its practical influence, appears
to justify, from an American writer, contemplating " Reform in England,"

the following comparison :
   " Look at the United States. In fifty-seven years we have passed through

two wars, and great vicissitudes of domestic politics, and have nevertheless
paid off a public debt of nearly 200 millions of dollars, (forty millions of
pounds sterling,) grown up from three millions of inhabitants to thirteen,
and settled the continent for 1000 miles into the interior. This has our
tumultuous democracy achieved.

   " What has the stable monarchy of Great Britain done in the mean time ?
Quadrupled her debt. And for what purpose ? To put down the French
revolution. Is it down ? Look at its dtnouement in July 1830. To put
down the French revolution ! Every dollar spent by Great Britain in that
cause tended to assure its success. Such a policy, under a free representa
tion of the deliberate and intelligent sense of the people, could not have
been persevered in. It has entailed on England her present heritage of
embarrassment; and unless the reform of Parliament is followed by radical
changes in the system of government, in virtue of which it can be adminis
tered at half its present expense, nothing will have been gained towards
 satisfying the public mind." See " North American Review," Doston,
 (1832,) XXXIV. 65, 56.

    · According to Mr. Wansey, the " salaries to the legislature" were,
 " President, 25,000 dollars (5650/); Vice-President, 5000 dollars. (1125/.).
 Each senator, six dollars per day, and three more while travelling to and
 from Congress. Representative, six dollars per day; and the Speaker, twelve
 dollars." Excursion, p. 240.

 priate motto, utrum horum mavis accipe, the chief executives on the side of
 " Britain" are a " King," (long utterly incapacitated by a hopeless mental
 malady,) " 120,000/. ;" a " Prince Regent, 595,000/." From the whole
 detail, " it appears that the government expenses of England exceed those of
 America in the proportion of upwards of twenty to one;" while " the Ame
 ricans have no sinecure places ; or pensioners, except a few brave veterans,
 who fought to obtain and secure their independence ; and no internal taxes,

Gentlemen,  Philadelphia, June 21, 1794.

It is with peculiar satisfaction that [ receive the congratu

lations of my brethren of the Philosophical Society in this

city, on my arrival in this country. It is, in great part, for

the sake of pursuing our common studies without molestation,

though for the present, you will allow, with far less advantage,

that I left my native country and have come to America ; and

a society of philosophers who will have no objections to a

person on account of his political or religious sentiments, will

be as grateful as it will be new to me. My past conduct, I

hope, will shew that you may depend upon my zeal in promot

ing the valuable objects of your institution ; but you must not

flatter yourselves, or me, with supposing that at my time of

life, and with the inconvenience attending a new and uncertain

settlement, I can be of much service to it.

I am confident, however, from what I have already seen of

the spirit of the people of this country, that it will soon appear

that republican governments, in which every obstruction is

removed to the exertions of all kinds of talents, will be far

more favourable to science and the arts than any monarchical

government has ever been. The patronage to be met with

there is ever capricious, and as often employed to bear down
merit as to promote it,'having for its real object, not science, or
any thing useful to mankind, but the mere reputation of the
patron, who is seldom any judge of science; whereas a public,
which neither flatters, nor is to be flattered, will not fail, in
due time, to distinguish true merit, and to give every encou
ragement that is proper to be given in the case. Besides, by
opening, as you generously do, " an asylum to the persecuted
and oppressed of all climes," you will, in addition to your own
native stock, soon receive a large accession of every kind of
merit, philosophical not excepted, whereby you will do your
selves great honour, and secure the most permanent advantage
to the community.*

Dear Friend,                   Philadelphia, June 24, 1794.

This is my third letter to you. The last was by the Hope,

from New York. On Thursday last I arrived at this place.

Our journey was very pleasant, and the aspect of the country

better than I expected. J
  This city is by no means so agreeable as New York ; but

upon the whole more eligible than any other for my residence,
till our settlement be ready for me. With respect to religion,
things are exactly in the same state here as in New York.
Nobody asks me to preach, and I hear there is much jealousy
and dread of me,§ and on the whole I am not sorry for the

   § This "jealousy and dread" had not subsided, a few months later. Mr.

Bakewell, whom I had occasion to quote, (I. 208,) " arrived at Philadelphia

Nov. 1." He says,
  " I went several times to the Baptist meeting in Second Street, under the

care of Dr. Rogers. This man burst out, and bade the people beware, for
* a Priestley had entered the land ;' and then, crouching down in a wor
shiping attitude, exclaimed, ' Oh, Lamb of God ! how would they pluck thee

from thy throne !'                        _

" For this indecorous and unmanly conduct, Dr. Rogers was reprimanded

circumstance, as it offends many, who have on this account the
greater desire to hear me ; so that I have little doubt but that
I shall form a respectable Unitarian society in this place. The
alarm of the danger of Unitarianism has been sounded so long,
that it has ceased to be terrific to many, and I stand so well

in the public prints, and given to understand that such contumelious usage

ill became a member of the Philosophical Society. He seemed to feel the

impropriety he had been guilty of, and made an acknowledgment of his

error." M. R. I. 393, 394.

I cannot forbear, here to anticipate Dr. Priestley's later visits to Philadel

phia, that I may add the following interesting anecdote, from several com

municated to me by Mr. James Taylor, of Philadelphia, in 1825, while on a

visit to England. Mr. Taylor says,

" The first of these anecdotes was related to me a very few years ago

by the late Rev. William Rogers, D.D., a Baptist minister, whose sen

timents were highly Calvinistic, but who was strongly attached to Dr.

Priestley, and took pleasure in cultivating his acquaintance.

" The doctor, when in Philadelphia, would occasionally call on Dr. Rogers,

and without any formal invitation, pass an evening at his house. One after

noon he was there when Dr. Rogers was not at home, having been assured

by Mrs. Rogers that her husband would soon be there. Meanwhile, Mr.

, a Baptist minister, called on Dr. Rogers, and being a person of

rough manners, Mrs. R. was a good deal concerned lest he should say some

thing disrespectful to Dr. Priestley in case she introduced the Doctor to him.

At last, however, she ventured to announce Dr. P.'s name, who put out bis

hand ; but instead of taking it, the other immediately drew himself back,

saying, as if astonished to meet with Dr. P. in the house of one of his bre

thren, and afraid of being contaminated by having any social intercourse

with him, ' Dr. Joseph Priestley ! I can't be cordial.'

" It is easy to imagine that by this speech Mrs. Rogers was greatly em

barrassed. Dr. P. observing this, instantly relieved her by saying, and with

all that benevolent expression of countenance and pleasantness of manner

for which he was remarkable, ' Well, well, Madam, you and I can be cor

dial ; and as Dr. Rogers will be soon with us, Mr.             and he can con

verse together, so that we shall all be very comfortable.' Thus encouraged,

Mrs. Rogers asked Dr. Priestley some questions relative to the Scripture

prophecies, to which he made suitable replies; and before Dr. Rogers

arrived, Mr.  was listening with much attention, sometimes making

a remark, or putting a question. The evening was passed in the greatest

harmony, with no inclination on the part of Mr.          to terminate the

conversation. At last Dr. P., pulling out his watch, informed Mr.

that as it was ten o'clock, it was time that two old men like them were at

their quarters. The other at first was not willing to believe that Dr. P.'s

watch was accurate; but finding that it was correct, he took his leave with

apparent regret, observing, that he had never spent a shorter and more

with the country in other respects, that I dare say I shall have
a fair and candid hearing; and at my return from the Susque-
hannah, where I propose to go the next week, I believe some
place will be prepared for me. In the mean time I am print
ing an edition of my Appeal, and Trial of Elwall, which will
be ready, I am told, by the next Monday. Part of the im
pression will be sent to New York, where things are in as
great forwardness as here.

   If I do not greatly deceive myself, I see a great harvest open
ing upon me, and there is room for many labourers ; but it will
require great prudence and judgment at first. Also, those that
come must not be discouraged at first appearances, and be able
to support themselves, and at a greater expense than would be
necessary in England; and in New York, or here, greater than
in London itself. This unexpected expense makes a great
proportion of the emigrants repent of their coming, the women
especially, who do not easily find any society.

   Notwithstanding the flattering attention that is paid to me,
I cannot help sometimes regretting the society I had in England ;
but I am fully satisfied that I did right to leave it; and I firmly
believe that much good will be done here by my removal, and
in this I rejoice.

   An embargo was laid here on all shipping for England. I
fear that when this was heard of with you, an embargo would
also be laid on ships going from England to America, and that
this may be the reason why we have not yet heard from any
body, and indeed have had no news of any kind from England.
We must have patience, but we are very anxious to hear what
passes on the continent of Europe. Here, both the Indians
and the English are making encroachments; and if orders from
England do not stop those proceedings, a war will be inevitable,
and people in the back settlements are so eager for it, that they
can hardly be restrained even now.

pleasant evening. He then went away, Dr. P. accompanying him, until it
became necessary to separate. Next morning he called on his friend Dr.
Rogers, when he made the following frank and manly declaration : ' You
and I well know that Dr. Priestley is quite wrong in regard to his theology,
but, notwithstanding this, he is a great and good man, and I behaved to him
at our first coming together like a fool and a brute.' " Orig. MS.

266         MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   Since I wrote the former part of this letter, I have almost
determined to make my residence in Northumberland, and
spend a few months of the winter in this city. ThiB will, on
many accounts, be better than living chiefly here. The ex
pense will be prodigiously less. I shall have more leisure for
all my pursuits, and I shall be on the whole of as much use in
propagating Unitarianism as if I resided constantly in the
towns.* I see so great a certainty of planting Unitarianism on
this continent, that I wish you and Mr. Belsham would
look out for proper persons to establish in New York and
Philadelphia ; and to supply the college, which you may take
for granted will be established at the place of my residence.

   A place of worship is building here by a society who call
themselves Universalists.f They propose to leave it open to
any sect of Christians three days in the week ; but they want
money to finish it. My friends think to furnish them with
money, and engage the use of it for Sunday mornings. The
society itself, I hear, intend to apply to me to open it, which
I shall gladly do. A person with a proper spirit and prudence
may do great things here. I find I have great advantages, and
I hope to make a good use of them.

   I shall inclose an address to me from the Philosophical So
ciety in this place, which is the only one that I have received,
and also the preface to the American edition of my Appeal. J
Thompson superintends the office where it is printed §.

· Mr. Priestley says, " What had greater weight with him than any thing

else was, that my mother, who had been harassed in her mind ever since
the riots at Birmingham, thought that by living in the country, at a distance
from the cities, she should be more likely to obtain that quiet of which she
stood so much in need." Continuation.

  + Mr. Winchester, on his return from England this year, (1794,) became
the preacher. " His first introduction to Dr. Priestley," the late Mr. Titford
thus describes :

   " We went together to his house at Clapton ; he was not at home. Mrs.

Priestley said the Doctor wished much to see Mr. Winchester, and if we

would call at the Rev. Mr. Palmer's at Hackney, we should find him there.

We went, and were introduced to Mr. Palmer, Mr. Belsham, and Dr.

Priestley, who received Mr. Winchester in a most friendly manner." M. R.

           To Mr. Samuel Parker.

Dear Sir,             Philadelphia, June 27, 1704.

Your very obliging proposal to send me any philosophical

instrument that I had occasion for, when I last had the plea

sure of seeing you, emboldens me to request that, in addition

to the glass vessels with which your father has always been

so good as to supply me, you would be so good as to procure

me a M. De Luc's hygrometer. When I was at New York,

I saw one in the hands of Dr. Mitchell, professor of chemistry

in the college there, made by Mr. Blunt, which I liked very

much. Before the riots in Birmingham, I had one made by

M. De Luc himself,* and which he gave me. It is a most

valuable instrument.

As far as I have seen of this country, I think I shall like it

very well, and it promises to be a happy asylum during the

troubles in Europe. But there is a great drawback in the ex

pense of living here, which is higher than in London, the price

of every thing having been doubled the last two years. On

this account, and with a view to having more leisure, I think

I shall settle in the back part of this state, at Northumberland,

near the place where my sons are making their establishment.

I shall prefer the climate of this country to that of England

very much, especially as I hope that here I shall be able to

make much more use of the excellent burning lens with which

your father supplied me,f than I could ever have done in

England.

People here are very anxious about the result of Mr. Jay's

negociation.J They wish for peace, but are every where pre

paring for war, and in the back country hostilities seem to be

breaking out not only with the Indians, but with the British,

   X "About the middle of July, 1794, my father left Philadelphia for
Northumberland, a town situated at the confluence of the north-east and
west brunches of the Susquehannah, and about one hundred and thirty
miles north-west of Philadelphia." Mr. Priestley's Continuation.
   Mr. Dukewell, who arrived at Northumberland in the spring of 1795,
says, " On each side of the opposite shores of the two branches, the
mountains lift their towering heads, and preclude all prospect, but what
their barren sides afford. From thence, turning our eyes down the river
to the junction of its streams, which spread about a mile across, a sight, in
some degree romantic and of pleasing aspect, strikes the view.

   " At Northumberland, as in some other places in America which may
probably rise to eminence, a plot of ground of considerable extent was laid
out, divided into streets and building lots ; but, at the time I was there, it
did not contain more than a hundred houses. As a temporary residence,
Dr. Priestley bought a small house, and fitted it up decently for himself,
while one of considerable magnitude was building on a plot of land at the
upper part of the town, on the north branch of the river. This house was
very pleasantly situated, having two fronts ; one towards the street, and the
other towards the river, with a large garden and orchard." M. It. I. 505.

 beyond Jordan is used in the books of Moses, Joshua, and Judges.
 I was particularly struck with it in my late reading of the
 Hebrew Bible.

   I see every thing ripe for the propagation of Unitarianism
 in this city and New York, and I doubt not through this
continent in general. But the first missionaries must have
something else to depend upon for a subsistence, at least for some
time, and the expense of living is excessively high, and this
city would be to me very irksome. There is no such thing as
taking a walk half a mile from the town, or by the river side.
Excepting a square, adjoining to the State House, there is not,
in or near this city, any thing like a plantation, or anything else
calculated for the pleasure, I may say the health, of the inha
bitants. It is only a place for business, and to get money in.

   I am told, and I believe it, that if I were to reside here, and
open a course of lectures in chemistry, I should get money, and
be able to live here. But I think that upon the whole I shall
spend my time to better purpose if I live in the country, where
1 can have leisure for my pursuits, and spend a month or two
in the winter or spring in this city or New York, and this my
present funds will enable me to do. As to society, I am sure
I shall find enough at Northumberland ; but T am alarmed at
the difficulty and expense of getting all my packages thither.
There is no such thing as a made road in all this country, and
the shaking of their best carriages, at the best state of the roads,
is very great. But the next time that I write I shall be able
to give you a better account of them.

tion of my Appeal to the Professors of Christianity, with a
new preface.

   Since I wrote the above, I have been inclined to take a
house at Germantown, or within some miles' distance from this
city. I can then preach almost constantly, and remove my
apparatus, &c, with less trouble and expense ; but I cannot
determine till my return from Northumberland whither we
go on Friday next. The rain that fell lately made travelling
impossible on Tuesday.

many labourers will soon be wanted. Many attend no public
worship, merely because there is not any they can attend with
satisfaction; and the disposition to infidelity produced by this
circumstance, may, I am confident, be easily removed. I have
no doubt but that my coming will be of great use in this re
spect. When I return from the country, a place will be ready
for me ; and the ministers, seeing how I am received, cannot
conceal their alarm. They are, however, very civil.*

Dear Sir,    Northumberland, Aug. 27, 1794.

   I have had great satisfaction from the sight of your letter
by Mr. Davy. Living, as I do, at so great a distance from
England, and even from the coast of America, I cannot de
scribe the pleasure I receive from the letters of my friends in
England, nor the longing I sometimes feel for an interview
with them, especially Mr. Lindsey and yourself. I sometimes
wish I were with you, and sometimes that you were with me
here, and, as things now are, and I fear are like to be, I should
prefer the latter.

   I do not think there can be, in any part of the world, a
more delightful situation than this and the neighbourhood,

 and the conveniences of the place are improving daily. The
 climate I shall like much. The summer has been always tole
 rable, and, excepting not more than a week in all, most pleas
 ing, and all agree that the finest time of the year is now ap
 proaching : but finer weather than we have had the last fort
 night I never wish to see.

   I have just now fixed upon a spot on which to build a house,
 and could I but see you, Mr. and Mrs. Lindsey, and a few
 friends from England, in it, I should be too happy. I have,
 however, had a long and severe seasoning, and it is what all
 Europeans must expect, before they can recover from the in
conveniences of the voyage, and the difference of climate, mode
of living, &c ; but now I am in perfectly good health, and am
recovering my flesh and strength very fast ; and I am eagerly
setting to work, as much as my situation will admit; but I
cannot do much till I get my books and instruments from
Philadelphia.

  Several things in your letter I read with pain, but I am
above measure delighted with the account you give me of your
success in the continuation of the lectures to young persons.
Indeed, I had no doubt of its succeeding well in your hands,
and I cannot wish you to have more satisfaction in it than I
always experienced. At present, I have no opportunity of
doing any thing of the kind ; but I do not despair of it in time.

  A month or six weeks in the spring I intend to pass in Phi
ladelphia, where every thing is ready for a respectable Unita
rian society; as is the case at New York. I do not despair of
seeing a college on the most liberal principles established in
this place,* and sometimes I give a little more scope to my

institution, and he was appointed president. He, however, declined receiv
ing any emolument, and proposed giving such lectures as he was best quali
fied for, gratis, in the same manner as he had done at Hackney, and he
meant to have given to the institution the use of his library and apparatus,
until the students could have been furnished with them by means of the
funds of the college. In consequence of the failure of some of the principal
contributors, the scheme fell through at that time, and little more was done
during my father's life-time than to raise the shell of a convenient building."

Dear Friend,                   Northumberland, Sept. 14, 1794.

I am gratified with the receipt of a third letter from you,

dated June 6 ; and at the same time have heard that the

package from New York, containing the parcel and another

letter, is on its way to Philadelphia, so that I hope to receive

it soon.

Nothing can be more delightful, or more healthy, than this

place ; but, except the lawyers, all the people are wholly oc

cupied in getting a living; and though they have some reli

gion, they have much bigotry. If any of our friends should

settle here, we should build a place of worship for ourselves,

and, in time, others may join us.

  The professor of chemistry in the college of Philadelphia is
supposed to be on his death-bed. In case of a vacancy, Dr.
Rush thinks I shall be invited to succeed him. In this case, I
must reside four months in the year in Philadelphia ; and one
principal inducement with me to accept of it will be the
opportunity I shall have of forming an Unitarian congregation,
in which I foresee no great difficulty. But I feel myself much
weakened by something or other in this country, so as to have
much less ability for public speaking than I had in England.
When I preached here, I could hardly get through the service.
I am, however, stronger now than I was then, and exercise
might help me still more.

   I have had an invitation both to give a course of lectures,
and to form an Unitarian society at New York ; but it is too
far off to think of it. If I should be professor of chemistry
at Philadelphia, it is probable I shall reside somewhere nearer
to it than here. What brought me hither was the expectation
of its being near the settlement that my son and Mr. Cooper
were projecting, and behold that is all over.*

   I have transcribed for the press my answer to Mr. Paine,f

Since my last, I have received two of your letters, the very

sight of which gives me a satisfaction that I cannot express,

and could not have imagined beforehand.

The greatest inconvenience attending this situation is a want

of a ready communication with Philadelphia. There are no

stage-waggons ; and the only method of sending heavy goods

is by land in the waggons that carry corn to Middletown, on

the Susquehannah, and thence by water hither; and the water
is so low at this time of the year, that it is not navigable. It
is expected to rise a little towards the end of this month ; but
the best time for it is in the spring, and till midsummer ; but
then there are few waggons going to Middletown.

   Inconvenient as this circumstance and some others make a
residence in this place, I prefer it on the whole. Philadelphia
is unpleasant, unhealthy, and intolerably expensive ; and there
I should have little command of my time. Here I can com
mand the whole ; and when I get my books and instruments,
I hope to do as much as ever I have done. In the mean time, I
am not idle. I have some books, and every day do something
towards the continuation of my Church History. I shall finish
the next period, which will carry the History to the rise of
Mahometanism, in about a month, tasking myself every day.
My materials will not carry me much farther.

   I never read so much Hebrew as I have since I left
England. I have nearly finished all the Old Testament, and
1 never read it with so much satisfaction, especially the pro
phecies, which I am now attending to. I think I shall read
more or less of the Hebrew Bible as long as I live ; and shall,
when I get my Polyglots, and other helps, take much pleasure
in translating more than I undertook before. Having leisure
for miscellaneous reading, I have read almost the whole of
Tacitus,* which I had not done before, and I admire him
more than I expected. I shall read many of the best ancient
writers, especially the historians, when I get my library.

   I have nearly printed the Continuation of my Letters to the
Philosophers and Politicians of France, and to a Philosophical
Unbeliever ; the latter in answer to Mr. Paine's Age of Reason,
which is much read, and has made great impression here ; nor
will you wonder at it, when you consider what kind of Chris
tianity is preached here. I am told that the Quakers read it
with great avidity, and they have no knowledge at all of the
proper evidence of Christianity, or the doctrines of it. Many
of them, therefore in this country, either actually are, or are

   I told you that when f came hither, I was asked to preach at
the Presbyterian meeting-house ; but though I am sure I said
nothing which could give any Christian just offence, they never
asked me again,* and I have contented myself with reading a
sermon in my own house,f Yesterday, however, the officer
of a company of soldiers who are passing this way, requested
me to preach to them, and they got the use of the meeting
house, and some of the people of the place attended ; but little
can be done before I get a place to myself, which, if a few
persons from England join us, will soon be accomplished, es
pecially if the college be established here, and of this no doubt
is now entertained ;J and the person whose property the greatest
part of the town is, has consented to give the ground to build
it on. We therefore hope to have the buildings raised the next
year, and begin some business, when I hope to be of some use.
In the spring, however, I shall go to Philadelphia, and preach
a sermon, which I have already composed and transcribed,
from Acts xvii. 18--20 ;§ but I want your cool judgment in
this and all my other compositions. I feel myself as a ship

Dear Friend,            Northumberland, Nov. 12, 1794.

The uncertainty there must now be in the conveyance of

letters to England, is a most unpleasant and distressing circum

stance; but the stop that will be put, in a great measure, to

emigration, is more afflicting still.

We have been much affected by the capture of Mr. Russell,

when we were every day expecting to see him.* All that can

be done here to procure his release has been done ; and I hope

that in consequence of the representations that have been made

on the subject, it will sooner or later be effected. As soon as

I heard of it, I wrote to the French minister, with whom I

am acquainted, particularly to shew the connexion of his case

with my own, and the gratification that it would be to the

English ministry that such a person as Mr. Russell should

suffer as he has done.

cipal inhabitants, preached to the troops in the Presbyterian meeting,
(where he had once before preached,) on a general subject, but composed an
excellent prayer for the occasion, and was well attended to, though it is un
usual to hear preaching with notes.

   " Oct. 13. Dr. Priestley appears perfectly pleased with this situation ; and
having a printing press close by him, is a great satisfaction and entertainment.
He is now printing a Sequel to his Letters to the French Philosophers, and
an Answer to Panic's Age of Reason, a book much read in this country.
He is very anxious for the arrival here of his books and apparatus, and they
are coming by water, that he may resume his favourite studies ; but still
more anxious to get society, that he may again pursue his principal object,
by public instruction in a place of worship, and by lectures to youth, as well
as the establishment of a public seminary; and he declares that he would
happily engage in them, without any prospect of fee or pecuniary reward.

280 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   The power of the French at sea appears to us most astonish
ing, after their loss of so many ships of war. Indeed, the pre
sent state of things confounds all speculation. A new state of
things is certainly about to take place, and some important
prophecies, I believe, are about to be fulfilled. The late events,
and my continued attention to the prophecies, make me see
this in a stronger light than I did when J wrote my Fast Ser
mon.* Many more of the prophecies than I was then aware of
indicate the great destruction that will be made of mankind
before the restoration of the Jews. See particularly Is. xxiv.
26, &C, xxxiv. 60, 63, &c, lxiii. 6; Jer. xxv. 30, &c, xlvi.
28, li. 20. The destruction of kings seems to be particularly
mentioned, Is. xxiv. &c. I shall perhaps republish that ser
mon, with farther remarks, or write something larger on the
subject.

   I have made some important additions to my " Observations
on the Causes of Infidelity," and think to publish it as a se
parate tract. I hope you will receive with this some copies
of additional " Letters to the Philosophers and Politicians of
France." and my answer to Mr. Paine, which I find is well
received in this country. I shall soon print an edition on better
paper.

   I have just received an invitation to the professorship of
chemistry at Philadelphia, and for some time was determined
to accept of it, chiefly on account of the opportunity it would
give me of forming an Unitarian congregation in that city; but
when I considered that I must then pass four months of every
year from home, my heart failed me, and I declined it. If my
books and apparatus had been at Philadelphia, I might have
acted differently ; but part of them are now arrived here, and
the remainder I expect in a few days, and the expense and
risk of the conveyance of such things from Philadelphia hither
is so great, that I cannot think of taking them back. Besides,
there are many circumstances in favour of my residing in this
place. The situation is very pleasant ; the climate much better

than in or near Philadelphia. I can live at half the expense,
and I have much more leisure for my pursuits ; and in a year
or two, I doubt not, we shall have a college established here.*
As to Unitarianism, it is, I perceive, greatly promoted by my
coming hither, and the circulation of my publications, and pro
bably in a more effectual way than it would have been done
by my acting more openly. However, I shall have a place of
worship here, and shall prepare sermons for delivery at Phi

I propose to go as far as Boston.f

  I lately had a very distinct dream about meeting you and Mr.

You were not able to speak, and I only said, I am come to see
you, and when you know my reasons, you will not blame me;
when I awoke, and the pleasing illusion was no more. My great
consolation is in the consideration of an over-ruling Providence,
which has fixed me here, and I hope for some good purpose;
and whether more or less pleasing to myself, is not of much
consequence, considering the short time I can expect to live.

  Reading, as I now do, much about the monks, with a view
to my Church History, I often compare my situation with
theirs, and think that, remote as I live from the busy world,
my condition is greatly preferable to theirs, and especially that
my pursuits are more rational, and of course attended with
more satisfaction. In one thing, however, the effect, I fancy, is
the same, that it renders a man more indifferent about life.
I long to meet my most valued friends, and that, with respect
to many of them, can only be on the other side of the grave.
But to meet them to advantage, we must strenuously do all
the good we can on this side of it. Earnestly wishing to meet,
and never to be separated from, you and Mrs. Lindsey, I am
most affectionately yours.}:

282 MEM0IH8 OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

                   To Rev. T. Belsham*

Dear Sir,          Northumberland, Dec. 14, 1794.

I am indeed exceedingly shocked at your account of the

infidelity of Mr.  , especially after what £ had just

before read concerning him in a letter from Mr. Lindsey.

When I saw him, I spoke to him in confidence, as a Chris

tian brother, and particularly asked him whether it was true

that Mr.           had written any thing on the subject of

infidelity before he left England. I also expressed my great

.concern that he should have given up all thoughts of preach

ing, when he was so young and able, and told him that I had

recommended him to my friends in New York as an Unitarian

minister.

Nothing that he said on the occasion could have led me to

.suspect his change of sentiment, but I recollect a coldness and

reserve in his answers, which, though it did not strike me at

the time, very well agrees with your account of him. I also

thought that he avoided me, choosing to remain at Sunbury,

Tather than Northumberland, for the trifling reason that they

were better accommodated at the inn there.

Mr. -      was at my son's, and in a long conversation I

had with him in a walk, he, for the first time with me, avowed

himself an unbeliever, and I think on the weakest of all grounds,

viz. the want of sufficient authenticity of the books of scrip

ture, saying that Moses could not be the writer of Deute

ronomy, &c &c, when the great facts to be accounted for, viz.

the reception of the miracles at the time by persons indisposed

to receive them, are independent of the authenticity of any

particular books. To account for the belief of the Jews, he

only said it was in the power of priests to make the common

people believe any thing. This conversation led me to write

a section on the power of the Jewish and Christian priests,

which I shall add to the next edition of my "Causes of the

Prevalence of Infidelity." Never was any thing advanced

more at random, or with less colour from the state of facts.

  In this part of the country 1 find nothing but the extremes
of infidelity and bigoted orthodoxy. Whether I shall do any
good here I cannot tell. If I do, it will be slowly and silently.
But I have leisure for my pursuits, at least shall have when my
house is built, which, if all be well, will be in the course of the
next summer. Being set down here, and having got my books,
&c, about me, I cannot now remove again, and I hope it will
some time or other appear to have been for the best. It is a
pleasant and healthy spot, far preferable to any thing on or
near the coast, and from its situation must some time hence be
a considerable place. A college, I have little doubt, will be
fixed here, and I hope soon. I was invited in the most respect
ful manner* to accept of the chemical chair at the college in
Philadelphia,f and should have liked the employment, and
still more the opportunity it would have given me of opening
an Unitarian meeting ; but I must have spent four months of
every year, and that in winter, in Philadelphia. J

             To Rev. T. Lindsey.§

Dear Friend,                    Northumberland, Dec. 20, 1794.

I am always affected, more than I can express, by the sight

of your letters, and since my last I have received two, the latter

the first. With the other, received yesterday, came the various

packets in the box from New York, and' by other later con

veyances, which furnish a feast that will not be soon ex

hausted. I shall, I am confident, have much satisfaction in

reading Mr. Paley's work;|| but my son and daughter-in-law

have requested the first reading of it.

We have bought about 300 acres of the cheaper kind of land.

Harry Iras taken a fancy to it, and so he is to have it, and to

enter upon it next spring. It is yet to clear; but it is full of

good timber, which will almost pay for the clearing. The
purchase was not quite thirty shillings an acre.
. Though I am far from being so happy as I was at Hackney,
near you and Mr. Belsham, I have a tolerable prospect of being
more comfortable when I have got my house built ; but I fore
see much trouble, as well as expense, attending it. My in
struments must remain unpacked, at least in a great measure,
till then, and my books are chiefly in a barn and a garret, so
that it is not very easy to come at them all. In this respect,
however, I do pretty well, and by doing my different tasks
every day, have the satisfaction of thinking I do some busi
ness, without which I should have little enjoyment of life.

  I shall get well acquainted with the Hebrew Bible, a large
portion of which I read the first thing every morning, and
I give some hours every day to my Church History. The
great number of unbelievers here will keep up my attention to
the evidences of revelation, and I think I may perhaps add
another part to my Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever, on
the subject of prophecy. I like Bicheno's idea of the seven
thunders meaning the seven wars which have taken place
since the conquests of the Turks, but there is little else that I
admire in him. I have had some of the same thoughts that
Mr. Garnham has entertained ; but I cannot say that they give
me the same satisfaction that they do him, and I think he
hazards a great deal in foretelling the duration and the issue
of the present war against the French. I am endeavouring
to settle my opinion of the most probable interpretations of the
principal prophecies in Daniel and the Revelation, and when
I have done it, shall write to you more fully on the subject.
I have no satisfaction like that which attends the study of the
Scriptures.

  Since I wrote last, I have a prospect of being employed as a
preacher here. I have a service every Lord's day at my son's
house ; and several persons, the most respectable in the place,
have desired to attend, and even, I hear, talk of building a place
of worship for me. To this I shall contribute pretty largely
myself, and shall feel most happy in being so employed and
in instructing such young persons us will attend me but the

ignorance and the bigotry of the generality of people here is
very great. I believe I have gained their esteem, and shall
succeed the better in consequence of my having lain by for
some time, and not discovered too much zeal. I shall not fail
to inform you of the progress I may make in this business,
which I have most at heart. I hope, too, that we shall succeed
in establishing a college here ; but it will require some time to
do this.

   I have great pleasure in reading the Cambridge Intelligencer,
which you are so good as to send me. It is all the English
newspaper that I see. If I can forward it without expense,
I shall certainly send the packet to Mr. Toulmin ; but he is
as much out of the world to us as he is to you, and the post
is very tedious and expensive ; but we shall endeavour to get
it reduced by setting up a coach. We now depend on private
conveyance by travellers for small things, and large things
can only come at certain times of the year, except at an enor
mous price.

   I once thought of living at German Town, but, besides that
it is far from being a pleasant place, it is dearer living there
than in Philadelphia. Mr. Davy, who is there, is obliged to
buy even his fire-wood at Philadelphia, and that is almost ten
times as dear as it is here.

   We have hardly any frost yet, and there is a great flood in
the river. It was never before known to be so mild at this
late season. With all our best respects, yours and Mrs. Lind-
sey's most affectionately.

           To Mr. G. Clark.*

Dear Sir,  Northumberland, Dec. 22, 1794.

I thank you for your letter and poem, the sentiments of

which are excellent; and I thank you for the compliment you

have paid me ; but I think you write prose better than verse.

I fear, however, that neither prose nor verse will stop the

course of the war in which you are fatally engaged.

286 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   After seeing Mr. Cooper's book,* you cannot want any in
formation that I can give you respecting this country; and
knowing the facts, you must advise yourself. It is too hazard
ous for another to give it, especially where so much is depend
ing, as with you. I can only apprize you of one thing, of
which you may not perhaps be sufficiently aware, viz. that
much money will unavoidably be sunk in the passage, and
living in any manner here, till you have looked out for a farm ;
for I would not advise any person to take one without having
seen it himself. Two hundred pounds is the least that would
go in this way. Living in Philadelphia, or any of the great
towns, is more expensive than in London, and, with every
advantage, very irksome to a person accustomed to English
modes. To me the difference was much more than I was
aware of.

   But, supposing a person actually here, and willing to labour
in any way whatever, he will be twice as well off as in England.
He will find immediate employment, and good wages. We
could take all the servants, mechanics, and handicraftmen, that
England could furnish; but if a man or his family must live
without actual labour, he will starve. Farming will not answer,
if the labour be all hired. On this account, all farms are small,
sufficient to maintain families in abundance with necessaries,
but nothing more. All the money a man gets he employs in
speculation, chiefly now in buying land, with a view to selling
again, or in merchandise.

   If, on this view of things, you should think it worth your
while to come over, I should be very happy to have you near
me; but in this place there is no scope for farming, or at pre
sent any thing else, though some time hence I think this is so
situated as to promise considerable things with respect to traffic,
though the expense and trouble of getting hither is greater than
you can well imagine. I came with a view of being near a
large settlement of emigrants, which is now given up ; but being
here, and having all my books, &c, with me, I cannot remove
any more. Indeed, I had not the means of subsisting at Phila-

delphia, without more exertion than at my time of life I am
well capable of. Though my time here is far from passing so
agreeably as it did in England, I am very thankful for such an
asylum ; and all the accounts I have from England make me
more satisfied with my lot, though not a very enviable one.
In time, however, I hope to have some employment, in which
I may be once more useful and happy. With every good wish,
I am, dear Sir, yours sincerely.*

                    To Rbv. Samuel Palmer. t

     Dear Sir,
  I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing your son, though
I am in daily expectation of it. This is one inconvenience
attending my distance from Philadelphia; but then there are
many more than equivalent advantages in this country place.
It is not near so expensive, and much more healthy. Indeed, I
never saw a town I liked less than Philadelphia. My friends in
England wonder that I did not accept the offer of the professor
ship of chemistry in the university there ; but they cannot see
all the circumstances. I was at one time inclined to it, but it
was solely with a view to the forming of an Unitarian congre
gation there. And I still mean to spend about two months
there every winter, with that view, at least to deliver a set of
discourses on the evidences of Christianity, and other interest
ing subjects, and a place is provided for the purpose.
   Here, though I have little society, I have leisure for my pur
suits, and I endeavour to make the most of it. At present I
apply very closely to the continuation of my Church History,
which I hope to finish in about two years. It was late before
I got my books hither; and now I am crowded with all my
books and instruments in one room, though a large one. Some
thing, however, I contrive to do in my experiments, and I
have more advantages in this respect than you could easily
imagine in this remote place.| I want hardly any thing but a

glass bouse. As to any instruments of consequence, I must
have had them from England, had I lived in Philadelphia.

   I cannot just now find the letter you were so good as to
write to me, or I would answer it more particularly. I do
assure you 1 cannot help looking back with some regret on the
time I spent at Hackney, though I find every thing in this
country to exceed my expectations, and we have many capital
advantages that are nowhere else to be found--a free govern
ment, no church establishment, no tithe, no poor, and almost
no taxes, and a climate greatly indeed superior to yours.

   But I want my friends, and such society as I have been
accustomed to. We do, however, pretty well in this respect,
and hope to do better every year. I am expecting Mr. Russell
from France, and though I cannot expect that he will live
always here, he will probably reside here some part of the
year. Here we enjoy the great blessing of peace, which I ear
nestly wish you had. The treaty is generally disliked here,
so that many persons think it will not be ratified without so
many restrictions as will make it rejected by England. I
hope, however, there will be no war between the two coun
tries. It would be very hurtful to both. If there should be a
general peace, how happy should I be to pay you a visit before
I leave the world ! and sometimes I do not despair of this,
though I should probably find things so changed as to have
but little enjoyment of it. I therefore endeavour to look for
ward to a better and more permanent state of existence.
While we live, I shall always be glad to hear from you.

Dear Friend,         Northumberland, Jan. 19, 1795.

We are now in the depth of winter, the cold much greater

than ever I knew it in England. It has been 3 below 0 of

Fahrenheit. This morning I found it 1 below 0, and in the

night it had been 2, and yet it is much more tolerable than the

cold with you, and the day as pleasant as in summer. Till

the end of December the weather was quite mild and warm;

now the river is nearly frozen, and it is expected to continue

so about a month or six weeks, when the warm weather comes

on pretty suddenly, and continues all the remainder of the year,

so that now we have had both the extremes of heat and cold in

this climate, and a pretty clear idea of what it will be in the

whole course of the year; and certainly it is greatly superior

to that of England.

We shall very soon have a better communication with Phi

ladelphia, and a dimunition of our heavy postage, as well as

a quicker conveyance. At present we are nearly a week later

with respect to intelligence than they are at Philadelphia ; and

as there have been no late arrivals from England, and few ships

expected at this time of the year, we suffer a good deal from

impatience to know what is passing in Europe, and especially

in England. The last accounts we had brought us to the

speech of the judge on the trial of Mr. Tooke,f and this we

had near a month ago, and I cannot express my anxiety on

the subject; and we had reports, but nothing certain, of the

French taking possession of Rotterdam or Amsterdam. J I am

dence, though it is impossible not to feel great concern for
one's friends, and even one's country, as such, whatever we
may think of the government, or governors of it. The more I
think on the subject, the more I am persuaded that the cala
mitous times foretold in the Scriptures are at hand ; and I fear
they will be of long continuance, and that England has much
to dread from them. I am now giving much attention to the
prophecies ; but I do not see my way so clearly as I wish. I
think Mr. Bicheno's conjecture about the seven thunders a
very happy one.* Mr. Garnham's application of Rev. xii. 13,
had occurred to me, but I am not quite satisfied with it ; and
I rather think that Antichrist means any visible power, as that
of the Pope, than usurpations of power in the Greek Emperors,
&c, according to Mr. Evanson. With respect to prophecies
allowed to be accomplished, my chief difficulty respects the
11th of Daniel. It is indeed a most difficult chapter. Could
I see my way through that, I think I should write on the sub-
ject. I have now no great satisfaction except in theological
studies, but this increases daily.

who had published, 1794, " The Signs of the Times; or the Overthrow

Despotism." A contemporary critic says,

   " Whatever may be thought of the author's success in the application of
the prophecies of this obscure book, he certainly discovers great ingenuity,
and a commendable attention in studying the symbolical language of his
original. The reflections likewise with which he concludes his work, on the
predominant motives to the present crusade against a people struggling for
liberty, and the unaffected fervour which breathes in his exhortations to a
speedy political and moral reformation, are honourable testimonies to his
seriousness and liberality." N. A. Reg. XV. [183].

A worse change is, that I am losing my fore teeth, which will
affect my speech. All these changes precede the great one,

philosopher, yet it beamed with so much simplicity and freedom, as made
him very easy of access." M. R. I. 394.

was disposed of according to a project, the original of which is now before
me.

from which the print was engraved by Holloway, is now in the possession

to present the picture to Dr. Williams's Library."

   · Such arts must have been practised, however imperfectly, in another

part of America, about the middle of a former century. The justly cele
brated John Eliot, of Boston, thus complains :

   " It seemeth men may be said in some respects to be even bewitched with
fashions, when they will disguise and dishonour their own bodies rather than
not to be fashioned like the world. They will cut oflf their own beards, and
old men cut off all gravity that nature and grey hairs would honour them
withal, and cover the honour of their grey heads with counterfeited and
youthful periwigs, as if all the grave affairs of the land were managed by
green-headed youth ; an evil it seems in Tertullian's time, elegantly and
earnestly scorned by him. To such he writes, ' We youthfulize our heads,
as if that were our eternity.'

   " If you be not ashamed of the enormity, be ashamed of the pollution.
Vex not an holy and Christian head with the periwig, and refuse of another
man's hair : it may be a filthy person, perhaps a wicked man, ordained to
damnation. Cast off from your free heads this slavish excrement ; and oh
to be lamented ! they say the pulpits are much of the same guise.

   " Sundry come over hither from England in such dresses, that the sight
of our eyes might move us to lay to heart the sins of England, and yet
sundry of onrs, yea, of the more ungirt sort of professors too, are more
ready to imitate than bewail them ; and were not such sins cryed against by
some, there be that would spare no cost to shew their frothy minds by such
flags, when it were far better to be bestowed in paying their debts : but
Christ hath his pretious ones among us, who do continually bewail and re
sist these things."

which the various changes in my life, and especially the last,
make me consider as not undesirable. Then my present state

           To Mil. Samuel Parker.

Dear Sir,                 Northumberland, Jan. 20, 1795.

Living, as I do, at a considerable distance from Philadel

phia, and this being a time of the year in which all communi

cation by water is cut off, I have not yet received your kind

present of glass ware, which, however, I hear is safely arrived.

I am sending a slay, which is our best method of conveyance

in winter, to fetch them, and other things that are waiting for

me. We shall soon have a stage-coach and stage-waggon to

this place, which will remove one of the greatest inconve

niences we labour under.

I shall very thankfully, by Mr. Johnson, pay for the hygro

meter, or any thing else that you shall be so good as to pur

chase for me. And as you are pleased to say you will supply

me with any vessel, for the use of my experiments, made of

glass, I shall take the liberty to inform you, that that part of

my apparatus (which was very complete) has suffered exceed

ingly in its conveyance hither, owing chiefly to injudicious

packing, large thin glasses having been rilled with smaller

without sufficient stuffing, so that the shades, or bell-glasses,

with which your father liberally supplied me, are almost all

broken, and more than half of thenars of my electrical batte

ries. If you will be so kind as to replace these, you will do

me a most acceptable service. My jars were twelve inches

deep and four wide; but others that will go within them will

do just as well, and lessen the bulk of the package.

I have lost also the receiver for the guinea and feather, and a

set of glass tubes with large bulbs at the end, which I used iu

 See supra, p. 269.       f Vrig. MS.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.                        293

 the experiments I last published on the generation of air from
water, the stems about half an inch wide, and thirty inches
long, and the bulb made to hold a quart or two quarts of
water. They were made for me at Russell's glass-house.
Some of those with smaller bulbs are preserved.

   This place is inconveniently situated for carrying on my
experiments; but living here is cheap, and the climate, &c,
uncommonly fine, and my sons are settling in farms about me.
It is now the depth of winter, and the thermometer sometimes
(though only in the night) below 0 of Fahrenheit. It is plea-
santer in the day than your summer, and we had nothing like
winter till the beginning of this month. But our great advan
tage arises from a happy constitution of government, and a
state of peace, in consequence of which the country enjoys an
unexampled state of prosperity, the advancement in popula
tion, and improvements of all kinds, being beyond any thing
that the world ever saw before. I earnestly wish your situa
tion and prospects were as good. For though I have found a
happy asylum here, I consider it in no other light. I feel
myself as in a state of exile, and my best wishes are for my
native country and my friends there.

  With every good wish to your father and yourself, I am
yours sincerely.*

With great pleasure I have just received yours of the 27th

satisfaction that I have in this place. How often do I think of

the hours I have spent by your fire-side, and with Belsham

at your tea, on Sundays! J Those times will never return.

But I hope the time will come, (and cannot be far distant,)

when we shall meet to part no more. My separation from

you makes me think more of this than I ever did before. I do

not, however, think it impossible but that I may see several of

my much-valued friends, though not yourself, on this side the
water ; and that, in two or three years, I may even visit others
of them in England. By that time it may be hoped that your
public affairs will be settled some way or other ; and there are
so many righteous there, that I hope the calamity that may be
impending over it will be mitigated.

   You will perceive that I am still meditating on the subject
of prophecy. It occupies much of my thoughts and my read
ing. I also put down what occurs to me, though I have by no
means got so much light on it as I wish for. The present
times, however, by turning the attention of many serious and
ingenious persons to the subject, may be expected to produce
something valuable.

   I bought, when I was in Englaud, a Latin tract, by Increase
Mather, of Boston, on the Second Coming of Christ.* I think
I told you I thought it something extraordinary for the time

Dear Friend,                 Northumberland, Feb. 22, 1795.

I am just gratified with the receipt of three of your letters,

accompanying some Cambridge papers and Morning Chronicles,

which also were both very acceptable. The pleasure I always

receive from your letters is more than I can express, their

value being sensibly enhanced by our distance, and I fear

the increasing improbability of having any other intercourse

on this side the grave.

You are concerned, as I expected you would be, at my

fixing in this place, so much out of the world, as you naturally

take it to be ; but had you been here, you would not, I think,

have advised me to do any other than I have done, distant as

it is from my original views. The acceptance of the chemical

professorship would have obliged me to spend four months of
the year at Philadelphia.

   As to my usefulness in other respects, I really think it will
eventually be greater in consequence of not immediately forcing
myself into a more public situation. My writings, which are
now much inquired after, and were not known or thought of
before, will prepare the way for my preaching in Philadelphia,
which 1 am determined upon, about two months, the next
winter. In the mean time I shall have a small congregation
here, all the more intelligent people in the place having agreed
to join in building me a place of worship. A Mr. Walker, a
good scholar, and, in point of character and fortune, the first
person in this place, has read almost all my theological writings
with the most entire approbation, and even my Disquisitions
and controversy with Dr. Price.

   If we establish a college here, I do not think that I could
any where be fixed to more advantage, especially if it be con
sidered that I have here the leisure for my pursuits that I
could not have in a populous town, and the climate, $c, much
superior to any thing near the coast, in several important re
spects. Could you and Mrs. Lindsey be set down here, es
pecially in the autumn, without the risk and fatigue of the
voyage, you would think it a paradise. It gives a feeling of
serenity and cheerfulness that I never had in England. Even
 the winter, which is now closing, is much less disagreeable,
 though colder, than yours. It was, however, only three times
 below 0, and then not at all unpleasant; and as the air is gene
rally clear, that is the time for visiting and pleasurable ex
 cursions on slays, which is superior to any other mode of con
veyance.*

           To Rev. T. Belsham.t

Dear Sir,    Northumberland, March 2-2, 1795.

I consider it as nearly the same thing whether I write to

you or to Mr. Lindsey, as I have nearly the same things to

say to you both, as you both interest yourselves in what relates

* Orig. MS.  f Hackney College.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  297

to me and my pursuits; and I have little else, living as I do,
sequestered from the world, to entertain you with. But I judge
of you by myself; and nothing interests me so much as what
relates to you and your pursuits.

   I do not know that any thing has given me more pleasure
since I left England than to hear, in my present state of in
action, of your success in the congregation, and in your lec
turing to my class at Hackney. I feel as if, by your means,
1 was not wholly idle, though I am here at present unemployed,
and, much against my will, without any thing to do. I hope,
however, you will not consider me as being wholly useless.

   Inconveniently situated as I am, I have contrived to repeat
my experiments on the generation of air from water, and have
diversified them in such a manner as to answer some objections
that were made to them, and to extend them farther. In a
few weeks it will, I hope, be in my power to do a good deal
more; but I will not trouble you, about things of this nature.

   I have published an answer to Mr. Paine's book, and it is
much read. An edition I first printed here was on bad paper,
but another, printed at Philadelphia, looks as well as any
pamphlet printed in England, and there will be another edition
in Boston. I am now greatly enlarging some Observations I
wrote and printed on my arrival in this country on the Causes
of the spread of Infidelity. I will send you and Mr. Lindsey
copies of what I publish here, if I can, but I find more difficulty
than I was aware of in doing this. If I was at Philadelphia I
 could manage better.

    I admire the climate of this part of the country very much ;
but our greatest advantage is the peace we enjoy, and have the
prospect of preserving, and the blessings of a good government
 calculated to preserve it. It is with the greatest eagerness we
 read all advices from Europe, and especially from England,
 for the interest of which I cannot help feeling very sensibly.
 The last accounts we have had, mention the French having
 passed the Waal, and advancing to Utrecht, and the probability
 of the Dutch making peace.

     With every good wish to my native country, and especially
 my friends in it, I am, dear Sir, yours sincerely.

   Mr. Priestley, having carried through the press
at Northumberland the Memoirs, " from his father's
manuscript," thus commences his Continuation ;

   I entertained hopes at one time that my father would have
continued the narrative himself; and he was frequently re
quested to do so by me, and many of his friends, in the course
of the year preceding his death.

   He was requested also, in imitation of Courayer,* to add, at

   M. Le Courayer died in 1776, aged 95. He had constantly resided in
England since 1728, when he quitted France to escape the persecution ex
cited by his " Dissertation sur la validité des Ordinations Anglicanes." About
1751, Mr. Lindsey came into his acquaintance in the family of the Duchess
of Somerset, where Courayer was frequently an inmate.

   The " derniers sentimens" are strictly Unitarian, though the author, too
like some earlier Unitarians, does not allow himself, in terms, to explode
the notion of a Trinity. He says,

   " De toutes les manières d'expliquer le dogme de la Trinité, je n'eo
connois point de plus contraire à la véritable doctrine du Christianisme, que
celle qui suppose dans la Divinité l'existence de trois natures, ou de trois
substances, distinctes, soit collatérales, soit subordonnées. C'est, à mons
sens, rétablir le polythéisme, sous prétexte d'expliquer un mystère. L'Unité
de Dieu est le fondement de l'Evangile ; et tout ce qui peut donner atteinte à
cette vérité est dangereux.

   " Je crois donc, qu'il n'y a qu'un seul Dieu ; que son Esprit n'est point

the close of his Memoirs, a summary of his religious opinions.
This would have counteracted the suspicions entertained by
some, that they had undergone a considerable change since his
coming to America; and it was thought by his friends, that
such a brief and simple statement of all that appeared to him
essential to the Christian belief, and the Christian character,
would attract the attention of many readers previously indis
posed to religion altogether, from not understanding its real
nature, and judging of it only from the corrupt, adulterated,
and complicated state in which it is professed in all countries
called Christian.

  It was suggested to him also, that as his society through life
had been singularly varied and extensive, and his opportunities
of attaining a general knowledge of the world, and a particular
knowledge of eminent political and literary characters, very
great, it would contribute much to the instruction and amuse
ment of those into whose hands his Memoirs should fall, if
they were accompanied with anecdotes of the principal charac
ters with whom he had been acquainted ; for he had a fund of
anecdote, which he was never backward to produce for the
amusement of his friends, as occasions served for introducing it.
But his relations were never sarcastic or ironical, or tended to
disparage the characters of the persons spoken of, unless on
subjects of manifest importance to the interests of society.

   He meant to have complied with the above suggestions, but
being at that time very busily employed about his " Com
parison," and thinking his Memoirs of little value compared
with the works about which he was then engaged, he put off
the completion of his narrative until his other works should be
ready for the press. Unfortunately, this was too late. The
work he had in hand was not completed until the 22d of Ja
nuary, when he was very weak, and suffered greatly from his
disorder, and he died on the 6th of February.

   The letters which will occupy the remainder of this
chapter are all from Dr. Priestley. They narrate the
various objects which now engaged his attention, and
the disadvantage or facilities for their pursuit, which he
naturally attributed to a remote and retired residence.
They also feelingly allude to bereavements of the most
painful description, which he was too soon called to
suffer, and discover the consolations he derived from an
habitual confidence, on Christian principles, in the equity
and benevolence of the Divine dispensations, piously con
cluding, that

     To Rev. T. Lindsey.*

     Dear Friend,  Northumberland, April 5, 17.05.

I never felt so sensibly as I now do the benefit of the

principles which I have taken so much pains to teach to others.

I mean, chiefly, the belief of a Providence, extending to all

events ; of nothing happening without the will of the wisest and

best of Beings. Otherwise, my situation is so very different

from what it has ever heen before, that I should have felt the

change very severely, especially so late in life.

Nothing is yet done towards building my house. It is next

to impossible to get workmen, and the price of every thing is

advanced one-third since we have come hither. This indeed

is an alarming circumstance, and how far the evil will go we

cannot tell. It is with most probability ascribed to the increase

of paper money, which has only very lately made its way

hither. In consequence of this, I expect that living, even in

this remote place, will soon be as dear as in London ; but my

sons will soon raise every thing we want of provisions within

themselves, and that will make it easy to us. Even I some
times take my axe or my mattock, and work, as long as I can,
along with them. Nobody here thinks himself above bodily
labour of any kind, and they dress accordingly.

   In general, the lower class of people are very idle, as well as
proud, and live miserably, many of them as wretchedly, to
appearance, as the poor are said to do in Ireland ; but there is
hardly any such thing as thieving, drunkenness, or open pro-
faneness, though there is little religion. It is universally ob
served, that the more we approach the frontiers, the more un
civilized the people are, till they are little better, many really
worse, than the native Indians, having all their bad qualities,
without their good ones. Such was this place a few years ago.
During the late war it was in the possession of the Indians,
though now there are none within 200 miles of us. But as
places get better peopled, those lawless people who had the
first possession leave them, and get nearer to the frontiers,
where they can live in a manner more agreeably to their dis
position and habits. You have no such people in England or
Europe. They will live in the woods without houses, like
wild beasts, the greatest part of the year; and even in the
winter they want little more provision of any kind than their
cattle.*

  * " He who would wish to see America in its proper light, and have a
true idea of its feeble beginnings and barbarous rudiments, must visit our
extended line of frontiers, where the last settlers dwell. There, men appear
to be no better than carnivorous animals of a superior rank, living on the
flesh of wild animals. Remote from the power of example and check of
shame, many families exhibit the most hideous parts of our society. They
are a kind of forlorn hope, preceding, by ten or twelve years, the most re-
spectable army of veterans which come after them.

   " In that space prosperity will polish some, vice and the law will drive off
the rest, who uniting again with others like themselves, will recede still
farther, making room for more industrious people, who will finish their im
provements, convert the log-house into a convenient habitation, and change
in a few years that hitherto barbarous country into a fine, fertile, well-re
gulated district." See " Letters from an American Farmer," ( 1 782,) pp.
56, 57.

influence, perhaps even till componitur orbis ad exemptum, may well accord
with the history of the intervening century, and the present political aspect

my prospects in that and other respects. They continue the

continued my Memoirs of myself to the present time. All
things considered, 1 believe I am better here than in Philadel
phia. If I have done any good, it has been chiefly by writing,
and here I have more time to command for that purpose, as
well as for making experiments. However, when 1 cannot do
as I would, I must be content to do as I can, and submit to
the order of Providence. I want most the society of Christian
and Unitarian friends, and particularly lament that I hear no
thing of Mr. Russell. The English, who think of settling here,
are almost wholly unbelievers, which renders my situation
much less agreeable. This, however, is the will of Providence,
and perhaps some good may come even of this unpleasant cir
cumstance. I hope I shall at least guard my own family from
the general infection.

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, May 17, 1795.

I find there is a packet coming to me from Philadelphia.

I am eager to receive it; but in this respect my patience is

fully tried, so that I make myself more easy than I did at

first; and were it not for the concern I have for my friends,

and the attention I give to the fulfilment of prophecy, I should

take but little interest in the politics of Europe. He we are,

of Europe, where it may be reasonably conjectured, that the people " who
know their rights, and knowing dare maintain" them, are rapidly increasing :

   " Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men, whose
labours and posterity will, one day, cause great changes in the world.
Americans are the western pilgrims, who are carrying along with them tha
greats mass of arts, sciences, vigour, and industry, which began long since
in the east. Tbey will finish the great circle." See " Letters from an Ame

as it were, out of the world, and begin to give but little atten
tion to it. I used to feel something of the same kind between
living at Birmingham, absorbed in my own pursuits, and
spending a month annually in the bustle of London. But I
feel the difference much more sensibly here.

  It is my determination to spend two months annually in
Philadelphia, or some of the greater towns in this country, and
preach, for which I now hope I have sufficient strength; but
last year I really had not. I have written to my friends at
Philadelphia, to acquaint them with my resolution, saying I
would appear among them, if at all, in my proper character of
a Christian minister, and that they must therefore provide a
place in which I may deliver a set of discourses on the evi
dences of revelation, or other seasonable and interesting sub
jects. If they could not succeed in this, I said I should make
the same proposal to my friends at New York, but that I
should give the preference to Philadelphia.

  I have this day finished the transcribing the second period
of the continuation of my Church History, which brings me to
the re-establishment of the Western empire, under Charle
magne. This work I stick close to; but I could have done
but little, if any thing, at it, if I had been at Philadelphia. As
to experiments, I find I cannot do much till I get my own
house built. At present I have all my books and instruments
in one room, at the house of my son.

   I am beginning to read your publications. Over the Apology
and Farewell Address to the people of Catterick,* I could not

     Dear Friend,
  I have just received yours, in recommendation of Mr. Millar;
but I have not seen him, or heard from him. Had our college
been established, I should have thought him a valuable acqui
sition. However, several of our zealous friends are of the
aristocratical, or governmental party in this country; and to

 them Mr. Millar's having left England for his attachment to
 the principles of liberty will be no recommendation. On the
 contrary, they have the greatest jealousy of such persons, and
 Mr. Adams, with whom I have some correspondence,* acknow
 ledged it was the fear they had of such emigrants that led
 them to put the restrictions they have lately done on the
 naturalization of foreigners. For my own part, I told him I
 had no intention to be naturalized at all, but to live as a peace
 able stranger. I can perceive, however, that the democratical
 party is growing stronger, and will, in time, get the upper
 hand. Party spirit is pretty high in this country, but the
 constitution is such that it cannot do any harm.

    On Sunday last, at the request of the judges of the Supreme
Court, which has not sat the last two years, I preached at
Sunbury, to a tolerable audience, some of whom I was told
were much surprised to find that I was a Christian. I have no
doubt of finding an opening to preach, and with effect, in this
country soon, and I think with more effect, in consequence of
having been thought to be overborne by the bigotry of the
Calvinistic party, here called Presbyterians. Indeed, the Pres
byterian discipline generally prevails here, the same as in
Scotland. All the emigrants from Great Britain, of late years,
have been from Scotland, or the north of Ireland. Very few
settlers indeed have come from England. Nobody in these
parts remembers any, and we are regarded with peculiar
jealousy ; and no others are considered as foreigners but
ourselves. From other parts they are received as at home.
At the same time we are evidently considered as something
superior to other emigrants, and thought to be immensely
rich.

   Harry will make a spirited and laborious farmer. He is the
wonder of the place, and, I hope, will not fail to do well.

   I have read Darwin's Zoonomia, and admire it much ; but
he should have made more respectful mention of Hartley, who
was before him in every important observation.f

                          To the Same.

Dear Friend,              Northumberland, June 17, 1795.

I have lately received two letters from you, and many pam

phlets and newspapers, which were exceedingly welcome to

me. I can hardly give you an idea of the interest I take in

every thing that comes from England, and how little in any

thing here. This is in a great measure, no doubt, owing to

there being nothing very interesting now going forward here,

every thing being quiet, and only in a silent, regular progression

to a better state; whereas with you the greatest events may be

expected, and things cannot continue as they are; and with

the fate of England is connected that of Europe, and of the

world.

The Morning Chronicle is particularly welcome to me, and

I plainly perceive by it that the spirit of the people is getting

up, and that things are approaching to the state they were in

towards the close of the American war. I wish the issue may

not be more calamitous. I am far from rejoicing in the dis

tresses of my native country, and even those of my enemies in

it; though I as earnestly as ever wish well to the cause of

liberty, and, consequently, the success of the French. I rejoice

in the change of measures that has taken place in that coun

try,* and wish it may be permanent; but, by our last accounts,

another revolution was apprehended. By this time you know

much more than we do here, and much more you will know

before you receive this.

What you say on the subject of my continuing unactive

here, affects me much. But if you could have been present at

all the train of events by which I have been brought into this

situation, I am confident you would not blame me. I feel a

more eager desire than ever of doing what I can in the way

that you wish me; but hitherto there has been no opening

for it. I flatter myself, however, that I shall appear with

more effect in consequence of this very circumstance, which

appears so unfavourable. Nothing shall be wanting on my
part towards it.

   As to the chemical lectureship, I am now convinced I could
.not have acquitted myself in it to proper advantage. I had no
difficulty in giving a general course of chemistry at Hackney,
lecturing only once a week ; but to give a lecture every day
for four months, and to enter so particularly into the subject as
a course of lectures in a medical university requires, I was not
prepared for ; and my engagements there would not, at my
time of life, have permitted me to make the necessary prepara
tions for it ; if I could have done it at all. For, though I have
made discoveries in some branches of chemistry, I never gave
much attention to the common routine of it, and know but
little of the common processes. On the whole, I am satisfied
that I can never appear at Philadelphia, as a Unitarian preacher,
if I have any thing else to attend to; and to this object I am
determined to devote my time, and all my resources,* whenever
I get into a settled way of living.

   Here I have most leisure for writing and experimenting,
by which I have done the most. I have composed and tran
scribed about another volume of my Church History, and hope
to complete the whole in less than two years; and I do not
think I could employ my time to better purpose. I shall like
wise give constant attention to every thing that relates to the
evidences of Christianity.

    Having suddenly heard of this opportunity of sending to
 Philadelphia, I cannot now write to the Ouke of Grafton, but
 shall, the next, and probably you will receive both the letters
 at the same time. I cannot but say that the benefaction is
 seasonable, my expenses so much exceed my idea of them.
 However, I thank a kind Providence, I shall do very well.f

    * I have found this exemplary devotion thus estimated in America, twenty
 years after Priestley had rested from his labours :

    " It seems to us, that if there is one man to whom, more than to any
 other, Unitarians can look with confidence, and point with pride, as the
 honest, zealous, pious, unwearied, distinguished champion of their prin
 ciples, Dr. Priestley is that man." See " Unitarian Miscellany," Baltimore,

           To Rev. T. Belsham.*

Dear Sir,  Northumberland, June 18, 1795.

You make me very happy by your letters, and if I do not

write so often in return, it is only because I take it for granted

Mr. Lindsey will communicate to you every thing in my

letters to him that will interest you, and that will be almost

every thing I say to him. Nothing is wanting to my complete

satisfaction here, but such society as his and yours. You are

continually in my thoughts, and your letters, and the papers

and pamphlets you send me, are a chief part of my entertain

ment. But my distance from Philadelphia, and the want of a

ready communication with it, not for letters, but parcels, is a

great obstruction to it. This, however, we hope will soon be

removed by the erection of a stage coach.

I am very glad that you have taken up the subject of pro

phecy, which, indeed, must interest, in a particular manner, all

who have any faith in the subject at this critical time. I had

no doubt but when you particularly attended to the Revelation,

all your doubts about it would vanish. I also have been giv

ing a good deal of attention to the subject of prophecy, and

find, or think I find, less difficulty with respect to the Reve

lation than I expected. I have found Jurieuf in many respects

an excellent work. But I find the greatest difficulty fn the

interpretation of the eleventh chapter of Daniel ; and the more

I think, the more puzzled I am. If you can give me any light,

pray do.

I wish much for a copy of your Academical Lectures. If I

give lectures on the same subjects, I shall not compose any of

my own. But I have some presentiment, that as soon as they

will be wanted, you will deliver them yourself here. The idea

is too pleasing to me to be given up.J

           To Mr. Sporrell.*

Dear Sir,  Northumberland, July 12, 1795.

I am very much affected by your kind letter, and blame

myself for not writing to you before, though I always intended

doing it. For we are frequently speaking of you, and shall

never forget the many obligations we are under to you, or the

pleasure we have had in your society. The satisfaction I had

at Clapton was in a very great measure owing to it. How

happy should I be to have your company here, where I want

it still more ! but I cannot, at present, at least, give you any

encouragement to come. If I could, I should have written to

you long ago.
   This would be a good situation for manufactures, were it

not for the high price of labour, and the great expense of car

riage for raw materials of any kind. Indeed, the price of pro

visions, and all necessaries, is suddenly and astonishingly

raised ; nearly one-third since we came hither, and they have

doubled in the last three years. Where this will stop we can

not tell, but it is very alarming to those who live on fixed in

comes. But here every housekeeper has a garden, out of which

he raises almost all he wants for his family. They all have

cows, and many have horses, the keeping of which costs them

little or nothing in the summer, for they ramble with bells on

their necks in the woods, and come home at night. Almost

all the flesh meat they have is salted in the autumn, and a fish

galled shads in the spring. This salt shad they eat at break

fast, with their tea and coffee, and also at night; for they have

no supper distinct from their afternoon's tea. We, however, have

   · Alton, Hants. With Mr. Spurrell my acquaintance commenced in

1792, among the " Friends of the People ;" and I enjoyed his society and
friendship till his decease, in 1822, aged 79- He was deservedly esteemed
as a liberal politician, and an enlightened and consistent Christian.

  It has been justly remarked, that though Mr " Spurrell spent all the year?
of his life in the occupations of commerce, he found leisure for mental culti
vation, and so improved his understanding by habits of reading and reflec
tion, as to have rendered himself no uninteresting companion to men of
great talents and attainments, some of whom he had the satisfaction to rank
among his personal and particular friends." See Obituary by the Rev. E.
Cogan, M. R. XVII. 375, 376.

not yet laid aside our English customs, and having made great
exertions to get fresh meat, it will soon come into general use.

   All persons who come here must have farms, and cultivate
them themselves for the most part, as the natives do. This is
what my three sons do now. My youngest son, Harry, works
as hard as any farmer in the country, and is as attentive to his
farm, though he is only eighteen. We have not much society
except among ourselves.

   As to religion, we are like you, having a service in our
own house, at which only two or three persons out of it, and
those from England, attend. I shall get a place where I
can preach more publicly, but it must be at my own ex
pense. We are, however, about to establish a college in
this place, and then I can make use of the common hall for
that purpose.

   I propose to spend a month or two every winter in some of
the towns. There, however, 1 could not live. It is dearer in
all respects than in London, and all towns themselves very dis
agreeable. Here the climate is excellent. We hope in a little
time to have agreeable society, and be better accommodated in
a variety of respects than we are at present.

   We are much affected by the many afflictions you have met
with.* They have, indeed been uncommonly great ; but your
Christian principles will, I hope, carry you through them all.

   Peace, I think, you must have, from choice or necessity ; for
this destructive war cannot last always. In this case of peace,
I do not wholly despair of once more seeing my friends in
England ; and among the first of them, yourself and your
family. Nay, I sometimes flatter myself, that if there should
be an unfavourable turn in public affairs, you and others of my
friends may find an asylum here. Nothing would make me
so happy. It is, indeed, almost all I want. Do not fail to
write to me, and if you should look this way, all that we can
do shall be done for you. Believe me to be, with much grati
tude and esteem, dear Sir, yours sincerely.

   My wife joinsin best respects to you and your family.f

To Rev. T. Lindsey.*

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, July 12, 1795.

I cannot express my feelings when I open any of your

letters, and to this the distance I am from you contributes not

a little. But that we can correspond at all, is one of the great

est satisfactions I enjoy. I have just received yours of May.

You will find that I had written to Mrs. Rayner. To the

Duke I wrote ; but without inclosing the letter to you, and
now I shall write to Mr. Tayleur ; but from the account you
gave me of him, I had concluded that it was too late to write

to him at all.f
   Mrs. Rayner's benevolence is peculiarly seasonable ; though

I hope, in a year or two, to do without any. Harry proceeds
with so much spirit and industry, that I must give him all the
assistance I can. Considering his youth, for he is not eighteen,

his conduct is thought by every body to be extraordinary.
Harry drives his horses and cart, and works with his men,
like one of them, and here there is little difference between
master and servant. Indeed, those terms are unknown. If
there was more subordination, it would be better for them all.

There are no beggars here, or in the country ; but though they
are miserably housed, hardly clothed, and feed no better than

their cattle, they will not go to service.
   I am exceedingly glad that you have, at last, got my answer

to Mr. Paine, and that you like it. I wish to see your pre-
face.J It cannot give more pleasure to you than it does to me,

 to have our names connected in every possible method. I
 hope they will be for ever inseparable. I have now nearly
 printed some Observations on the Increase of Infidelity, and I
 will send them, the first opportunity. I hardly ever wrote more
 than I do now, at least with a view to publication. I read
 nothing for amusement. What I chiefly attend to now is my
 Church History, which I have composed and transcribed, as
far as the taking of Jerusalem by the Crusaders. Two periods
more will, I think, bring me to the Reformation. As Fleury
contains all the facts in the order in which they took place, I
begin with abridging and re-arranging his materials, with my
own reflections and colouring, and, for the middle ages, this
appears to me to be almost all that is wanting. It is very
laborious, but without some serious business my time would
he intolerably heavy on my hands. I have only one room for
my books and instruments, and therefore I cannot do much ;
but I make some experiments every day, and shall soon draw
up a paper for the Philosophical Society at Philadelphia,
being a continuation of my last experiments in England.
  Two or three hours I always work in the fields, along with
my son. The weather beginning to be hot, I do this early and
late; but I am at my History between five aud six every
morning.* Before next winter I hope to have two more volumes

work. On the subject of the prophecies I think a good deal,
and write a little; but whether I shall ever publish I cannot
tell. I do not understand the eleventh chapter of Daniel, nor
the prophesying of the witnesses in the Revelation. I thank
you for Brothers* and other curiosities in that way.

   The English newspapers interest me much. I shall never
feel otherwise than as an Englishman. Here I feel, and
always shall, as a stranger, and indeed have no intention to be
naturalized. The present governing powers have shewn a
ridiculous jealousy of democratical emigrants, and, from a
dread of them, as Mr. Adams acknowledges to me,f they
have, in the last congress, made naturalization more difficult
than before.

   I have just heard from Mr. Toulmin. He is engaged for
another year at Lexington ; and after that I have some hope
that we may get him hither. This will be a central and most
agreeable place, though, perhaps, not so much as the Athens
of America. I long for the society of rational Christians ; and
I hope in time to form some here ; but no friends are like old
ones. X

asked him a question. He observed one day, when we were talking about
the strength of religious prejudices, ' In these things I was once a slave.'

   " I always found him up and writing, when I went to the house, which sel
dom exceeded six o'clock in the morning. He usually took a walk after
breakfast, and employed the remainder of his time in writing till noon. In
the after-part of the day he would frequently come to me in the garden, or
visit the people employed in building his house, and then return to his study.

            To Rev. T. Belsham.*

Dear Sir,   Northumberland, Aug. 3, 1795.

Your letters and Mr. Lindsey's give me greater satisfaction

in this remote part of the world than I can well give you an

idea of, and you are both very kind in writing to me, as you

do. I wish it was as easy to convey parcels as it is letters ; but

if I believe a thing I much wish to see will come some time or

other, I am now tolerably easy. At Hackney, we had the

newspapers once or twice every day, and while fresh. Here

we have the post only once a week, and European news, which

is all that interests us, two or three months after you have it.

but to this I am now reconciled. I carefully preserve all the

Morning Chronicles, and the Cambridge Intelligencer, which I

neglected when I was with you. They are now all in good

order, and frequently referred to. I hope soon to receive the

Annual Register, which will be another feast for me.

Though this country, and the government of it, are really

almost every thing that I can wish from them, I shall always

feel as a stranger ; but my sons will be at home soon. What I

want chiefly is the employment I had at Hackney, but for this

I am finding a substitute. I apply very closely to my Church

History. A year more, applying to it as I now do, will

enable me to complete the whole. However, as I shall have

interruptions, and shall take a good deal of time to revise and

compare different accounts, I shall hardly go to press before

two years.

Mr. Brookes, one of your Sunday pupils, has been so good

as to send me the heads of some of your lectures to the young

people, which makes me very desirous of seeing the rest, es

pecially on the Revelation. Could you by any means favour

me with a sight of them? I am thinking much on the sub

ject, but cannot by any means arrive at the satisfaction I

wish for. I am more and more dissatisfied with Mr. Evan-

son's and Mr. Garnham's principles of interpretation. Anti

christ and the beasts, &c, &c, must be visible powers or

governments, and not opinions or superstitious practices. In

the Revelation, I am most puzzled with the witnesses, their
death and resurrection, and the earthquake that followed it.
I think with you, neither their death nor resurrection have yet
taken place, and therefore we cannot expect to understand
them.*

                        To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,              Northumberland, Aug. 12, 1795.

I begin to think it rather long since I have heard from you ;

but I hear the ship Molly, after a long passage of more than

ten weeks, is arrived, and I hope will bring letters from Mr.

Belsham and you. Thus, at least, I flatter myself. We are,

however, better situated in that respect in this place than Mr.

Toulmin,J in Kentucky. I heard from him lately. He has

engaged for another year in their college, which, however, by

his account, is hardly a grammar school, nor likely at present

to be much more. What will be done here I cannot tell ; but

I hope better things; but not so much better as to afford

ground to expect such society as that of his, or any other

friends from England. Of late I have not heard any thing

about the scheme. § However, I shall do what I can, and leave

the event to Providence.

I never before found such aid from a sense of religion as in

my present circumstances, and a persuasion that both in coming

to this country, and settling here, I acted from the best views,

as things appeared at the time ; nor could I have subsisted any

where else without being too burdensome to my friends, or

engaged in some employment for which I am growing every

day more unfit, and which would have taken up all my time,

which I can now give to useful pursuits. As to society, I do

well enough without it. I feel myself too old to enjoy new

acquaintance, and those I could enjoy cannot be had. I believe

we shall have several English settle in this neighbourhood ;

but I expect nothing from them in that respect.

To drive off ennui I was never more fully employed, espe

cially about my Church History, in which I am writing the

history of the war with the Albigenses. In experiments I can-

not do very much, till I get my laboratory built, and then my
time may be but short. But the will of God be done. I am
going to draw up an account of what I have done, for the Phi
losophical Society at Philadelphia.

   The only thing that I repent of here, is my undertaking to
build a house, not foreseeing the difficulty and expense of it.
In all other respects I have every thing that I wish for on this
side the grave, at least all that this country can give me. We
have the great blessing of peace, which I earnestly wish you
had also. Mr. Jay's treaty* is almost universally condemned,
so that many think the President will not ratify it. We have
had a very fine mild spring, and as yet but little hot weather.
1 have not disliked the hottest.

  It is now a long time since we have had any European news
of consequence, which makes me hope that the contending
powers are inclined to peace. This would be a most desirable
event indeed, but I fear a greater blessing than the state of the
world will authorize us to expect. I cannot help being sen
sibly impressed with the language of prophecy, though happily
we cannot tell how long the evil day may be delayed or (for
the elects' sake) shortened. It will be happy if we be found
always ready. How I long to confer with some intelligent and
learned Christian on this and other interesting subjects! At
present I can only indulge my own private thoughts, and in
this case they are too apt to become particular and odd, as we
used to think was the case with Mr. Cappe.

  In hopes of better times, yours, Mrs. Lindsey's and Mrs.
Rayner's most affectionately,f

Dear Sir,  Northumberland, Aug. 30, 1795.

I have this day received yours of June 14, and I cannot ex

press the satisfaction I receive from all your letters, and those

of Mr. Lindsey. The distance, and other circumstances, give

them the effect of letters from the dead.

How happy I should be to enjoy once more such an inter

view as we used to have after walking together from Hackney

to Essex Street! It makes me think more than ever of the
time when I hope we shall meet to part no more. Still, how
ever, I am willing to flatter myself that I may see you both on
this side of the grave, if peace should return while I am ca
pable of undertaking the voyage, for I cannot expect to see
Mr. Lindsey here, and hardly you.

   I am exceedingly concerned at the lukewarmness and de
sertion of the persons you mention. What would I not give to
have the opportunity that any of them has given up, to appear
as a public preacher of Unitarian Christianity! That is the
only considerable thing wanting to the satisfaction I enjoy
here ; and I feel the restraint I am under very painfully. I
hope, however, it will in some measure be removed ; and I
consider that if I have done any good, it has not been so much
by preaching as by writing, and that my capacity for public
speaking must necessarily decline. I must therefore be content
to bear my testimony some other way, though I have engaged
a pulpit for the sake of delivering a course of sermons at Phi
ladelphia the next winter. I have no expectation of a chapel
here till we build for the college, and then I shall make use of
the common hall. At present we have a service every Sunday
morning, but, being in a private house, very few attend, and I
only read printed sermons. I am now reading the third and
fourth volumes of Mr. Bourn's, of Norwich, which I like much.
They are a set on the parables.

   I am glad to hear that you have some hope of the conti
nuance of your college, which I heard was despaired of ; but
you must not leave it. I hope every thing goes on well in the
congregation, the welfare of which I have much at heart. I
have written to Mr. Travers, Mr. Palmer, and Mr. Spurrell,
who laments his want of rational Christian society. In that
respect he seems to be worse situated than I am here.

   P. S. Did I leave any volumes of Montfaucon? Mr.
Russell is safely arrived at New York.*

acceptable to me, as expressing your approbation of my conduct
in choosing to settle here, rather than go to Philadelphia. I my
self am more than ever satisfied that in this I do right; but I
earnestly wished that you might see the thing in the same light.
Every thing here is by no means what I wish; but there is
a good prospect of their growing better in all respects, and in
a short time, both with respect to usefulness and happiness,
which go together.

   My prospect is much improved by the arrival of Mr. Russell
and his family, who are now with us, and seem to like the
place so well as to settle in it. He has, however, taken a house
in Philadelphia, where he will reside in the winter, and where
it is settled that I am to be his guest, as long as I choose to
continue there, which will add much to my satisfaction. He
will also have packages coming to him hither at least twice a
year, and in these any thing may be sent to me with great
convenience. Besides this, we shall soon have four new cir
cumstances in our favour, a market, a stage-coach to Philadel
phia, a corporation, and a college. The third, judging from
your ideas, you may think to be no advantage ; but here it is
found to be a great one, as the majority can then bind the
minority, in removing nuisances, and making regulations for the
convenience of the whole. In these respects, Mr. Russell will
be a treasure to us; and his activity and public spirit is in
creased, rather than abated, since I saw him last. His daugh
ters and his son are much improved by the scenes they have
gone through, which have been very various, and some of them
very distressing.

    "We all think ourselves very happy in this peaceful retreat,
which will now be more desirable than ever. We only wish
for the society of a few of our friends, for their sakes, as well
as our own, till the storms in Europe be blown over. The
 difference between the two countries is infinitely to our ad
vantage, notwithstanding some things that are against us ; and
 these all arise from the unexampled prosperity of the country
 in general ; I mean the high price of labour, and the consequent
 difficulty of getting servants.

 .318 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   What I wrote to Mr. Clarke,* I ilo not recollect, but I wish
you could yourself see the letter. The same things do not
always appear to us in the same light, and I might wish to
discourage his coming, thinking him not qualified to do well
here. New-comers labour under great difficulties. The ex
penses at the sea-ports are enormous. Much time and much
money must be spent before a person can be settled, and more
still before any farm can be productive. There are, then, many
chances against persons unacquainted with the country ; but
artisans of all kinds, and labourers, find immediate and pro
fitable employment. As to the law, which is Mr. Clarke's
profession, no person can practise till he has been in the coun
try four years. This materially affects Mr. Cooper.

   I thought, till Mr. Russell informed me to the contrary, that
you had got the edition of my answer to Mr. Paine, which
was printed at Philadelphia. Mr. Russell says he left his
copy with Mr. Paine at Paris, who promised to return it, but
did not. He could not tell what he thought of it. He was
very angry at the other answers.

   I have received a box from Mr. Jones, and the medal, on my
departure from England, and the head in a frame,f but not the
newspapers, or any books or pamphlets. All accounts from
England are now peculiarly interesting to us ; and, owing to
the rains, which have stopped the post, we have had no news
this long time. We hope, however, that there must be peace,
from the impossibility of carrying on the war ; and in this I
shall greatly rejoice, whatever I may think on the subject of
prophecy. I have no thoughts, however, of publishing any
thing on the subject you mention, though I am particularly
considering the prophecies that are fulfilled, and forming a
general idea of what is to come ; but as to the particulars, and
the time, I believe nothing but the events will give us any
satisfactory light. It is impossible, however, to forbear form
ing conjectures on a subject so very interesting.

   I rejoice that you are going to the north, as it will, I doubt
not, be a source of satisfaction to you and your friends. I shall
continue to write at least once a month. We have had an
uncommonly wet and unhealthy summer all over the continent.
No person remembers the like. On this account we have not
been able to make bricks to build my house.

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Nov. 9, 1795.

I am very happy to hear just now of your safe return from

your northern excursion, and hope you will live to enjoy many

more of them. I am glad that you mention receiving three of

my letters.

Nothing in this life would give me so much pleasure as the

visit you mention to you and my friends in England ; but I fear

it is not to be thought of. I think of you without ceasing,

perhaps more than I ought, considering too much the satisfac

tion I had when near you, and the little, in comparison, that I

have here; but I hope I am resigned to the disposal of a

wise and good Providence, believing it to superintend and

direct every thing. A train of circumstances, no doubt for

good purposes, has brought me hither; and having all my

books and instruments with me, here I must remain, and I hope

I shall be useful and happy, though not in so great a degree as

I fondly wished, and that every thing will improve with time.

My principal resource is in employment, in which I am as

regular as in any part of my life.

At present, my principal employment is the continuation of

  * A present from Mr. Parker. See I. 216. There was afterwards fabri
cated for Mr. Parker " a burning-glass of most extraordinary powers.
Platina, iron, steel, flint-stone, were melted in a few seconds, and a diamond,
weighing ten grains, exposed to this lens for thirty minutes, was reduced to
six, during which operation it opened and foliated like the leaves of a flower,
and emitted whitish fumes ; and when closed again, it bore a polish, and re
tained its form." See Nelson's " History of Islington," ( 1829,) p. 196.

 my Church History, of which I have transcribed more than I
 have printed, having brought it down to the conclusion of the
 Council of Constance. L'Enfant's Councils, with which you
 supplied me, are of unspeakable use in what I wrote lately, and
 what I am now composing. With Mosheim I am more than
 ever dissatisfied. His work was originally Lectures on the
 History, and that plan could never suit the History itself.

    Before I go to Philadelphia, I intend to compose a new set of
 discourses on the Evidences of Revelation, and shall find some
difficulty in varying my plan, as I have published so much on
that subject, though I believe that not much of that is known
 in this country, at least in this part of it. I am also preparing
a View of the Mosaic Institutions, compared with the idola
trous systems of the times, which will be more new ; but I find
I want several books, though I have enow for a course of po
pular sermons on the subject.

   I wish you would get me Reland's Jewish Antiquities, which
I did not replace after the riots ; Jablonski's Pantheon, or any
thing that occurs to you relating to the subject. Send me also
a Juvenal. I want also Apuleius, with notes. Here no books,
such as scholars want, can be had ; for the few you happen to
see in the shops the most extravagant prices are asked. Indeed,
the dearness of every thing in this country is hardly to be ac
counted for, and prices are continually advancing.

   Mr. Russell is now at Boston; and from a letter I have just
received from him, I fear there is little prospect of his settling
here, he gives so great a preference to New England. This is
a circumstance not a little unfavourable to me, as the want of
such society as I was used to in England is one of the greatest
that I feel here.

   The state of society is such as you cannot well form an
idea of. It is quite unlike what I had imagined, or can well
describe, so different it is from that of England. I think my
self, notwithstanding this, very happy here, when I read your
newspapers. I have just received the large parcel you sent,
and peruse them with great avidity, as I do every thing from
England ; but as yet they arrive very slowly. A parcel has
been at Philadelphia about three months, which I am expect

iug every day. We hope in another year to have a stage-coach.
If Mr. Russell settle here, we shall have that convenience, and
many others. His activity and public spirit are much wanted
here; but if he be at Boston, he might as well be in England.
His letter did not reach me in less than three weeks. The
post here is very irregular and uncertain. Peace, and a con
sequent free intercourse with all parts of Europe, will do us
the greatest service, and surely the war cannot last always.

   With every good wish to my country, and all that are in it,
I am yours and Mrs. Lindsey's most affectionately.*

                   To Mr. Russell.f

       Dear Sir,   Northumberland, Nov. 10, 1795.

We were very glad to hear of your safe arrival at Boston,

which we only did the last post, there having been no post the

week before. I am happy to find you were so well pleased

with your visit, though, in consequence of it, we can hardly

expect to see you any more at Northumberland.

In a variety of respects, as well as liberality, we must yield

to New England ; but a train of circumstances have brought

me hither, and it is impossible for me to remove, and our diffi

culties are not so great but we may get through them, though

not so soon as if we had had the aid of your activity, as well as

experience and public spirit. I shall certainly regret the want

of your society, but 1 shall hope to meet you sometimes at

Philadelphia, and perhaps you may again pay us a short visit

here.

We have had a very sickly season, but so it has been through

all this part of the continent. My wife suffered extremely.

Harry, too, has had the ague, and is not yet well ; but the

damp weather being now over, the country in general begins to

be healthy again.

The society at Boston would certainly be most agreeable to

me, but we cannot have every thing we wish for. I had three

sons, as well as myself, to settle, and had not the means of doing

it in any of the larger towns ; and in the back country I do
not know whether I could, on the whole, be better than where
I am. However, I am satisfied with the situation, such as it
is. I have leisure for my pursuits ; and with this, even with
out society, I shall not be unhappy. I believe there is the
hand of a good Providence in every thing, and therefore I
hope I am come hither for good, and I- would not make my
own gratification my principal object. Besides, in any part of
this country I should feel as a stranger, being too old to form
new attachments; though, on this account, the loss of old ones,
which I cannot replace, is more sensibly felt. But, sooner or
later, this must take place with respect to all our most valued
connexions in this world. The parting with Mr. Lindsey, and
my other friends in England, has made these reflections fa
miliar to me; and as I hope to meet all that I value again
where we shall not separate any more, I feel less than I could
have expected from that absence, which is only temporary.

   I should much rejoice to see Mr. B. Vaughan,* but it would
be very unreasonable to expect it. He would enter into all
my views, theological, philosophical, or political ; but he must
have a larger sphere than this place can furnish, and I am
getting too old for him.

   With every good wish, in which we all join, to yourself and
family, I am yours affectionately.

   P. S. I beg my best respects to Mr. Vaughan, Mr. Freeman,
and Mr. R. Vaughan.f

Dear Friend,       Northumberland, Dec. 6, 1795.

I send this by Dr. Young, who has been a physician in this

place, but has left off practice, and will make the tour of a

good part of Europe. A more friendly man I have hardly ever

known ; and I hope that, though we lose him for the present,

we shall get him again, and that he will build and settle in this

town. If, by means of your acquaintance, you can procure

  him a sight of any thing he wishes to see, you will oblige me
 very much.

    I send by him a copy of a paper I am sending to the Phi
 losophical Society at Philadelphia,* unless by landing at Liver
 pool he should see Birmingham before he reaches London, in
 which case he will forward this letter, without the paper,
 leaving it with my friends of the Lunar Society there, f If
 you get it first, you will please to forward it to Mr. Galton
 the first convenient opportunity. It contains several new ex
 periments, which must be thought of importance, especially
 with respect to the new French system, with which, though
 universally adopted, I see more and more reason to be dis
 satisfied.

    I have much more to do in my laboratory ; but I am under
 the necessity of shutting up for the winter, as the frost will
make it impossible to keep my water fit for use, without such
provision as I cannot make, till I get my own laboratory pre
pared on purpose, when I hope to be able to work alike, winter
and summer. I have materials for another paper, not yet
composed, of which I shall take the first opportunity of send
ing you a copy.

   The difficulty, and what is more, the uncertainty of the con
veyance of any thing across the Atlantic, is a great drawback
from the satisfaction I might have in this place. I have just
seen Mr. Fawcett's Poem on War,J in a copy sent to Mr.
Cooper, from Mr. Hawkes, of Manchester. It discovers a most
exuberant imagination, but so many words and phrases for one
idea, I never saw before. Some parts are very affecting.§

   It is not long since I received the copy of your edition of
my answer to Paine. I read the preface with much emotion,
from a sense of the friendship to me expressed in it. If I had
laboured ten times more than I have, I should not have thought
it too much for such a reward. I hope that before this you

will have got my "Observations on the Increase of Infidelity," as
1 have se.it copies of it various ways. It is a subject now very
interesting, and much more might be observed with respect to
it. As it must have engaged your attention, and that of Mr.
Belsham, I cannot help wishing you would reprint that tract,
with such additions, &c, as may occur to you.

   I have now completely transcribed, as well as composed, the
continuation of my Church History, to the Reformation ; but I
have yet much to do in revising it, and comparing different
accounts. I have also to draw up an account of writers in all
the periods, and a short sketch of political events, so that I
think it advisable to defer the printing of the work a year
longer. The farther I advance, the more convinced I am of
the importance of the work, and I shall spare no pains to make
it as perfect as I can.

   I must at present, however, suspend all farther progress in
this work, for the sake of preparing some discourses, to deliver
in Philadelphia. They will relate chiefly to the evidences of
revelation, aud I must contrive to make them different from
any that I have printed. There is something very remarkable
in the progress of infidelity in this country, but I am more
astonished with respect to some particular persons in England,
and especially Unitarians. Others, however, at least a suffi
cient number, will rise up, better qualified to fill the places of
those whose apostacy we regret the most. Mr. Hawkes says
there are many Unitarians in the academy at Northampton,*
and others may arise where we least expect them. In the
mean time, the apostacy of some will try and purify and in
crease the zeal of others. This state of things will also pro
 duce better and clearer defences of revelation than any we
 have yet seen ; and the opponents will be more effectually con
 founded by the reason to which they appeal; and, what is of
 more .consequence, the superiority of the truly Christian cha
 racter, above that of unbelievers, will be more apparent to
 the truly serious and discerning. Christianity will lose no-

thing by the apostacy of the luke-warm, the ill-informed, or
 the worldly-minded.

   Since I wrote the above we have heard from Miss Russells,
in which they say nothing of Boston, but enlarge much in
praise of Middletown, in Connecticut, from which they write,
so that they seem disposed to settle there. I shall, however,
meet him in Philadelphia.

   I rejoice to hear so good an account of Messrs. Palmer and
Muir,* and hope their exile will serve for the furtherance of
the gospel, and the cause of liberty. I hope that you or Mr.
Johnson pay my subscription of five guineas annually to them,
and two to Mr. Winterbotham.f I also wish Mr. Johnson will
send me all his publications. I see by the papers that he is
very industrious. Happily, these persecutions are now over.
A person lately from England says, nothing hurt the interest
of the Court so much as the issue of those prosecutions, from
which so much was expected, and nothing produced. Still,
howeve , I fear that peace is at a great distance. The landing
of so many British troops on the coast of France looks like a
determination to push the war to all extremites. With you,
the fate of that measure, which we have but just heard of, is
already known.

   I hope you have, long before this, received the letter that
contained one for Mrs. Rayner, and also, that the Duke of
Grafton and Mr. Tayleur have received those I wrote to them.
Mrs. P. is recovered from a very long illness, and we are all
tolerably well.J

To Rev. R. Scolefield.§

      Dear Friend,
   That I have not written to you, as well as to my other
friends, before this time, you will not, I am sure, ascribe to
any disrespect, but a presumption that you would, in some
way or other, hear every thing concerning me that was known
to others, and it did not seem very material by what channel

the intelligence was conveyed. Indeed, except a general out
line of my new situation, which you could not well miss
having, I had nothing of much importance to communicate.

   I have at length found a settlement quiet enough, and where
I shall have more leisure for all my pursuits than ever I had
yet ; though I have not as yet such a sphere of active exertion
as I had in England. At first this gave me some uneasiness,
as I wished for nothing more than to conclude my race in the
same manner in which I had run it. But it has pleased the
Sovereign Disposer of all things to order it otherwise, and at
present I have no regular business as a preacher. I do preach,
however, occasionally, and we have always a service among
ourselves, though attended by very few, every Lord's-day, and
I shall spend about two months every year at Philadelphia, or
some of the larger towns, and preach all the time I am there.
But if I have done any good, it has not been so much by
preaching as by writing, and in that way I can do more than
ever, if there be any call for it. I can also prosecute my ex
periments to more advantage than you would imagine, though
not so well as when I was at Birmingham or Hackney. The
person who takes this letter to England, takes to Philadelphia
a paper of experiments, which I have made since my arrival,
for the Philosophical Society in that place, and I shall very
soon send another, so that I am not idle in this way. When
my house is built, and my laboratory completed, I shall hope
to do more still.

   In theology I have printed a few small articles, which you
either have seen or will see, and I have continued my Church
History, to the Reformation. In a year or two more, if nothing
of more importance interfere, I may bring the History to the
present time, or near it, and then I hope I shall have done an
useful work.

   The defection of so many Unitarians in England astonishes
me. Still, however, none, I believe, have fallen who ever
were serious Christians ; and that men whose chief object is
advancement in the world, or who have a disposition to gaiety
or pleasure, should become unbelievers, is surely not sur
prising.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.                                    327

    The person who takes this is Dr. Young, who has been a
 physician in this place, but has a strong passion to make the
 tour of Europe. He is determined to see Birmingham, being
 fond of curious arts. I shall take it as a favour to myself if
 you will procure him a sight of any thing he may wish to see.
 To me he has been the most friendly of men. I hope he will
 return and settle here, after all. If so, he will be again my
 near neighbour.

   Should peace return, I cannot express the pleasure it would
give to pay my friends in England a visit before I die, and
sometimes I do not despair of it. In that case I shall certainly
visit Birmingham, which I take it for granted I may then do
without any apprehension of danger.

   We often think and talk of you and your sister, and the
satisfaction we had in your neighbourhood. I give you joy on
the marriage of your niece, and hope it will be a happy con
nexion in all respects. My sons are all farmers, and, on the
whole, we are already very comfortable, and hope our situation
will improve every year. Mr. Russell will hardly settle here.
He seems to give the preference to the New-England States,
which I regret much. But I do not want much society, and
my wife is still more indifferent to it. Many of the people are
as sensible and friendly as any in England. But we did not
come hither for the sake of improving in that respect, and
cannot be disappointed.

   Give my best respects to your sister, Mr. Coates, and any of
our common friends.

   P. S. Do not fail to write to me, directing to John Vaughan,
Esq., Philadelphia.*

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Dec 17, 1795.

I think that in my last, of the 7th instant, I mentioned

Harry's being indisposed, in consequence, we imagined, of his

attending his lime-kiln in the night. It proved to be a more

serious illness than we or the physician imagined. He grew
worse till the 11th, when he died, it is now almost certain, of
an inflammation and mortification of the stomach. Having
had little or no apprehension of danger till near the time of his
death, the shock, you may suppose, was very great, and being
the first event of the kind, I am affected more than I thought I
should have been, though I have unspeakable consolation in
believing that nothing can befal us without the appointment of
the best of Beings, and that we shall meet our departed chil
dren and friends in a better state.*

   He had recovered from an ague, which was common in this
part of the country, this summer ; but after this he had fre
quent colds, from exposing himself to cold and wet, and not
taking proper care of himself afterwards, which certainly laid
the foundation of his subsequent and last illness.

   Had he been bred a farmer, he could not have been more
assiduous than he was. He was admired by every body for
his unremitting labour, as well as good judgment, in the
management of his business, though only eighteen years old.
With respect to his ardour in his pursuits, he was more like
what I was at his age than any of my children, though our
objects were very different. He was strictly virtuous, and was
uncommonly beloved by all that worked under him; and it
was always said that he was better served than any other
farmer in this country. He had a sense of honour and genero
sity which, I am sorry to say, is not common here. I hope,
therefore, that he had the foundation of something in his cha
racter, on which a good superstructure may be raised hereafter-
We thought his temper, and even his looks, altered for the
worse by the severe illness he had at Hackney; but it is
remarkable, that some time before his death, (as his mother,
who never left him, says,) and very visibly afterwards, he had
the same sweet, placid, and even cheerful countenance, that he
had when he was young, much like that of his sister, whom,
at that time, he greatly resembled. I never saw the counte
nance of a dead person so pleasing, and so it continued till he

was buried. Even this seemingly trifling circumstance gives
me much satisfaction. I know you and Mrs. Lindsey will ex
cuse my writing so much about myself and family. I could
not write so much to any body else.

   I am composing, with as much care as I can, a set of dis
courses, to be delivered at Philadelphia, on the evidences o*
revelation, and similar subjects. I have finished two, and have
got materials for a third, on the enormities of the ancient hea
then worship, of which the generality of modern unbelievers
know nothing at all, and which are strangely coloured over by
Voltaire and others ; while they load the Jewish system with
every abuse. In another discourse I shall shew the superiority
of that system to any others.

   My wife is much affected, as you will suppose, by the death
of Harry ; but, at the same time, discovers proper fortitude.
By her constant attendance upon him, she has made herself
ill, but seems to be getting better.'

Dear Sir,    Northumberland, Dec. 30, 1795.

Yours of the 6th instant I received only yesterday, and find

you had not received one that I directed to you at Boston.

This, I hope, will find you safely arrived at Philadelphia,

where I hope to join you in about six weeks ; an event to

which I look forward with pleasure.

Since I wrote last we have lost poor Harry. What we feel

on this occasion you will judge from your own feelings, in a

similar situation. Being the first loss of the kind that I have

experienced, it affects me very much indeed, and my wife no

less. I am, however, perfectly satisfied that this, as well as

every other dispensation of Providence, is right, and will

hereafter appear to have been so. I do not, however, at all

think of him as to this world, or as any particular loss to myself;

but only as to another, where I have no doubt I shall meet

him again, and as I believe he had a good mind, and no vices,

· Orig. MS.                          t Philadelphia.

I hope to meet him in favourable circumstances. He died a
sacrifice to a want of care of himself, exposing himself to cold
and wet; and the nature of his illness was not at all understood
till it was too late. It was an inflammation, 1 do not doubt,
and mortification of the stomach, or some of the intestines.

   My wife is now far from being well, and I fear is not likely
to be so soon. Should she be no better than she is at present,
I cannot think of leaving her : otherwise, you may depend
upon seeing me at the time I have mentioned. I am compos
ing a set of discourses on subjects relating to the evidences of
revelation. Six I have nearly transcribed, and I think eight
will be enow.

   You speak very highly of Middletown, as you did of Boston,
and that part of the country in general. I therefore suppose
you will settle there, and I sincerely wish you much happiness
there, though the circumstance will be felt by me as a dis
appointment of a very sensible kind. If I was undetermined, I
would certainly choose to fix wherever you should be ; but if
I was not so fixed here as never to think of removing, which is
the case, I should, from any thing that I have heard of the
eastern country, give the preference to this, in most respects,
though not in all. However, while I am able to travel, I shall
hope to meet you every winter, and with this I must be
satisfied.

   With every good wish to yourself and family, in which my
wife heartily joins me, I am, dear Sir, yours affectionately.*

I am happy in having two of your letters before me, and as

many of Mr. Belsham's. The satisfaction I have from this is

what you can hardly conceive, without being in my situation.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLETY.  331

  I am glad that you have got my Observations on the Increase
of Infidelity, and that you like any part of the pamphlet so
well as to think it worth while to reprint it. You think my
expectation of the second coming of Christ, and the millenium,
a little visionary, and therefore do not wish to have them
brought forward. However, the sentiment that offends you in
this pamphlet, is in my last Fast Sermon, and more enlarged
upon.* It can hardly be thought by any person who reads
my publications, or this last pamphlet, that I have any doubt
with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence of revelation.
But my doubt relates to the sufficient degree of attention that
we can procure to it, and without this it is impossible that it
should produce its proper effect. I think it is clear that our
Saviour supposed, not only that his second coming would be
most unexpected, but that, at the time, there would be a very
general unbelief with respect to its ever taking place. And
what he thought proper to intimate, I see no impropriety or
inconvenience in saying after him.

   1 must, however, acknowledge, I never had such apprehen
sions of the difficulty of engaging a sufficient degree of atten
tion to the evidences of Christianity as I have had of late.
Recent facts force attention, and this was the case at the
 promulgation of Christianity. But though, in several respects,
 the evidence is even stronger now than it was then, it does not
 obtrude itself. It requires a voluntary effort to attend to it ;
 and many things so pre-occupy the mind, as wholly to prevent
 that attention being given it. We must not, however, despair,
 and some good will result from every endeavour. I shall,
 therefore, devote myself chiefly to this object, in some measure
 flattering myself that I am particularly called to it, and let my
 success be ever so little, I shall, with peculiar satisfaction, give
 my time and best application to it.

    I am now on my way to Philadelphia, with a new set of
 Discourses on the Evidences of Revelation, which I shall pro
 bably publish soon after, if any person will run the risk of
 printing them. They are different from the set I have already

· See W. XV.- 540.

published, and may well be subjoined to them. I will just
mention the subjects.

   1. The Importance of Religion. 2. The Superior Value of
Revealed Religion, compared to Natural Religion. 3, 4. A
Comparison of the Heath n Religion to the Jewish and Chris
tian. 5, 6. The Superiority of the Principles of Revealed
Religion to the Maxims and Opinions of the Heathen Philoso
phers. 7, 8. The Evidence of the Miracles in favour of
the Mosaic and Christian Dispensations, considered jointly.
9, 10. The Evidence from Prophecy. 11. The Impossibility,
from Internal Evidence, of Jesus being an Impostor. 12. The
Moral Influence of Christianity. The fifth and sixth Dis
courses I was led to, by reading Dr. Enfield's History of Philo
sophy, which is a pleasing and valuable work; and I hope you
will think I have made a good use of it.

   Besides the above-mentioned Discourses, I have another,
which I once intended to be the first that I should preach in
Philadelphia or New York. This I shall, if I see occasion,
preach after the preceding. In the former I shall appear in
the character of a Christian, and in this in that of an
Unitarian.

accompanied by my daughter-in-law, in my son's Yarmouth

accommodated. We found him engaged to drink tea with the

as in any private family. He invited me to come at any time,

I wish all my friends, with you, were here, provided they
could subsist and be happy. But great numbers find them
selves, on one account or other, disappointed, and return, I
understand, with very unfavourable ideas of the country ; and
for this I see no remedy. I have been careful not to encourage
any person to emigrate, though I admire this country very
much.

   I have the use of Mr. Winchester's pulpit every morning,
and yesterday preached my first sermon to a very numerous,
respectable, and very attentive audience.* I was told there was

  * In 1822, Mrs. Hart, of Exeter, who had been one of Dr. Priestley's con
gregation at Philadelphia, communicated to her brother, Mr. Samuel Hart,
these interesting recollections :

  " It is now nearly five and twenty years since I was in America, having
sailed therefrom for England in the spring of 1798, and in the lapse of a
quarter of a century many circumstances have faded from my mind : at your
request, however, I will, with cheerfulness, endeavour to call back to remem
brance the occurrences of those long-departed days. It is ever a pleasure to
me to reflect on the character of the late Mr. Winchester, in which were
combined uniformity of Christian conduct and deportment, with great urba
nity and benevolence of heart; and what renders his memory peculiarly
estimable to me, was that artlessness of manners, singularly his own, and an
unaffected liberality which he manifested towards Dr. Priestley, the first win
ter the Doctor came down to Philadelphia to preach, and for which I was
quite unprepared.

   " The congregations that attended were so numerous that the house could
not contain them, so that as many were obliged to stand as sit, and even the
door-ways were crowded with people. Mr. Vice-President Adams was
among the regular attendants, and, to the best of my recollection, Mr. Win
chester was never absent, and he constantly gave out the hymns when that
excellent man Dr. P. did not read them himself.

   " On the floor, directly in front of the pulpit, and close to it, was placed a
long seat, with back and arms, and a table before it : on this seat, which was
generally occupied by elderly men, members of the Universalist Society, Mr.
Winchester would take his place, unless he went into the pulpit with the
Doctor, it being large enough to hold several : this I need not say was a
strong mark of friendly-heartedness and liberality, and, in fact, gave umbrage,
together with his acting as the Doctor's clerk, to some of his own people."

a great proportion of the members of Congress, though the
notice of my preaching was very imperfect. I see a good
prospect of establishing an Unitarian congregation in this
city, and have promised to officiate every winter without any
salary, which I shall absolutely refuse, provided I can lodge
with a friend, which, I fancy, will always be easy. We only
want a reputable minister to reside all the year. I hope, how
ever, to establish, pro tempore, at least, a society with a liturgy,
and without any minister. Mr. Russell thinks it very prac
ticable. I propose to be here two months, and in that time
shall feel my way better.

   I cannot accept of your generous benefaction, except as a
loan, or for some public use in this country. The times are
difficult enough with you, and must add to your expenses.

   I shall probably write again soon. I hope I shall come here
to good purpose. Yours and Mrs. Lindsey's most affection
ately.*

                   To Rev. T. Belsham.f

Dear Sir,          Philadelphia, March 5, 1796.

I mentioned to Mr. Lindsey the plan of a course of ser

mons I am delivering here, on the Evidences of Revealed

Religion, different from those that I published in England,

and dedicated to you. J I have delivered three of them to very

crowded audiences, great numbers not being able to get into

the place. I am told that the greater part of the members of

Congress are my hearers, and intend to continue so. I have

promised to come two or three months in the winter during

the sitting of Congress, till a resident minister can be provided.

But I shall be able to write more fully on this subject before I

leave this place.

Many persons, I find, attend no public worship, not from

infidelity, but because there is no place where they can attend

with satisfaction, or without disgust ; and in general their infi

delity arises from ignorance and inattention to the subject, and

not from a disposition to cavil, so that I have much more hopes
of them than I had. But there is a great want of sensible
preachers. As many persons have expressed a wish to see the
sermons I am delivering, I shall print them while I am here,
and send you copies the first opportunity.

   I am much obliged to you for your notes on the Revelation.
It is impossible not to give much attention to the subject of
prophecy in these times. The most difficult circumstance
appears to me to be the death, resurrection, and ascension of
the witnesses, which may yet be future. I cannot say that I
agree with you with respect to the flood which helped the
woman, though you had the hint from me. I have just seen a
treatise, entitled Harmonie des Prophe'ties, by C. de Loys,
printed at Lausanne, (1774,) which I like much, though he
was mistaken in predicting the fall of the Turkish empire,
1769, or the war which commenced at that time. His illus
tration of the prophecies concerning the papal power is parti
cularly excellent.

   I have no intention of publishing any thing on the subject of
prophecy, though I much wish to make up my mind with
respect to some particulars, especially the eleventh of Daniel.
They who apply all the latter part of it to Antiochus Epipha-
nes, advance many plausible things; but I am persuaded that
hypothesis will not do, as it is immediately connected with the
restoration of the Jews in the twelfth chapter. There must be
great chasms in the prophecy, but that is not unprecedented,
and all the great features of history are noticed.

   Here I find a large box from Mr. Johnson, which has lain
in the Custom House some months. It contains your brother's
excellent History, which I have hurried through, and admire
exceedingly. I shall read the whole at leisure in the country.
The box contains many other articles, and I cannot give you
an idea of the satisfaction I feel in opening a package of
English books and pamphlets. It is a treasure to me. I shall
now put things in better train for their being transmitted
sooner. The officers at the Custom House are disposed to be
as civil as possible.

   We have had no arrivals from England about a month, and

                        To Rev. T. Lindsev-I

Dear Friend,  Philadelphia, April 8, 1796.

After having had no advices from Europe for seventy-five

days, (the longest interval of the kind that any person here

remembers,) we all rejoice in hearing news, and I in receiving

letters from you and Mr. Belsham.

I think I wrote to Mr. Belsham after I had been here one

Sunday. I have now preached six, and with more acceptance,

if I may judge from appearances, than I could have imagined,

the congregations having always been numerous, and most re

spectable ; and it is evident that I am heard with more atten

tion than was given to me in any place before. A consider

able proportion of the members of Congress, and all the

principal officers of state, are my constant hearers. As Mr.

Adams, the Vice-President, is most punctual in his attendance,

and an old acquaintance and correspondent, I shall dedicate the

discourses I am delivering to him.J

I am myself surprised to find to how great a degree the

violent prejudice that had been raised against me is overcome.

Many of my hearers were those who were the most prejudiced,

and great numbers such as never attended any public worship

before. I daily hear of the impression that my discourses

make on those who were the most averse to every thing re

lating to religion. There is no doubt now of our being able

to form a very respectable society of Unitarians, and we are

taking measures for the purpose. There is really a noble

harvest here. We want nothing but able labourers.

I have received a large box, containing a treasure of things,

from Mr. Johnson. I have also just now received a box, con

taining, I believe, the books you mention in your last, and

which are most welcome; but I wish I had mentioned par
ticular books, (though I might not know in all respects what
I wanted,) for I had Giannone in Italian, which I read, readily,
and shall not fail to make use of it; but really Fleury seems to
contain almost every fact, of consequence, and, with respect
to the claims of the court of Rome, is as unexceptionable as
Giannone. I hope I shall make the work an useful one ; but
I must have recourse to my friends (and Mr. Russell will be
one) to assist with respect to the printing of it. My friends
here undertake the printing of the sermons. I freely give my
labour, but I cannot well (as I could wish) do more. I thank
you for the inclosures. Every thing from England interests
me.

   Neither my wife nor myself can cease to think, with con
siderable emotion, of poor Harry ; and the event makes us
more indifferent to life than before. While I live, I shall en
deavour to be as useful as I can; and, though with this draw
back, I am very happy, and, I hope, truly resigned.*

             To Rev. T. BelSHaiw.f

Dear Sir,                    Philadelphia, April 8, 1796.

My letters cannot give more pleasure to you than yours do

to me, though sometimes their contents are not of a pleasant

nature. I am particularly concerned for the fate of the college^

which seems to be unavoidable, but I rejoice that your con

tinuance at Hackney is secured by the congregation, the flou

rishing state of which gives me particular pleasure.

I shall always think with great satisfaction of the time I

spent with you. It was indeed, on the whole, perhaps the

happiest period of my life.§ Here, though I am as happy as

this country can make me, and I have great reason to be

thankful for my situation, both as an asylum from persecution,

and as promising a sphere of usefulness, I do not feel as I did

in England. The separation from old friends, and the im

possibility at my time of life of supplying their place by new

ones, is sensibly felt, but this circumstance makes me think

more than ever of the time when I hope to meet you all again,
and this I find to be an increasing source of satisfaction. The
death of Harry, unexpected till the day in which it happened,
contributes much to give my thought this turn. I think
I can say with truth, that hardly five minutes have passed in
which it does not in some way or other occur to me ; but it is
only a pleasing kind of melancholy with which I am affected
by it.

   Mr. Lindsey will tell you how my preaching is received
here, as I write to him this opportunity, and you will see him.
The attention that is given to me far exceeds my expectations,
and I hope will prepare the way for something more perma
nent. What strikes my hearers most, is the comparison I have
at some length drawn between the religion of the Hebrews and
that of the Heathens, and also of their philosophy, which I
have now finished.* Every thing that I have advanced on these
subjects seemed to be perfectly new to almost every body here.

   Do not fail to send me Mr. Cogan's tract, f I have received your
edition of my " Observatious on the Increase of Infidelity."!
I am glad that Mr. Lindsey has published it as he liked best,
though I do not see his reasons for all his omissions. An edi
tion of 14,000 copies of Paine's Second Part is just received
here. I think to notice it in my preface. It is too absurd to
reply to in a separate work. Mr. Wakefield's Reply is nothing
but an example of ingenious modes of expressing contempt.§

   I rejoice in your design to write to me every month. I
hope you will keep to it, whether I be so punctual or not.||

 bringing me no letters. Others, however, are daily expected,
 and I indulge hopes.

    I have now delivered all my discourses on the Evidences of
 Revelation, except the closing one, which will be of a practical
 nature. I shall also give another in the character of an Uni
 tarian, which is universally expected, and for which my hear
 ers are now sufficiently prepared.

    All the profit that may arise from the sale of the Discourses
will be appropriated to the fitting up a place for Unitarian
 worship, which we have in view. The next winter I am to
have the use of the University common hall, which is more
central than the place I have used. It is generally used for
 the accommodation of particular congregations, when their
places of worship are repairing, or for strangers. By the deed,
a very strict Calvinistic creed is required to be subscribed, but
it has never been actually required, except when, for other
reasons, the trustees wished to exclude a preacher. It was
apprehended by some that I should have been excluded on this
pretence ; and there were some, especially the Episcopalians,
who, I doubt not, wished to exclude me ; but my discourses
having been very popular, and altogether unexceptionable, not
one of the board chose to make any objection.

   I had a trial of the candour of my audience, when, in one of
my discourses, I detailed the opinions of the heathen philoso
phers, and, among the rest, their doctrine of a soul distinct
from the body, as contrary to that of the Scriptures. I gave
satisfaction, I was told, to many who were most attached to
the common opinion, and who had declared that nothing I
could say should convince them, and I believe I did not give
the least offence to any person. I had prepared them for it,
by apprizing them, at the close of the preceding discourse, that
my argument would make it necessary for me to touch upon
that subject, which would probably shock their prejudices.
In consequence of this notice, the place was exceedingly
crowded, and the attention given to me very great. I have
little doubt now but that I shall be heard with the same can
dour when I deliver my last discourse, though on subjects
which would otherwise give the greatest offence.

   The books you have been so good as to send me will be ex
ceedingly useful to me ; but I shall consider them as yours, to
be disposed of as you shall hereafter direct. The Juvenal was
the same that I had lost. When I return to Northumberland,
I shall stick close to my Church History. If you can think of
any thing that will throw light on the History, near the present
time, be so good as to send it.

   After a long discussion, the House of Representatives have
voted, by a majority of three, for carrying the treaty with
England into execution.* Having much leisure, I have at
tended to hear much bf the debate, and have heard as good
speaking as in your House of Commons, and much more de
corum. A Mr. Amos speaks as well as Mr. Burke ; but, in
general, the speakers are more argumentative, and less rhe
torical. And whereas there are not with you more than ten or
a dozen tolerable speakers, here every member is capable of
speaking, which makes interesting debates tedious. A good
account of the speeches is taken by short-hand writers, who
have a desk for the purpose, and, I believe, many of the speak
ers correct them afterwards. As the speeches on this occa
sion are printed, I will send them to you. The members for
the northern states are in general in favour of the treaty, and
those from the southern, against it. I am well acquainted with
both, and they do not avoid one another, as the heads of parties
do in England ; and when once any thing is decided by fair
voting, all contention ceases.

   I leave this place in less than a fortnight; but if, in the
mean time, I hear from you, I shall write again. We long to
hear of any thing that looks like peace, but I fear it is at a
great distance. This country is getting rich by the folly of
Europe.f

   Dr. Priestley was now returning to Northumberland,
where he had left Mrs. Priestley, whom a disinclination to
reside in the American citiesj had deterred from accom
panying him. For the following " Recollections and

 Anecdotes" of his visit to Philadelphia, I am indebted
 to a gentleman of that city, a near and intelligent ob
 server, whose very friendly communications, which I
 shall here quote, I have had, already, occasion to ac

 knowledge :*

    Dr. Priestley was remarkably frank and easy of access, and,
 in company, perfectly unassuming, never attempting to take
 the lead in conversation, but always ready to accommodate
 himself to the taste and wishes of others. He was neither
 taciturn nor talkative ; and it may be truly said, that whatever
prejudices had been previously entertained against him, on
account of his theological opinions, by those who knew him
only as a polemical writer, were removed on a personal ac
quaintance.

   During a time of great political excitement, he dined with
a Presbyterian, whose political opinions were similar to his
own. Among other guests, were two Presbyterian ministers,
whose politics were opposite to those of Dr. Priestley and his
host. When the junior clergyman was asked for a toast, he
gave " Unity of sentiment in religion and politics." Soon
after, Dr. Priestley being called on, he looked significantly
first at the master of the house, and then at the author of the
former toast, and proposed " Candour, when there cannot be
unity of sentiment in religion and politics." The young man
felt abashed, and soon retired.

   With the sedateness suited to his age and professional cha
racter, was combined habitual cheerfulness; and although
strict, as regarded himself, no one could be more liberal as re
spected other persons.f It will be easily imagined that the
society of a man whose knowledge was so extensive, and
whose manners were so winning, was eagerly sought and highly
valued.

   Had Dr. Priestley lived thirty years later, and come here in

   * Supra, p. 264, note.

was enough for an old man, but he did not prescribe his own practice as an

1824, instead of 1794, he would have found many eminent
Unitarian ministers, and many devoted friends. His heart
would have rejoiced while he witnessed the spread of those
opinions which he regarded as the simplicity of the glorious
gospel, and the increasing liberality which may be said to dis
tinguish the present age. Yet, although proscribed as a theo
logian, he was respected for his talents, revered for his virtues,
and beloved for his pleasing and simple manners, by men who
were shocked at his heterodoxy, and who shuddered while
they contemplated the imminent danger of his soul.

   Yet, even at that time, we had liberal-minded men among
the orthodox ; in the foremost of which stood the excellent and
now (1830) venerable Bishop White,* who paid Dr. Priestley
the most marked and respectful attention, and to this day
reveres and honours his memory. With the late Drs. Ewingf
and Andrews, Provost and Vice-Provost of the University of
Pennsylvania, he was in habits of close intimacy.+ Both oc
casionally attended him when he preached in Philadelphia,
and Dr. Evving advised several young persons belonging to his
own congregation to attend the Discourses on the Evidences
of Revealed Religion ; " for," said he, " you will hear from
Dr. Priestley what you will not hear in any of the sermons
usually delivered." During his residence in the United States,

cated, in 1804, a very short time before his decease, his " Doctrines of the
Heathen Philosophy compared with those of Revelation." See W. XX. 369.

   f Who died, 1803, aged 73. Amer. Ann. II. 413.
   \ " One Sunday, having been at Dr. Ewing's church, he dined with Dr.
Davidson, one of the Professors. Dr. Ewiiig being present, Dr. Priestley
said to him, ' While I was listening to your discourse, you almost made me
fancy myself a young man.' ' Why so ?' asked Dr. Ewing. ' Because,' said
Dr. Priestley, ' I have not heard so much Calvinism since my youthful days.'
   " After some further conversation, Dr. Priestley remarked, that although
their creeds were different, he thought Dr. Ewing might allow him to preach
a funeral sermon in his church for a gentleman whose monument was tinder
his pulpit, and who, while he lived in England, was one of Dr. Priestley's
stated hearers ; assuring Dr. Ewing, in his pleasant manner, that he would
not say one word that would or could give offence. Catholic as Dr. Ewing
was, and friendly as were his feelings towards Dr. Priestley, the latter well
knew that such a permission might cost Dr. Ewing his living." See supra,
p. 277, note*.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIKSTLEY.  343

 he preached only one controversial discourse,* which was
 afterwards published. It formed no part of his plan of lec
tures, and was composed and delivered in consequence of the
earnest solicitation of some of his friends.

   A gentleman of New York, of excellent understanding, but
a confirmed Calvinist, with whom I was in habits of friendly
intercourse, although he had never seen Dr. Priestley, would
frequently speak of him as a person of no vital religion, and as
one with whom he would not choose to become intimately ac
quainted. Having occasion to visit Philadelphia, he called on
me immediately on his arrival. Dr. Priestley was spending
the afternoon with me, and my friend being seated next to the
Doctor, seemed so much engaged in conversation with him,
that he had little to say to any one else.

   On taking his leave, to my astonishment he exclaimed,
" Who is that delightful old gentleman I have been conversing
with ?" for when introduced he had not attended to the name.
As I naturally concluded that the bare mention of this would
instantly destroy the charm, I was in no haste to gratify his
curiosity; but when the question was repeated and answered,
he replied, with his usual frankness, " All that I have for
merly said respecting Dr. Priestley is nonsense. I have now
seen him for myself, and, remember, I will never forgive you
if you do not put me in the way of seeing more of him."

   At Philadelphia, Dr. Priestley's name is often mentioned
with admiration and warm feeling by those who knew his
worth, and who, notwithstanding their difference of religious
belief, courted his society, and cultivated his friendship. A
very few years ago, when a young popular preacher spoke of
Dr. Priestley in the pulpit as similar to Hume and Voltaire,
the injustice of the comparison was openly complained of by
many worthy persons of different denominations, who were old
enough to remember with what ability and effect Dr. Priestley

   · " One of his orthodox friends having told him that he intended to be
one of his hearers, the Doctor instantly intreated him not to come and hear
him on that day, and said, ' I must necessarily say things which you will
hear with pain, and perhaps displeasure. Now this would grieve me, and,
at your time of life, I cannot hope to change your opinions.' "

had pleaded the cause of divine revelation at Philadelphia,
particularly in those discourses delivered in 1796.

   It was reported, by some of the opposite party in theology,
that towards the close of life Dr. Priestley became more ortho
dox. The fact is not so ; though it is certainly true that he
held no opinion after he was convinced of its fallacy; and so
humble-minded was he, that he was always willing to learn.
He might be truly styled a devotee of truth, and one of the best
of men.

           To Rev. T. Belsham.*

Dear Sir,  Northumberland, May 29, 1796.

I am now returned from Philadelphia, after being much

disappointed in not receiving any letter from you or Mr-

Lindsey the two last months. The arrival of every fresh ship

raised my expectations, but none of them brought any thing

for me.

My visit much more than answered my expectations. In

my last to you and Mr. Lindsey I mention the crowded au

diences I had, consisting of the most respectable persons in

the city. This continued to the last, and my concluding Uni

tarian sermon was heard with as much attention as any, and, I

have reason to think, made considerable impression, f A num-

   f " At the close of the course," says Mrs. Hart, (see supra, p. 333,) " Dr.
Priestley gave notice that, on the Sunday following, he intended to preach
directly on the person of Christ, explaining the Unitarians' view of the sub
ject, and that the Lord's Supper would he celebrated at the conclusion of
that service: this intimation produced a sensation indeed, among the Phila-
delphians ; they were puzzled, not being able to conceive what Unitarians or
Deists, as they termed them, had to do with it.
   " However, the Unitarians were glad to assemble round the table of their
Lord, especially with such a ministering servant of their profession ; and I
greatly mistake if Mr. Winchester did not give an indisputable and unam
biguous testimony of Christian love and forbearance in partaking with
them ; unhappily, too, as by so doing he increased the offence before given
to some of his more rigid adherents, in his friendly demeanour to Dr. Priest
ley. Afternoons and evenings, Mr. Winchester resumed his ministerial la
bours in his own pulpit, and afternoons Dr. Priestley was as attentive a hearer
as in the morning he had been an excellent speaker.
   " On the same day that Dr. Priestley gave out his next Sunday's subject

ber of young men are determined to form themselves into a
congregation, and to meet regularly for public worship, whe
ther they get a minister or not. After this beginning, there
cannot be any doubt but that an Unitarian preacher of good
character, and especially a good speaker, would soon have the
most respectable congregation in the place.

   Both my sets of Discourses and the single Sermon will be
sent to you and Mr. Lindsey. The demand for them is so
great, that the bookseller expected to sell the whole impres
sion in a month. In this, however, I dare say he will be dis
appointed. I am now sitting down to finish for the press the
continuation of my Church History, which I have brought to
the Reformation.

   I think as little as possible about politics, but I cannot help
being anxious about my friends in England. Do not fail,
therefore, to inform me of the general aspect of things with
you. Here, every thing is most promising. Earnestly wishing
that your situation and prospects were as good as ours, I am,
dear Sir, yours sincerely.

   P. S. I imagine Dr. Crawford's* thermometers and other
instruments have been disposed of long ago. I should have
been glad to purchase them. They were such as had never
been made before, and may not be made again for a long time.

in the riots in Birmingham. I wish to resume the subject.f

             To Mr. Russell.^

Dear Sir,    Northumberland, June 2, 1796.

As my wife wrote to Miss Russell, I did not think it neces-

to be Unitarianism, after their own service it was notified that Mr. Win

chester would, by desire, on that evening, defend the doctrine of the Trinity.

He did preach about it to the dissatisfaction of many of his friends, and many

more thought he had been peculiarly unhappy that evening in wielding the

weapons of Trinitarianism. His general preaching was on the love of God."

sary to trouble you with a letter at the same time. I hope I
need not say how happy I was, under your truly hospitable
roof. Indeed, I do not know what I could have done in such
a place, where every thing and every person were strange to
me, without such a resource. As it is an obligation that I can
never return, you must place it to the account of the cause in
which I was employed, and it will not be without its reward.

   I wish much to hear what prospect there is of forming an
Unitarian congregation in Philadelphia. How happy should I
think myself, if circumstances favoured it, to assist in it, per
sonally and continually!

   If I come again, I will endeavour to get a class of young
men, or young women, or both, to whom I may give regular
lectures, in the more familiar manner to which I have been
accustomed.

   There are more symptoms of the rising prosperity of this
place than you will easily believe. I found several new houses
erected, and many more are now building. Our market-house,
and a town-hall, with an assembly-room above it, is also in great
forwardness. I am, however, well satisfied, that though this
place is every thing that I want, it would not at all do either
for you or your family. Many other situations, I am per
suaded, would suit you much better.*

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, June 12, 1796.

I am very seriously concerned that I have had no letter from

you or Mr. Belsham these three months. The free communi

cation of our sentiments, to persons who think and feel as we

do, is the greatest charm of life, and it is impossible to do this

with strangers as with old friends. This is an inconvenience

inseparable from my situation. But what is this compared to

who perished in silence, unknown to any friend? I am truly
thankful for the comforts I have, though I cannot help regret
ting those that I have lost.

   I wish much to hear how you like the discourses I delivered
at Philadelphia. I have not yet planned another set for the
next winter, but I arn thinking of it. Perhaps it will be on
the gospel history, particularly with a view to its internal
evidence.

   I have just transcribed a small piece in answer to the new
theory of chemistry. While I was in Philadelphia two papers
of mine were printed for the Philosophical Transactions of that
city.* Copies of them I also forwarded to you and other
friends in England. The principal of them contains an ac
count of experiments made since I have been here, militating
with the new theory, which, though now almost universally
received, I am well satisfied will not stand a rigorous exa
mination.

   I am chiefly employed about my Church History, in which
I find the use of the books you were so good as to send me. I
now miss the catalogues I had in England. Here, books of
literature are not to be had at any price, nor would there be
any sale for them if they were imported. That demand is not
yet come. An English printer is just arrived at Northumber
land, and I have some thoughts of printing the work by sub
scription, advertising that the profit, if there be any, will be
appropriated to some public institution. I am very willing to
give my labours, and shall be happy in so doing.

Dear Friend,          Northumberland, July 28, 1796.

It is now more than four months since I have received any

letter from you, and it gives me most serious concern. The

state of things, in a variety of respects, is such, that I am more
anxious to hear from you than ever, and I do not know how to

reconcile myself to your silence.
   I gave you an account of the very favourable attention that

was given to me at Philadelphia, and the probable good effect
of my preaching there. It has been the means of establishing
a society of Unitarians, without any minister, which, I hope,
will be the means of doing more real service to the cause than
even the forming a congregation with a regular minister ;
and yet I cannot help wishing that one such congregation could
be fixed in all the large towns in this country.

   Since my return I have stuck close to my Church History,
and now have corrected it and completed it, by all that I could
find of importance in Giannone, and other authors, and have it
quite ready for the press, as far as the Reformation ; and I am
preparing to continue it to the present time. Very happily, I
am provided with the histories of the Reformation, in all, or
almost all, the countries in Europe, more than sufficient for
such a general account as I must confine myself to. Semler's*

   * " John Solomon Semler," born, 1 725, at Saalficld, in Thuringia, became,
" in 1 757, Director of the Theological Seminary at Halle," where Griesbach
was his pupil. "Foreseeing his death (1791) a considerable time," Semler
contemplated it " with calmness, resignation, and hope. His friend, F. A.
Wolf, the celebrated Editor of Homer, published an account of the inter
views and conversations which he had with him in the days which preceded
his dissolution." See " Biographical Sketch of J. S. Semler," M. R. XVI.
65, 72.

   Semler's biographer having described circumstances which led him to
study natural philosophy, and especially chemistry, says,

   " In uniting a taste for these pursuits with those which were more strictly
professional, he resembled our own Priestley; but the parallel is confined to
this single circumstance. While Priestley enlarged the boundaries of science
by his curious discoveries, Semler wasted his time in researches after the
elixir of life and the philosopher's stone." Ibid. p. fi9.

   Having remarked that Semler " was too ardent a lover of truth to keep
it back from the world, till he could present it in the form best calculated to
attract admiration to himself, and connect his own name with his discove
ries," the biographer adds,

   " We trust that no one will think that we derogate from the respect due
to the talents of Dr. Priestley, when we compare him with Semler, in this
neglect of the polish of his writings and indifference to merely literary repu
tation. Had he published fewer works, had his pen been less prompt.

is, certainly, a very good book, but too concise and systemati
cal, and not sufficiently Unitarian. The method, too, is more
proper for teaching than for reading. I am much obliged to
you for the set you sent.* Mine wanted the last volume. I
want Burnet's large History of the Reformation ; though I have
his abridgment, which may answer my purpose.

   I have just printed a Defence of the Doctrine of Phlogiston,
against the new French theory, a small piece ;f but which I
expect to produce some effect. Mr. Dobson, a bookseller at
Philadelphia^ prints it, at his own risk, and will send 500
copies to Mr. Johnson, and about forty copies for myself, which
I wish you to distribute.

   My house will not be finished till next Midsummer; but I
hope to get the laboratory finished soon.§

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Aug. 1, 1796.

   I am this day made very happy, indeed, by the receipt of
two letters from you, having not received any before, since soon

wherever error was to be attacked or truth defended, he would have retained
a higher permanent rank as an author, but never could have given that
powerful impulse to the public mind in his life-time which his unwearied
activity and constant readiness for exertion enabled him to produce : and no
doubt if the option had been formally presented to him, of incurring the
charge of incorrectness, or limiting and delaying the usefulness of his works,
while he brought their style and arrangement nearer to perfection, he would
have chosen the former part of the alternative with a cheerful sacrifice of
fame to duty." M. It. XVI. p. 136. See I. 18, note.

Semler also published two volumes entitled, " Commentarii Historic! de an-

of Civil and Ecclesiastical History in the Middle Ages." M. R. XVI. 139, 140.

after my arrival in Philadelphia. These came with a parcel

containing Mr. Paine's pamphlet* and some newspapers, with

advice of Darwin's second volume,f and the other things you

are so kind as to send me.

I am not surprised at the news of Mr. Tayleur's death.J A

happier exit and more promising for futurity no man can

make. So, Mr.             gives up his hopes of immortality for

such poor reasons as he alleges in his pamphlet. Such is my

persuasion of the use of Christianity to elevate and improve the

mind, that I cannot think highly of any man who rejects it.

He certainly never knew or felt what it was. As he is not

destitute of candour, perhaps some of my late discourses may

be of use to him ; but, vestigia pauca retrorsum. I should not

wonder at his following Mr.               to atheism. Indeed, the

great step is taken when a man abandons Christianity. But all

this was foreseen and intended, and is, no doubt, for the best.

I am much pleased with your account of Mr. Winter-

botham.§ We see, in his case, what Christianity can do. Re

member me kindly to him, and double my benefaction if you

think proper. I admire his industry and spirit, as well as his

excellent temper. Post, haec neminesse juvabit. He would be

I find, by Mr. Lindsey, you received, I wrote after my return;
but as I keep no account but of the dates of my letters, I have
no recollection of the subjects of them, and therefore you will
often probably find repetitions, and perhaps some variations
and contradictions in them, arising from my different views of
things at different times.

   I wish particularly to hear what you think of the Discourses
which I delivered at Philadelphia. I am now composing
others, to deliver the next winter, on the gospel history. As
yet, I have only composed two, on the account Jesus has
given of a resurrection and a future state ; but I have not yet
settled any general plan. I think, too, I shall give a discourse
or two on the prophecies relating to the great apostacy and the
latter times, having been reading and thinking much on that
subject, though without having hit on any thing original re
specting them.

   Since my return from Philadelphia I have revised and com
pleted my Church History, to the Reformation, and as I pro
ceed with great regularity and assiduity, always performing
the task I set myself, I have little doubt but that, in the space
of a year or less, I shall have completed the whole to the pre
sent time. I am much interested in the history of Luther, as
written by Beausobre ; but I shall want materials for the his
tory nearest to our own times. I shall expect some assistance
from Dr. Toulmin's edition of Neale. However, the striking
events in the ecclesiastical history of late years are not many,
and the gradual progress of things will not require many words
to describe. The great events are those we are now looking
for.

   We are impatient to hear news from England, haying just
heard of the success of the French in Italy, and have some
faint hope that it may be the means of producing a general
peace. Here we enjoy that great blessing, and the capital of
this country is said to be prodigiously increased in consequence
of the troubles in Europe. But this increase is attended with
the increased price of every thing.

   P. S. Give my respects to Mr. S. Palmer, and thank him

for his last letter and the heads of the Nonconformists. I
shall write to him soon.*

             To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,         Northumberland, Sept. 11, 1796.

The day after I wrote my last, I received your three former

letters, and after that another, so that I now have them com

plete, and shall not despair any more.
   I wish much to know how you approve of the discourses I

delivered at Philadelphia, and behold I have nearly composed

another set before I can know that. I want, old as I am, such

advice as you used to give me. I am still apt to be too preci

pitate, and to overlook many circumstances that you used to

remind me of. J I must, however, do as well as I can. Those

I am now composing are rather miscellaneous, but chiefly on

the gospel history; and they all relate, directly or indirectly, to

the evidences of Christianity.
   One is on the moral object of the Jewish and Christian reve

lations ; another, on the prophecies concerning Antichrist ;

another, on the doctrines of a resurrection and a future state, as

taught by Christ himself, in which I collect and arrange every

thing that he has said on the subject; and another I have
nearly finished, on the great dignity of the character of Jesus,

in which I go over his whole history. I hope you will think

them, if you ever see them, considerably original and useful. I

am planning others.

I do not know that I have more satisfaction from any thing

I ever did, than from the lay Unitarian congregation I have been

the means of establishing in Philadelphia. Mr. Gales (who

was a printer in Sheffield) writes me word, that they increase,

and that all who attend have increasing satisfaction in it. Six
persons, chosen by ballot, are to direct every thing, and one of

this number to administer the Lord's Supper. Mr. Russell

eays, that when he and Mr. Davy go to town for the winter,

they must get a larger room than they now have. It is the

Common Hall in the college which I had engaged for myself.

In our present circumstances, a society of this kind is better

than one with a minister ; it both prevents superstition and is

propagated without expense.

Within this week I have been made happy by the receipt of

the box of books containing the Life of Lorenzo de Medicis,

&c, &c. This package has been a great treat to me. I have

read Mr. Roscoe's work with much pleasure, though I did not

get from it so much information as I expected. I was glad to

find that so extraordinary a man was a Christian and truly

pious. In that he resembled Petrarch. I have read almost the

whole of the Life of Mr. Robinson. It is well written and

useful ; but I cannot think so highly of him as Mr. Dyer does,

in any respect. I am obliged to Mr. Dyer for the book, and

shall soon write to thank him for it.

I have made no experiments all this summer, one laboratory

(if I can call it one) being deranged, and the other not yet

built; but I hope to be in it in about a fortnight. I am thank

ful that I never had better health than I have in this country;

but my wife is not better than she used to be in England. She

has now kept her bed a week of a feverish complaint, which is

pretty common in this neighbourhood, but I hope- is getting

better.
  I had, lately, a letter from Sir John Sinclair, President of the

Board of Agriculture in London, who says he hopes soon to

see me in England and renew his acquaintance with me. Now,

I do not remember ever to have known him. Here, too, a re

port is prevalent, Mr. Russell says, that I am about to return to

England. This I cannot account for. Nobody, seeing what I

do here, could suppose I ever meant to leave the place. Indeed,

I was never more fixed in any thing than I am to end my days
here ; though I own, that if the aspect of things was favourable,

it would give me the greatest pleasure to pay you a visit -, but

of that I have not the most distant expectation.

In my last I wrote to Mrs. Rayner, and, by the post, to the

Duke. I hope you will always remember me gratefully to

them both, and also to Dr. Hebcrdeit, whose accident gave me

much concern. Such men are the glory of our species. How
greatly superior to such as Voltaire, the King of Prussia, and
unbelievers in general! I hope to make some useful remarks
on their correspondence, which I am reading. I want the
king's posthumous works.*

                     To the Same.

       Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Sept. 19, 1796.

I never stood in more need of friendship than I do now,

and I am thankful that I am not destitute of it, here ; though I

could wish for a nearer communication with old, tried, and

pious friends : and, after all, our chief refuge must be in God,

whose providence, we cannot doubt, orders every thing for the

best.

This day I bury my wife. She died on Saturday, after an

illness of a fortnight. On Sunday morning she went to my

son's, in whose house we have our service, but returned before

we had begun, was seized with sickness, followed by a fever,

which almost instantly affected her head, so that she had but

little sense of any thing, and spake but very little till she died.

She had, to appearance, suffered very much at some times ;

but died without any symptom of being in pain.

She had taken much thought in planning the new house,

and now that it is far advanced, and promises to be every

thing that she wished, she is removed to another. For activity

in contriving and executing every thing usually done by wo

men, and some things done by men, I do not think she ever

had a superior, or in generosity and disinterestedness ; always

caring for others and never for herself. My loss is propor-

tionably great, though I am thankful that she had been pre

served so long. We have lived together more than thirty-four

years.f She, as well as myself, was much affected with the

death of Harry. Though it is now near nine months since he

died, he has never been long out of my thoughts; but this will

affect me much more; though I have abundant sources of con

solation, for which I am truly thankful.

    I read, with particular satisfaction, yesterday, to our own
 families, (for I admitted nobody else,) one of the discourses
 which I have composed for my next journey to Philadelphia,
on the subject of a resurrection and a future state, as taught by
Jesus.* In this, as well as all the other discourses on the gos
pel history, I take every opportunity of illustrating the internal
evidence of Christianity, which, to the truly intelligent, is as
strong as the external. I have three discourses on the autho
rity assumed by Jesus, and the dignity with which he spake
and acted,f which furnishes, in my opinion, an unanswerable
evidence of his divine mission. The facts cannot otherwise be
accounted for.

   I think that, to relieve my mind in my present situation, I
will make a progress through some parts of this continent J
that I should not otherwise have visited; and then I shall take
every opportunity of preaching such discourses as these; and,
on the whole, I really believe I am in the way of doing more
good, especially by promoting lay Unitarian societies, than I
could by being a resident preacher. I thank God, my means
will enable me to do this, though without much to spare.§

             To Mr. George Dyer.

Dear Sir,           Northumberland, Oct. 4, 1796.

I am very thankful for several kind notes that I have re

ceived from you, and presents of your very useful publications;

and though I have not written to you before, it was not be

cause I was unmindful of you, or for want of respect or grati

tude; but because I had nothing to inform you of, but what

you would learn from some of my correspondents, with whom

you are well acquainted.
   I am much pleased with all your publications. Your Life of

Mr. Robinson,|| which I have just read, must be very useful as

you have written it. He was certainly an extraordinary man,

though I do not think quite so highly of him as you do; but

as you saw much more of him, you must be a better judge
than I can pretend to be. I do not see either the Critical or
the Monthly Review, but I am sure that nothing you could say
of the controversy between Mr. Evanson and me* could give
me any offence.

   I am exceedingly shocked at reading this day Mr. Palmer's
letter to Dr. Disney, from Botany Bay. From a former letter
of his,f I had concluded that his situation was not, on the
whole, uncomfortable. But what a picture does he give of
despotic and military government ! Surely it cannot continue
without some redress or mitigation of severity.

   Every account I hear from England makes me think myself
happy in this peaceful retirement, where I enjoy almost every
thing I can wish in this life, and where I hope to close it,
though I find it is reported, both here and in England, that I
am about to return. The two heavy afflictions I have met with
here, in the death of a son and of my wife, rather serve to at
tach me to the place.J Though dead and buried, I would not
willingly leave them, and hope to rest with them, when the
Sovereign Disposer of all things shall put a period to my present
labours and pursuits.

   The advantages we enjoy in this country are indeed very
great. Here we have no poor ; we never see a beggar,§ nor is
there any family in want. We have no church establishment,
and hardly any taxes. This particular state pays all its officers
from a treasure in the public funds. There are very few
crimes committed, and we travel without the least apprehen
sion of danger. The press is perfectly free, and I hope we
shall always keep out of war. I do not think there ever was
any country in the world in a state of such rapid improvement
as this at present.

   But we have not the same advantages for literary and philo
sophical pursuits that you have in England, though even in
this respect we are every day getting better. Many new books
are printed here. But what scholars chiefly want are old
books, and these are not to be had. We hope, however, that
the troubles of Europe will be the cause of sending us some
libraries. And they say, " it is an ill wind that blows no
good." I sincerely wish, however, that your troubles were at
an end, and from our last accounts (the French having taken
Frankfort*) we think there must be a peace, at least from the
impossibility of carrying on the war.f

            To Rev. T. Belsham.J

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Oct. 8, 1790.

You will have heard by Mr. Lindsey, or Mr. Vaughan, of

my great loss in the death of my wife, after that of my son.

According to the course of nature, she should have outlived me

near ten years. A separation like this, after living together

very happily more than thirty-four years, cannot but be sen

sibly felt. These two events, however, make me think more

of another world than I do of this, and I look forward to the

time which, with respect to me, cannot be very distant,

when I hope to meet them and other virtuous friends again,

never to part any more. In this respect I feel the unspeakable

value of Christianity, and wonder at the readiness of so many,

and these not all, unworthy characters, to abandon that blessed

hope.
   And yet I wonder almost as much at your doubts concern

ing the authenticity of the book of Daniel,§ the arguments for

which appear more satisfactory than those for the Revelation,

though I never had any doubts about that. As I am con

sidering the prophecies with a view to some more discourses

relating to the evidences of revelation, I propose to give parti

cular attention to this subject, and I think that, besides the

common arguments,it will be evident from a comparison of the
book of Daniel with the second of Esdras, the Sibylline oracles,*
and other books allowed to be forgeries, that Daniel cannot be
one. If it had, it would not have been so obscure and difficult
to interpret. Besides, it extends to the last times, as clearly as
the Revelation itself. Also, considering the circumstances of
the Jewish nation at the time, I cannot imagine any motive for
the forgery. We have no account of any use attempted to be
made of it. If you were to give more attention to this book,
I think you would give as good an account of it as you have
done of the Revelation. Your notes on that I like very much,
though 1 am not quite satisfied with any interpretation I have
yet seen of the woman in the wilderness, or the vials.

   I fear we could not invite Mr. Kenrick,f or any other minis
ter from England, to preach in Philadelphia, at present. Having
now one tie less to this place, I propose to spend more time
there, so long as I shall be capable of public speaking ; but the
loss of my foreteeth, (having now only two in the upper jaw,}
together with my tendency to stammering,:}: which troubles me
 sometimes, is much against me, though I do better than I
expected.

    I want some better account than I have, of the Apocryphal
books. Some copies contain more than others, and I find my
 self much at a loss to ascertain the date of each. I think that
 Calmet gives a fuller account of them, and I had his 3 vols.
 of Dissertations, 4to., but one of them being lost at the riots,
 I sold the other two among other odd volumes. I wish you
 would assist Mr. Johnson in repurchasing the whole for me, or
 send Calmet's Dictionary, if that contains what I want.

    I cannot say how much I admire your brother's History.
 After reading the whole by myself, I did read it again to my
 wife within one-half of the last volume, before she died. We
 began with the two first, and she liked it as much as I did. I
 do not think that we have any history better written, besides,
 that the principles of it are excellent. I prefer his style to

that of Robertson or Hume. There is more strength, and less
appearance of attention to it.

   I am in daily expectation of hearing from you and Mr.
Lindsey ; but I shall never wholly despair again, and please to
observe that my letters are longer than yours. My wife often
talked of writing to you, but for the last year she was very
feeble, and backward to write to any body. She left an un
finished letter to Mrs. Vaughan, which I have forwarded
to her.*

             To Rev. T. Lindsey.I

Dear Fkiend,                   Northumberland, Oct. 29, 1796.

I hope that by this time you are returned from your ex

cursion to the North ; though, from what I hear, this would be

rather a melancholy visit. There is nothing, however, to be

lamented when our friends die at the usual term of human

life, and leave only younger relations behind them, and those

in a condition not to stand in need of them. Yet, though this

was the case with my father, and I had hardly ever lived with

him, and, my aunt taking every expense attending me upon

herself^ I had never received any thing from him, I felt a

great deal when I heard of his death, though little in com

parison with what I now feel for the loss of a son, and es

pecially a wife, with whom I have lived, and lived happily,

more than thirty years. But I feel on this occasion, more than

ever, the real power of Christian principles, and look forward,

with peculiar satisfaction, to the time when all the virtuous

and the good will meet again, and in more favourable circum

stance than ever. As the picture of Dr. Price, and that of Mr.

Lee, always hang in my view, I am continually reminded both

of the past and the future. I often wish I had yours too. It

would add much to my satisfaction, especially as I now sit

more alone than I used to do.

Having now one tie, and that a strong one, to this place less

than I have had, I think I told you that I proposed to spend

more time than I should otherwise have done at Philadelphia.

I expect to be there in December, and shall stay till the rising
of Congress. With a view to this, I have prepared and tran
scribed eleven discourses, and have read with great care the
Koran, and various things relating to Mahometanism, out of
-which I expect to make several more discourses, which I hope
will be of use ; but as yet I have only made extracts, and have
not even digested, much less composed any thing. This I can
do at Philadelphia. Besides this, I intend to draw out a new
plan of lectures on the evidences of revelation, which 1 intend
to give to young people, and perhaps others, all the time
that I shall be there.

   I have just heard from Mr. Kenrick, of Exeter, expressing
some willingness to come as an Unitarian preacher. I write
to him by this opportunity, but I am fearful of giving any
person much encouragement, though nothing could give me
more satisfaction than the settlement of such a person as he, in
this country, in that capacity. Could I see him settled at Phi
ladelphia, and Mr. Belsham at the college here, and could I
pay you one visit in England, I should sing my nunc dimittis;
but I shall not repine if these things should not take place.
Indeed, any one of these is more than I can reasonably ex
pect. We are all in the best hands, and so are the affairs of
the church and of the world.

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Nov. 4, 1796.

Tn little more than the last fortnight I have been happy in

receiving four of your valuable letters, two yesterday.

The giving up of the collegeJ is certainly very mortifying to

the friends of liberty, and I doubt not the occasion of much

triumph to its enemies ; but we must give way to the times,

which are unfortunately against the good cause, in England.
Here we have nothing of that kind to complain of.

   I have prepared another set of Discourses relating to the
Evidences of Christianity, against my next visit to our metro
polis, and intend to give lectures besides on some new plan, of
which I have a general idea. I am much pleased with Mr.
Cogan's little pieces,* and shall make use of his ideas. I wish
he would write more. You also, and every person capable of
it, should stand forth on this occasion. Every man has some
thing peculiar to himself, in his manner of conceiving things, or
of expressing himself, better adapted to impress a number of
other persons than that of any others, besides that every writer
will get a different class of readers ; and the very idea of a
number of writers tends to give an idea of the strength of a
cause. This more than counterbalances what is lost by the
different and sometimes contradictory arguments of different
persons. Unbelievers have also their contradictions, as glaring
to the full as those of Christians.

   It is mortifying to me, but it is an inconvenience that must
be submitted to, that we cannot communicate our thoughts
and publications more speedily. I wished much to hear what
you and Mr. Lindsey thought of my last Discourses before I
set about the composition of others, but I find that you have
yet seen only the single sermon, which is of little consequence.
I am glad, however, that you are pleased with it, and not a
little flattered with your reading it to my old congregation,
and with Mr. Edwards doing it at Birmingham.

   Though you see and say that I am re-settled in " the orthodox
doctrine of Universal Restitution," I cannot say that I am at
all times free from doubts, but they grow less and less, and my
earnest wishes may have contributed something to fix my
opinion.f I think Hartley did wrong to make so much use of

universal restoration. As it has been well remarked by his remote suc

arguments from the Scriptures.* Other considerations have
great force. Many Americans are of this opinion, but all de
pend on arguments from Scripture. They are violently hated
by the Calvinists, though, in general, Calvinists in other lespects.

   I know nothing of the invitation to Leyden, or of the
Duchess of York's Unitarianism. She is no correspondent of
mine. I was informed before I left England, on pretty good
authority, that she had read my Appeal, so that the report
you mention is not altogether improbable. They are, I hear,
undecided whether to choose me or Mr. Jefferson, President of
the Philosophical Society ; but I gave my informant good rea
sons why they should not make choice of me. There is a
warm contest between the friends of Mr. Jefferson and those of
Mr. Adams about the Presidency of the United States. The
electors are chosen this day. I am inclined to think that the
majority will be in favour of Mr. Jeflerson,f but all say the
contest will be a hard one.J

Dear Friend,               Northumberland, Dec.3, 1796.

Though I have not heard from yourself, I hear by others

that you enjoy good health and good spirits, which gives me

very great satisfaction. In the evening of life, this is a great

happiness. I informed you of the death of my wife, a stroke

I shall long feel, though I have much still left to be thankful

for, and truly am so. I live very comfortably with my son.

I have full leisure for my pursuits, and this 1 hope I employ

to as much advantage as I can. You have gratified me ex

ceedingly by the books you sent me. I have nearly read them

all. Mr. Gibbon's Life is very amusing ; and from this, and

the letters of Voltaire, the King of Prussia, &c, I hope to

make out something in favour of Christianity. Dr. Darwin's

is a very capital work.* It will lead me to study medicine,
though so late in life; but nothing you have sent strikes me
so much as Count Rumford's publication. We see by that,
and the no less wonderful effect of the new regulations of the
public prison at Philadelphia, that the world may be in a
manner renovated by good government. I shall be impatient
to see his other numbers.

   The French government is much offended at the partiality
of the governing powers of this, to England, and I fear the
consequence will be the French seizing the vessels that go

so much calamity affecting Europe, it would be extraordinary
indeed if we should wholly escape.

   Mr. Washington is much blamed by the zealous republicans
for his ingratitude to France, and, I think, with some reason ;

and shall sincerely lament any evil that may befal my native
country, though I condemn as much as ever the conduct of its
rulers. Dabit Dens his quoque finem. But I think now more
of another world than I do of this, and pity those who have no

To Mrs. Barbauld.

     Dear Mrs. Barbauld,

   The pleasure I received from your letter, was the greater
from its having been unexpected. It has brought a great
number of pleasing scenes to mind, though attended with
the melancholy reflection, that one person present to them
all, is now absent. Though for many years she wrote but
few letters, there were not many persons who were more fre
quently the subject of our conversation, or whom she spoke
of with so much pleasure as yourself. Indeed, pleasing im
pressions of so early a date,* are not soon effaced, if no pains
were taken to revive them. If my diaries had not been de
stroyed in the riots, I should have been able to retrace some
of them better than I can do now.

   She often lamented the loss of a folio book, into which she
had copied all your unpublished poems, and other small pieces,
especially the first poem we ever saw of yours, on taking leave
of her, when we left Warrington, f The perusal of it would
give me more pleasure now than it did at first. The short and
very just character which you draw of her I have, and value
much.

   But the time is fast approaching with respect to me, when
our intercourse, from which I have derived so much satis
faction, will be renewed with advantage, and to this future
scene late events have drawn my attention in a more particu
lar manner than ever. How much to be pitied are they who
are not Christians ! What consolation can they have in their
sorrows? Mine have sometimes such a mixture of joy, as
hardly to deserve the name.

   What you wish almost, I wish altogether, that you, and
many others of my friends in England, were here. There
cannot be a more delightful spot on the face of the earth, and
here I trust we shall have peace. In England I fear there will
be more troubles. If possible, however, I propose to myself
the satisfaction of seeing my native country once more before I

die.                           f Sec I. 49, note \

  I am glad that what I publish here in defence of Chris
tianity gives you pleasure. By this time you may have seen
more pieces of the same tendency. Here, the defection from
Christian principles is as great as with you. But I consider it
a certain sign of better times.

  I hope that, a beginning being now made, our correspon
dence will be continued, at least occasionally. I shall always
be exceedingly happy to hear from you. Yours and Mr.
Barbauld's most sincerely.*

   Besides the obliging attentions of Mr. C. R. Aikin,
which I have had occasion to acknowledge, he has very
lately favoured me, from Mrs. Barbauld's papers, with the
following letter. Though belonging to an earlier period, I
cannot withhold it from the story of Dr. Priestley's life,
ordeny myself a conclusion, so interesting, to the present
chapter.

Mr dear Friend,    Aug. 26, 1791.

I received your kind letter, a week ago; but have not.

had power to answer it, or certainly should have thanked you

sooner, and informed you that I am very well in health for one

like me, and that my spirits are very good ; and if it had not

been for our fellow-sufferers, I think this would not have

affected me much.

I believe there is something inherent in me, which always

makes me swim at the top of affliction, so that I am ready to

pop out to the first friendly hand that offers assistance ; other

wise I am surprised at myself that I have borne it so well, and

greatly rejoiced that Dr. P. has kept up under that, and all

the malignity that has attended it. Our property may be said

to be entirely destroyed; the few remains that have been picked

up so demolished as to be of little value; and if all had been

destroyed at once, it would not have been half the vexation

that attends the recovery of any thing we have got.

It is impossible by letter to give you any idea of the situa

tion of this place; a place, I trust, Dr. Priestley will never be

induced to live in again, if 99 out of 100 requested it. We
 have been here eleven years, and do not know that man,
woman, or child, has had reason to complain of us ; and to be
thus rewarded once, I think, is enough' in one's lifa* It is a
great comfort to feel conscious we deserved very different
treatment. However, as we have been driven off the Birming
ham stage by the audience and our fellow-actors, I do not
think that God can require it of us, as a duty, after they have
smote one cheek, to turn the other. I am for trying a fresh
soil, though old to be transplanted, and leave them to settle at
their leisure the repentance and sorrow they have brought
upon themselves.

   My daughter's situation has kept me here; otherwise I should
have joined Dr. P. in London. She begs to be affectionately
remembered to you and Mr. Barbauld.

   I shall have the pleasure, I hope, of seeing you in the win
ter, as we propose taking lodgings, either in London or near it.
 However, as we have little to take care of, we need not hurry
. ourselves about taking a house. It is happy our children are
grown up, and that they all bear this so well; but I see no
reason to sink where there is a good conscience to keep one up.
I have learnt much by this new scene, and shall, I hope, be
able to practise in future; and that is, to endeavour to bear
other people's misfortunes as well as I have borne our own, and
as well as many under the mask of friends have borne ours in
this place.

   A few days before the riot, I burnt all my letters. I had
often taken them out, and burnt part before ; but that morning
I determined to burn all. I consumed every parcel. The last
bag was full of yours. I put a handful into the fire, when

   * More appropriate rewards awaited Dr. Priestley's memory. Among
various gratifying instances, I have observed the following notice :

   " In Birmingham there has existed for some time past an association of
young men, under the denomination of the Priestleyan Society, the members
of which meet once a month, when one of their body gives a sort of retro
spect of the advance, or retrogression of civil and religious liberty since their
last meeting. Once every year, (the anniversary of Dr. Priestley's birth-day,)
the members and friends of the society dine together. This occurred on
Tuesday last," March 13. Examiner, p. 203.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.                    367

casting my eye upon a letter with some verses, I thought I

would save them a little longer, and read them over before I

burnt them. These went with every thing else; but whether

destroyed, or kept for private amusement, I cannot say. How

ever, it is happy, if they are read they can find no sentiment,

but such as would make them blush for themselves while they

read them. A great quantity of Mrs. Galton's, more from good

luck than foresight, I burnt: she living on the spot would have

made the letters more attended to.

Dr. P. comes into the country as soon as I can join him, to

take a journey. All our fellow-sufferers are as well as can

possibly be expected. They will scarcely find so many re

spectable characters, a second time, to make a bonfire of. So

much for King and Church for ever.

I beg my kind respects to Dr. Aikin and family. It was

well he did not settle in Birmingham. He would certainly

have been one of the party. Tell him, also, that the phy

sicians have had no practice since the riots. All the nervous

patients are cured. Dr.             has been more frightened

than any body. They drank all his wine. He took great

pains to tell people he was no Dissenter ; but this he need not

have done, for their quarrel against him must have been on

account of his physic With kind respects to Mr. Barbauld,

I am, my dear friend, yours affectionately,

                                    M. PRIESTLEY.*

Mrs. Barbauld, at Dr. Aikin' s, Yarmouth.

· Whose " constancy and perseverance" in " supporting" her husband,

" under all his trials and sufferings," have been recorded, by an affectionate
son, in the continuation of his father's Memoirs. Of Mrs. Priestley's judg
ment, I was once led to form a high opinion, though at the expense of my

own.
   At the close of 1792, by the desire of some common friends, as well as

from my own inclination, I endeavoured to prevail on Dr. Priestley to take
a very public part upon an interesting political occasion on which I had been
appointed to preside. I allured him, I remember, among other inducements,
by the example of Dr. Price, in 1 789. At length, with his usual disregard
of personal consequences, he freely assented to my proposal. On a subse
quent interview with Mrs. Priestley, I was soon convinced that my desire
had outrun discretion. Dr. Priestley absented himself from the meeting, and
what soon occurred confirmed Mrs. Priestley's superior judgment. See
W. XXII. 522--524.

                       CHAPTER V

                                      (1 797-- 1800.)

   Dr. Priestley had resigned to the grave, though
not without indulging the Christian hope, two endeared
companions of his emigration ; a wife, the discreet and
affectionate partner of his various fortunes ; and a son,
in whom he had, once, fondly expected a successor, who
might advance, beyond himself, in theological inquiry
and scientific research.* Yet, a merciful providence re
served, even to his life's last moments, in the elder
branch of his family, the sweetest solace of declining
age, in the willing offices of filial affection. Now, how
ever, he again left his home, for the metropolis of the
States, to pursue the purposes of his Christian mi-
nistrv.t

   · " Id the autumn of 1795," says Mr. Priestley, " my father had the mis
fortune to lose his youngest son, of whom, being much younger than any of
his other children, and having entertained the hopes of his succeeding him
in his theological and philosophical pursuits, he was remarkably fond. He
felt this misfortune the more severely as it was the first of the kind he had
experienced, and particularly as it had a visible effect upon my mother's
health and spirits. He was, however, so constantly in the habit of viewing
the hand of God in all things, that his mind soon recovered its accustomed
serenity. The same habit enabled him to support himself so well under the
loss of his wife, the greatest affliction that could possibly have befallen him."

Dear Friend,                Philadelphia, Jan. 13, 1797.

Since I have come hither I have received your letter that

came by the way of Liverpool, in which you mention with

approbation my single sermon.f I have sent to the press a

new and much enlarged edition of the " Observations," in

which I animadvert on the correspondence between Voltaire

and D'Alembert, and especially on M. Volney's Ruins.J He

is now in this city, publishing a new edition of his work, and

by no means pleased at my preaching. He says he wishes he

could preach too, that he might propagate his sentiments to

more advantage. I hope that my animadversions on his work

may excite some attention.

I rejoice to find that, in consequence of my recommendation,

a very respectable Unitarian society is formed in this city.

While I am here, they omit their morning service, and I attend

with them in the afternoon ; and I never attended public wor

ship with more satisfaction. The service is read with great

propriety and seriousness, by persons appointed by ballot. I

have been here only one Sunday, and Dr. Price's Sermon on

the Resurrection of Lazarus was read. Each reader selects or

composes his prayers as he pleases; and they do not in general

prefer a liturgy. They administer the Lord's Supper every

two months, as was our custom at Birmingham.

My first discourse was well attended, and, among others,

was Mr. Lister, the English ambassador, with whom I dined

on Monday. He is a pleasing, liberal man, and I am very

happy that there is such a minister from England. I expect

to see him frequently. He that was in that capacity before,

Mr. Hammond, I could not see. He was a violent man, and

patronized the writer of that scurrilous pamphlet relating to

my emigration.§

The Sunday after next, I am to preach a charity sermon for

the Emigrant Society, and they will endeavour to get me the

they will succeed.* There is, however, more liberality among
the Episcopalians than the Presbyterians,f and I had much
rather be obliged to them.

   I have received and read, with much satisfaction, Mr.
Towers's two volumes on Prophecy,X and I shall soon write to
him. I am glad to find that we have a young man among us
of such ability, and whose mind is so properly and seriously
impressed. I have learned much from this work, though I
differ from him with respect to the Millenium. But I am far
from having been able fully to satisfy myself with respect to
that, or several other subjects of this kind.

   I seldom trouble you with the politics of this country.
Indeed, I think very little about them. But I must inform
you, that Mr. Adams is to be our next President, and Mr.

will act very harmoniously together, which will greatly abate
the animosity of both the parties. But such is the temper and

Dear Friend,                 Philadelphia, Feb. 20, 1797.

Your letter was balm to my wound. I could not help

being much affected by it; but, notwithstanding this, it gave

me a satisfaction that I cannot describe. I would not ex

change such sorrow for many persons' joys. Much afflicted as

I certainly have been, I have always been very happy on the

whole. Such is the real value of Christian principles. I have

been much gratified with the accounts that Mrs. Galtonf and

Mrs. Lindsey have given of my wife. They are, indeed, very

just, and it is a source of pleasure to have had such a connexion,

especially with the prospect, of which I never lose sight, of a

more happy union, though of a different kind hereafter.

Two ministers are become entirely of my sentiments, and

correspond with me, being in danger of being brought into

difficulty in consequence of it. But what I rejoice in most, is

the establishment of the Unitarian congregation, which is

every thing that can be desired, greatly exceeding any expec

tations I had formed of it.

All parties seem well satisfied with the new appointment of

governors. But the merchants are much distressed by the

capture of their ships by the French, and such a want of

money as was never known before.

Always give my best respects to Mrs. Rayner, the Duke of

Grafton, and Dr. Heberden. I can never forget their friendship

to me.J

one, a third edition, with large additions, of my "Observations
on the Increase of Infidelity," and the other, " An Outline of
the Evidences of Revealed Religion." In the former you will
see I have given a challenge to M. Volney, who is in this
city, and much looked up to by unbelievers here. What he
will do I cannot tell, but every body says he must make some
reply, or his cause will suffer. From the nature of the ques
tion between us, you will see that I cannot be under any great
apprehensions about the issue. But the progress of infidelity
here is independent of all reasoning, though I hear of many
being reclaimed, especially by Bishop Watson's publications,
which are much read here. I am printing another volume of
Discourses, which I hope will be at least as useful as those I
delivered and published last year.

   Considering my situation in this country, I may almost say
with the apostle, I am set for the defence of the gospel, for
nobody else seems disposed to do it. Indeed, but few, I
believe, are at all qualified for it. They can bawl out against
me as a heretic* loud enough, but they have nothing to say to
the common enemy, so that I have to look two ways at the
same time. However, except avowing my sentiments, which
I thought it necessary to do, in a single discourse the last year,
I pay no attention whatever to the orthodox, and confine myself
to the unbelievers, as by much the more formidable enemy of
the two.

   I thank you for your present of the heads of the Nonconfor
mist ministers. They could not be more acceptable to any
body. Your memorial is always at my elbow, and I frequently
take it up for edification. Such examples are most animating.

   I have had a great change in my situation since I wrote last.
It has broke another tie to this world, and leads me to think
more of another. Indeed, I feel almost perfectly indifferent to
all the affairs of this.

                      To Rev. T. Belsham.*

Dear Friend,              Philadelphia, March 14, 1797.

We have now been a long time without any arrivals from

England, and therefore I have not heard from any of my cor

respondents; but we are expecting ships every day. We

have just heard indirectly that Lord Malmsbury has left

Paris,t and that Mr. Pinkney also, who was sent from this

country, has not been able to obtain an audience,! both which

give us great concern. I was in hopes that there might be a

peace of some short continuance at least, and in that case I

had resolved to pay a visit to Europe, going to France in the

first place in order to settle some affairs there, and then to

England to see you all, once more on this side of the grave.

It would indeed already appear as life from the dead, after so

long a separation. I shall, however, seize on the first interval

of peace to carry this purpose into execution.

We have got a new presidency,§ and I hope a more pro

mising one than the last, though it will be difficult, and I fear

impossible, to undo the false steps that have been taken. The

distress among the merchants, owing to the capture of their

vessels by the French, is extreme, and as it is not in our power

to resent it, they are in great perplexity what to do. I wept

to take leave of the late president. He seemed not to be in

very good spirits. He invited me to Mount Vernon, || and said

he thought he should hardly go from home twenty miles as

long as he lived. The new federal city is within twenty

miles of his residence, and that has been a favourite object

use in stopping it. I have delivered and have nearly prine d
another set of Discourses similar to the last, more original and,

          To Rev. T. Lindsey.?

My dear Friend,        Philadelphia April 3, 1797.

By the ship which will take this, I send a few copies of six

different publications, which I have printed since my arrival

in this place : 1. A second volume of Discourses. 2. A third

and much enlarged edition of the Observations on the Increase

of Infidelity. 3. An Outline of the Evidences of Revealed

Religion. 4. An Address to the Unitarian Society. 5. Letters

to M. Volney. 6. A Sermon for the Benefit of the Emigrant

Society.

You will see by the preface to the Observations, that I in

tended it as a challenge to M. Volney, who is much looked up

to by the unbelievers of this country. He replied in an angry

pamphlet, by which he did himself and his cause no sort of

credit. A copy of this will be inclosed. This, however, gave

me an opportunity of addressing some letters to him which

have been much read, and have evidently made some impres

sion, especially as his behaviour on the occasion has been that

of a pettish child, and not that of a man. He refused to re

ceive the copy that I sent him, declaring he would not read it.

Notwithstanding the great prevalence of infidelity, to which

nothing, I believe, will oppose an effectual barrier at present, I

 doubt not but my coming hither has done it in a great number
 of cases, and, in general, it has made the cause of religion
 more respectable, as not declining, but inviting discussion, from
which our enemies evidently shrink.

   The cause of Unitarianism, also, evidently gains ground, and
holds up its head, against bigotry on the one hand and infide
lity on the other.* The Unitarian Society is in a most promis
ing state, and the members of it attend with a kind of enthu
siasm, and shew an attachment to each other similar to that of
the primitive Christians. They gain ground continually, and
many who do not openly join them respect them. It is better,
I am satisfied, than any congregation with a regular minister.
The last Lord's-day I administered the Lord's Supper, and
Mr. Eddowes baptized two children in a manner that affected
and edified all who were present ; the discourse and prayers
all his own. Several of the readers, who are appointed by
ballot every six months, use their own compositions as well as
those of others ; but none of them are inclined to a liturgy.
It happens, also, that they have some excellent singers, which
is a great advantage to them.

   I am about to go to France, as I see that my property in the
French funds will never yield me any thing while I remain
here, especially as this country is now on bad terms with
France. I believe I shall go with the late French ambassador,
M. Adet; and Mr. Lister, the English minister, will give me
a protection in case of meeting with an English ship of war.
He does the same for M. Adet ; so that a better opportunity I
could not have had. If I succeed, I shall make some purchase
of land in France, and then I can spend my time here or there,
as it shall suit me ; and, perhaps, I sometimes flatter myself,
that having been of some use in promoting the cause of the
gospel here, a door, unseen at present, may, in the course of
Providence, be opened for me in France for the same purpose.
I do not think that my continuance here is now of much con
sequence, and I do not wish to live for any other purpose.

   I had a house built and a laboratory furnished in such a

manner as I had promised myself the greatest satisfaction from
both, and it was ready to receive me. But as you used to say,
I'homme propose, mats Dieu dispose, and his will is best. I feel
myself roused, and not sunk, by the event,' and, I thank God, I
never was in better health ; though, getting into years, I feel
more averse to any changes, and this will be a great one. Yet,
since the death of my wife, I feel much unsettled, and, on that
account, less averse to the voyage. However, after deliberating
with myself and advising with others, I have formed my reso
lution, and desire that your next letters to me may be directed
to M. Perigaux, Banker, in Paris.

   I wished to have printed my Church History, but it must be
postponed till 1 have leisure to complete the whole. If I can
get no further, I hope Mr. Belsham will complete it. We are
in daily expectation of arrivals from London, and 1 shall write
again before my departure.f

           To Mr. Russell.J

Dear Sir,                   Philadelphia, April 19, 1797-

I did not doubt the kind sympathy of your daughters. It

is a great satisfaction to know, that I have such Christian

friends as those in your family, though our distance prevents

any personal intercourse. I now look forward chiefly to that

state in which we shall experience no more painful separations

from those we most esteem and love.

I thank you for your good wishes with respect to my

Church History; but I must suspend the printing of it. I

shall, however, keep writing the Continuation, and hope for a

more favourable opportunity. At present, I see that very little

attention will be given to any thing of the kind.

I sent you my two pamphlets. You will see what I have

said to M. Volney. He makes no reply, and said he would

not read the pamphlet. However, others have read it, and I

hope it has done some good. Infidelity, however, increases,

notwithstanding all our endeavours, and will do so, still more,

for some time; till the prophecies, which unbelievers them-

selves are now fulfilling, shall have had their complete accom
plishments, and that time seems not to be at a great distance.

   I often wish to hear your sentiments on the great events of
the present times, especially relating to the critical state of
England. Its affairs must come to a great crisis soon. The
approaching summer must, I think, decide every thing. The
temporal power of the Pope is, probably, even now, at an end,
and that will be followed by other great changes in the state of
Europe and the world at large. All Christians, however, will
look forward with joy to the bright close of the calamities that
will accompany these events.*

              To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,  Philadelphia, April 30, 1797·

I cannot leave this place without writing to you once

more, especially as the last accounts we have had from En

gland are very alarming. I hope and pray that a kind Provi

dence may watch over you and my other friends in the great

crisis, and, if prudent measures be taken to prevent tumults,

the calamity may not be so very great as we have sometimes

apprehended. It is impossible, however, not to be exceedingly

anxious about the issue when so much is depending.

The shock given to credit affects this country in a very sen

sible manner ; which, joined with our unpleasant situation

with respect to France, fills the country with alarm. The

Congress will soon meet ; but what they will do is very un

certain. I am sorry to see a dislike to France prevail so gene

rally as it does.J This affects me and all who are supposed to

wish well to that country. The writer of that scurrilous pam

phlet on my emigration § now publishes a daily paper, in

which he frequently introduces my name in the most oppro-

brious manner, though I never took the least notice of him ;
and have had nothing to do with the politics of the country ;
and he has more encouragement than any other writer in this
country. He, every day, advertizes his pamphlet against me,
and after my name adds, " commonly known by the name of
the fire-brand philosopher." He also publishes a periodical
pamphlet called the Political Censor, in which he never fails
to mention me in a similar manner.

   The aversion to those emigrants from England, who are
supposed to have been hostile to the measures of government
there, is greater, I think, than it was in England. But, hap
pily, we are better protected by the laws, and the disposition
of the lower orders of the people, among whom a respect for
the French, for assisting them in gaining their liberty, is not
extinguished. The rich not only wish for alliance offensive
and defensive with England, but, I am persuaded, would
have little objection to the former dependence upon it. But
the present aspect of affairs in Europe discourages them
greatly.

   I feel greatly unsettled since the death of my wife, and
much more indifferent as to any thing that respects myself.
I hope to employ myself usefully at Northumberland, and I
have cut myself out work for a year at least. I shall continue
my Church History to the present time, draw out a com
parison between the system of the Hindoos and that of Moses,
and recompose what was lost at the riots, of my Notes on the
New Testament, besides attending to my experiments. I
shall also translate and continue the Helvian Letters, men
tioned in the preface to the volume of Discourses printed the
last winter. I have begun to give particular attention to the
history of all the nations bordering on Palestine, as the Moab-
ites, Ammonites, &c, to compare the prophecies concerning
them, with the events. This has been overlooked by Bishop
Newton ; and yet, I think, is of considerable importance. I
have already made some progress in writing out the prophecies
in general in one column, and the events corresponding to
them in another ; but whether I shall make any public use of
it is uncertain. It is a most pleasing exercise to myself.

  It is a long time since I have heard from Mr. Belsham, or
have had any parcel from you or Mr. Johnson. I expect
every thing from the William Penn ; but it is not yet arrived.
I wish you would call on Mr. Jones, optician, in Holborn, and
tell him, I wonder that I have not received the globes and
other articles he was to send me ; but, if he has not already
sent them, to send only the globes and my planisphere which I
lent him.*

                 To Rev. T. Belsham. t

Dear Friend,          Northumberland, May 29, 1797-

I have just received your No. 2, and lately No. 1, and I

hope you will not forget your promise to write at least once a

month. Every thing that you can write about is interesting

to me ; indeed, every thing from England, for which, and espe

cially my friends in it, I cannot help being very anxious. The

times are indeed very dark, and the conduct of your rulers is

as like a judicial infatuation as any can in human affairs. I

cannot help fearing the worst, though I hope that, for the sake of

the many righteous among you, the calamity will be lessened,

if not averted.

Great as may be the progress of infidelity with you,

I cannot think it is equal to what we have here. Of those

who attend public worship, there are, I believe, as many

Roman Catholics as of any other persuasion in Philadelphia,

and they are not more bigoted than the Presbyterians. The

most liberal are the Episcopalians. With several of those I

was very intimate. Bishop WhiteJ is the " learned friend" in

the second appendix to the new edition of my " Observations

on the Increase of Infidelity."§ He says, if I will translate, as I

proposed to do, the Helvian Letters,\\ he will procure me assist

ance, with respect to the expense. I wish you or Mr. Lindsey

could see that work. If it would be read, it would certainly

be useful. But here unbelievers will not read any thing but
what makes for them, and I suppose it is the same elsewhere.

   Have you seen a work of some Scotchman, in answer to my
History of Early Opinions? Mr. Palmer speaks of it as deserv
ing of notice. If you have, let me know what you think of it.
If it be necessary to resume any of my controversies, every
body will look to you for it. Pray when shall we see your
Lectures? If our college* goes on, I shall want them. But
several of our principal subscribers have suffered by the late
speculations, so that, for the present, things are at a stand with
respect to it.f

To Rev. T. Lindsey.J

Dear Friend,                    Northumberland May 29, 1797.

After hearing nothing from you since the 5th of April, I

have just now received your Nos. 4 and 5, which makes me

very happy. I have written to the Duke by this conveyance.

When I consider how much is done for me, I think I can never

do enough in return : but I am sorry that you deprive yourself

of valuable books, when, judging of you by myself, nothing is

-more satisfactory than having it in our power to consult them

whenever we want them. This must have been your case with

respect to Calmet. His Dissertations, 3 vols. 4to, I had before

the riots, and valued them much, as I am sure you also must.

I met with his Dictionary, 4 vols. folio, the original edition, in

French, when I was last in Philadelphia.

By means of Dr. Ross,§ who has been much in the East, and

whom I knew in England, I have now almost every book that

I wanted respecting the religion and learning of the Hindoos,

and I intend to make use of them, in drawing a comparison

between that system, so much boasted of by unbelievers, and

that of Moses ; both of nearly equal antiquity. And I think it

must be so much to the advantage of revelation, as must strike

all who will give attention to the subject.

This summer I am in hopes of doing something decisive,

with respect to the doctrine of phlogiston, and the composition

of water, and though all the world is at present against me, I
see no reason to despair of the old system; and yet, if I should
see reason to change my opinion, I think I should rather feel a
pride in making the most public acknowledgment of it. M.
Adet has published an answer to my pamphlet ; but I shall
find no great difficulty in replying to it. I wish to have every
thing on the subject, that shall appear in England, sent to me.

   The Royal Society of Dublin have made me a present of
their five volumes of Transactions. Your picture will make
me happy indeed ; but it grieves me to deprive you and your
other friends of it. I hope Mrs. Lindsey will have a copy of
it. I would send you one of me, taken since I have come
hither ; but I am so different from what I was, chiefly in con
sequence of wearing my hair, that you would hardly know me.
I have hair enough to keep me warm in the coldest weather,
and as yet it is very little grey. I never had so good health as
I have enjoyed a long time. For this I am very thankful, as
for every other advantage by which I can be useful to others.*

                          To the Same.

Dear Friend,              Northumberland, June 18, 1797.

I am just made happy by the receipt of your No. 6. I have

no reason to think that any letter sent to me has miscarried,

except one from my daughter, in answer to that in which I

gave her an account of her mother's death. As my chief satis

faction consists in hearing from you, writing to you, and think

ing and talking of you, I shall continue to write, though some

letters should miscarry.

I am sending to the press another pamphlet on Phlogiston,

containing an answer to every thing that I have seen in reply

to my former, with additional evidence. I am well aware, that

at present my character as a philosopher is under a cloud; but

depend upon it, in a reasonable time, every thing will be

cleared up, and then I hope my character, as a theologian, will

gain in consequence of it ; and it is in this light chiefly that I

regard it. How insignificant are all subjects, compared to

                          · Orig. MS.

382 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

those which relate to religion! And yet I am persuaded I have
more pleasure in my philosophical pursuits than any of my un
christian brethren. My views of these subjects give a dignity
and importance to them, which, in the eye of an unbeliever, it
is impossible they should have.

   I feel deeply for you with respect to Mrs. Lindsey. I know
her importance to you, by that of my wife to me.

   Though here we are happily out of the way of all politics,
and only see newspapers once a week, we cannot help being
much interested in what is passing, especially as it respects our
native country, which will ever be dear to us. We fear your
troubles are approaching, and earnestly wish our friends were
with us.

   I shall be glad to see Blayney's Zechariah.* I have all the
other new translations. Nothing interests me more than illus
trations of scripture, especially prophecy. Though I may not
mention them, I enjoy every thing you send me, much more
than I should in England.

   P. S. I cannot help being very anxious about my daughter,
from whom I have not heard a long time. I imagine she is at
Mr. Galton's. Her trials must be great;f but she has a strong
sense of piety, and great natural cheerfulness. J

            To Rev. J. P. Estlin.§

Dear Sir,                  Northumberland, June 25, 1797.

Though I have been too negligent in acknowledging the

receipt of your valuable pamphlet, relating to Mr. Paine and

infidelity in general, I was not the less pleased with it. I

admired both the sentiment and the language. You express

yourself with great propriety and force. If any good is to be

done, it will be by such writings as yours. Your piece on

Atheism is not yet come to hand ;|| but I expect it every day.

I wished to have seen it before I wrote to you ; but having an

opportunity of sending to Philadelphia, I was unwilling to

delay writing any longer.

   You will find, that almost every thing I have published
since I have come hither has had the same object with yours,
and I rejoice to find you so able a coadjutor. There is, in
deed, a great call upon every man who has talents, and a
sufficient knowledge of the subject to stand forth in defence
of every principle that is of real value, moral as well as, more
properly, religious. We now plainly see that they go toge
ther; for nothing can be more licentious than the principles
of many of the modern unbelievers. They are finely exposed
in a work entitled, Helvian Letters; which I have some
thought of translating and abridging. But it is hardly possi
ble to draw any degree of attention on such subjects in this
country, at least this part of it.

  Notwithstanding the many solid advantages possessed by
this country, it appears to me that there is less of religion than
with you. As to rational religion, which alone can be opposed
with effect to the infidelity that prevails so much, it is hardly
known here. While I am preaching and writing against the
common enemy, they are preaching and writing against me.

  I thank you for your kind sympathy in my heavy losses. I
feel them deeply, but never before felt so much the real power
of religion to enable me to bear them. All evils are only for a
time, and a short one, and will all lead to good. How little to
be envied are the most prosperous of unbelievers! How
gloomy are their prospects! I am glad to find you have
noticed Dupuis' work. I have not yet seen it, but I have
quoted and animadverted upon a short account of it, sent me
by himself, in MS., before I left England, in a new edition of
my " Observations on the Increase of Infidelity." It must be
absurd in the extreme.*

To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Aug. 27, 1797.

The last letter I had from you was received July 17. The

news from Europe, and especially from England and Ireland,

is now more than ever interesting. By the last accounts we

* Orig. MS., communicated by Mrs. Estlin.  f Essex Street.

 384 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

had, the mutiny in the ships at the Nore was not quieted, but
we thought would be soon. Ireland seemed to be on the eve
of rebellion. But another messenger was sent to procure
peace, which we hope would be successful, as it was so much
wanted by both parties.

   Never, surely, were our general prospects so dark as they
are at present. And yet, as I believe there is more rational
Christianity and real piety in England than in any other country,
I am not without hopes that, on this account, the calamity
there is too much reason to expect, will not be so heavy as it
has fallen in France and elsewhere. But, in any situation,
what a noble consolation do we derive from the prophecies of
scripture, (to which I give more attention every day,) which
assure us that the issue of these calamities will be most glori
ous and happy, and that whatever be our fate in this life,
there is another and a happier reserved for the righteous!

   Removed, as I now am from you, and almost^ all that I
much value in this world, I please myself more than ever with
thinking on that state in which we shall certainly meet again ;
and I amuse myself with conjecturing what our employment will
be ; but that we shall have nothing to do, I can never persuade
myself. By the Acts of the Apostles we see that our Saviour,
after his ascension, was particularly attentive to the state of his
churches, and I doubt not he is now as much so as ever,
though this does not appear. You will see some hints of this
kind at the close of my Discourse on the Resurrection/ printed
at Philadelphia.

   I greatly admire Mr. Towers on Prophecy ; but I cannot
help thinking that the coming of Christ will be personal, like
his ascension, and previous to the Millenium ; though it is
very possible we may have no just idea of the nature of that
state, or of the agency of Christ, and of those who will be then
raised from the dead in it.

happily at a sufficient distance from it; but we seldom
escape agues and fluxes, though they are not dangerous.*

              To Mr. Russell.f

Dear Sir,                   Northumberland, Aug. 31, 1797.

I was much affected in reading your very friendly letter, by

which I perceive that, notwithstanding the distance at which

we are removed from each other, and the little probability of

our having much intercourse, your affections are not alienated,

and that you have the same zeal for the great objects which

we have pursued together, so many years.

I have seldom felt a more sensible disappointment than in

finding, that though equally exiles from the same country to

the same, and on the same account, and intimately connected

as we have been, with equal satisfaction to both, we should

settle at so. great a distance from each other. Had I found

you here before me, I should certainly have thought of no

other situation than your neighbourhood, whatever it had

been. But I am satisfied, on reflection, that this situation,

from which I cannot remove, would not suit you, and much

less your daughters, (for whom, next to my own, I feel a pecu

liar regard,) or your son, and therefore I acquiesce and approve

of your choice of another.

1 shall greatly rejoice to see you ; but, if at all, it must be

here, and I hope you will contrive to spend as much time with

us as you can. Such opportunities will not occur often.J

Dear Friend,                Northumberland, Nov. 4, 1797.

How little are we able to see before us, especially in these

eventful times! The idea with which I flattered myself so

much, of visiting my friends in Europe when there should be

a peace, begins to vanish, as the last accounts do not promise

peace, though the negociations at Lisle had continued two

months. I wish much to see Mr. Morgan's pamphlet,* of which
we have had an extract in our papers. Other accounts, which
my son has from England, represent every thing in a state of
perfect security, with every appearance of plenty and pros
perity. Surely, having all the power of France to contend
with alone, must create some alarm in the most confident.

   Here, our prospects seem more favourable than they did
some time ago, as I hope we are in a fair way of accommo
dating matters with France and Spain, though nothing is fully
settled as yet. The yellow fever, which is not less infectious
or fatal than the plague, has been severe at Philadelphia this
autumn, as well as at Baltimore, and some other places ; but
it has never yet reached the interior part of the country.

   Our situation at Northumberland is in the way of being im
proved by the opening of the Susquehannah, the navigation of
which has been much impeded by rocks. This, it is supposed,
will be accomplished in two years. We have also a line of
stage-coaches from this place to Philadelphia, and several
more bridges will be built over creeks that are sometimes im
passable.

   We have had some very cold weather, and expect a severe
winter ; but at present we have what is here called the Indian
summer, the weather uncommonly hazy, but such as the sun
shines through, warm, and very pleasant, but with frosty nights.
This sometimes continues several weeks, and then come the
winter's snow and frost.

   Your last mentioned Mrs. Lindsey's illness, but with hopes
of her recovery. I am anxious to know the result. May you
be long spared to each other ! The loss of near friends, and
the society to which we have been long accustomed, weans us
from the world. I have hardly a wish to stay behind, already.
When a few more of my friends are gone, I shall wish to go
too ; and I think of our meeting in another state much more
than ever. What an unspeakable blessing is the knowledge of
Christianity ! What a pearl of great price do unbelievers

reject ! I have now very little real satisfaction in any studies
that are foreign to this. I think I should even drop my phi
losophical pursuits, but that I consider them as that study of
the works of the great Creator, which I shall resume with
more advantage hereafter.

they have received. How great are my obligations, and all

              To the Same.

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Nov. 16, 1797.

When there is more regularity in the intercourse between

the two countries I shall gladly send you my portrait,f if I do

not bring it myself, for I will not give up the idea of seeing

you once more in this world, though, in this state of separa

tion, I lay less stress on this, than I did, and think more on our

meeting in a better state. This is now almost constantly on

my mind. Indeed, I have now but little real satisfaction, ex

cept in Christian studies, and the society and correspondence

of Christian friends ; and as to such society, I have here very

little, but I am thankful that I am not altogether without it.

But even most Christians are but little so, and the difference

between their general conversation and that of others is not

great. Indeed, except in times of persecution, or when some

thing more particularly directs our views to other objects,

those we see every day will chiefly occupy men's thoughts,

and of course engross their conversation ; and in the present

extraordinary situation of things in the political world, the

universal topic of all conversation is of course politics, though

less in this remote part of the country than in cities.

This state of things makes me look more and more into the

Scriptures, in reading which I have more satisfaction than

ever, though I am less satisfied with respect to some of the

prophecies, especially some in Daniel, notwithstanding I have

no doubt at all of its genuineness. I am persuaded, however,

* Orig. MS.             f See supra, p. 381.
              2c2

588 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

that our principal difficulty arises from the uncertainty of the
reading, and the difficulty of translating. If we knew what
Daniel really wrote, I am persuaded we should now understand
him better than he did himself. You need not fear my pub
lishing any thing upon this subject before I get more light
than I yet have. Of late I have read and thought a good deal
about the prophecy of the seventy weeks, and do not like any
thing that I have found, or that I wrote in the Dissertation
prefixed to my Harmony.*

   I have completed and transcribed for the press the whole of
my Church History, brought down to the present time. I am
now collecting materials for my Comparison of the Institutions
of Moses with those of Hindostan, and with this view am pe
rusing the Institutes of Hindu Law, by Sir W. Jones. As to
the Helvian Letters,! I find, as you do, that the work is too
large ; and rather than abridge it, I shall endeavour to strike
out something of a similar nature, and make use of the ma
terials that it will supply ; but whether I shall be able to do
this to any purpose, I cannot tell. There will be great diffi
culty in it, and I fear I have written too much on the subject.
I have a pretty large section on the progress of infidelity, in the
last period of my Church History. I am very thankful in
deed that I have the capacity and the means of doing any thing
to promote the greatest and best of causes.

   P. S. I rejoice to hear that Mrs. Lindsey is recovered from
her illness; I was long anxious about it. J

Dear Friend,      Northumberland, Nov. 30, 1797.

I have just received your No. 12, but not 11, any more than

7, 8, or 9, so that I fear our correspondence, which is one of

my greatest consolations, will suffer much interruption. I feel

little or no interest iu any thing that passes here. Indeed, the

great scenes that are open in Europe engross every body's

whole attention.

We have just seen the declaration of the French Directory,

preparatory to the renewal of hostilities, and have some faint
hopes that it may prevent them. I have a new thought with
respect to the prophecy of the seventy weeks, as it is com
monly called, about which I shall write to you or Mr. Bel-
sham, when my ideas are a little clearer.

   I wish much to see Mr. Belsham's answer to Mr. Wilber-
force ; also Mr. Frend's Algebra. I am sorry that Mr. Fer
guson's New Rotula, which I refer to, p. 35 of the Disserta
tions* prefixed to my Harmony, could not be got when I left
England. Mr. Jones, of Holborn, had a copy in MS. which he
offered me, but I was unwilling to take it, hoping he would
get it engraved. Please to apply to him to get a copy taken
of it.

   1 thank you for all the articles of news that you send me.
Every thing you write interests me more than you can well
imagine. I am particularly pleased with the account of the
societyf at Paris, and wish to know which of the Directory^
belongs to it.§

                         To the Same.

Dear Friend,             Northumberland, Jan. 1, 1798.

I have nearly finished the first short-hand copy of a Com

parison of the Institutions of the Hindoos and other Ancient

Nations with those of Moses. I feel myself much interested

in this work, and could I have it read, it must, I think, make

some impression on candid unbelievers. I have made many

hundreds of extracts from various writings, especially the In

stitutions of Menu, and the Code of Gentoo Laws, and have

introduced them, or the substance of them, into my work.

This peace, so long looked for, must surely come soon. I

wish the victory at sea, on the coast of Holland,|| of which we

have just heard, may lead to it; but I rather fear it may put

it farther off. But, should this desirable event take place, I

fear I shall not be able to realize my great wish to see you

once more. Such a voyage at my age is a very serious thing,
and the expenses attending it would be very great. Else I
would bring this work and my Church History and print them
both with you ; for, if I was in England, means, I trust, would
be found to do it.

   Having now much leisure, I am recomposing what was lost
of my Exposition of the New Testament at the riots. This is
heavy work, but I am determined to do it. In about a year I
shall hope to bring it to a conclusion. On reconsidering the
work, I have given up all thoughts of the translation or abridg
ment of the Helvian Letters, though I wish some person would
undertake it.

   We are entering on another year, which seems to be big
with great events. May they be happy ones ! But I cannot
help fearing great calamity, as the prophecies announcing such,
I think are about to be accomplished, or rather are accom
plishing.

   Three complete years I have now passed in this country,
and each of them has been attended with a great trial to me.
I hope, however, I feel solid consolation from my full per
suasion that every thing is ordered in the best manner; and,
though not now, I shall, one day, see how it is so. I cannot, how
ever, but, in consequence of these events, sit much looser to this
state than I ever did, and think more of another. Without
this resource, I do not know what I should do, from despair of
any good. With it, I am far from being unhappy.

   Since I wrote the above, I have received your No. 8, also
Mr. Belsham's. He objects to a note in my Letters to M.
Volney*, which I believe had a good effect here. I cannot ex
press what I feel on receiving your letters, and those of Mr.
Belsham. They set my thoughts afloat, so that I can do
nothing but ruminate a long time; but it is a most pleasing
melancholy. I am interested in every thing you write, whereas
I have nothing to write in return, but about myself and my
pursuits.f

              To Rev. T. Belsham.*

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Jan. 11, 1798.

I am now made happy by receiving your No. 4. I perceive

that you had received most, if not all, my publications of the

last winter.

Mr. Adams, about whose conduct you wish to be informed,

only attended on me once, the last winter. When my lectures

were less popular, and he was near his presidentship, he left

me, making a kind of apology, from the members of the prin

cipal Presbyterian church having offered him a pew there.f

He seemed to interest himself in my favour against M. Volney,

but did not even subscribe to my Church History. Had he

done that, and recommended the subscription, it would have

succeeded, I doubt not ; but that any statesman should risk his

popularity on account of religion, is not to be expected. He

would have been the first in any similar situation if he had

done it. I suppose, too, he was not pleased that I did not

adopt his dislike of the French.
  The outcry against French principles, &c, is more violent

here, probably, than with you. The abuse of the French, and

the supposed friends of France, (among whom 1 have the mis

fortune to be ranked,) is much more violent and coarse than in

any English newspaper whatever ; yet, in point of argument,

the friends of France are greatly superior to their opponents,

and so they are in Congress. I have desired my son to send

Mr. Lindsey some of our publications on that subject.
   P. S. I am much concerned at the last news from Europe,

as I fear there will be no peace for England soon, and the

country must be in a state of great alarm and real danger. J

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Jan. 18, 1798.

Since I wrote last, I have received two of your letters. I

hare also been made very happy by receiving, very safe, the

box of books from Mr. Johnson, of which I had despaired.

He has sent me a treasure in the General Dictionary. It will
be very useful in revising my Church History, which I shall
wish to make as perfect as 1 possibly can. Having very little
society here, such miscellaneous reading as this work supplies,
is a great resource for me. Such, too, is the Universal His
tory, which I owe to Dr. Disney, to whom I beg you to give
my best respects. I have lately read with pleasure his Lives.*
They are very useful, and written with a liberal spirit

   I receive most satisfaction from works, especially of the last
age, which illustrate the Scriptures. Of this kind I miss the
first volume of Reland's Miscellanies, destroyed at the riots.
I want Jablonski's Pantheon Mgyptiorum.f I have only the
 third volume, which escaped the riots. If you would know
 and feel the value of books of literature, come hither, where
 they are not to be had. I am very thankful, however, to have
 a library so well furnished. In this country I have seen three
 of college libraries, and mine is three times more valuable than
 all. But, at Philadelphia, there is a very valuable learned
 library, to which I was much obliged when I was there. By
 the help of it I detected the false quotations of Freret,J as
 you would see in the third edition of my Observations.

    I have nearly finished my Comparison of the Institutions of
 the Hindoos with those of Moses. If the subject would but
 be attended to, it must furnish a most decisive proof of the
 divinity of the latter. I have some hopes that I can get this
  work printed here. If I could afford it, I would do it at my
  own expense. I should not grudge any thing that I could
  spare for such a purpose.

     I rejoice with you that Mrs. Lindsey is so much better.
  What could you do without her ; and what can I do when
  you are gone ? At present, most of my ties to this world are
  broken. But the Christian hope is every thing. Having this,
  I shall never be unhappy. This lessens my concern for my
  daughter. I trust she will be improved by her trial, and shew
  an example of Christian fortitude, humility, and industry, and
  she cannot suffer long. I do not, however, wholly give up the

hope of seeing both her and you, before our more happy
meeting.0

           To Mr. J. H. Stoned

Dear Sir,                   Northumberland, Jan. 20, 1798.

I was very happy to receive your very kind letter^ and the

very sensible pamphlet which you did me the honour to

address to me. I am sorry we are so circumstanced that we

can have so little intercourse even by letters, the communica

tion between France and this country is so very uncertain.

In this I found myself exceedingly disappointed.

Your account of the state of religion in France gives me

great satisfaction. I rejoice that neither you nor Mr. Vaughan

are carried away by the present torrent of infidelity. They

cannot say that all men of sense leave us. This makes me

wish the more to see France, for though I cannot preach in

French, I might, in some other way, promote the cause I

have so much at heart. I wish I knew how to send you the

Discourses I have published here on that subject; but perhaps

you may get them from London. I know no method of send

ing you any thing from hence, or of getting any thing from

you.

You congratulate me on my interview with B. V. He is

settled so far from me (at Kennebech) that I never expect to

see him at all. I once intended to have gone as far as Boston ;

but travelling in this country is so inconvenient and expensive,

that I have given up all thoughts of it. I should almost as

readily cross the Atlantic

There has been a most extraordinary change in the politics

of the trading people of this country since I came hither,

as to countries in alliance with France, which gives me great

concern ; and now I am subject to more coarse abuse, as a friend

of France, than I was in England. But the bulk of the people

are still hostile to England, and rejoice, as I do, in the success

of the French, and I am persuaded would never be brought to

fight against them. I hope that you have more moderation

and good sense than to proceed to hostilities against this coun
try, though it has not (I mean the leaders of it) deserved any
better. It is the mercantile interest only that has made the
change, and the glorious success of the French arms, if nothing
else, will open their eyes at length.

   M. Adet promised to write to me on his arrival in France,
but I have not heard from him since he left us. I have pub
lished a reply to his answer, on the subject of Phlogiston. I
wrote to M. Perigaux to desire he would make a small pur
chase for me near Paris, but my money in his hands will not
suffice for the purpose.

   P. S. Perhaps M. Talleyrand would assist in what I have
hinted. The last thing he said to me was, that he expected to
see me in France.

             From Mr. J. H. Stone.

             Paris, February 12, 1798

, Dear Sir,  (25 Pluviose, 6 Year).

Although it is now a very considerable time that we have

not had the pleasure of hearing immediately from you, your

self, yet, either by way of England, or by citizens coming from

America, we are seldom, for a long time, without tidings of a

more or less particular nature concerning you. The last, we

received from a young Frenchman, who tells us, that he has

been particularly acquainted with you, and rejoiced us with

the agreeable information that, at the peace, you would not

fail to revisit Europe, and that he hoped you would fix your

self in this country. Whether you fix yourself here or in En
gland, as England will then be, is probably a matter of little

importance, except to your friends, who will naturally be anx

ious to have you, each where themselves are fixed ; but we

all think that you are misplaced where you are, though, no

doubt, in the way of usefulness, however the sphere may be

diminished.

I presume you are not so far removed from the centre of the

political world, in your retreat at Northumberland, as not to

be duly informed of the principal events that are passing in

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIKSTLEY,  395

Europe, although you may not know much of the detail. You
will, of course, have heard that our old country is now the only
one left to struggle against the French Republic

   You have heard, no doubt, of the new sect, which now has
usurped every church in Paris, under the name of Theophi-
lanthropism. This sect is prohibited by the government; but
it is in the hands of ignorant men, who do not know how to use
the weapons that are put into their hands. They are, for the
most part, well-intentioned ; and had they the means of infor
mation, would, probably, make good Christians. Nothing is
read here, on these subjects, because nothing is wrote. We
have seen nothing but Mr. Paine's Age of Reason, of which an
immense edition, in French, was published, and not twenty
copies were sold. I am told, he has also been rejected from
the society of the Theophilanthropes, on the charge of intole
rance. They have, at least, refused his offers of public in
struction. Some atheistical tracts have been published, which
have been little attended to, and the mind is floating, at pre
sent, not knowing on what ground to repose ; unwilling to re
ject the Christian religion, and yet ignorant how to distinguish
the wheat from the chaff.

   Our National Institute goes on reading and publishing, and
has just an appearance of activity, though nothing of very con
siderable importance has been done since its formation. I be
lieve I mentioned to you, in my last letter, that Favery is about
to publish a history of chemistry, or, at least, is busily em
ployed in writing in the mode, as I understand from himself,
of your History of Optics and Electricity. I have a packet of
books done up for you at a bookseller's, but the hopes of see
ing you in France hindered me from sending them at the
period I might have sent them, and now it would be extremely
hazardous, since all American vessels are made prizes, and
there is no security of conveyance. Nevertheless, if I find a
fortunate opportunity, I shall send them, for I fear that we
shall yet delay to see you here.

   Whether we shall continue or increase our hostilities towards
the United States, is as yet uncertain. All depends on the
great operation directed against England. If that succeeds,

396 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

English influence will, probably, not predominate amongst
you. In the mean time, it is most likelysthat the French will

go on, as at present, treating with as little ceremony as usual
every thing that relates to America. John Adams' speech, on
the opening of Congress, caused a few smiles; the more so, as
it was understood to be a speech full of thunder and menace
against France. Nothing is wanting but the interposition of
some upright and patriotic citizen to settle the misunderstand
ing ; but I fear it will not be done in John Adams' time.

   Mr. Skipwith has promised that a letter shall be conveyed
safely to you. I have, therefore, taken the opportunity of
writing you a triple letter ; and, but for fear of wearying your
patience, so much multiplied are events, I could fill half a
dozen more. The history of the events in France of the last
year, you will find pretty largely detailed in the New Annual
Register, to which my present is a kind of supplement; but
we hope that you will not long delay to be a fellow-witness of
them with ourselves.*

To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,                Northumberland, March 8, 1798.

After many delays, I have, at length, received all the

Morning Chronicles and Cambridge Intelligencers that you

have sent me ; for I find I have them complete from the time

of my arrival in this country, and I value them much, especi

ally the Cambridge paper, and as it contains almost every

thing that is of much value in the other, I shall be very well

content to have that only.

   Having had leisure enough this winter, and finding it irk
some to make many experiments, which require me to have

my hands frequently in water, I have not only brought my

Church History to the present time, but have recomposed
what was destroyed in the riots of my Exposition of the New

Testament. I have also completed my Comparison. To make

the evidence in favour of the divine mission of Moses more

unexceptionable, I have methodized all the laws of Moses, and
added a few notes. The whole will make a pretty large 8vo.
I should not choose to print the Exposition, for several years,
and, in the mean time, I shall be reading with a view to the
improvement of it, as well as of the History.

   What will you say to my leaving this country and going to
France ? Having some acquaintance with Talleyrand Perigord,
late Bishop of Autun,* who succeeds M. Delacroix, I have writ
ten to him, almost promising, that if what his predecessor said
would be made good, I should go, but that it would be im
prudent, at my age, to go on an uncertainty. I wait his an
swer ; but if it should be favourable, I cannot leave this coun
try till the next summer. The satisfaction I should have in
being nearer to you and my friends in England would be
greater than I can well express. But I wish not to consult my
satisfaction (for I am very well content to be here, and am
truly thankful for the asylum I have found here) so much as
my power of being useful with respect to Christianity. I shall
devote my time to that one object, and consider my philoso
phical pursuits as only subservient to that. Now I really
think that I cannot do much more in this country, though I
am happy to think that I have done some, and that a seed is
sown which will not require my continuance here to ripen. I
even think it will ripen better without my presence.

   We are much interested in the news from Europe. Things
are coming fast to a great crisis ; but the friends of England
here are under no apprehensions for it. I wish my friends
were elsewhere ; but a wise and good Providence overrules all
events. Party spirit is more violent here than with you, and
such is the increasing hatred against France, that I almost fear
an open rupture. As a supposed friend of France, I have more
coarse abuse than I had in England, so great is the change that
has taken place since my arrival. Our last newspaper gave us
part of Mr. Fox's speech on the new finance bill, with Mr.
Pitt's reply, and an account of great preparations for the inva
sion of England.

   With my earnest prayers for the safety of you ail, I am
yours and Mrs. Lindsey's most affectionately.*

             To Mr. RusselL.f

Dear Sir,    Northumberland, March 22,1798.

   I thank you for so readily admitting my excuse for not
paying you a visit. There is no place to which I should go
with so much satisfaction. If I had not children of my own,
I should petition to live with you, or near you ; and it is not
impossible but we may yet spend a good part of the remainder

of life together.
   I have already not only recomposed, but transcribed all that

was destroyed at the riots, of my Exposition of the New Tes
tament. But though it is ready for the press, I had rather
keep it a year or two longer to make improvements in it, and
especially to add what I had not before attempted, an Expo
sition of the Revelation. I am now at work upon it. To this
work, whenever it is printed, I propose, as from the first, to
prefix a dedication to you, as the person who made every
thing so easy to me at Birmingham, where I first began the
custom of expounding from the pulpit, and who contributed
so much to the satisfaction I enjoyed in that favourite situa

tion.
   There is, certainly, no such thing as an Unitarian Exposi

tion of the New Testament, and therefore Mr. Thatcher is
particularly desirous to have mine printed. But neither is
there any Unitarian Church History, and, I think, this is even
more wanted than the other. The times, however, more im
mediately call for works that may throw light on the evidences
of revelation, and, in this view, I think my Comparison
most wanted at present. We must, however, submit to the
times, as the voice of Providence. I shall employ the happy
leisure I enjoy here in improving all these works, as well as
in my philosophical pursuits, and one entire year, without in-

terruption, will, I hope, enable me to do a good deal. I am
very thankful for such an opportunity.

   We cannot now see a day before us, and the greatest events
are depending; but if there be a peace within the year, I think
it not improbable but I may go to France the next summer,
and then I may print these works there ; and I shall hope to
be able to do it even without the assistance you kindly pro
mise me, which, however, I shall not refuse, if it be necessary.

   I see in Swift's " Collection of the Laws of Connecticut,"
that Unitarianism is a crime punishable, in the first instance,
with incapacity for office, and, in the next, with exclusion
from the courts of law ; so that a Unitarian cannot recover a
debt or have redress for any injury. The book was printed, I
think, in 1796, or very lately. Now this one circumstance,
though the law should not be put in execution, would prevent
my settling in that state, whatever else it might have to recom
mend it. I was absolutely astonished to find this, but there
cannot be a doubt of the fact, though you may not have heard
of it. There is no such law in this state, or in France. If ever
we live together, it must be in a country of religious liberty at
 least.*

To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, May 17, 179S.

It is now a long time, indeed, since I have had the satisfac

tion of hearing either from you or Mr. Belsham, and the times

are such, that I fear our communication will grow more un

certain and difficult. Your last was received the 17th of

January.
   I have sometimes regretted that we were not nearer the sea-

coast; but, in the present state of things, it is better for us to

be farther from it. We are much more quiet ; though a vio

lent party spirit rages, in a great measure, through all the

 country. Our governors, in my opinion, have acted as ab
 surdly as yours, and have brought the country into great diffi
 culties, which might easily have been avoided, and the mea
 sures they are now taking have no tendency to make things
  better. The state of religion and morals is not better here than
 in England, and public calamities, generally brought on by the
 violence and folly of the governing powers, seem to be the
 usual means in the hand of Providence of correcting moral evil,
 and disciplining nations into virtue.

    The present state of things is wonderfully interesting, and,
 to a Christian, full of consolation, though calamitous. Our
 young men will see great things, and even we, who are old,
 may at least sing the song of Simeon. The papal power, for
 the destruction of which we have so long prayed, is now fallen,
 and this will be a great blow to her spiritual power which
 preceded it, and will, no doubt, continue some time longer.

    To my Comparison I think to add some strictures on the
 strange work of M. Dupuis, which I have now before me. It
 is, I think, the ne plus ultra of infidelity, and hardly admits of
 a serious answer. M. Volney, I hear, triumphs greatly on its
 appearance, and the prevalence of infidelity is astonishing. And
 yet, notwithstanding all I have done to oppose its progress, in
which I am single, I was, last Sunday, (and, 1 believe, fre
quently am,) preached against in this very place, as a deist;
and lie under much greater odium than any professed un
believer.

   There are, however, both here and in various parts of the
country, some rational Christians, and their number increases,
though slowly. The extreme bigotry of some, affords a better
prospect than the total indifference of others. Those whose
sentiments are more liberal, do not care to shew it. It is only
now and then that any besides our own family attend on Sun
day's service, though the place contains many persons of good
sense, and the preachers are nothing better than the common
run of Methodists in England.

   Having abundant leisure, I think now to go on writing notes

in any thing, and I am pretty well furnished with books for
the purpose. They will remain with my executor, if I cannot
print them myself.*

               To Rev. T. BulshAm.t

Dear Friend,                         Northumberland, June 5, 1798.

What would I not give to lay before you my Notes on

Daniel and the Revelation, as well as my Comparison, to which

I have now added, Remarks on M. Dupuis's Origin of all

Religions. It is impossible to be perfectly grave in answering

it. Accordingly, I have occasionally indulged in irony, as in

my answer to Volney; who, it seems, had all his wild notions

from him, and, I hear, triumphs greatly in the publication.

Mr. Estlin has some good observations on the subject of this

work ;J but weak as it is, it deserves, on account of the great

labour, ingenuity, learning, and originality, a fuller answer.

There are no studies that give me so much satisfaction as

those relating to the Scriptures and revelation in general, and

at present the prophecies are certainly the most interesting, as

the fulfilment of the most important of them is, no doubt, at

hand ; and yet a good many years may intervene before the

scene of calamity be passed. I fully expect the personal ap

pearance of Jesus, and have given my reasons for it at large in

. my Notes on the Revelation ;§ but this will hardly be before

the restoration of the Jews, of which there are no symptoms at

present. The Turkish empire must fall, before that event, and

the neighbouring powers do not seem disposed to meddle with

it. But, great changes in the dispositions of men may take

place in a short time, and things least expected come to pass.

Of this we have lately seen many instances. Little did I ex

pect hostility between this country and France, when I came

hither. It was rather thought there would have been a war

with England.

You will, probably, think me a visionary and an enthusiast,

but I have pleased myself much of late in thinking that Jesus

has a proper sphere of action relating to his church at present.
Consider what he says to the seven churches in the Revelation,
which implies both his attention to them and his direction of
their affairs, especially ch. ii. 5, 22, and iii. 10,* and his saying
to Peter, concerning John, " If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee ?" Angels may be men in the same state
 with him, and occasionally visible.f We do not see them, but
 they may see us, and have more to do than we are aware of.
 Jesus is no doubt living and on the earth, and he cannot be
 unemployed. No intelligent being, who is awake, is or ought
 to be so.

    My letters, I fear, do not reach you, any more than yours
 reach me. I shall, however, continue to write.

    P. S. I have just received and read, with the greatest satis
 faction, your answer to Mr. WilberforccJ I admire it through
 out, and cannot help thinking that, if he would read it at all, it
 must satisfy even himself, had we not so many instances of the
  invincible power of prejudice, especially when reason is avow
  edly distrusted.

     I wish I could see your Exposition of Isaiah. I am more
  than ever at a loss to understand many parts of his book, espe
  cially those that have been thought to relate to Christ. Jarchi
  gives very good reasons for applying most of them to the He
  brew nation. I wish you would tell me which you think are
  really prophecies concerning Christ in the Old Testament.
  It is a subject that wants light very much. I shall not fail of
  giving the closest attention to it; but I despair of getting com
  plete satisfaction.!

To Rev. T. Lindsey.H

Dear Friend,                Northumberland, June 16, 1798.

After an interval, which I thought very long, I have just

received three of your letters. I rejoice that, in such times

as these, we can have any communication. I fear this great

source of satisfaction to me will grow less and less.

   We are now, in fact, at war with France, and you are threat
ened, probably by this time more than threatened, with an
invasion from the same great power. It is, no doubt, the instru
ment in the hands of Providence of effecting the greatest pur
poses, and Buch as they least of all intend. The issue will no
doubt be happy, but the immediate effect will be calamitous.
The fall of the Papal power must be followed by that of those
which have supported it ; but in what manner, or at what
distance of time, we cannot tell. A few years, we see, produce
the most unexpected events. I am glad to see the French
looking towards the East, though with what view does not
appear.

   As to my speculations about the Millenium, and the present
condition of Christ, &c, surely they are innocent. To myself
they are something more than amusing ; and that they should
offend any body, really surprises me. I cannot help thinking
that some of my observations on that subject are calculated to
remove considerable difficulties in the scheme of revelation.
I should not have thought that, to any Christian, they would
have appeared very extravagant, much less that they would
have given offence, except to the very captious ; and if what
is both useful and original must be wholly overlooked, and
nothing but blemishes dwelt upon, it will be time to give over
writing. But I hope that some readers will have more candour.
I shall, however, hardly undertake more than completing, in
the best manner that I can, what I have begun. The Notes
on the Old Testament will employ me several years ; and if
they never be published, I shall not repent my labour, as I
cannot do any thing else that will give me so much satisfac
tion. I have nearly finished the short-hand copy of my Notes
on the Minor Prophets. I find Zechariah the most difficult,
though Blayney has thrown much light on that book.

   You need not be concerned about my not finding prophe
cies concerning the Messiah. There are enow, and I only ex
pressed some doubts about the Christian interpretation of the
53d of Isaiah, thinking that of the Jews, which I have been
considering, more plausible than I was used to think it, and
wishing to have Mr. Belsham's assistance, as he has lately

                                         2D2

404 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

been expounding that book. I have not formed any decided
opinion on the subject.

   I find a great disadvantage in being alone, having no person
whatever to confer with on any subject of this kind ; and as we
used to observe with respect to Mr. Cappe,* my solitary spe
culations may lead me astray, farther than I can be aware of
myself; and for this there is not perhaps any remedy, and
therefore my friends must bear with me. They should,
however, consider that they are not infallible, any more than
myself; and to many of us the time is not far distant when we
shall see more clearly than we do at present.

   I am truly thankful for the benefactions of my friends, and
desire you would make my acknowledgments to Mr. Heberden,
and my particular respects to his venerable father, of whose
bounty I have largely partaken, whether the present came from
him or not. I have written to the Duke, and shall inclose a
letter to Mrs. Rayner. I hope I truly feel the obligations
which such benefactions lay me under, to do all that I can to
promote the great cause they have at heart, and I hope that
we^shall one day rejoice together.f

Dear Friend,          Northumberland, Aug. 2, 1798.

I am just made very happy by the receipt of two letters

from you. I hear also that the books you have been so good

as to send me are safely arrived at Philadelphia, and will soon

be here, together with the newspapers, by Mr. Brookes, J whom
I have not yet seen.

I only learned that Mr. Salte was dead, by the Monthly

Magazine, which I received very lately. I have had no letter

from Mr. Sharpe. The legacy will be acceptable, though I

have no wish for any thing, but to enable me to print what I

have composed ; and this, I doubt not will be in my power

ere long, and in the mean time I shall endeavour to make what

I have written, more perfect.

I am much concerned at your account of the very bad state

of Dr. Aikin's health.* I always thought him very healthy,

and likely, being temperate and active, to live long. He was

always usefully employed, and his manners peculiarly pleasing.

Dr. Enfield's death was mentioned by Mrs. Barbauld and Mr,

Johnson as an event with which I must be acquainted, whereas

I had not had any account of it at all, and was much concerned

at it. He was much younger than me, and always actively

and usefully employed. I am particularly thankful that you

and Mrs. Lindsey are preserved. Could I but see you once

more, (and I do not despair of it,) it would, I think, make me

live something longer, it would give me so much satisfaction.

But we are all in the hands of One who best knows how to dis

pose of us; and the thing we should, and I hope do, chiefly

attend to, is to secure a happy meeting in a state of greater

permanency than this.

I had some hopes that            's scepticism had left him,

but you intimate the contrary. However, evert Christianity

itself is only a means to a certain end ; and, if that be attained,

though I think it next to impossible, all will be well. That

any unbeliever can be pious, and habitually devout, (without

which every character must be very imperfect,) is what I have

not yet seen any appearance of.

Your account of Mrs. Rayner and Dr. Heberden is very

pleasing. I have not yet had the letter of the former, but now

I shall not despair of any thing. It will give me great plea

sure to receive it, come when it will. Time will carry off one

friend after another; and this makes our own removal less

painful, nay, rather desirable. I do not wish to live a day

longer than I can live to do some good ; and I am thankful

that my health is on the whole better now than it has ever

been yet, though I am far from being strong. I wish Mrs.

Lindsey could say the same.

      Sir, Northumberland, Sept. 4, 1798.
   I beg leave, through the channel of your paper, to give
what satisfaction I can to many persons in this country, who
seem to be alarmed at the publication of an intercepted letter
addressed to me by Mr. J. Stone at Paris,§ and inclosing ano
ther which I was to transmit to M. B. P. (which means a Mem
ber of the British Parliament) at Kennebeck. They were first
printed in England, with a view to render me obnoxious here.
Whether they ought to have this effect, let any impartial per
son judge from the following circumstances :
   Mr. John Stone was a member of my congregation at Hack
ney, and a zealous friend of the American and French Revo
lutions, which sufficiently accounts for his corresponding with
me.|| But I am not answerable for what he or any other per
son may think proper to write to me.
   The letter inclosed to me is for Mr. Benjamin Vaughan, for
merly a pupil of mine,*] and son to Mr. Samuel Vaughan,**
who some time ago resided in Philadelphia. He is a man that
any country may be proud to possess; having for ability,
knowledge of almost every kind, and the most approved inte
grity, very few equals. He is well known to, and probably
corresponds with, the President, who will smile at the sur
mises that have been thrown out on the subject. He has
fixed his residence at Kennebeck, because his family has large

which to do mischief. But,

                 To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,     Northumberland, Sept. 6, 1798.

Since your last, the intercepted letters have been published

here, with the preface and notes from the English edition,

and others much more virulent. Though I have no more to

do with the politics of this country than you have, so violent

is party spirit, that if there be not a change soon, I cannot

expect to live in peace here. It looks like a call of Provi

dence for another remove, after having, at a great expense,

provided to spend the remainder of life where I now am.

Living alone, as I do, this is almost all that I have to write to

you about.

Your kindness to my daughter affects me much. I never

can requite the friendship you shew me in every way. I have

had an affecting letter from her.

I have many difficulties here that I little expected ; but my

time cannot be long, and I hope my faith in a good Providence

is such as that I shall never be unhappy long. No cloud has

hitherto been so thick but I thought I could see through it;

and the same Being who has conducted me hitherto will be my

guide still. But when the times are so dark and serious with

respect to nations, how can individuals expect to escape

troubles ?J

                 To Rev. T. Belsham.§

find that mine to you have been conveyed with some regu
larity.

   Though I am regarded with suspicion, and disliked by all
the friends of the ruling powers in this country, and labour
under much disadvantage in several respects, as want of philo
sophical intelligence, and books, &c, from Europe, yet, as I am
under no apprehension of actual molestation, I certainly shall
not remove till there be a peace, and a good prospect of doing
better, elsewhere.

   The change that has taken place is indeed hardly credible,
as I have done nothing to provoke resentment; but being a
citizen of France, and a friend to that revolution, is sufficient.
I asked one of the more moderate of that party whether he
thought if Dr. Price, the great friend of their own revolution,
was alive, he would now be allowed to come into this country.
He said, he believed he would not. The persons most in favour
are the old Tories, who opposed the revolution. Notwithstand
ing this, the great body of the farmers, and others in these back
parts, are opposed to the government, as has appeared in the
late election for members of Congress. In our neighbourhood
they are only the more wealthy people, and those connected
with the merchants, that are the violent enemies of France,
and they now find they have not the influence they imagined
they had, over the lower orders of people.

   We expect a hard struggle the next meeting of Congress,
especially as it now appears that the French do not intend to
go to war with this country, and shew a disposition to con
ciliate matters. The heavy taxes, too, laid by the last session
of Congress, and which will soon become due, it is thought
cannot be raised, so great is the want of money in the
country. Almost all business is done by the exchange
of commodities. This, however, makes many articles very
cheap, especially at this time of the year, when many
of the farmers are obliged to sell their cattle as well as
they can. We have just bought the best mutton for three
half-pence sterling per pound, and all butchers' meat is nearly
as low. What they cannot sell, they kill and salt.

   George Humphrys, the youngest of the three brothers, is
lately dead, near Philadelphia, cut off by the yellow fever,
which prevails so much there, and in other parts of the coun
try.* It is as destructive as the plague. Pestilences and earth
quakes, as well as war, are to precede the second coming of
Christ. I consider the Millenium as the day or season of
judgment, and the coming of Christ is to be visible, and to
precede this. But the Jews must first be restored to their
own country, and there is some appearance of this great work
being in agitation.

   No period since that of our Saviour has been of so much
importance as the present ; and it is evident that the state of
things is in a rapid motion. What is now done is only the
commencement of something greater. I long to be nearer the
centre of motion, and to be doing something in my way, more
than I can here. Whatever danger there might have been for
merly from the idea of Christ being on the earth, and having
some unknown sphere of action, there is none now; and there
fore we may freely indulge any speculations on the subject.f

To Rev. T. Lindsey.J

Dear Friend,                       Northumberland Nov. 1, 1798.

I am willing to flatter myself that I may be able to pay

you a visit the next year, whether my stay be longer or shorter.

This, however, will depend on several circumstances, which

we cannot command, particularly on the event of a peace, or

truce, which I once hoped might have been made before the

next spring ; but that prospect is, at present, much obscured.

I have been very busy in my laboratory, and have made as

many original experiments this summer as I almost ever did

in the same time. The account of them would make a pretty

large volume. But my favourite occupation is theology ; and

on this subject I can employ myself as long as I live, be that

ever so long. Whether what I write be ever published or not,
I cannot spend my time better, or more to my own satisfac
tion. The books with which you have kindly supplied me,
have been, and are, of singular use. With respect to the
Scriptures, I am pretty well furnished. Mr. Scott, my neigh
bour at Ipswich, when I was at Needham, in Suffolk, pub
lished a poetical version of the book of Job, with large critical
notes.* I lost it at the riots, and forgot to replace it. It
would now be useful to me, and I wish you would desire Mr.
Johnson to send it, and any new publications that may come
out, of the kind.

   Though we are always apt to magnify present appearances,
I have little doubt but that the great prophecies relating to the
permanent and happy state of the world, are in the way of
fulfilment ; but the preceding season of calamity may be of
long continuance. The termination of the temporal power of
the Pope,f and the destruction of the monarchy that made him
a temporal power, shews us pretty clearly where we are, and
what we have next to look for. I rejoice to hear of something
respecting the Jews. Whatever it be, it must prepare the way
for their restoration. The French, it is said, have it in view, in
consequence of some proposals they have made to them ; and
that they have no view to the fulfilment of prophecy, is a
favourable circumstance. We have just heard of Buonaparte's
safe arrival at Alexandria,J and part of his force at Scanderoon.
Whatever be the object of that expedition, it seems to be
hazardous. However, great things may come of it, and those
not intended by the French.

   From our last accounts, a new war seems ready to break
out ; but there seems no appearance of it reaching us, so that
the rash measures of this government may, perhaps, have done
no harm on the whole. As the French have surrendered in

Ireland, I suppose you will have no invasion this year. The
French do not seem to have seriously intended it.

  I hope this will find you returned, in health, from the north,
and that Mrs. Lindsey will have a prospect of being something
better. We have had an uncommonly dry summer, but now
snow falls, and I dread the winter.*

             To Mrs. Barbauld.

Dear Madam,  Northumberland, Dec. 23, 1798.

  This will, I hope, be delivered, as it will be conveyed, by
my son. How happy should I think myself to wait on you
and Mr. Barbauld in person ! Should there be a peace, I do
promise myself that pleasure ; but at present this great bless
ing seems to be at a great distance.

  When I compare the perturbed state of Europe with the
quiet of this place, I wish all my friends were here, provided
they could find sufficient employment to be happy; but, if
they be like myself, they must be content to be idle, except so
far as they can make themselves employment in their closets.
My library and laboratory sufficiently occupy me, and of com
mon society I have as much as I want. A few more rational
Christians, to form a society, would make this place a paradise
to me, and this would be wanting in many parts of England.

  You have obliged me very much by the exquisite little poem
you sent me. I hope you will add to the obligation by the
communication of the fragment on the game of Chess, or any
other little pieces you may think proper to send me. You had
no copy of your first poem to my wife,f or I should value that
above any other ; and also the little poem you wrote on the
birth of Joseph.

                 To Rev. T. Lindsey.*

Dear Friend,                  Northumberland, Dec. 23, 1798.

I send you, by my son, a picture of myself, in return for

yours, which always hangs directly opposite to me as I sit,

and which I frequently look at with peculiar satisfaction, and,

I may say, improvement. The picture of Dr. Price is also in

view, and that of our old friend Mr. Lee,f and the fine coun

tenance of Professor Hutchinson, from Hollis's Memoirs.

Though dead, they seem to speak, and tend to inspire good

sentiments.

We expect a warm session of Congress. The State of Ken

tucky has rejected the late acts of Congress respecting sedition

and aliens, and sent to all the other state-legislatures for their

concurrence. Their declaration on the subject is, for forcible

composition, equal to any thing I have ever read. We suppose

it to be drawn up by our friend Mr. Toulmin, the secretary of

state. A great majority of the people in these parts, and, I

believe, through this state, disapprove of the late measures ;

but this will only appear in new elections for members of

Congress, &c, though party-spirit runs very high, and indivi

duals are much exasperated against each other. On this ac

count, as well as others, I do not go to Philadelphia this winter.

I am anxious about Mrs. Lindsey's health : but as she is

younger than you, I hope you will hold out together, and have

some years of comfort yet. J

                 To Rev. Da. Toulmin.§

Dear Sir,                     Northumberland, Jan. 9, 1799.

If I have not written to you so often as you wished, it has

not been owing to any want of respect, but because I had no

thing to inform you of that you would not, of course, hear

from Mr. Lindsey or Mr. Belsham, with whom I correspond ;

and really I live here so retired, and pass my time in so uni
form a manner, that I have nothing worth writing to you about.
I have here abundant leisure, but no object beyond my library
or laboratory ; and though desirous of exertion other ways, I
have no field for it.

  Two winters I went to Philadelphia, and delivered two sets
of discourses on the Evidences of Revelation, which were well
attended to, at first, but, when the novelty went off, my audi
ence was so inconsiderable, that I thought it would answer
no good end to do any thing more in that way, and I have
no encouragement to go, any more. The state of politics has,
I believe, contributed something to this. 1 am considered as a
citizen of France, and the rage against every thing relating to
France and French principles, as they say, is not to be de
scribed. It is even more violent than with you. This is a
change that I was far from expecting when I came hither. I
have nothing to do with their politics, and have taken no
part whatever ; but this does not exempt me from the most

rancorous abuse.
   There is, however, another party in the country, and I be

lieve the great majority of the farmers in this part of the coun
try are of it. In Kentucky, where your son is Secretary of
State, they are almost universally of it. They are so much
opposed to the measures of the general government, that I
begin to fear a division of the country, and perhaps a civil war
will be the consequence. In my opinion, an amicable sepa
ration will be desirable, as the southern states in general are
disaffected. In this state of Pennsylvania, the majority, I be
lieve, are so too, though those who are so say little. The true
 state of the case will appear at the next election of a Governor,
 which will be the next autumn.

    This circumstance, and it is the only topic of general con
 versation, makes the country unpleasant to me ; but I am so
 fixed that I cannot well leave it, though I had some time ago
 thoughts of going to France. Should there be a peace, I still
 promise myself the pleasure of seeing my friends in Europe
 once more ; but according to our latest accounts, that desirable
 event is yet at a great distance.

find here. I have no concern but about my daughter, and her

conduct is such as really makes me proud of her. She will, I

doubt not, get through her difficulties in time, and be better

in every respect for them ; and if I never see her in this world,

which I have almost ceased to expect, I shall hope to meet

her in a better.

A visit from you and Mr. Skey, and any other of your fa

mily, would make me very happy; but I do not now expect

it.j

                  To Rev. T. Lindsey.§

      Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Feb. 14, 1799.

The books you have sent me lately are singularly useful,

especially Jablonski's Pantheon. I have read it with particu

lar satisfaction, and shall give a short analysis of it in my

Comparison. I have also read that strange but curious book,

Apuleius's Metamorphoses. Vandale's works and H. Reland's

are excellent; and with Commentators on the Scriptures I am

well supplied. And yet, if I could see any of your sale-cata

logues, I dare say I should long to purchase many articles.

As every thing of this kind must come from England, I can

not give more than a faint idea of my feelings when I open a

fresh package of books or instruments, or hear that they are

safely arrived at Philadelphia.

I am much concerned for the fate of Mr. Johnson. He cer

tainly did not deserve this harsh treatment; but we are fol

lowing you here in the same steps as fast as we can. I shall

be anxious to know the whole of his destiny, and also that of
Mr. Wakefield, whose honest boldness* is worthy of better
times; but he could not expect to escape in these.

   Though I am much affected at this part of your letter, I re
joice at the recovery of Dr. Aikin,f and especially that of Mrs.
Lindsey. I have thought of her and of you much upon that
account. I hope we shall all meet in a better state than this,
though we have much to be thankful for here, and I am very
thankful, when I feel the most. When I consider how the
 patience of the excellent characters in the Old Testament (to
 which I now give particular attention) was tried, I think my
 trials nothing at all. Still more do they vanish when 1 con
 sider the fate of M. MarollesJ and thousands of the martyrs,
 especially those who were long imprisoned in loathsome dun

 geons. As to a public violent death, the idea of that does not
 affect me near so much. But God is the best judge of our lot,
 and, no doubt, orders every thing for the best, for us all.§

              To the Same.

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, March 21, 1799.

   I cannot express what I feel when I receive and read your
letters. I generally shed many tears over them, but by no
means from sorrow or any unpleasant feeling. I am truly
thankful for such a friend, and shall endeavour to deserve it.

   Having sold a small house which I purchased for my re
sidence till this was built, I am able to put to the press my
Comparison, &c. I shall prefix an Address to the Jews re
specting the present state of things, and in a separate section,
an account of their devotions and customs, at present. With
all their superstitions, they are infinitely superior to the Hin
doos or any heathen nations. I have made great use of Jab-
lonski. It is an excellent work, and is written in so good and
easy Latin, that it reads like a book in English or French,

 which is seldom the case with German Latin. Sleidan is an
 other example of elegant, easy Latin.

    The work to which I propose to devote what remains of life
and faculties is my Notes on all the Books of Scripture, and a
corrected version of them. In this I should be glad to have
some assistance, as I have mentioned to Mr. Belsham. I wish
that, for this purpose, our old plan could be resumed.* For
this work my library (with respect to which I am much in
debted to you) is sufficiently ample. When I consider where
I am, I view my library and apparatus with astonishment; and
yet I want many things that would cost little or nothing in
London. I wish you would call on Mr. Parker in Fleet Street,
and thank him for his late present of glass. It was very ac
ceptable.

   I have nearly printed my Notes on the Pentateuch ; and I
never had so much satisfaction in any thing as in these studies.
The only thing that is irksome to me is transcribing what I
compose, in long hand. But, for this, I task myself so many
pages a day, and I do not want patience. I have finished my
Notes on the Prophets.

   I rejoice with you again and again on the restoration of Mrs.
Lindsey's health. May you be long preserved to each other,
and to the world, to the happiness of which you in so many
ways contribute !f

To Rev. T. Belsham. t

Dear Friend,              Northumberland, April 16, 1799.

   I am favoured with your No. 5, and all the preceding. I
should write oftener, if I had any thing to write about, but
myself and my pursuits, which continue the same. With you,
there are a thousand things in which I feel myself much more
interested than in any thing passing here. I dislike the public
measures of this country as much as I did those of England ;
but here the excellence of the constitution provides a remedy,

 IF the people will make use of it, and if not, they deserve what
 they suffer.

    You rejoice in the victory of Nelson ; so do I, now, though
 I did not at the time. It evidently encouraged the Turks, the
 Neapolitans, and Sardinians, to declare against the French,
 and has hastened their downfal, for I hope that of the Turks
 is not far off; and this will be a glorious event indeed. Read
the 19th chapter of Isaiah. Something favourable is promised
to Egypt in the latter days,* which I think are at hand, but I
do not presume to say that Buonaparte is the deliverer there
 promised them.f He may be cut off; but what is promised
will no doubt be fulfilled.

    In my last I expressed a wish that you would join me in re
 vising the English version. When I have finished my notes,
I shall make it a principal object; but it will not be so well
 received from one hand, though, if nothing were done besides
making the best use of the late new versions, it would be very
useful. This I could do myself, and I should not like to print
any notes without a corrected text.

   I wonder as much at your objections to the authenticity of
the Book of Daniel,J as you do at Mr. Evanson's objections to
those of the New Testament, but I have nothing more to ad
vance on the subject. I can only say that you do not seem to
give sufficient attention to some of my arguments ; but we
cannot all see things in the same light, even if we do attend to
them.

   You seem to have departed from my idea of the lectures in
the vestry, which was, instruction in the fundamental principles
only of religion, and were therefore confined to the young -, but
a change of situation requires a change of conduct, and I can
not judge for you. Your Lectures, I doubt not, will be very
useful. There is nothing in which I had so much satisfaction.

   My longing to see Mr. Lindsey, yourself, and some other
friends in England, is sometimes excessive ; I cannot describe
it. I wish you were all here, if I could find any thing for you
to do. I rejoice to hear that Dr. Aikin is so much better. I

Dear Friend,                  Northumberland, May 3, 1799.

With your No. 8, I have just received Mr. Browne on

Universal Restoration, with which I am exceedingly pleased in

deed. I feel the deepest interest in this subject, and the greatest

consolation from such views of futurity as are exhibited in this

pamphlet. Indeed, owing, perhaps, to my drawing nearer to

the close of life, I am more interested than I ever was before

in every thing relating to Christianity, and am more sensible of

the value of it; and though philosophical pursuits are much

less interesting to me, I have a higher relish for them, as an

investigation of the works of the Great Author of all things,

which I hope to pursue to more advantage hereafter.

   You ask, why Mr. Adams§ does not silence the person who
abuses me so much.|| He once said to me, " I wonder why the

man abuses you," when a hint from him would have prevented

it all. But' he is too useful to the party, on the whole, and it

answers their purpose to cry down all who are supposed to
favour French principles. If the French succeed in the war,

their principles will become more popular here.

We have begun to print my Comparison ;1f but it will take

us all the summer to finish it. As to the execution of this

work, I can only say, that I have used my best judgment ; but
I will not answer for its giving satisfaction. I think it, how

ever, rather extraordinary, that I cannot quote what has been

printed, again and again, by writers universally respected, and

proper, when the facts I. adduce are necessary to my argument,*
and would make no impression at all, if they were mentioned
in such a manner as a man might read aloud in the presence
of women. By this rule you must put many valuable works
into an Index Expurgatorius. Many passages in the Scriptures
must be put in the same Index. We do not read them aloud,
but surely they ought to be there.

   I rejoice to hear of the Academy in Exeter. Here the
States have refused to grant any thing to our college in this
town. The walls are raised, and so, I believe, it will remain, f
I suspect politics have influence here. I think to resign my
presidentship of it. The two houses are strongly on the side
of government. At the last session the House of Assembly
voted us 3000 dollars ; but the Upper House put their nega
tive. I proposed to do the duty without any salary. I am
afraid, however, that the objection is not to me, but to the
encouragement of seminaries of literature in general.J

Dear Friend,             Northumberland, June 6, 1799.

   Long before this, I hope you have seen my son. We have
heard of his safe arrival at Liverpool. I am, every day, in ex
pectation of seeing Mr. Russell. I imagine he will not con
tinue in this country much longer; but where he will finally
settle I cannot tell. He expresses a very earnest desire of our
spending the remainder of life together, and has some proposal
to make to me for the purpose. I certainly shall not leave
this place for any thing in this country, or hardly in any other.
Another removal would be the termination of all my labours
and pursuits in this world ; and these I will not give up, while
I am capable of doing any thing. And, I thank God, I never
had better health ; though I am not strong, or capable of bear
ing much bodily exercise, and cannot keep to one thing so
long as I used to do. By great regularity in the distribution
of my time, and having few avocations, I do almost as much

little for amusement.

   I have received the Dictionary of the New Testament which
you were so good as to send me. It seems to be a work per
fect in its kind, and of great value indeed. I have, also, the
Cambridge Intelligencers, complete for the last year. They
interest me much.

T must write a short letter for the sake of inclosing one to

Mrs. Rayner, whose kindness to me has been repeated as for

merly. I have also written to the Duke, inclosing a copy of

the Dedication of the Comparison to him. We have printed

about half of this work, and a Jew of some property will, I

hope, assist me in the disposal of some copies ; and, if he does

this, as he promises, I shall be no great loser.

At present I attend to nothing but my Notes on the Old

Testament, which it gives me an opportunity of studying more

than I ever did before, and in this I have the greatest satisfac

tion, far beyond my expectation. I have just finished the two

books of Kings. It is a very extraordinary and most instruc

tive history.

It is generally thought now, that France wishes to be on

good terms with this country; and the generality of the people

wish it. But the leading people prefer a connexion with En

the yellow fever.

Deau Sin,    Northumberland, Sept. 12, 1799.

   I have just now received your No. 3, by Mr. Ridout, who
sent it by a person coming hither from New York. I have
had no newspapers for this year, nor any books from Mr.
Johnson, for more than a year. I never was so far behind
hand, in philosophical intelligence, which is of much conse
quence to me. I feel my absence from you and my friends in
England more sensibly than ever ; but I now fear we shall no
more meet on this side the grave. My greatest consolation is
in looking beyond it.

   I have had a cause of trouble, which I never mentioned to
you, and what will be the end of the business, I cannot tell ;
but as the will of God is in every thing, I hope the best, and
refer myself to him. Indeed, I find a resource in this more
sensibly than ever ; so that, if my trials increase, my consola
tions increase with them.

   Mr. Cobbett, the author of the malignant pamphlet on my
emigration, and who has never omitted any opportunity of
abusing me, has just published, in his newspaper, the whole of

a pamphlet, which he says was published in London, in April

have seen it. I have some thoughts of addressing a few fami
liar letters to the inhabitants of this town and neighbourhood,

on the subject.

Dear Sir,   Northumberland, Nov. 14,1799.

I have just received your No. 2, and all the books that

were sent by the Active, a treasure and a mine, the riches of

which it will take much time to explore. I thank you for

what you have contributed to it.

As to the Introductions to Matthew and Luke, there is evi

dence of some copies wanting them, and more of the contents

being disbelieved from the very first.§ This is not the case

with respect to any part of Daniel. Besides, we may easily

conceive how any thing that tended to make Christ appear to

more advantage might be adopted and gain credit. A strong

bias to this appeared in very early times. As to the appear

ance of fable, there is, in my opinion, as much of it in the

history of Elijah and Elisha as in that of Daniel.

You surprise me as much in fancying there is Platonism in

John. I see nothing like it. There are more discourses of

Jesus in John than in the other Evangelists, but what they do

put into his mouth is sometimes as enigmatical ; and the narra

tive of facts in John has more simplicity than in any other of

the Evangelists, more like that of an eye-witness, and a person

actually present at the transactions he relates. The principal

assure you, I have done my best. I wrote it twice over in

long hand, which I never did with respect to any thing before.

I have found it in a manner necessary to write some Letters

to the inhabitants of this place and the neighbourhood on the

subject of the abominable calumnies that are incessantly pub

lished in the newspapers of this country about me. I have

just printed one pamphlet, and shall comprise all that I have

to say in another, which is in the press. They are written

in the manner of my Familiar Letters at Birmingham. The

second part will contain matter of more importance. Indeed,

this has given me a good pretence for saying many things that

I think may be very useful here, if I can draw any attention to

them. If not, I shall be satisfied in having done all that I have

had any means or opportunity of doing.

                          To the Same.

Dear Friend,              Northumberland, Jan. 9, 1800.

I have this day received yours of Sept.. 30, but not a pre

ceding one, to which you refer. Your kindness to me is in

deed excessive, and has always been most seasonable. I can

not be enough thankful to a good Providence for it. Without

it, including Mrs. Rayner's, I must have been almost incapa

citated for every thing.

Your account of my daughter's illness affects me much.

So few recover from consumptions, that I have no expectation

of it in her case. She will, however, be freed from much

trouble in this life, and be well prepared for another; and such

is my situation here, and so near am I to the same catastrophe,

that such an event affects me much less than it would other

wise do. The removal of a very few more would make me

wish to follow them. I have no desire to live on account of

any enjoyment that I can reasonably expect in this life; but

while I am capable of doing any good, I wish to have the op

portunity.

From how much trouble has my wife been relieved ! She

had a great mind ; but the events that have taken place since

her death would have affected her deeply. My trials, now

towards the close of life, are as great as I can bear ; though I

doubt not that a wise and good Providence overrules all events,

and I have daily a more habitual respect to it. Nothing else

could support me. I have often said, and I see more reason for

it continually, and in my own case, that many events are more

to be lamented than the death of children and friends. In that

case the mind is relieved from farther anxiety ; and though we

have reason to be satisfied when we have done what we think

to be our duty, it is not such a satisfaction as leaves the mind

fully at ease.

We are frail, imperfect beings, and our faith is at best but

weak, and requires to be strengthened by reading and reflection.

I never omit reading, and I do it with more satisfaction than

ever, a considerable portion of scripture every day, and by this

             MEMOIRS OF OH. PRIESTLEY.  42.5

means my mind is much relieved ; and having good health, my
spirits are naturally good. Besides, I often think how small a
proportion my afflictions bear to those of many others, and to
the great mass of distress that I cannot help thinking is coming
on a great part of the world, in which many of the worthiest
persons must be involved.

   Notwithstanding all my troubles, I have much to be thank
ful for, especially the means of study, in a valuable library and
apparatus, of both which I endeavour to make the best use
that I can. I sometimes flatter myself that I could be of some
use to the cause of Christianity in France; and with any rea
sonable prospect of that, I would cheerfully abandon every
thing here, and devote myself wholly to it, whatever I might
suffer in consequence of it; but I must wait the call of God,
in the course of his providence. Here I hope I have done some
good, and have laid the foundation for more ; but it is not what
we expected. We must not, however, despair of the cause.
It is advancing, like the planets, when they seem to be station
ary, or even retrograde.*

              To the Same.

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Jan. 16, 1800.

I wrote very lately in answer to a letter of yours. I can

not express the satisfaction I have received from the last pack

age of books from Mr. Johnson, both with respect to philoso

phy and theology. Mr. Scott's Jobf is very valuable. I shall

take much from it, in addition to my notes on that book. Who

is the Layman that answers Mr. Wilberforce ? J It is an excel

lent tract.

Before this, you will I hope receive copies of my Compa

rison, and also of my Letters to the inhabitants of this place.

The latter have completely answered my purpose here, though

they have exposed me to more abuse at a distance; but that

gives me little concern. The articles in some of the late Phi

ladelphia papers are as coarse and low as any thing that I have

quoted in the Letters. Nothing in an English paper was half
so malignant.

  I have ventured on another publication, of no great bulk,
which I shall entitle " The Doctrine of Phlogiston established,
and that of the Composition of Water refuted." I have well
considered all that my opponents have advanced, and feel per
fectly confident of the ground I stand upon. In this definitive
treatise I insert all that is contained in my former publications
on the subject, with many new experiments. Though nearly
alone, I am under no apprehension of defeat.

  I am not without hopes that the combined powers, having
failed in their great attempt to crush the French, may give up
the contest, and make a peace in the approaching winter. If
so, depend upon seeing me, if I can afford to come.

   To my account of the reasons for leaving England I prefixed
a motto from Petrarch.* In a note to the present publication
I introduce the following from the same :

     Exul ab Italia, funis civilibus actus,
     Hue subii, partimque volcns, partimque coactus.
     Hie nemus, hie amncs, hie ocia ruris amoeni.
     Sed fiili comites absunt, vultusque sereui.
     Hoc juvat, hoc cruciat. Nihil illis dulce remotis.f

This is exactly my situation. Were it not, however, for a
very few names, I should hardly have a wish to see England.

  I am much concerned at the situation in which I learn from
your last my daughter was at Bristol ; but the excellent treatise
on consumption by Dr. Beddoes, under whose care she is, gives
me hopes. If she die, she will be removed from much care
and sorrow. This consideration, and that of her excellent
character, will do much towards reconciling me to the event.
There are many things in life more affecting than death. I am

sey to me and to the world.*

             To Mr. Russell.f

Dear Sir,    Northumberland, Feb. 7, 1800.

   When you see my political pamphlets, you will see my
reasons for the publication. What we printed here, Mr.
Jefferson informs me, were all sold in a day or two, and Chan
cellor Livingston, of New York, says, he has printed an edition

at Albany. I think it probable that a new edition will be
printed at Philadelphia ; so that you will easily get them. I

hear there is an answer at New York ; but I have not yet seen
it. I shall hardly be tempted to do any thing more of this
kind ; but I do not repent of what I have done.

   I shall be glad to see you. As to your proposal, it cannot
take effect, if it be to remove from this place. If you were
here, you would see that, some very extraordinary occurrence
excepted, I am fixed for life. Mr. Jefferson writes to consult
me about the plan of a new college, which the State of Virginia
is going to establish and endow. They design to have pro
fessors from Europe. If any thing would draw me from this
place, it would be something of that kind ; but I am too old,
and the expense and loss of time attending it would be too
much for me. Removals have always unhinged me for a long
time, and now I am better settled than ever, as you will see,
whenever you come. I am concerned to find that they are
again unsettled in France; but they must be distressed in En

428 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

                   To Rev. T. Lindsey.*

Dear Friend,       Northumberland, March 6, 1800.

I have very lately received two letters from you, one dated

Oct. 25, and the other Oct. 31, 1797, so irregular is the con

veyance of letters to this country ; and the inconvenience can

hardly be removed till there be a peace in Europe. Of this,

however, we are not altogether without hope this winter. All

parties must surely be tired of a war, by which nothing can be

gained, and the defection of the Russians must dispose the

emperor to peace ; after this, England will hardly continue the

war at such an expense alone.

1 have been writing a Dissertation on the Knowledge of a

Future State among the Ancient Hebrews ; and I think I have

shewn that there are unquestionable references to it in many

parts of the Old Testament. If your Commentaries and Essaysf

be open, I should be glad to have it printed there. I shall

send it to you the first opportunity, and dispose of it as you

please. I did not use to be of the opinion I have now adopted ;

but I now think it demonstrable, as far as a thing of this kind

is capable of it.

The situation of my daughter affects me much ; I never be

fore so much wanted, but I can also say, I never before so

much felt, the consolations of religion. In this respect, I hope

the troubles with which I have been visited have been of use to
me. I think less of this world than ever, and more of another. J

                   To Rev. T. Belsham.§

Dear Sir,          Northumberland, March 30, 1800.

I rejoice to hear that you have thoughtof publishing your

Sermons on the Christian Doctrine of a Future Life. There is

no subject so interesting. I have just finished a tract on the

Knowledge of a Future State among the Ancient Hebrews.

With a view to improve my Church History, I have read

Robinson's " Ecclesiastical Researches," and find more in it

 than I expected, with many repetitions and superfluities. He
 must have taken much pains in reading books that come into
 few hands. He had them from the libraries of the universities.
 In this respect the clergy have a great advantage over the dis
 senters.

   The last parcel of books contained the Missionary Voyage
to Otaheite, to which you refer. It is pity that so much zeal
should not be accompanied with more knowledge ; but some
wise end, unseen by us, may be answered by the prevailing
bigotry. Here it reigns uncontrolled. I have, however, found
some young men of a serious and inquisitive turn, who read my
works, and are confirmed Unitarians. By their means light is
diffused ; and I do not now despair of an Unitarian society
being established in this place in a reasonable time.

   The society of our Unitarians at Philadelphia, I understand,
does not increase, which gives me much concern. They have had
some differences among themselves, and they want a sufficient
number of good readers, though some of them I thought excel
lent. They have also lost many valuable men lately by the
yellow fever. This fever is a dreadful scourge to this country;
but hitherto it has been confined to the sea-ports. It already
makes Philadelphia a most undesirable place of residence.
Rents of houses are fallen at least one-third. This disorder is
nearly as destructive as the plague in the east.

   I want you to give me some account of an answer to my
History of Early Opinions by a Mr. Johnston, in Scotland.* I
see it spoken well of in the Annual Register. As I am old and
out of the way, I must depend upon you for every thing that
used to be expected of me.

   Your account of Apeleutherusf does not much excite my cu
riosity, let who will be the writer, or writers of it. I beg my
respectful compliment to Mr. Livius, and thanks for his in
tended present, but I have not yet heard of its arrival. I am
interested in every thing relating to the propagation of Chris
tianity in any form, and no sect has done so much in this way
as the Moravians ; I admire their patience and perseverance.

   I rejoice in the success of your preaching and lectures,
though I sometimes think you would do better to confine the
latter to elementary instruction, as you might then have more
young people. By admitting the old, I found at every outset
in that way, that I excluded the young.

   We have just heard of the Revolution in France, in which
Buonaparte acts a principal part, and what to think of it we
cannot tell. The federal party here, who are the enemies of
the French, triumph in it; but I hope, without reason. I cau-
not believe that any turn of events will restore monarchy in
France, or reinstate the popes in their temporalities ; and if
those two horns of the beast fall, the rest must follow. It is
true, as you observe, that we are apt to overrate the importance
of the events of our own times ; but surely they are of peculiar
magnitude compared with any preceding ones since the writing
of the Revelation.*

                 To Mr. Russell.f

      Dear Sib,  Northumberland, Aprils, 1800.

The same post that brought me your letter, brought me one

from         , remonstrating in such a manner against my

Letters, as if I had committed the sin against the Holy Ghost.

Now I think it is a great reflection on any country, and the

government of it, if any man, even without the provocation

that I have received, cannot publish his objections to any pub

lic measures, when he does it without acrimony or ill humour,

which I am sure I neither felt nor expressed. I am glad that

you have read them with different eyes. They have been of

service to me in this neighbourhood, which was my first ob

ject, and I shall hardly trouble the country again in the same

way.
   As to their publication's preventing the circulation of my

theological writings, I do not think it can possibly make any

difference. When I published proposals for printing my

Church History by subscription three years ago, I got only

seven subscribers, and among them there was not Mr. Adams,*
or any member of administration.

   I believe the lower class of people with you are more de
cent in their manners than they are with us, and in that re
spect they are something better here, than in England ; but I
think there is not so generally a principle of honour and honesty
in any class of men as in England, and their religion is chiefly
form and bigotry, which does not soften or improve the heart.

   All hope of peace is, I fear, banished, which adds to the
probability of this being the time of trouble that is to end in
the destruction of all the monarchies of Europe. I do not
know what to think of the new constitution of France ; and
that country seems to be in more danger than ever, chiefly from
the great number of royalists, who are supplied with arms
 from England, f

           To Rev. T. Lindsey.J

Dear Sir,             Northumberland, April 10, 1800.

I send along with this an account of a course of experi

ments of as much importance as almost any that I have ever

made. Please to shew it to Mr. Kirwan, and give it either to

Mr. Nicholson for his journal, or to Mr. Phillips, for his ma

gazine, as you please. I was never more busy or more success

ful in this way, when I was in England ; and I am very

thankful to a kind Providence for the means and the leisure for

these pursuits, which, next to theological studies, interest me

most. Indeed, there is a natural alliance between them, as

there must be between the word and the works of God.

A letter from Mr. Russell informs me that Mr. Dodson is

dead, and that, among other legacies, he has left you and me five

hundred pounds. If this be true, it will be very seasonable to

me, and enable me to pursue all my schemes to advantage,

though I do not mean to print any thing more on my own

account. He was a worthy and valuable man. How many

agreeable days have we spent with him! The recollection of

these, and of the dinners at Mrs. Rayner's, affects me in the
strongest manner. Those times will never return ; but I hope
better still will succeed, in due time. To that time I now look
continually more than I ever should have done, in more favour
able circumstances. I have lately composed a Discourse on the
use of the Exercise of Faith and Patience, which I wish I
could shew you.*

                          To the Same.

Dear Fiiiend,             Northumberland, May 1 , 1800.

I do not wonder that you are alarmed at my taking a part

in the politics of this country ; though I hope that when you

see what I have written, (for your kind advice came much too

late,) you will not blame me so much, as, without knowing the

circumstances, you were disposed to do.

My Letters are variously spoken of, as you may suppose, by

different persons; but what was of most importance to myself,

they have made me thought better of in this neighbourhood by

persons who were much prejudiced against me. However,

having fully explained my principles in religion and politics,

I have no inclination to enter into the latter field any more,

though, at a distance, the abuse of me is not diminished, but

it is in a lower way than you can well imagine,f Indeed, the

styleof the publications of this country would not be borne by

any party in England.

If you think that the person to whom I principally reply is

singular in his style of abuse, you are much mistaken. I could

send you paragraphs in many newspapers quite as low as any

thing in him. At this time he is by far the most popular

writer in this country, and, indeed, one of the best in many

respects. He now publishes a paper called the Rushlight,

which, in sarcastic humour, is equal, if not superior, to any

thing that I have ever seen. Till he began to censure the con

duct of Mr. Adams, he was cried up by all his friends; though

now they pretend to be ashamed of him. All his works are

now printing in England.

    The violence of party here is greater than I ever knew it in
 England, and the governors are disposed to be more severe ;
 but they stand in some awe of the people, with whom their
 measures are certainly becoming unpopular. The great con
 test will be that for a President the next November, when
 both parties will put forth all their strength.

    By this time you will have received my Comparison, &c;
but my distance from all those who will take any interest in
what I do is a great damper. However, the more I hear of
 the state of Europe, the more satisfied I am that it is best for
me to remain here. I have as much sunshine as I want, which
was far from being the case in England. But I want my
friends, and especially yourself and Mr. Belsham.*

             To Rev. T. BelSHaM.f

Dear Sir,                     Northumberland, May 15, 1800.

I am concerned to find Mr. Lindsey much disturbed at my

" Letters to the Inhabitants of Northumberland ;" but no per

son in England can be a proper judge of what it was expe

dient to do in my situation.

Mr. Thatcher,:}: the most strenuous supporter of all the mea

sures of government, but zealously with me in theology and

metaphysics, said he was very glad that I had published these

Letters, and thought that the letter on the subject of Religion

could not fail to do much good. Indeed, I believe it has done

more to serve the cause of Unitarianism and Christianity than

all that I had written or done in this country, which however

was not much. When Mr. Thatcher had seen the second part

of my Letter, he wrote to me as follows :--" Your Letters

(both parts) I have read with all the pleasure with which I

read your other works, excepting that deduction which na

turally arises from the difference of opinion we entertain on

some of the points therein discussed."

On the whole, though something might have been better

omitted, or better expressed, I see no reason to regret what I

have done. I know that some Federalists have said, that the
other party, who wish me well, disapprove of my writing; but
others, and some of the first men in this country, say that my
Letters have done much good, and have made a great impres
sion on many, and they write to me in the most flattering
terms on the subject. However, having done what 1 thought
 necessary, I have no intention to do any thing more in this
 way.

    Desire Mr. Johnson to procure for me Gale's Answer to
 Wall on Infant Baptism, with Wall's Reply, and also Sten-
 net's tract on that subject. I have lately read Wall, and
 think it impossible to answer it to any purpose. Whatever
 may be said of the unreasonableness of infant baptism, I think
 the antiquity of the practice, from the time of the apostles,
 indisputable. I have had some thoughts of writing a short
 piece on the subject, in the form of a letter to Dr. Toulmin,
 or to learned Baptists in general ; but I must first see Gale and
 Stennet.

    I am now reading with much satisfaction Bingham's " Ec
 clesiastical Antiquities." It is a laborious and valuable work.
 Every thing of this kind interests me much ; and though I
 now and then want books that I cannot get, I have a double
 enjoyment of those I have, and read many that I should never
 have read in England, and this has been of considerable ad
 vantage to me.*

To Ret. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, May 29, 1800.

I am prepared to expect a very severe censure of my " Let

ters to the Inhabitants of Northumberland." I will not say

that every thing is just what I now wish it had been ; but you

cannot judge of my situation at the time of writing those

Letters. Some apology I have made in a letter to Belsham,

which you will see. To shew you that all persons here do not

see them in the same light with you, I will transcribe part of a

letter that Mr. Jefferson, with whom I am in correspondence,
wrote to me on the occasion. You will likewise from this
form some idea of Mr. Jefferson, and his political principles,
which is of some consequence, as he is generally thought to be
in many respects the first man in this country, and will pro
bably be our next President.

Dear Sir,     Philadelphia, Jan. 18, 1800.

" I have to thank you for the pamphlets you were so kind

as to send me. You will know what I thought of them by

my having before sent a dozen sets to Virginia, to distribute

among my friends ; yet I thank you not the less for these,

which I value the more as they came from yourself.

" The papers of Political Arithmetic, both in yours and Mr.

Cooper's pamphlets,* are the most precious gifts that can be

made to us; for we are running navigation-mad, and com

merce-mad, and navy-mad, which is worst of all. How de

sirable is it that you should pursue that subject for us ! From

the Porcupines of our country you will receive no thanks,

but the great mass of our nation will edify, and thank you.

" How deeply have I been chagrined and mortified at the

persecutions which fanaticism and monarchy have excited

continuance of the English persecution ; but I observe that,

between Fenno and Brown, the latter (though succeeding only

to the Federal portion of Porcupinism, not the Anglican, which

is Fenno's part) serves up for the palate of his sect dishes of

abuse against you as high-seasoned as Porcupine's were. You

have sinned against Church and King, and therefore can never

be forgiven.

fixed a choice of position, J did not visit the valleys on each

finest climate, and most healthy air on the earth, the homage

of universal reverence and love, and the power of the country

spread over you as a shield; but, since you would not make

it your country by adoption, you must now do it by your good

offices. I have one to propose to you, which will produce

their good, and gratitude to you, for ages, and in the way to

which you have devoted a long life, that of spreading light

He then, as at the request of " the ablest and brightest

characters of the state," desires I would give them a plan for a

college or university, which they wish to establish in the healthi

est part of Virginia, and endow in the most ample manner.

Mr. Livingston, the Chancellor of the State of New York,

was so much pleased with my Letters, that he got a new

edition of them printed at Albany,* and writes to me in a

similar manner on the subject. I believe that, on the whole,

the Letters have done real good ; and, being shut out from

every thing in the way of theology, I see no reason why I

should not endeavour to be useful in any other. But I believe

J have done with the subject ; and if I have offended, shall do

so no more. As to Mr.  , you should not pay any

attention to what he or that family says. They consort only

with Federalists.

Mr. Cooper has been convicted of a libel, on the Sedition

Act, and is now in prison ;f but he has gained great credit by

it, and he will, I doubt not, be a rising man in the country.

The trial is published, and I shall send you a copy of it. This

has been the last blow to the Federalist party, which is now

broke up. Mr. Adams has quarrelled with all the officers of

state, and dismissed them, and he courts the Anti-federalists

so much, as is not at all to his credit, so that he is now sunk

with all parties ; and his old friends intend, it is said, to set

up Mr. Pinkney as the opponent of Mr. Jefferson. So much

for politics.

 occasion for all my philosophy and religion too. It is nothing
 but a firm faith in a good Providence that is my support at
 present ; but it is an effectual one. I never felt its power so
 sensibly before. I read the introduction to the second volume
 of Hartley, and his conclusion, when I am most pressed. This,
and the daily study of the Scriptures, are a never-failing re
source. In this state of mind, what would I not give for the
society of such a friend as you, to whom I could jay what I
cannot write !

    Though I believe my situation here is preferable to any
other whatever, I do not wish to live a day longer than 1 can
do some good ; but at present my health, and I hope my facul
ties, are as good as at any former period of my life, and I feel
no abatement of activity, but what arises from a want of op
portunity of exertion. In writing and experimenting I do
almost as much as ever.

   There is, in a Philadelphia paper, a strange account of my
dining with Mr. Lister, the English ambassador,* on the
Queen's birth-day, copied from the Gentleman's Magazine.f
Mr. Lister, after inquiring of a common friend whether I would
not be offended at the invitation, called on me in the most
friendly manner, and nothing was done or said on the occa
sion that could give offence to any friend of liberty. In the
drawing-room Mrs. Lister seated herself by me, and said I
must hand her down stairs. I often visited bMr.^Lister, and
was much pleased with him. You will not suppose that I

always was. While my wife was living, I said I was only a
lodger in her house, as I now am in my son's. Your account
of what I might be, and do, living with you at Hackney, is
flattering in the extreme ; and if I considered my own satisfac
tion only, I should fly to it immediately, as the happiest lot I
can imagine for what remains to me of life. It appears to me
to be all that I could possibly wish for ; but there are, for
some time at least, insuperable objections to the scheme.

    Several years of the best part of my life have been lost by
removals, and I could not make another without the loss of all
the remains, during which I can be capable of doing any
thing. However, after a very few years, it will be a matter of
much indifference where I live, or rather where I die; but
then my company will not be worth having. I shall only be
burdensome. On the whole, I do not think that I can do better
than determine to remain where I am for life.*

                 To Mr. Russell.f

Dear Sir,        Northumberland, June 5, 1800.

Your letter of April 27 alarms me a good deal, as I fear

your disorder is of a more dangerous nature than I had ima

gined ; but we are all in the hands of God, who knows better

than we can do what is best for us, and the world in general*

and also how long it is proper that we continue here. This is

my only consolation in the heavy trials with which it has

pleased the Sovereign Disposer of all things to exercise roe in

this country, but it is abundantly sufficient.

I have just received a letter from Mr. Belsham, urging me

strongly to return and live with him at Hackney. If any thing

could tempt me, that would ; but I am so fixed to this place,

that a removal is now absolutely impossible, without too great

a sacrifice of property, and, what is more, of my time, for any

useful purpose.

By my last advices from England, my daughter has had an

alarming relapse. I now despair of her recovery, but I do not

lay this much to heart. She is prepared for a hetter world,
and has little prospect of happiness in this.

   I have no communication whatever with France, and there
fore cannot give you any account of Mr. Walker ;* but by one
means or other, I do not recollect what, I heard that he had
been in prison, but was at liberty again. What he was charged
with, I did not hear, but it was said that he made heavy com
plaints of the country, and the government of it.

   I cannot help being very anxious to hear from you. But
few of my old friends are now left, and few indeed whom I
have more reason to value and esteem than yourself; and the
loss of any kind of property endears the remainder to us. But
we shall meet in a better state ; and to this the disappointments
we meet with here naturally direct our attention.f

                     To Rev. T. Lindsey.J

Dear Friend,         Northumberland, June 19, 1800.

I once thought, as you will have seen by my letters, that I

might be of some use to the cause of rational Christianity in

France, but I now think I should do no more by my presence

than I can by my writings, so that I am well content to con

tinue where I am.

Besides, a field of some usefulness is gradually opening to

me here, and by means of my writings in other parts of this

country. Bigotry and indifference no doubt prevail ; but, with

respect to myself, prejudices are much abated ; and though my

congregation is not large, I am constantly attended by about

half a dozen excellent young men. They knew nothing of

religion before I came, but are now equally intelligent and

zealous. One of them, by means of whom all the rest have

been gained, though without any education besides that of

reading and writing, has composed several letters, or rather

tracts, on the subject of the Divine Unity, that might be

printed. With a liberal education, he would certainly appear

to great advantage. He has read Locke, and is eager to pro-

ceed to Hartley. He has long been in the habit of reading
books that my son or myself have lent him ; but I could not
for a long time persuade him to read any thing on theology,
and now he has little pleasure in any thing else. Two of these
young men are going to work at the federal city, (they are
carpenters,) and I shall furnish them with books. Wherever
they go they will, I doubt not, make proselytes, and they are
strictly virtuous and conscientious.

   Mr. Christie* is doing every thing he can in the good cause
at Winchester, in Virginia, though hitherto without much suc
cess. He has published an excellent tract, and has preached
a set of sermons on the Unity. I have just received a small
parcel of the tracts directed to you, which I will send to Mr.
Vaughan, to be forwarded to you the first opportunity.

   I have sometimes lamented that the few Unitarians that
have emigrated hither are placed at such a distance from one
another ; but I believe we are of more use in the situation,
though our personal satisfaction would be greater if we were
nearer. We are not wanted in England ; and though as yet
not much progress is made by any of us, it is more than could
have been done if we had not come, and a little leaven may
in time leaven the whole mass.f

doubt not but that hereafter, though not now, we shall see that
the most untoward events have their use. At present I am

Dear Friend,                  Northumberland, Aug. 13, 1800.

I have the satisfaction to inform you that my son is now

safely returned. He brings a very affecting account of the

state of. the country, such as I should think cannot continue

long ; but the scarcity will be relieved by importation and the

present harvest. With us it had been more abundant than was

ever known, both in hay and corn ; and so fine is the climate,

that there is rarely any difficulty in reaping or getting in.

The longer I live in this country, the more I like it. Your

spending a year with me in this place, of which you dropped

something like a hint in a late letter, would make it a paradise.

But that is far above any expectation I have of happiness in

this life. The circumstance I am most thankful for is your

enjoying so good health, so as to be useful to me and many

others, where you are.

It was not a little that you contributed to my Comparison,

if that work be of any value. From you I had Jablonski,

Vandale, and several other books, which I made use of. I

fear you commend it more than it deserves. I can only say it

was well intended, and as well executed on the whole as I was

able to do it ; but I know my defects, and here there is nobody

to give me any hint or assistance of any kind, which is a dis

heartening circumstance. However, I must be doing some

thing, and, like the Archbishop of Granada, the will may con

tinue longer than the power.

I send you with this, an Attempt to Explain the 19th of

Isaiah, occasioned by the perusal of Bishop Horsley on the

same subject. I am sorry that the " Commentaries and Essays"f

are discontinued, as the articles I send you will not bear a

separate publication; and the Monthly Magazine may be

thought unsuitable to them, as not calculated for the generality

the trite subject of Infant Baptism.*

     Dead Sir,  Northumberland, Sept. 25, 1800.

I am glad to hear from you there is some appearance of the

spread of rational sentiments in politics in your part of the

country. I have similar accounts from other quarters. When

I see you, I shall shew you some pleasing letters from Mr.

Jefferson, who was desired by some of the principal persons

in Virginia to consult me about a new university they intend

to found in that state. I have given them my best advice, and

Mr. Jefferson much approves of it.

Here I have at length succeeded in forming a small society

for public worship. For this I am, I believe, in a great mea

sure indebted to the letter concerning religion, in my late pub

lication ;t for the people in this neighbourhood, having read

none of my writings, were made to believe that I was an enemy

to all religion, and they did not know but that Unitarianism

was the same with Deism or Atheism. Now, my small tracts

in defence of Unitarianism are read, and with good effect. In

this you will justly conclude that I greatly rejoice.

If any thing could draw me from this place, to which what

has lately taken place has contributed to attach me more than

ever, it would be the prospect of promoting the same cause in

a. larger field in France; but this appears to me at present

altogether chimerical, though I once flattered myself that it

might have been otherwise. As I shall never speak the lan

guage fluently, my writings will do all that I can do. This,

however, I suspect to be your object. To reside in France in

your company, and be usefully employed there, you aiding

me, as you did at Birmingham, would be the height of all my

wishes. But there is a time for all things; and though we

doubt not but that every thing that is good will be finally ac

complished, we are not the best judges of the proper time, or

of the proper instruments, and may fancy ourselves qualified
for services we are the least fit for. Here I am doing some
good, and have a prospect of doing more ; and with this I ought
to be content and thankful, as I hope I am.

Dear Friend,               Northumberland, Oct. 16. 1800.

A fortnight ago a letter from Mr. Russell informed me of

the death of Mrs. Rayner, and of her having left me 2000/.

Considering her great age, and knowing her kind intentions, I

think it not improbable. A letter from you will, I hope, soon

put an end to the uncertainty. What do I not owe to that

excellent woman, and to you and Mrs. Lindsey through her,

and to the Giver of all good through you all I

This hand I endeavour to respect daily and hourly ; and it

is a never-failing consolation under all my troubles, which have

been many, since my settlement here. I am thankful they

did not come at an earlier period, when I should have been

less able to bear them, and when they would have impeded,

more than they now do, the course of my studies. I am thank

ful that in this remote, and in some respects unfavourable situ

ation, I have both the power, the will, and especially the lei

sure, to do something both in theology and philosophy, on the

whole hardly less than I have done at any period of my life.

I mentioued to you a young man of this place who is become

a zealous Unitarian. By his means chiefly I have now a class

of fourteen very promising young men, to whom I have great

satisfaction in giving lectures, as I used to do in England, from

my Institutes. I have also been encouraged to open a place

of public worship in a school-room near my house, where I

have a small congregation. I principally expound the Scrip

tures. I am now expounding Isaiah, and the history of the

gospels, from my memory.?

Dear Friend,             Northumberland, Oct. 30, 1800.

The day after I wrote my last, I received yours of July 28th,

in which you give an account of the illness and death of that

excellent woman and my great benefactress, Mrs. Rayner, and

of her dying attention to me. Happy are they who live and

die as she did. At our time of life we cannot expect to survive

her long. We shall all meet again, I doubt not, with the same

friendly dispositions that we have exercised here; and this

will be one great source of our happiness hereafter.

I am glad to find (by a notice from the Royal Society) that

my tract on Phlogiston has reached England :* also the MS.

my arguments would, at first especially, strike you as they do

them. In whatever manner you dispose of the piece^ it will

be equally agreeable to me. I am glad that you think it worth

I have some thoughts of sending you my interpretation of

Ihe 53rd of Isaiah, which I am pretty clear relates to the He

brew nation, and not to Jesus, though there are some expres

sions in it that are peculiarly difficult on any hypothesis. .You

have not told me how you or Mr. Lindsey like my interpreta

tion of the beginning of the prophecy of the seventy weeks, as

it is commonly rendered, of Daniel, in my Comparison, though

I do not recollect whether you consider that chapter as spuri

ous or not. If I could be surprised at any thing of the kind, it

would be at your incredulity on this subject, and that reasons

which impress me so much, should impress you so little. I

hope to hear Daniel himself giving you a gentle reproof on this
head. But considering the great number that are to be raised,
I sometimes think that our chance of having any interview
with persons who have lived in a period and a country very re
mote from us, cannot be great, and that we shall have some
thing else to do than converse with one another.

   I know you already think me very visionary with respect to
a future state ; but the subject is so interesting, that it is im
possible not to have some ideas about it, be they ever so
visionary. And, separated as I now am from most of those
whom T value most in this state, I think the more of that in
which I hope to meet them again, and in more favourable
circumstances than the present, though what those circum
stances will be we cannot know. But the less there is of cer
tainty, the more room there is for imagination.

   I have lately read, and with much satisfaction, Spencer de
Legibus Hebrceorum.* But I am exceedingly dissatisfied with
what I have read of the second part, which is about one half;
and he is every where unnecessarily prolix, and too formal in
his method.

   I have heard of, I think, two attacks on my History of Early
Opinions,f but they have not been sent to me ; so that I do
not know what ground they go upon. As my time is over, I
look to you for a defence of Unitarianism in all its branches ;
but do not spare me when you may think I have been (and I
am apt to be) too hasty. I am pretty confident, however, that
in that work I have gone on sure ground in the main ; and, if
so, minute criticism does not amount to much.

   Mr. Lindsey will tell you that I have now a decent congre
gation, and a pretty good class of young men to lecture to.J

winter, and I cannot encourage you to undertake the journey
while the snow is on the ground : for here it ofteo fails.
The last winter we had three falls of snow, each completely
melted before the next came. I once began a journey to Phi
ladelphia on a sleigh, but the snow failed before we had got
halfway, which put us to great inconvenience.

   Though I wish to know what it is that you have to propose,
I am confident it is something great and generous, but such as
I fear the times will not admit of. I will tell you, however,
what I now intend, and I suspect it may bear some relation to
your proposal. As soon as there is a free and safe communi
cation with France, I really intend to make the voyage, in part
to look after my property there ; but, also, to see whether there
be a prospect of doing any thing in favour of rational Chris
tianity.

   But I am far from being sanguine with respect to it, and
imagine that all I can do there (or, indeed, elsewhere) will be
by my writings, which are there already, though my being
present might serve to excite a little more attention to them.
As to preaching, I am nearly too old for it, and my teeth fail
ing me, I could not appear to any advantage in the pulpit,
even if my strength did not fail, as I perceive it to do. Be
sides, being so long out of the habit of public speaking, I
should not soon recover the little power that I once had of
that kind. I should, no doubt, wish for a larger field than I
have here, but, small as it is, I am thankful for it, especially as
it respects my class of young men, which, though not consist
ing of more than a dozen, is very promising. My congrega
tion is sometimes about forty, and is not likely to increase.

   I wish I could send you my treatise on Phlogiston;* for
though the subject would not interest you, there is something
in the preface, that you might like to see. It pleases my
theological friends in general. I am also glad to hear, by
Mr. Lindsey, that my Comparison, &c, gives them much
satisfaction.f

           To Rev. T. Belsham.*

Dear Sir,   Northumberland, Nov. 26,1800.

   I have just received two of your very acceptable letters,
and am happy to find you had then received three of mine.

   I do not know that I could have gone to any place more
eligible on the whole. The climate I prefer greatly to that of

England, especially for my experiments, many of which re
quire sunshine, of which I have now plenty; whereas I have
watched every gleam in England, and often to no purpose, for
months together. What is called bad weather, such as rain or
snow, seldom lasts more than two or three days. Clouds soon,
and almost certainly, bring rain, and then the sky is clear
again, both in winter and summer. The only circumstance I
complain of is, the sudden changes from heat to cold, and vice
versd, in all seasons. This I did not expect, having imagined
that the climate in this, as in other respects, bore a nearer re
semblance to that of Asia Minor and Palestine. But in return
for inconstancy in the weather, we have a constant verdure,
which they have not, and but little danger of hay or corn suf
fering in time of harvest.

   In many respects we are far behind you in Europe ; but we
 have the satisfaction of seeing every thing in a state of rapid

improvement. Were I to tell you all the improvements that
have been made in this remote part of the country since our
arrival, I might write a little volume, and the amount would
hardly appear credible. This place has many natural advan
tages, and must, in time, be a very considerable town. I have
had some views of it taken, which I will, the first opportunity,
send to Mr. Lindsey. Some of them, I believe, will be en
graved to accompany an account of this part of the country,

and an actual survey of our river as far as it is navigable.
   That my Calvinistic friends should expect any change in my

sentiments f is a little extraordinary; but it seems to shew that
they do not think very ill of me. I do not, however, think it

 at all necessary to make any such formal declaration as you re
 commend. My Church History and Notes on the Scriptures,*

 with the last of my publications, or posthumous ones, will
 abundantly answer that purpose. Nothing but a great inter
 val between the last of my publications and my death, could
 give any colour to the surmise. If I publish those works my
 self, it must be when I can superintend the press ; but the
 delay of a year or two will be no disadvantage to them, though
 it is not my custom to delay nine years, as you have done with
 respect to your lectures. I rejoice, however, that you have at
 length resolved to send them to the press. I was afraid I should
 not have lived to see them.

    P. S. How is my treatise on Phlogiston received by my
philosophical friends ?f

   · In a letter, "Dec. 16, 1831," which I shall have another occasion to
notice, Mr. Priestley has Jhus obligingly set me right, as to circumstances
respecting both these works, which I appear to have misapprehended :

   " I take this opportunity of correcting an error into which you have fallen,
iu your prefaces to the 10th and 13th volumes, in supposing that the latter
volumes of the Church History were published after my father's death, and
that the Notes on the Scriptures were not in the state in which they would
have been published had he been alive.

   " The fact is, that the whole of the Church History was printed by my
father in 1803, he superintending the press himself, when he was as capable
of doing so as at any period of his life. Of the Notes on the Scriptures, he
printed the whole of the first volume, and as far, I think, as to the end of the
Prophet Isaiah in the second volume, and two or three sheets in the third.
The doctrines of Heathen Philosophy were ready for the press, and were
printed by myself after his death.

   "But, that he would not have made any alterations in either of the latter
works I am satisfied from the circumstance, that he never began to print any-
work till it was completely ready for the press ; never making any material
alterations ; and I have heard him say, that he never made the printers wait
for copy, or for the correction of any mistakes, but their own. My father,
expecting that he should not live to print the works, left the whole in such
order that there could not well be any mistake ; nor is there any material
one, that I am aware of, except that there was an omission of the Notes of
one whole chapter of the Book of Revelation ; but, whether the omission
was my father's or the printer's, I cannot tell, as I was absent at the time
that part was printed." Orig. MS.

   I had conjectured, in 1810, that, "on Ch. vii., the author had written no
notes, or else they were accidentally omitted in preparing the Northumberland
edition." See W. XIV. 459, adfin.

Dear Friend,     Northumberland, Dec. 16, 1800.

   To my remarks on the history of Goliath, I wish to add an
account of the size of one Middleton, commonly called the
child of Hale, near Warrington.f He lived in the time of
James I., and being sent for to court, his picture was taken as
he went through Oxford. I went to see it, at Hale, and there
was, in my time, a copy of it at the Red Lion inn, in Warring
ton. I dare say Dr. Aikin will remember it, and perhaps
may, without farther inquiry, give me the information I want.
Please to give my respects to him and request this favour of
him.

   Unitarianism has, I doubt not, taken firm root in this coun
try; but its progress is slow, though, in time, the grain of

mustard seed may becoms a respectable plant.J Both my
congregation and class of young men are something diminished,
and the Unitarian Society at Philadelphia is broken up. Seve

Others left the place, and few native Americans joined them ;

· Essex Street.  f See, on 1 Sam. xvii. 4, W. XI. 376.

   J The following passages of a letter to Mr. Lindsey discover how Dr.
Priestley had accelerated this progress, before his emigration ; while the sub
sequent, and especially the recent, prevalence of Unitarianism, throughout
the United States, sanctions the anticipations of the learned professor :

   " I have the pleasure of inclosing you the thanks of the College for Dr.
Priestley's theological works. We arc much obliged to you for your kind
intention of having sent the philosophical works ; but we were before pos
sessed of them ; and the opinion they had excited in the minds of the stu
dents here, of the Doctor's superiority as a writer, led them to look into the
theological works with avidity, the moment they were deposited in the
library for their use.

   " I am persuaded that, by means of them, and of your own valuable la
bours in the same cause, the seeds of Unitarianism will be sown in the minds
of the youth in this seminary, and yield such fruit as will shew that they
were not uselessly bestowed. In other parts of the continent, as well as
here, they have excited a spirit of inquiry and attention to the subject, that
cannot, I think, be unfavourable to the progress of truth, and must afford
you the highest satisfaction. J. Smith. Cambridge, N. E., July 11, 1789."

the whole congregation, in a manner, being emigrants from
England.

   I do not hear of any farther progress of infidelity in this
country; but there is a great indifference to religion among
the most intelligent Christians, and this is little better than in
fidelity. They neither converse nor read on the subject.
Thus losing sight both of the thing itself and the evidence of
it, the transition to absolute infidelity is very easy; and when
once that step is taken, a dislike of the subject increases con
tinually, so that there is little probability of their being re
claimed. The secret suspicion they may have of their
having concluded too hastily, will not lead them to reconsider
the arguments.*

      Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Dec. 25, 1S00.

   I have just received yours of 29th September, in which
you mentioned the receipt of three of mine. I hope that, be
fore this time, you will have received others, one of them con
taining a copy of another letter from Mr. Jefferson, approving
of the plan I sent him of the constitution of their new college,f
I have also sent you copies of three articles for Mr. Nichol
son's Journal.

   I wish you may see the Medical Repository, printed at New
York. It contains many curious articles, especially in natural
history, that will interest you, and all the admirers of the
works of God. See also, if you can, the 4th volume of the
Transactions of the Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, for
an account, by Mr. Jefferson, of a large animal, of the lion kind,
probably now existing on this continent, but about three times
the size of the African lion.

   The extent of the works of creation are very imperfectly
known to us. Much has been discovered on this small globe on
which we live ; but much more remains to be explored. It is
a noble field of speculation, so naturally leading to devotion,

      * Orig. MS.   f See supra, pp. 436, 442.

that I sometimes wonder that all natural philosophers are not

pious men ; and yet it is notorious, that many of them are the

reverse of this, and even speculative atheists. This, however,

I am willing to think, cannot be so long, if what is most ob

viously true and right must prevail at last; and of this we

cannot entertain a doubt. My conviction of the infinite wis

dom in the structure and government of the world increases

continually, and the satisfaction I derive from it is greater

than ever; probably in consequence of being shut out from

many other sources of enjoyment and pleasing reflection.

Without this, I assure you that I should be very melancholy;

but with it, I am, in all my trials, cheerful and happy. I can

even look beyond any thing that is painful in my reflections on

the conduct of  .* I trust in a good-Providence, with re

spect to the issue both in this world and the next. The dis

cipline we are under, will at length soften the most refractory

tempers, and make all of us what we ought to be, and the

hand of God is in every thing. The belief that his will is ac

tually done, and must always be so, should make us easy, and

it will do so, after the first shock of a new event is a little over.

But I ought not to preach to you.

The election of Mr. Jefferson for our next President is now

secure by a considerable majority, and also that of Mr. Burr, of

New York, with whom I am well acquainted, for Vice-pre

sident. The measures of the late administration are now

almost universally reprobated, and I hope, in due time, some

strong censures, such as will prevent their future occurrence,

will be passed upon them. But Mr. Jefferson will do no

thing rashly. His being President may induce me to visit

the federal city, and perhaps his seat in Virginia.

I am happy in being remembered by the excellent family at

Morden.f Give my best respects to them all. I shall never

forget the many pleasing hours that Cecil spent with us at Bir

mingham. Remember me also to Dr. Blackburne and other

friends.J

 courses that I had prepared, principally for them. I shall,
 however, see what farther can be done. Several of the most
 zealous died of the yellow fever, and most of the rest have left
 the place. There were not half a dozen at their last meeting.
 They were all English families. Not a single native American
joined them. The more opulent of their society, as Mr. -
 left them, evidently because they made no figure, and it was
 disreputable to belong to it.

    Indifference to religion is greater here than, I hope, it is
 with you ; and those with whom it is any object, are mere en
 thusiasts, without any knowledge. I have attended some of
 their places of worship ; but I have not found one that a man
of sense can hear with any satisfaction ; except Bishop White,
who is, indeed, an excellent man, and in whose society I am
very happy. I see him often, and our conversation is truly
Christian and edifying. Such too is that of Dr. Rush ; but
though a zealous Christian, and an Unitarian, at least an Arian,
he never attended the Unitarian society. One of the clergy,
Dr. Andrews, is an Unitarian, and generally came to hear me.
He is no preacher himself, having a professorship in the uni
versity. With him and the bishop* I have much intimacy,
and this is the more extraordinary as the bishop is orthodox,
and they are both Federalists, and Dr. Andrews, they say, very
violent. That party, however, is now broken, and Dr. An
drews said I had done them more mischief than any other
man.

   As far as I can see, the people of this country, in general,
and even the Federalists, will acquiesce in the presidentship of
Mr. Jefferson, in which I rejoice very much'. He is a man of
great prudence and moderation, and, if it be possible, will heal
their differences, and keep the country in peace. I hope, too,
that he is a Christian, and, if so, an Unitarian, and of this I
have been assured by some who know him pretty well.

   There is nowhere a more zealous Unitarian than Mr.

self materially by his zeal in the cause, without gaining, as he
says, a single convert ; though he gave public notice, and de
livered a set of discourses composed for the purpose, and he
was well attended, especially at the first. He has given up
his office in the college, and now has a private school, on
which he cannot subsist. He wishes to come to Northumber

than maintain a single man, and his Unitarianism would hurt

that it was only for a fortnight, and I supposed you were gone.

lives precious to mankind, and for the continuance of which
every thinking man is solicitous. Bigots may be an ex
ception.

   What an effort, my dear Sir, of bigotry, in politics and reli
gion, have we gone through ! The barbarians really flattered
themselves they should be able to bring back the times of
Vandalism, when ignorance put every thing into the hands of
power and priestcraft. All advances in science were pro
scribed as innovations. They pretended to praise and en
courage education, but it was to be the education of our
ancestors. We were to look backwards, not forwards, for
improvement ; the President himself declaring, in one of his
answers to addresses, that we were never to expect to go
beyond them, in real science. This was the real ground of all
the attacks on you. Those who live by mystery and charlata-
nerie, fearing you would render them useless by simplifying
the .Christian philosophy, the most sublime and benevolent,
but most perverted system that ever shone on man, endeavour
ed to crush your well-earned and well-deserved fame. But it
was the Lilliputians upon Gulliver. Our countrymen have re
covered from the alarm into which art and industry had
thrown them. Science and honesty are replaced on their
high ground; and you, my dear Sir, as their great apostle, are
on its pinnacle. It is with heartfelt satisfaction that, in the
 first moments of my public action, I can hail you with wel
 come to our land, tender to you the homage of its respect and
 esteem, cover you under the protection of those laws which
 were made for the wise and good, like you, and disclaim the
 legitimacy of that libel on legislation which, under the form
 of a law, was some time placed among them.*

   As the storm is now subsiding, and the horizon becoming
 serene, it is pleasant to consider the phenomenon with atten
 tion. We can no longer say there is nothing new under the
 sun. For this whole chapter in the history of man is new.
 The great extent of our republic is new. Its sparse habitation
 is new. The mighty wave of public opinion which has rolled

            · " In the margin is written by the author, ' alien law.' "

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  457

over it, is new. But the most pleasing novelty is, it so quietly
subsiding, over such an extent of surface, to its true level
again. The order and good sense displayed in this recovery
from delusion, and in the momentous crisis which lately arose,
really bespeak a strength of character in our nation which
augurs well for the duration of our republic ; and I am much
better satisfied now of its stability than I was before it was
tried.

  I have been, above all things, solaced by the prospects which
opened on us in the event of a non-election of a President ; in
which case the Federal government would have been in the
situation of a clock or watch run down. There was no idea
of force, nor of any occasion for it. A Convention, invited by
the republican members of Congress, with the virtual Pre
sident and Vice-president, would have been on the ground in
eight weeks, would have repaired the constitution where it
was defective, and wound it up again. This peaceable and
legitimate resource, to which we are in the habit of implicit
obedience, superseding all appeal to force, and being always
within our reach, shews a precious principle of self-preserva
tion in our composition, till a change of circumstances shall
take place, which is not within prospect of any definite period.

   But I have got into a long disquisition on politics when I
only meant to express my sympathy in the state of your health,
and to tender you all the affections of public and private hos
pitality. I should be very happy indeed to see you here. I
leave this about the 30th inst. to return about the 25th of
April. If you do not leave Philadelphia before that, a little
excursion hither would help your health. I should be much
gratified with the possession of a guest I so much esteem, and
should claim a right to lodge you, should you make such an
excursion.

  Accept the homage of my high consideration and respect,
and assurances of affectionate attachment.*

                   To Mr. Russell.*

Dear Sir,          Philadelphia, April 4, 1801.

I am just recovered from an illness, in which the physi

cians at one time despaired of me ; but I am thankful that my

recovery seems to be perfect, and they say that my constitu

tion will be the better for it. I am, however, very weak, and

am advised not to write. This is the first letter that I have

undertaken.

I greatly admire your zeal in the good cause, and wish you

may see the good effects of it, but you must be prepared for

disappointment, for the difficulties you will have to encounter

will be numerous. I would advise you to do nothing till you

get to Paris, and see what may be done ; and if a preacher can

be employed to advantage, to write to Mr. Belsham to recom

mend one.

What publications of mine are translated into French I do

not know ; but the Letters to the Philosophers, &c, of France,

I believe are. I have lately heard from Mr. Stone, and find he

had not seen my Comparison. This work, and what I have

published in this country, you will of course have with you,

and may make what use of them circumstances shall direct.

The late French consul, Letombe, who goes to France very

soon, has engaged to take care of any thing that I shall wish

to send thither, and he will not be pleased if I do not send by

him, so that I shall not have any occasion to trouble you. As

to myself, I cannot go to France till I know more of the state

of affairs there.

A zealous Christian friend and assistant will be, in a mea

sure, necessary to you in France, but I know no such person.

But we should never give way to anxiety, even about doing

good, but content ourselves with being always ready to lay

hold of every opportunity that offers, persuaded that every

thing that is truly desirable to be done will be done in the

proper time, and by the most proper persons.

I fully expect to set out for Northumberland the week after

as to promise us pretty good roads. I should have been glad
to have seen you before your voyage, but it could only have
been a personal gratification, as nothing of importance depends
upon it.*

             To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,  Philadelphia, April 8, 1801.

My son, I believe, wrote you a short letter while I was not

able to write myself, though I was then recovering from a very

dangerous illness. I am now, through the goodness of God,

completely recovered, and want only a little more strength to

be as well as I was when I came to Philadelphia. They call

my disorder a bilious fever, with pleurisy ; and, according to

the established system here, I was bled profusely, seven times

in all, under the direction of Dr. Rush, and to this I believe

I owe my recovery. I hope now to return to Northumberland

some time the next week, and I shall rejoice if the books you

mentioned arrive before I return.

I have received a very kind and confidential letter from Mr.

Jefferson, inviting me to complete my recovery by a visit to

him. I hope you have received a copy of it. The change that

has taken place in the politics of this country has been a happy

one for me.

I desired Mr. Belsham to tell Mr. Johnson that I wished

him to send me a small fount of Greek and Hebrew (pica or

small pica) for the sake of the notes to my Commentary on the

Scriptures. Desire him to send it the first opportunity. I

long much to see my Essay, &c, with your preface.^

Dear Sir,     Philadelphia, April 12, 1801.

go soon, I may yet see you at Northumberland, but if you go
with Mr. Henry or Mr. Letombe, you will go pretty soon.
Mr. Letombe you cannot but like. He has been consul here,
many years, and is esteemed by every body.

   I greatly admire your zeal and your liberality in support of
rational Christianity ; and whether your excellent purpose be
answered or not, you will have no reason to repent of what
you do. No man can give his time or money to a better pur
pose; but we must not look for our recompence in this world.

   You must certainly be some time in France before you can
see what is best for you to do. No doubt it is desirable to
have a person who can preach in French ; but there are many
English in Paris, and many Frenchmen who understand English,
so that one English congregation* might be very useful.f

             To Rev. T. Belsiiam.J

Dear Sir,    Northumberland, May 14, 1801.

Your late sermon§ I like much. It is an excellent sum

mary of prevailing errors, with hints sufficient for their refuta

tion. Such a tract was wanting, and will be very useful. If

you started with a view to follow my example, you have now

got beyond me. It is a bolder sermon than I ever preached.

But my boldness was never so much in preaching as in pub

lishing, though I never declined speaking my sentiments from

the pulpit on proper occasions. Nothing is ultimately gained

by temporizing ; and I am confident you will never see reasons

to repent of the openness you have always discovered. ||

   If by Christ abolishing the heavy yoke of the law, (p. 6,) you
mean with respect to the Jews, as well as the Gentiles, I differ
from you. I have also doubts concerning angels, though none
concerning " the devil and his angels." Those that appeared
at the sepulchre of Jesus, and at his ascension, must have been
real beings. I sometimes imagine they may have been men
raised from the dead. The angels that appeared to Abraham,
&c, I consider as temporary appearances, representing the
Supreme Being, since they were addressed as such ; but this
was not the case of the two who rescued Lot. They spake
and acted as by commission from a superior.* We shall
know more of this hereafter.

   When I was at Philadelphia 1 met with, and purchased the
Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses, 26 vols. 12mo, and find them
exceedingly interesting on several accounts. Among other
things I find the following passage, (IV. 25,) in a letter from a
district to the west of the Caspian Sea, which, being a province
of the Assyrian empire, was probably the place to which the
ten tribes were carried captive :

by affecting to find Unitarianistn in the standards of the Church." The

eloquent speaker soon proposes the following contrast :

" In an after day, another champion, less cautious in his tactics, issued

from the ranks of the orthodox Dissenters, and as long as the highest moral

worth, united to an ardent longing after truth, shall command respect, the

name of Priestley must be held in reverence. This great man adopted a

course of proceeding the reverse of that pursued by Dr. Clarke. He cried

aloud and spared not. With him there was no attempt to conciliate persons

or principles which he felt it his duty to denounce, and at first the results

appeared to be disastrous.

" He was blamed by timid friends for his imprudence, he was assailed by

open enemies for his presumption ; he was exposed to the attacks of adverse

parties, to the high-church intolerance of Horsley, and the sceptic sneer of

Gibbon. A half religious, half political mob, destroyed at Birmingham his

literary and scientific property. A social persecution followed him to Lon

don with unremitted virulence, and he was at length driven from a country

of which he was an ornament, to seek shelter in a foreign land. But what

was the ultimate effect of all this ? We may read it in the flourishing state

of Unitarianism in England, and in the cheering progress which it has made

in America, to which the storms of persecution carried the seeds of truth.

   " The greatest part of the inhabitants of this province were
formerly removed to the other extremity of Persia into the
mountains between Balk, Cabul, and Candahar, where they
have preserved their former name, with some little alteration,
being called Afghans, but the roughness of the country has
perverted their natural dispositions. They have become rob
bers, and have made themselves formidable to the caravans
that go to India."

   These Afghans, Sir William Jones says, are the remains of
the ten tribes ;* but he does not account for their being settled
there, nor indeed does this writer. The writer of a note on
the passage says they were removed by Tamerlane, but he
found them where they now are.

sent two articles for it. To-day I send another; and I shall
soon draw out a fourth. One of these relates to some pheno
mena in dreams; and another, some confirmation of Mr. Noah
Webster's Observations on Pestilential Diseases. This is a
very curious and important work, which I wish you would
read. He is what is here called a Federalist, and wrote an
answer to my Letters to the Inhabitants of Northumberland ;
but I made no reply to him.

   I have had an example how much more pungent is our grief
for small things than for greater. My little grand-daughter, a
lively girl, that I am very fond of, got the seal you gave me as
a keepsake, and carried it away. It was missing about a week,
and my concern was really greater than I can describe ; but at
length our servant-man found it in the garden, when I had
despaired of ever seeing it again. I shall take more care of
it for the future. My joy on its recovery was in proportion to
my grief.

   I thank you for your advice about going to France. I shall
be governed by it. But really I have now very little expecta
tion of ever seeing any part of Europe, May our meeting be in
more favourable circumstances.*

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, July 30, 1801.

By our last post I have received yours of the 22d of May.

I am not surprised to hear of the death of Dr. Heberden.f His

was a good and a happy old age. He had done enough for me,

and I shall always think of him with respect and gratitude.

I am thankful that my supplies have always been, and now are,

equal to my wants. At least, I will make the latter correspond

to the former ; and indeed, at my time of life, my wants are

much contracted, as I shall hardly engage in any thing mate

rially new. The annual expense of my laboratory will hardly

exceed 50/., and I think I may have done more in proportion

to my expenses than any other man. What I have done here,

but on account of the almost universal reception of the new
theory, what I do is not, at present, attended to ; but Mr. Watt
and Mr. Keir, as good chemists as any in Europe, approve of
 my tract on Phlogiston, and truth will in time prevail over
 any error.

    I can begin to print as soon as I can raise money enough to
 buy the paper. I have had great satisfaction in the composi
 tion of both these works, especially the Notes on the Scrip
 tures. How is it that some can read with contempt what we
 read with admiration and the greatest reverence? I do not,
 however, feel the least disposition to abandon the study of
 nature. Each gives an additional relish to the other,f

Dear Friend,          Northumberland, Oct. 2, 1801.

Having sent to Mr. Nicholson a paper of experiments on

the pile of Volta, I beg you would send him the above P. S.

to it, and ask whether he have received the paper itself. I, this

day, send him another article, in reply to what Mr. Cruikshank

had advanced in the Journal on the subject of the new theory.

Having had great success in my experiments in this country,

as well as in England, I shall never desert philosophy ; but I

have much more satisfaction in theological studies, and I find

they greatly aid one another. I have lately given more atten

tion than I had done before, to natural history, and am ex

ceedingly interested in it. Several conclusions of a higher

nature are strongly suggested by this study. In a plan

abounding with such marks of Infinite Wisdom, nothing surely

can ultimately go wrong, and observations with a microscope

convince us that the smallest things are attended to, as much

as the greatest ; the smallest events, therefore, as well as the

greater and more striking. This consideration tends to re

concile us to small troubles and disappointments, as well as to

 those of greater magnitude. All are equally from the same
 hand.

     The view of the creation, and the connexion of its parts,
 must convince any attentive person of the folly of Arianism.
 No Being but He that planned and executed the whole, could
 create or superintend any part of the system.

    It must appear impossible that a Being of such immense
 wisdom and power can bear the least ill-will to any of his
 creatures, whose conduct, be it what it may, was a necessary
 part of his benevolent plan. It follows, with a force that gives
 me in my present situation a satisfaction I cannot describe,
 that the most refractory tempers must be rectified, some time
or other, and in the mean time they are not without their use

as I shall preach to some advantage ; but I fear that the bigotry
of some, and the federalism of others, will defeat the scheme,

worth having. We have had an uncommonly sickly season in
all these parts, though very few have died. You will see that
I foretold it. I have had a slight ague, and not one in the
 family has entirely escaped.

    I thank God continually for your health and spirits, and
 hope that our lamps will go out nearly together. I am not
 what I was before my fever in Philadelphia. I have lost flesh
 and strength, but in other respects I feel very well; but bodily

     Dear Friend,           Northumberland, Oct. 24, 1801.

I have received uncommon satisfaction from Mr. Kirwan's

Geological Essays.§ It is a work worthy of a Christian philo

sopher, and with candid and judicious readers will weigh much

in the scale of the evidences of revelation. I shall make much

use of it in my notes on the first chapter of Genesis, || though

there are still some difficulties that are not completely re

moved. Chemistry was never employed to so good a purpose

before.

But the more we see into any part of the constitution of

nature, the more do all the difficulties attending the system of

revelation vanish. That of the resurrection appears as nothing
in the eye of a person who contemplates, as he ought, the won
ders of creation, which Mr. Kirwan, with great probability,
has shewn not to have been all at once, but in succession, as new
occasions required the production of new plants or animals ;
and those of this part of the world were probably subsequent
to those of yours. Others also may be suffered to become
extinct when there shall be no more occasion for them. He
well observes, that beasts and fishes of prey, (and no doubt
birds too,) were probably created a long time after the ani
mals they preyed upon had become numerous.

   This idea of successive creations, so agreeable to reason, and
not contradicted by scripture, removes all the great difficulties
attending the history of the flood and the ark, and is parti
cularly pleasing as an evidence of the constant attention that
the great Creator gives to his works, and makes it more easy
to suppose, that when the general state of things shall require
it, the resurrection of the dead, or any other exertion of
Divine power that may be equally proper in itself, will cer
tainly take place.

   Having more time for reading than ever I had before,
though I do not neglect my laboratory, I have perused with
care many works which I had only looked into, or occasionally
consulted before. I have found unexpected satisfaction, both
instruction and amusement, in the Lettres Edificantes et Cu-
rieuses* of the Jesuits, and fortunately I got the new edition of
1781, by exchanging other books for them, when I was last in
Philadelphia. I have actually read twenty-one volumes, omit
ting very little, though I did not intend to read more than a
few of them.

   The writers in general were very extraordinary men, and,
I doubt not, of great piety and the best intentions, and seem to
have been actuated by a truly Christian spirit. I am sensible
that I could neither bear nor do what those missionaries did.
When will rational Christianity make such exertions ? Their
labours and sufferings were so great, that I cannot think they
were the mercenary and crafty persons that they have been

represented. Some of the letters are peculiarly edifying;
yet, exposed themselves to the most grievous persecution,
(which, however, they courted and rejoiced in more than be
came Christians,) they could approve of the persecution of the
Protestants in France. But the same spirit we see in Calvin,
and many of the most distinguished reformers. If you can
meet with this work, you cannot but be pleased with many
parts of it.

   The various articles of news that you send me are very in
teresting and pleasing, especially those relating to the spread
of Unitarianism. I wish I could give you a similar account of
the state of things here, though I doubt not that prejudices are
wearing out, and that truth will prevail in due time. I am
glad to hear what you say of Mr. Palmer. As he returns in
good circumstances,* I hope he returns as zealous a Christian
and Unitarian as he was when he went.f

     Dear Sir,  Northumberland, Dec. 12, ISO 1.

I hope that now peace is made, the intercourse between

this country and yours will be more regular.

I esteem you as one of the few who retain their integrity and

zeal in these trying times, and some have fallen whom I should

least have suspected of unsteadiness ; so that really I do not

know whom to depend upon. I rejoice, however, that you

think the plague is in some measure stayed, though a fatal in

difference to religion is taking the place of infidelity. This,

to my surprise, has taken place here, perhaps, to a greater de

gree than with you, and it seems to be the effect of the un

bounded liberty we here enjoy. There is no cry of the op

pressor and the oppressed, which, though an evil, serves to

excite attention and discussion of the points of difference.

There is nothing of this kind here. Except one small pamphlet

in defence of the doctrine of the Trinity, published after the

attention, there has not been, that I have heard of, a single
pamphlet relating to any controversy in religion. Of course,
the people are very ignorant; and yet there is great bigotry
among those who pretend to any religion, especially the Pres

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Feb. 14, 1802.

  It is now a long time since I have heard from you or Mr.
Belsham ; but this is a time of the year when there are few
arrivals at Philadelphia, and few ships go from it; so that you

may be as long in hearing from me. Though our rivers are
unfrozen, it cannot be known with you that they are so, and,
therefore, ships do not usually come to us. The winter here
is uncommonly mild. We have had no snow that remained
more than about a day, and that very slight. No person

living remembers so mild a season.
   You mentioned Mr. Maseres§ having sent me the third or

fourth volume of his Scriptores Logarithmici. I have only

the two first volumes.
   Some of my late letters will, probably, give you some alarm

respecting my health. It is true, that the various illnesses of
the last year, the fever at Philadelphia, and the ague here, have
shaken and reduced me very much ; and though I am now re

cruiting again, I think it necessary to lose no time in doing
what I am yet capable of.

At length I have had the satisfaction I had almost despaired

of, to receive a letter from you, and one that interests me ex

ceedingly; especially with respect to the ecclesiastical state of

France and the character of the Emperor of Russia ;§ from

whom I now expect great things. ||

" I doubt not, you have frequent occasions of rejoicing in the continued

accounts you receive, of the only competitor Mr. Jefferson appears to have,

amongst the rulers of the earth, the Emperor of all the Rirnias. His late

preceptor, Colonel La Harpe, recently returned from a visit to Petersburgh,

has furnished a variety of truly interesting anecdotes respecting him.

" His desire to do good was beyond principle ,- so ardent and unceasing

was it ever found, that it uniformly appeared as a passion. When speaking

of his people, he was never once heard to call them his subjects, but his

fellow-citizens ; when speaking of himself, never once to use the title of Em

peror, but expressing for his people the affection of a father rather than the

authority of the magistrate.

" He expressly enjoined upon La Harpe, not to come near him on the

day of his coronation. After it was over, he told him, that the ceremony he

had been obliged to submit to, was the severest mortification he had ever

experienced ; and so much had it humbled and agitated him, that, had he

accidentally met his eye, he should certainly have sunk under the consci

ousness of his situation." (Dictu mirabile monstrutnj

  I am concerned that you had not received any of my letters,
especially by Mr. Letombe, the late Consul. On him I had
the greatest dependence. I also wrote to M. Adet and M.
Talleyrand, but have had no answer. I had lately a short
letter from Mr. Russell, referring me to a larger, which has not
come to hand.

   I shall rejoice if the communications between the two coun
tries become open and regular, and especially if I can be in the
way of receiving books, &c, from France ; and now that there
is peace, I do not despair of it. As to my visiting Europe, it is
now too late in life to think of it, and my health has received
a rude shock by a fever I had at Philadelphia, and the ague
since, though, I thank God, I am now very well. Were I
younger, and could I speak French fluently, I should not he
sitate about it.

    Your undertaking to translate and publish my " History of
 the Corruptions of Christianity," is very flattering to me, and I
 hope will do some good, probably more than my being with
 you. This could only excite attention for a short time. If I
 should come, I should be happy to be under the same roof with
 you. Could I be persuaded that any good could arise to ra
 tional Christianity by my removing to France, I should not
 hesitate about it, though I am situated here, in all respects, as
 much to my liking as I could possibly be any where, and have
 every convenience for making experiments. But I am about
 to print, at this place, two pretty large works ; the Church
 History to the present time, and Notes on all the Books of
 Scripture, and I cannot remove till that be done ; so that there
 will be time to consider of the measure.

Dear Sir,                                                   1802.

I shall not omit the opportunity I have of writing to you

by means of Mr. Fenwick, though he will go to England be

fore he sees France. By him I shall venture to send a copy of

Mr. Jefferson's letter to me, which I promised in my last. I

must, however, require, that it may not, on any account, go

out of your own hands, or a copy be taken of it, much more

that it be not translated and printed. I should forfeit his

friendship by such an event.

I must again say how much satisfaction I received from the

various interesting particulars of your letter. I have sent a

copy of part of it to Mr. Jefferson, as the information it con

tains would be useful and interesting to him, and could not be

injurious to you. Mr. Cooper is not with us at present, being

detained at Lancaster during the sitting of our representatives.

He makes himself conspicuous, and will be a rising man in

this country; but the Americans have a great jealousy of all

foreigners, and the more if they be likely to eclipse them

selves. When he comes, which will probably be in a few

weeks, I shall deliver your message.

   I am much concerned to hear of the war with Toussaint in
St. Domingo, and fear it will not terminate soon, as the Negroes
are in the mountainous parts, and, no doubt, have laid up

event appears very uncertain, whatever force be sent against
them ; and it is not for liberty, but for Toussaint only, that
they fight. Could this be well understood among them, it
might have a good effect.*

Dear Sir,               Northumberland, April 10, 1802.

   I have received, at length, your " Elements of the Philoso
phy of the Mind,"+ and have read the whole, except some parts
of the treatise of Logic prefixed to it, and with peculiar eager

ness ; and I assure you it has not disappointed the expectations
I had from it, though these were pretty high. It is indeed re
markably clear, as well as comprehensive, and will, I doubt
not, be long considered as a standard work on the subject, and
contribute much to establish the true theory of the mental
operations.

   In a systematic treatise many parts will, to the generality of
readers, necessarily appear dry; but to all intelligent readers,

some must appear even sublime and animated, beyond what
could have been expected from any elementary treatise. Every
writer is the best judge of his own method, or I should have
thought that some parts of your theory of the Mind might have
been referred to the treatise on Logic, and a great part of the
Moral Philosophy to that on the Mind ; but as they are all in
the same volume, the arrangement is of little consequence.

   If I differ from you in any thing, it is in what you say of
space and duration, which I cannot help thinking we justly

conclude to have real existence, and, of course, necessary ex
istence, though, in some respects, the subject, as including the
idea of infinity, is 'beyond our comprehension. I have no
doubt, from the progress that has already been made in the
inquiry, that all instincts may be resolved into acquired know
ledge ; and that brute animals have general ideas, is, I think, as
evident, as that men who are no logicians have them. Is it
not a proof of this, that objects similar to those they have seen
before affect them in a similar manner? A sheep, for example,
having been torn by a dog, will fly from any animal resembling
a dog, as well as from any other dog that has not torn it.
Lastly, to close the short account of our differences, I see no
reason to suppose there is any difference between the power of
choosing among equal objects in the Divine Mind and those of
created beings.

   I wish you would give my respects to Mr. Morgan, who is a
Fellow of the Society, and desire him to take the Philosophical
Transactions, of the Clerk, for me. The last I have is the

have every thing of this kind as early as possible. Engaged as
I am in an important philosophical controversy,* it is a suffici-

   * During the course of which, he thus addresses his quondam scientific
associates, in the preface, to which he has referred, supra, p. 446, adfin.

   " My philosophical friends must excuse me, if, without neglecting natural
science, I give a decided preference to theological studies ; and if here, as in
Europe, I give the greatest part of my time to them. They are, unquestion
ably, of unspeakably more importance to men, as beings destined for immor
tality ; and I apply myself with so great satisfaction to the study of nature,
not so much on account of the advantage we derive from it at present, though
this is very considerable, as from its being a delightful field of speculation,
barely opening to us here, and to be resumed with far greater advantage in a
future state.

   " No discovery in philosophy bears any proportion in real value to that of
bringing l\fe and immortality to light, which is completely effected in the
gospel, and nowhere else. None of our experiments, or observations on the
course of nature, could have given us the least glimpse of this.

   " But the evidence of this great truth, though of the most satisfactory kind,
not being that of sense, but requiring attention and reflection, persons much
engaged in the business of the world, and even in literary and scientifical
pursuits, are not always convinced by it. It also requires a candid and well-
disposed mind, and therefore philosophers (who have their prejudices, as well

ent disadvantage to be at this distance from the theatre of in
vestigation. I do not, however, feel much interested in the

as other men) are not always Christians. Among those of this class, I am,
however, happy in being able to rank not a few who would do honour to any
cause ; and the number of truly philosophical Christians, I am well persuaded,
will, in due time, increase. As Paul said to King Agrippa, who said that he
had ' almost persuaded him to be a Christian, that he wished that both he,
and all who then heard him, were both almost, and altogether, such as he
himself was, except his bonds ;' so there is no greater happiness that I can
wish to all my philosophical friends than that, with respect to religion and
their future prospects, they were what I am, without the calumnies, and the
still more serious injuries, to which I have been exposed.

   " Without a view to this future situation, all our pursuits appear to me to
have little in them that is interesting, especially in the decline of life, and the
near prospect of death, which, if it put a period to our existence, involves
every thing in everlasting darkness, leaving us uncertain whether even the
world itself, and the whole race of man, as well as all other animals, may not
be doomed to destruction. How gloomy is this prospect, and how dead and
indifferent does it render a reflecting mind, to every great pursuit !

   " How thankful, then, ought we to be for an assurance of an endless state
of existence, and in circumstances infinitely more favourable than the pre
sent ! The evidence of this great doctrine (in comparison with which every
other inquiry is as nothing) is surely worthy of our most assiduous examina
tion, infinitely more so than a title to an estate, or a claim to a kingdom in
this world, which no wise man would be thought justifiable in neglecting.

   "This being, perhaps, the last time that I may have an opportunity of ad
dressing myself to my philosophical friends, who, I am concerned to perceive,
are generally unbelievers in revelation, I would make it my dying request,
proceeding from the most sincere good-will to them, to attend to this sub
ject, especially what I took the liberty to urge [W. XXV. 378--384] in the
preface to the sixth volume of my Observations on Air, which was reprinted
in the new edition of that work in three volumes, and also to my Letters to
the Philosophers and Politicians of France, on the subject of Religion, my
Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever, and my other works in defence of
revelation.

   " Independently of the consideration of the infinitely superior importance
of the subject, religion will give a double relish to philosophical pursuits, and
will thereby contribute to their success. It is only a wretched superstition,
and not religion, that draws men's attention from natural science, or, with
any other view, drives men into retirement, and excludes them from any
active and useful pursuits. On the contrary, it tends to inspire men with
increased activity, and imparts increasing satisfaction and animation in every
proper and laudable exertion. Of this, I think I may say, I have exhibited
an example in myself. My numerous publications will shew that, from early
life, I have given the greatest part of my time to theological studies, and yet
 few have been more assiduous in physical inquiries, since I have had the

not be much mortified if I were even obliged to confess myself
to have been in an error. Philosophy is now more an amuse
ment than ever, in consequence of being occupied with sub
jects of much more importance.*

             To Mr. Russell.!

Dear Sir,                            Northumberland, April 10, 1802.

   I have received only one short letter from you since you
left us, and one from Mr. Stone, some time after. You were

then at Paris, but about to visit your estate in Normandy.
   I think that I gave some intimation of my health having been

considerably impaired, in consequence of a fever that I had in

Philadelphia the last winter. Admonished by this, and my

advanced state of life, (for I am in my 70th year,) that what I

do I must do quickly, I have began to print my Church His

tory, and, if I can supply the necessary funds, this will be fol

lowed by my Notes on the Scripture. This undertaking will
necessarily detain me here, for some time, even if my health

would admit of my making a voyage to Europe, which, at

present, it would not. J

means of doing it. Do not then say, that religion necessarily makes men

idle, or busy to no useful purpose.

" Call this, if you please, the talkativeness of age ; but, believe it to pro

ceed from a zeal in the best of causes, and sincere good-will to yourselves.

For I find that I have, insensibly, got into a direct address, in the form of a

dedication, rather than that of a preface. With this, however, I conclude.

" Farewell, and may we meet, where our present doubts will be removed,

and where we shall make more rapid advances in knowledge, without that

envy and jealousy from which philosophers are no more exempt than other

men, and which, though it has an excellent effect in making men cautions,

and even ardent in their pursuits, from a view to the reputation they hope to

acquire by their discoveries, too often makes their pursuits the cause of more

pain than pleasure to them. Hereafter, we shall, I doubt not, be even more

actively employed, and more happy in consequence of it, from better mo

tives." See " The Doctrine of Phlogiston [established, and that of the

Composition of Water refuted," Northumberland (1800), Pre/, pp. vii.--x.

                   To Rev. T. Belsham.*

Dear Sir,                 Northumberland, May 18, 1802.

Though I was in some measure prepared for the account of

Mr. Lindsey's seizure,t I was, as you may suppose, exceed

ingly affected by it, and considering his age and the usual

course of those seizures, I shall be in daily expectation of hear

ing of his death. We ought, however, to be very thankful

that he has been preserved so long to us all. I have the greatest

reason, as I am more indebted to him than to any other person

whatever, and that in more respects than one. Some of my

most steady friends are those that he and Mrs. Lindsey pro

cured me. But without any regard to my particular obliga

tions to him, 1 have always considered him as one of the most

excellent of human characters. Dr. Price was another; both

equally pious, humble, and disinterested, whose only study it

was to do good in every way that was in their power, equally,

without vanity, or any regard to self.

1 consider it as my greatest happiness and praise to have had

the friendship of such men as those. I greatly respect the

memory of several other persons with whom, in the course of

a various life, I have had the happiness to be acquainted ; but

those two are in the first class of my worthies. In this, how

ever, I have been thinking of those in the clerical character ;

but I have had friends and acquaintances of great excellence

among the laity, such as Mr. Tayleur, of Shrewsbury, and,

above all, Mrs. Rayner. There are many others, especially in

the middle ranks of life, who had it not in their power to be

great benefactors, as not possessed of wealth, who appeared to

me to have shewn the great power of Christian principles in

improving the human character. I have also known many re

spectable unbelievers; but there is no character so truly excel

lent as the Christian. Of this I have the fullest conviction

from my own observation.

Having lost many friends by death, and considering this as

nothing more than a suspension of life, I am perhaps less

affected by that circumstance than many, especially as I must
be near the close of life myself, and therefore naturally look
forward to the time when I shall find them again. And, as
Mr. Lindsey often quoted, (but I do not recollect from whom,)
" I hope I shall not be doomed to worse company in another
world than such as I have most delighted in here."

   I am now reading Dr. Geddes' volume of Remarks, and won
der at many of them.* 1 shall not choose to mention his name
often, except for some truly original and valuable matter ; at
least such as is ingenious and plausible. I am sorry for the ac
count you give of the state of his health,f as the continuation
of his work is certainly very desirable.

   P. S. I open my letter to say how happy I have been made
by the receipt of your Nos. 2 and 3, giving me so favourable an
account of Mr. Lindsey. May a kind Providence preserve him
longer to us, and the world ! I have not received the letter
 that you say Mrs. Lindsey has written.

    If any thing could tempt me to leave my present situation,
it would be your kind invitation to occupy a part of your
house, and for the purpose you mention. But I am satisfied
that, if I can get a little assistance, the works will be printed
here to more advantage than any where else; and at the same
 time I shall not be under the necessity of abandoning my phi
 losophical pursuits, and, if this be done any more, it will be
final. My health is something better.*

             To Mrs. Lindsey.

Dear Madam,              Northumberland, May 8, 1802.

I cannot express how much I was affected on reading your

letter, though I was apprized of the situation of my best friend,

by the letters of Mr. Belsham, so that I had no reason to ex

pect any different account. But the few lines he added, with

his own hand, quite overcame me ; and if I read them, as I

shall do, a hundred times, I shall have the same emotions.

Such friendship as his and yours has been to me, can never be

exceeded, on this side the grave, and, independent of the real
emolument, has been a source of such satisfaction to me, as I
have not derived from any other quarter.

   And yet what I feel is not properly grief, for, considering
how near we both must be to the close of life, in which we
could not promise ourselves much more enjoyment, or be of
much more use, what remains cannot, according to the com
mon course of nature, be of much value ; and therefore the
privation of it is no great loss ; and considering how soon we
may expect, and I hope without much presumption, to meet
again in more favourable circumstances, the causes of joy may
almost be allowed to balance those of grief.

   If you saw me now, you would not flatter me with the pros
pect of long surviving my excellent friend. Judging from my
illnesses the last year, and my present feelings, I am far from
expecting it myself, and, indeed, as it will be the will of God,
whatever the event be, and, therefore, no doubt for the best, I
cannot say that I greatly wish it. My labours, of whatever
kind, and whatever be their value, must be nearly over.

   I beg, dear Madam, you would not fail to continue the cor
respondence of your excellent husband, and write, as you say,
on all sorts of subjects. Whatever interests you, will interest
me, and I hope Mr. Lindsey, whenever he is able, will add his
signature.*

the world, under the authority of your name, is securing its
credit with posterity.

   In the great work which has been effected in America, no
individual has a right to take any great share to himself. Our
people, in a body, are wise, because they are under the unre
strained and unperverted operation of their own understand
ings. Those whom they have assigned to the direction of their
affairs, have stood with a pretty even front. If any one of
them was withdrawn, many others, entirely equal, have been
ready to fill his place with as good abilities. A nation com
posed with such materials, and free, in all its members, from
distressing wants,* furnishes hopeful implements for the in
teresting experiment of self-government,f and we feel that we
are acting under obligations not confined to the limits of our
own society. It is impossible not to be sensible that we are
acting for all mankind; J that circumstances denied toothers,

   * A happy result which the President had anticipated from " a wise and
frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another,

ment, and shall not take from labour the bread it Iras earned." N. A. Reg.

   The United States appear to have profitably listened to the following early
warning from their eloquent advocate :

   " Peuples de l'Aim'rique Septentrionale, que l'exemple de toutes les na
tions qui vous ont precedds, et sur-tout que celui de la mere-patrie, vous
instruise. Craignez une trop inegale repartition des richesses, qui montre un
petit nombre de citoyens opulens, et une multitude de citoyens dans la
mist-re; d'ou nait l'insolence des uns, et l'avilissement des autres." See
" Revolution del'Amdrique. Par M. L'abbe* Raynal," (1/81,) pp. 181, 182.

   t Which to European "idolaters of forms and precedents" has ap
peared impracticable. Thus Burnet, an exemplary bishop, " the glory
of the priesthood and the shame," but a puny politician, says, in 1696,
to an expectant of the British crown, " wc won't be governed by one another,
 and therefore must have a sov'raign to rule over us." See " A Memorial to
 the Princess Sophia, according to the original in the Library at Hanover,"
 (1815,; p. 33 ; W. XXII. 332, 338; supra, p. 332, notes.

    \ Responding to Dr. Priestley, who says, "The eyes of all the civilized,
 at least of all the Christianized, part of the world, are now upon this coun
 try; as being, evidently, in a state of more rapid improvement than any
 other was ever known to be ; and I trust that, eventually, your administra
 tion will be a blessing, not to the United States of America only, but to all
 mankind." See W. IX. 4, 5.

but indulged to us, have imposed on us the duty of proving
what is the degree of freedom and self-government in which a
society may venture to leave its individual members.

   One passage in the paper you inclosed me must be correct
ed. It is the following: "And all say that it was yourself,
more than any other individual, that planned and established
the Constitution."* I was in Europe when the Constitution
was planned and established, and never saw it till after it was
established. On receiving it I wrote strongly to Mr. Madison,
urging the want of provision for the freedom of religion, free
dom of the press, trial by jury, habeas corpus, the substitution
of militia for a standing army, and an express reservation to
the States, of all the rights not specifically granted to the
Union. He accordingly moved, in the first session of Con
gress, for these amendments, which were agreed to and rati
fied by the States as they now stand. This is all the hand I
had in what related to the Constitution. Our predecessors
made it doubtful how far even these were of any value ; for
the very law which endangered your personal safety, the Alien
Act,f as well as that which restrained the freedom of the press,
were gross violations of them. However, it is still certain that,
though written constitutions may be violated in moments of
passion or delusion, yet they furnish a text to which those who
are watchful may again rally and recall the people. They fix,
too, for the people, principles for their practical creed.

   We shall all absent ourselves from this place during the
sickly season, say from the 22nd of July to the last of Septem
ber. Should your curiosity lead you hither, either before or
after that interval, I shall be very happy to receive you, and
shall claim you as my guest. I wish the advantages of a mild,

veneration and respect,f

      To Rev. T. Lindsey.J

      Dear Friend,                Northumberland, June 20,1802.

Whether it be you or Mrs. Lindsey that is my corre

spondent, I consider it as the same thing. You are alike my

friends, and my best friends, and, whoever survives, this corre

spondence will not, I hope, cease, on this side the grave, while

it is possible to continue it. This great change, to which we

are making near approaches, I regard, I hope I may say, with

more curiosity than anxiety. It is the wise order of Pro

vidence that death should intervene between the two different

modes of existence; and what engages my thoughts is, the

change itself, more than the mere manner of. making it. I

look at your portrait, and that of Dr. Price, and Mr. Lee,

which are always before me,§ and think of my deceased friends,

whose portraits I have not, with peculiar satisfaction, under

the idea that I shall, at no great distance, see them again, and,

I hope, with pleasure. But, how we shall meet again, and how

we shall be employed, we have little or no ground even for

conjecture. It should satisfy us, however, that we shall be at

the disposal, and under the government, of the same wise and

good Being who has superintended us here, and who best

knows what place and employment will best suit all of us.

The more I think of the wonderful system of which we are

a part, the less I think of any difficulties about the reality or

the circumstances of a future state. The resurrection is, really,

nothing, compared to the wonders of every day in the regular
course of nature; and the only reason why we do not wonder
is, because the appearances are common. Whether it be, be
cause I converse less with men, in this remote situation, I con
template the scenes of nature, as the production of its great
Author, more, and with more satisfaction, than I ever did-4>e-
fore ; and the new discoveries that are now making in every
branch of science, interest me more than ever in this connex
ion. I see before us a boundless field of the noblest investi
gation ; and all that we yet know appears to me as nothing,
compared to what we are wholly ignorant of, and do not, as
yet, perceive any means of access to it.

   I now take great pleasure in my garden; and plants, as well
as other objects, engage more of my attention than they ever
did before; and 1 see these things in a more pleasing light
than ever. I wish I knew a little more of botany ; but, old as
I am, I learn something new continually.

   I admire Dr. Darwin's Phytologia, and am reading it the
second time. But this work, which, I believe, contains all
that we yet know of this part of nature, shews me how little
that all is. Before he died, I am informed, he was about to
publish another work, in which he maintained the doctrine of
equivocal generation ;* and of all absurdities, this appears to
me to be the greatest, if by it they mean to exclude intel
ligence from the system of nature. And I cannot see any
other reason why unbelievers in revelation should lean, as
many of them do, to that doctrine. Their faith has certainly
less evidence than ours. If we believe that the whale swal
lowed Jonah, they may believe that Jonah swallowed the
whale.

Dear Friend,                     Northumberland, July 3, 1809.

How rejoiced I was to receive your letter, written wholly

with your own hand, after your late alarming attack ! I now

hope I shall have more of them ; and nothing on this side

the grave gives me more satisfaction ; and yet, considering how

soon we may hope to meet again, the separation by death should

not give us much concern. While we live, we ought to value

life, and friendship, especially Christian friendship, as the balm

of it. But we have a better life in prospect, and therefore

should not regret the parting with the worse, provided we have

enjoyed it properly, and improved it so as to have ensured the

better. Absolute confidence does not become any man, con

scious, as we all must be, of many imperfections, of omissions,

if not of commissions; but surely a general sincere endeavour

to do what we apprehend to be our duty, will authorize so

much hope as may be the reasonable foundation of joy, with

respect to a future state, without being chargeable with arro

gance or presumption.

You could not have made choice of a more pleasing or in

teresting subject than that of the work which you have happily

completed, J which, as I believe it is in Philadelphia, I expect

soon to receive. It occupies my own thoughts, I may say,

almost constantly, and is the greatest source of satisfaction that

in my present situation, and under my late trials,§ I enjoy.

Indeed, the reflection that we are under the government of the
wisest and best of Beings, and that nothing can befal us without
Ii is permission, is sufficient to banish the very idea of evil, and
to make us regard every thing as a good, for which we ought to
be thankful. At the moment, none who have the hearts and
feelings of men, but must grieve for many things that he sees
and feels; but Christian principles soon bring relief, and are
capable of converting all sorrow into joy. But this will be in
proportion to the strength of our faith, in consequence of the
exercise of it, when, according to Hartley, speculative faith is
converted into practical.

   We have printed one volume of the History, and, as I told
you, I have dedicated it to Mr. Jefferson. I inclose his letter*
on receiving a manuscript copy of it. I have since altered it,
I hope, to his mind, and shall very soon send it, together with
the volume. The three volumes, if I do not take a journey in
October, will be done about Christmas. I now hope you will
see this work, and even the Notes on the Scriptures. I wish
you particularly to see the preface and dedication. The latter
will not please you, as not calculated for England ; but I have
done with that country, and am indifferent to what the friends
of its government may think of me. I shall always appear as
I am, a sincere friend to the country, and shall not with in
tention say any thing offensive of its constitution, or the ad
ministration of it. I rejoice that its situation is much better
than I feared such a war would leave it.

   My health, I thank God, is better, but still very precarious,
and what I ought not to trust to. I am therefore very de
sirous to get my two works through the press.f

siring me to proceed without delay.*

   As it may perhaps please the Duke of Grafton to see the
copy that I sent you of Mr. Jefferson's last letter to me, I wish
you would shew it to him. Such things as these give a better
idea of a man's principles and character than more public do
cuments. I shall not be able to visit him as he wishes. In
deed, the state of my health is such as warns me that I have no
time to lose, and 1 am desirous of doing all I can in what re
mains of life. If well spent, longer or shorter makes no great
difference ; but mine has been a long life, though not so long
as yours. Whenever we die, we shall start together, at the
same time, hereafter. May it be in the same place, and our
happy connexion be resumed !

Dear Sir,           Northumberland, Sept. 4, 1802.

I informed you what I thought of your valuable Lectures.

I hope you will continue to enlighten the world with more of

your publications. Now that Mr. Lindsey and myself are

going off the stage, you will be looked up to as the principal

support of the Unitarian cause ; and I am concerned to see, in

some late publications, that it requires support, Methodism

gaining much ground with you. I cannot, however, think

with Dr. Horsley that Unitarianism is on the decline, though

it may appear so to him, and the progress may not be so rapid

as we are apt to flatter ourselves. He triumphs, I see, in my

flight, as he calls it.f I have some thoughts of writing a letter

on the subject for the Monthly Magazine; but if I do, I will

inclose it to you.

I wrote to Mr. Lindsey by the last post, and as I was closing

my letter, I received one from Mrs. Lindsey, and promised to

write again this day ; but I am really too ill to write any more,

having but just got out of bed from a fit of the ague. This is

the third time that I have had it this summer, and I am much

weakened by these attacks. I have had for the last six months

a considerable degree of deafness, and on this account I want

to see Dr. VValcot's treatise, and I have desired Mr. Jones to

send me a hearing-trumpet, such as is described in the Medical

                      To Rev. T. Lindsey.J

     Dear Friend,        Northumberland, Sept. 25, 1802.

   I cannot help being anxious about the state of your health,
as you kindly are about mine. It would be extreme folly for
either of us to flatter ourselves with the prospect of many
years to come, nor, at our time of life, is it in general desirable.
Before this time, the business of life, whatever it has been, must
be over, and nothing can remain but retrospect; and with re
spect to neither of us, I trust, is this very painful ; though no
man ever lived who might not have done more good in the
world (and for that end we come into it) than he actually did.

   Of late, but not more than a fortnight, I have had a better
prospect of health than I have had for a considerable time.
I now hope that with care I may see through the printing of
both my works, and I have hardly a wish to live longer, espe
cially as I shall not be capable of undertaking any thing more
of much importance.

   I am much affected at Mrs. Lindsey's account of the generous
assistance given by the Duke of Grafton and Mr. Maseres, and
especially Mr. Chambers. I desire you would express to all
of them, and any others, how sensible I am of it. I understand
also that I am under particular obligations to Dr. Disney for
his exertions in this affair, and I intend to acknowledge it in a
letter to him soon.

   I have some thoughts, if I continue well, to visit Philadel
phia for a few weeks, in company with my son and daughter,
some time this winter, perhaps in the interval between the
printing of the two works.

   I shall be glad to hear from Mr. Morgan.§

To Mrs. Lindsey.*

Dear Madam,                              Oct.16, 1802.

What do I not owe to you and Mr. Lindsey, and, at pre

sent, more particularly to yourself! Without your active

assistance, I find that the works I have now in hand would

hardly have been printed in my life-time, unless I should live

longer than I see any reason to expect.

Dr. Doddridge used to say he was confident there would

be more women in heaven than men, and certainly you excel

in the milder, and what are more peculiarly called the Chris

tian, virtues of patience, meekness, sympathy, and kindness ;

and I think that the history of persecutions proves you have

your full share of the more heroic virtues, and have shewn

as much true courage as men. When I reflect, as I often do,

on the character of my good aunt,| that of Mrs. Rayner, and

to those let me add, yours, I do not think I can find many of

my acquaintance to compare with them among men, and yet 1

have known many of great excellence. Of these, the foremost

on my list are Dr. Price, Mr. Tayleur, of Shrewsbury, and Mr.

Lindsey. Those in a lower class, however, are numerous;

and I doubt not but hereafter we shall find there has always

been more virtue than vice in the world, and that the vice has

had its use in producing virtue.

The more I contemplate the great system, the more satisfac

tion I find in it ; and the structure being so perfect, there can

not be a doubt but that the end and use of it, in promoting

happiness, will correspond to it. These views, as I take more

pleasure than ever in natural history, contribute much to

brighten the evening of my days. But my great resource is

the Scripture, which I have not, of a long time, passed a single

day without reading a portion of, and I am more interested in

it continually. I seem now to see it with other eyes, and all

other reading is comparatively insipid.

But I shall tire you with my moralizing. You are very

kind to interest yourself about my health. On thiB day se'n-

night I wrote to Dr. Disney, and told him I was much re-

cruited ; but this week I have relapsed again, but without
fever. The least thing disorders my power of digestion ; and
when I have any thing amiss there, it is a long time before I
get right again. My flesh and muscular strength are greatly
impaired. I hope, however, that with care, I may live to print
the two works, and then my mind will be entirely at ease.
Whatever may be thought of them, I have spared no pains to
make them as perfect as I could, and both the works are of a
kind that I am sure are much wanted.

   I no more expect fame than I do profit from either of these
works ; but neither of them are any object with me at present.
I have had enough of every thing that this world can give me,
and consider my lot as having been a singularly happy one ;
but I flatter myself that my writings, which are overlooked at
present, will be found useful some time hence.

   Mr. Lindsey's last work I read with peculiar satisfaction.
It is excellently adapted to gain its object, and discovers a
happy and most desirable state of mind with which to take
leave of the world, praising the great and benevolent Author
of it, and looking forward to the same excellent disposition of
things hereafter.

   Give my best respects to the ladies at Morden.* I shall
never forget their excellent characters, or their kindness to
myself. Remember me also to Dr. Blackburne. I often wish
I was under his care.

   P. S. Mr. Morgan's letter is come safe. I shall write to
him by the next post. I rejoice to hear that both Mr. G.
Walker and Dr. Parr are made easy with respect to pecuniary
matters-f

To Mr: William Morgan.*

Dear Sir,  Northumberland, Oct. 23, 1802.

I thank you for your kind letter, and though it was directed

to Virginia, some postmaster, I suppose, in this country had

changed that word for Pennsylvania, and it came safe.

Though my philosophical labours are nearly over, I am

glad to hear what is passing in that region in which I once

moved, though what I then did seems for the present to be

overlooked and forgotten. I am confident, however, as much

as I can be of any thing, that notwithstanding the almost uni

versal reception of the new theory, which is the cause of it,

it is purely chimerical, and cannot keep its ground after a

sufficient scrutiny, which may be deferred, but which must

take place in time. I am glad to find that Mr. Cruikshank in

England, as well as the chemists in France, begin to attend to

my objections, though the principal of them have been pub

lished many years ; but, as you say, many will not read, and

therefore cannot know any thing that makes against the opi

nions they have once adopted. Bigotry is not confined to

theology. It seems to be as conspicuous among philosophers,

who disclaim every thing of the kind. We see that envy,

jealousy, and every bad passion, may be excited by any thing

that is interesting to us, even in the belles lettres. Pope and

Swift, and too many others of that class, had as much pride

and malevolence as any divines.

Your experiment on inflammable air is curious; but our

opponents will say, that though water be decomposed in order

to form it, it will at the same time take up more water unde-

composed, and hold it in solution ; though, when condensed,

it must part with some of it ; the quantity of the water thus

held being in proportion to its dimensions.

Mr. Cruikshank, I find, promised an answer to my reply to

him, and I suppose it has been published in Nicholson's

Journal some time, but I have not yet seen it. In this respect
I work and write to great disadvantage. It is much to be
wished that some able advocate for the old doctrine might
arise in England or France. They would engage more atten
tion than any person situated as I am. Some time ago I sent
Mr. Phillips, for his Magazine,* a general answer to all the
objections that I had heard of to the argument attacked by Mr.
Cruikshank ; and it appears to me that of three principles on
which that argument has been assailed, that adopted by him is
the most unfortunate, directly militating against the system
that he endeavours to support.

   You surprise me with your account of the effect of the new
apparatus for the Galvanic experiment. I have the very ap
paratus you describe, and have not been able to make it answer
so well as the old one, and I find it exceedingly difficult to
make so many cells quite separate by means of cement. Your
account, however, encourages me to try again.

   I thank you for your hints of politics. How different is
our situation from yours ! Our debt is trifling, and will to
appearance soon be discharged,! though almost all our taxes
are done away. Our particular state has a fund, out of which
all the expenses of government are defrayed ; so that we hear
of nothing but county taxes for the repair of roads, &c We
in this place have only been called upon to pay a poor's rate,
and in both cases on account of single insane persons, and we
hardly ever see a beggarJ except for accidental fires, &c, and
these are soon relieved, every body contributing with great
cheerfulness. There being no church establishment, we have

with you.* I do not think that any country in the world was
ever in a state of greater improvement, in all respects, or had
fairer prospects, than this has at present. It is a great plea
sure to look round and see this : and yet we have many
grumblers and discontented persons.

   I rejoice to hear of the good state of your family, and hope
that this will continue a source of happiness to you, when you
cannot derive any from the state of public affairs; for which,
however, we cannot but have a feeling. I have, though at this
distance, and am a sincere well-wisher to Old England. All
the friends of liberty must have been disappointed with respect
to France. But, perhaps, a state of less political liberty may
suit that nation. If they do not complain, why should we?

I am now putting the last hand to the Notes on the Scrip

tures, many of which, I am sure, you will like, as they are

particularly calculated to point out the evidence and the value

of revelation, especially that of the Old Testament, which is

most objected to by unbelievers, and has been strangely given

up by some Christians like Dr. Geddes. || But this shews great

ignorance of the state of things in early times, and gross inat

tention to the circumstances of the revelation, and of the peo

ple to whom it was made. That Moses should either have

himself invented his institutions, or have imposed them on his

nation, is, on many accounts, absolutely incredible.

good a state of health as most men, so as hardly ever to have
been incapacitated for my pursuits of any kind.

   I received your Thanksgiving Sermon, and I like it much.
I am pleased with its moderation, and think with you, that we
x>ught to be satisfied and thankful when there has been so great
a change for the better as has unquestionably taken place, as
you have very well shewn. I think, too, that as Christians
we should be less violent politicians, having our minds chiefly
occupied with better things; though we should not forget that
we are citizens of this world as well as of another.

   Our affairs here seem to be in an excellent train ; I wish
your prospects were as good. If your brother were here, he

    Ithink, however, as well of this country as of any in the
 world; especially since the election of Mr. Jefferson, whose
administration is, indeed, excellent, highly favourable to the
 peace and happiness of the country in all respects. You will
see by his message to Congress, that, though all the internal
taxes are abolished, a great proportion of the national debt was
discharged the last year,* and we have no war except with
Tripoli, which does not give us much uneasiness.

He urges me again to pay him a visit ; but the distance is too
great, and travelling too incommodious, for a person of my age

prevail upon him to take it. He said he would not take it for
twenty dollars. However, I am not so ill thought of in this
place or the neighbourhood, and I believe the parcel is now in
a waggon at Sunbury ; but the river is so full of floating ice,
that it has not been passable for several days.

   I have just heard that a boat is gone over the river to fetch
five waggons that are on the other side, But they often make
unsuccessful attempts of this kind. One branch of our river
is shut up with ice, and the other at some distance from us.
This is a thing of which you have little experience in En
gland. The breaking up of the ice after a frost is a spectacle
 truly sublime, but it is sometimes the cause of much mischief.
I have seen the whole river full of floating trees, which had
 been torn from the banks. This has continued some days,
 one of the branches being navigable 300 miles above this
 place, and the other about 150. But this is only in the spring,
 and sometimes in the autumn. In the summer it is so low
 that children walk through it. The bottom is a solid rock.
 The river, the neighbouring hills, and the general face of the
 country, give us finer prospects in this place than I have ever
 seen elsewhere. The boasted prospects on the Rhine, which
 I have seen,* are not equal to these. I want nothing here but
 such society as yours and Mr. Lindsey's.f

   I rejoice to hear that you have the means and the spirit to
do what you do, both with respect to the translation and publi
cation of my writings, and the opening of the Protestant Church
at Caen ; when, as I hear, no other person has had the Chris
tian zeal to do so much in any part of France, at least in the
northern provinces, though the Protestants are pretty nume
rous there. That there should be so much lukewarmness in
such a cause, is a subject of much regret. The Catholics seem
to have the interest of religion much more at heart; and, in
time, I doubt not, more rational opinions, accompanied with a
due degree of zeal, will succeed ; but more time than we are
willing to allow may be necessary for so great a purpose; and
our , endeavours to promote truth and right will not be lost,

   " I have never yet met with any one acquainted with the subject, who has
not assured me, that, although the public creed of the Church is according
to the doctrine of Luther and Calvin, yet the ministers, in general, are Soci-
nian, so that I regard the new set of articles as perfectly inadequate to the
purpose intended, independent of the insuperable objection to them, as sub
jecting religion to the controul of the state, and appointing the civil authority
to preside and judge in matters of conscience.

   " The whole business shews the extreme ignorance and apathy of all con
cerned in it, and makes mc very frequently lament, that any circumstances
whatever should have prevented our excellent friend, on the other side the
Atlantic, from coming with me here, as was his intention. He would have
had the ear of the government, and his superior talents must have given the
whole business a very different complexion. However, as it is, I doubt not
but all is working right, and that we shall soon see many favourable symp
toms, but it will require a long- time to mature them." Orig. MS. See

and with this age of man, I ought to be, and I am, satisfied. I
hope I have not lived in vain. Most of my friends are gone
before me, and others cannot be long after me. How thankful
ought we to be for the glorious assurance that the gospel gives
of the meeting of all the virtuous and good in a better state !
Let us cherish that hope, and rejoice in the prospect it holds
out to us.

   I am here with my son and daughter-in-law, who join in
respects to you and your son.*

To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,           Philadelphia, March 1, 1803.

By the persuasion of my son and his wife, who were going

to Philadelphia, and being unwilling to be left alone, I came

hither, and I am well pleased, on several accounts, that I have

come. The journey, which I thought I should hardly have

been able to bear, has, itself, been of great service to me. I

think I have recovered the health I had before my fever. For

this I am very thankful ; aud I consider it as a call to that ex

ertion of which I am now more capable.

A great improvement in my hearing came pretty suddenly

yesterday, while I was attending the service in the Swedish

church, in consequence of happening to sit where my worst

ear felt the warmth of a stove. For, before the service was

over, I could, with that ear, when the other was stopped, hear

the tunes that were sung, which I could not do at all before.

The service, on that day, was in the Swedish language ; but

every other Sunday in the month it is in English. This I had

not been apprized of.

The principal Swedish minister, Dr. Colin, is an excellent

man, and a complete Unitarian. He observed, in our conver

sation, that the doctrine of atonement had done great mischief

to the cause of Christianity, and he laid great stress on all

prayer being addressed to the One God and Father of all. The

Sunday before I had heard in his pulpit a very orthodox mi-

nister, who officiates occasionally when the principal is em
ployed in a distant part of his parish. But he said that, for
himself, though he used the Common Prayer-book of the Church
of England, he took only what he liked, and made what alter
ations he pleased ; and in the pulpit used his own prayers.
He has a great degree of knowledge of natural philosophy as
well as theology. To-day I am to dine with him, along with
Dr. Andrews,* a clergyman and professor of morals, &c, in
the University, but an avowed Unitarian ; and notwithstanding
the bigotry of the generality, Unitarianism and rational Christi
anity are silently gaining ground in this country.

   I am hardly able to speak loud enough for a large audience,
or I am persuaded I should now have many hearers in this
place. Last night I preached to a very crowded room, and the
next Lord's-day I am to administer the Lord's Supper in ano
ther house, where some Unitarians regularly meet every Sunday
morning. They are the remains of the society of lay-unit-
arians, and I am not without hopes that it may revive. But I
see that a professed minister would be more useful, as making
the cause more respectable, by giving it a head. I was not so
fully sensible of this before.

   While I have been here, I have printed a pamphlet, entitled
Socrates and Jesus compared, and I dedicate it to Dr. Toulmin,f
who had written on the same subject.J If I do not greatly
flatter myself, you and Mr. Belsham will like it, though you
may not agree with me in every thing. The comparison of
these two men throws great light on the evidence of Christi
anity, and tends to make us sensible of the great value of it.

   As soon as my Church History is out of the press, at North
umberland, I shall begin to print the Notes on the Scriptures,
and hope to finish them in about a year, perhaps less. Though
I now look to very little in this world, I shall be thankful if
you live to see this work. But my prospects, as well as yours,
must now be directed to another state, in which I hope we

Dear Friend,           Philadelphia, March 5, 1803.

Presently after I had written my last, I was made happy

by the receipt of yours of Dec. 7, written almost wholly with

your own hand. This gives me hope that you may be conti

nued to us longer than I had lately presumed to think; and

for this I shall be very thankful, though, our times being in the

hand of God, we have reason to be satisfied and thankful,

whatever events take place. But till any event actually take

place, we are, no doubt, authorized to indulge our hopes and

fears according to our limited views, though with less anxiety

than is natural to those who have no respect to a Providence.

We stay a week longer in this place; but I now wish to be

at home. Little improvements always occur in the course of

printing, t which only the author can see or make.J

Dear Sir,              Northumberland, April 2, 1803.

I am now returned from Philadelphia, and though I had a

long relapse into a state of very indifferent health, after I in

formed Mr. Lindsey that I was perfectly recovered, I am again

much better than I lately expected I ever should be.

In the first part of the Notes on the Scriptures, one of my

principal objects is to vindicate the divine origin of the laws of

Moses ; and I think to close the whole with a Dissertation, in

which I have brought into one view all the principal argu

ments. This I wrote in my late journey, and have transcribed

it since my return.||

508 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

                  From President Jefferson.

Dear Sir,         Washington, April 9, 1803.

While on a short visit lately to Monticello, I received from

you a copy of your Comparative View of Socrates and Jesus,

and I avail myself of the first moment of leisure, after my

return, to acknowledge the pleasure I had in the perusal, and

the desire it excited to see you take up the subject on a more

extensive scale.

In consequence of some conversations with Dr. Rush, in the

years 1798-99, I had promised some day to write him a letter,

giving him my view of the Christian system.* I have reflected

often on it since, and even sketched the outlines in my own

mind. I should first take a general view of the moral doctrines

of the most remarkable of the ancient philosophers, of whose

ethics we have sufficient information to make an estimate: say

of Pythagoras, Epicurus, Epictetus, Socrates, Cicero, Seneca,

Antoninus. I should do justice to the branches of morality

they have treated well, but point out the importance of those

in which they are deficient. I should then take a view of the

deism and ethics of the Jews, and shew in what a degraded

state they were, and the necessity they presented of a reforma

tion. I should proceed to a view of the life, character, and

doctrines of Jesus, who, sensible of the incorrectness of their

ideas of the Deity and of morality, endeavoured to bring them

to the principles of a pure deism, and juster notions of the

attributes of God, to reform their moral doctrines to the stand

ard of reason, justice, and philanthropy, and to inculcate the

   * See the President's letters to Dr. Rush, from " Monticello, Sep. 23,
1800," and from "Washington, April 21, 1803." In the latter he says,
" In the moment of my late departure from Monticello, I received from
Dr. Priestley his little treatise of * Socrates and Jesus compared.' This
being a section of the general view I bad taken of the field, it became a sub
ject of reflection while on the road and unoccupied otherwise. The result
was, to arrange in my mind a syllabus, or outline of such an estimate of the
comparative merits of Christianity as I wished to see executed by some one
of more leisure and information for the task."-- Mem. and Cor. &c. III.
449, 514.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY,                509

belief of a future state. This view would purposely omit the
question of his divinity and even of his inspiration.

   To do him justice, it would be necessary to remark the dis
advantages his doctrines have to encounter, not having been
committed to writing by himself, but by the most unlettered of
men, by memory long after they had heard them from him,
when much was forgotten, much misunderstood, and presented
in very paradoxical shapes. Yet such are the fragments re
maining as to shew a master-workman, and that his system of
morality was the most benevolent and sublime, probably, that
has been ever taught, and more perfect then those of any of
the ancient philosophers. His character and doctrines have
received still greater injury from those who pretend to be his
special disciples, and who have disfigured and sophisticated
his actions and precepts from views of personal interest, so as
to induce the unthinking part of. mankind to throw off the
whole system in disgust, and to pass sentence, as an impostor,
on the most innocent, the most benevolent, the most eloquent
and sublime character that ever has been exhibited to man.*

   This is the outline ; but I have not the time and still less the
information which the subject needs. It will therefore rest
with me in contemplation only. You are the person who, of
all others, would do it best, and most promptly. You have all
the materials at hand, and you put together with ease. I wish
you could be induced to extend your late work to the whole
subject.

   I have not heard particularly what is the state of your
health, but as it has been equal to the journey to Philadelphia,
perhaps it might encourage the curiosity you must feel to see
for once this place, which nature has formed on a beautiful
scale, and circumstances destine for a great one. As yet, we
are but a cluster of villages.f We cannot offer you the learned
 society of Philadelphia, but you will have that of a few cha
 racters whom you esteem, and a bed and hearty welcome with
 one who will rejoice in every opportunity of testifying to you
 his high veneration and affectionate attachment.J

To Rev. T. Lindsey.*

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, April 15, 1803.

I am happy to hear by Mr. Belsham, that your health is

still good ; and as his letter is dated the 1st of February, I

hope you have got well over the winter. There is hardly any

thing that I wish for, or think of more, than the continuance

of your life and health, that you may see the last of my la

bours, and I may hear your opinion of them.

As to philosophy, I do not now give much attention to it,

though I do not wholly neglect it. With the good Dr. Heber-

den, Sir John Pringle, and many others, who, in early life,

engaged in philosophical pursuits, but were real Christians, I

think it natural, as we draw nearer to a future and better

world, to think more of it, and to have our reading and pur

suits directed more than ever towards it.

For the same reason, I think more of my departed friends,

as my good aunt, Mrs. Rayner, Dr. Price, Dr. Jebb, and

others, who have been my chief friends and benefactors, than

before ; forming conjectures (wild ones, no doubt) concerning

our meeting and employment hereafter. Such speculations as

these have, at least, the effect to make the thoughts of leaving

the world, and our friends in it, less unpleasant ; indeed, some

times almost desirable. If the disciples of Jesus rejoiced so

much at his resurrection, what will they do at his second

coming, in his proper kingdom, and when all their friends

will rise again, never to be separated any more? And the firm

faith that you and I have, that even the wicked, after a state

of wholesome discipline, (and that not more severe than will

be necessary,) will be raised in due time to a state of happi

ness, greatly diminishes our concern on their account,f

Such reflections as these occur to me more particularly

when I am not well, and my thoughts are less occupied with

my pursuits. But though I had a pretty long relapse of bad

health after my last to you, when I thought myself quite well,

and to have recovered my usual good state of health, I am
now again, I thank God, pretty well, and nearly as busy as
formerly.

   I have received a letter from Mr. Jefferson on the subject of
my pamphlet about Socrates, which I will copy, and send it
you the next post. I wish I could send you all his letters ;
but they are rather too long to copy, and a specimen or two
may be sufficient.*

                   To the Same.

Dear Friend,       Northumberland, April 23, 1803.

In my last, I promised to send you a copy of Mr. Jefferson's

letter, on reading my pamphlet, entitled, "Socrates and Jesus

compared." The abovef is that copy. He is generally con

sidered as an unbeliever. If so, however, he cannot be far

from us, and I hope in the way to be not only almost but alto

gether what we are. He now attends public worship very

regularly, and his moral conduct was never impeached^ I

should on several accounts be glad to make the visit he pro

poses, but my business will not admit of it.

I am at present employed in composing an Alphabetical

Index to the Bible, a work that I have often wanted myself,

and I know of nothing of the kind besides Pilkington's rational

Concordance, which is a very imperfect work. I have often

wondered that when there is such a demand for Concordances,

so little has been done in this way. If a particular text be

wanted, and a principal word in it be recollected, a Concor

dance will answer the purpose, but not when a subject is

wanted, and no particular word recollected, as in the prophet

ical and historical articles, as well as many others.

· Orig. MS.        f Supra, p. 508.

  \ Dr. Priestley's opinion is obviously founded on the sentiments expressed
by the President, confirmed by his public and private deportment. Yet " he
cannot be far from us," when separated from these considerations, was an
expression too well adapted to serve an insidious purpose, to have escaped the
handling of polemics, skilled to misrepresent, if not to calumniate, rather
than to draw fair conclusions from correct premises.

   Dr. Hutton has very lately exposed and confuted a gross perversion of
Dr. Priestley's language on this subject. See " Unitarian Christianity Vin

dicated," p. 143.

we shall do better when we begin the Notes on the Scriptures.*

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, June 4, 1803.

I have been made very happy by the receipt of yours of Jan.

16, written almost wholly with your own hand, though closed

by Mrs. Lindsey, on account of your suffering by the influenza,

which seems to have been almost universal with you. Here,

too, we have had a great deal of sickness, more than any person

remembers in any former time.

This day fortnight I got a dangerous fall on my left hip, with

a strain of the muscles of that thigh, in consequence of which

I have been very lame, and obliged to use crutches. Now,

however, I can walk with a stick, though with pain. I have

no fear but I shall get gradually better, though I shall probably

never recover the perfect use of the left thigh. In other re

spects I am better than I have been for a long time, and do as

much of such work that I am capable of, as ever, for which I

am very thankful. I cannot indeed at present do any thing in

my laboratory, but this I could not expect to do much longer.

Having finished my Notes on the Scriptures, I have now

nearly completed an alphabetical index to them. It has been

a very laborious work. I first made the index from the Bible as

I would for any other book, and then added whatever I thought

valuable from Pilkington,f which is very valuable in several

respects, but exceedingly defective in others.

My pamphlet entitled " Socrates and Jesus compared," has

been answered by a Mr. Linn, pastor of the first Presbyterian

church in Philadelphia, a young man of considerable ability,

in which he has introduced the doctrines of the divinity of

Christ and the atonement. I have just printed a reply to him^

by which I hope to procure a public discussion of those sub

jects, which is much wanted here. He has, from his ignorance

of the subjects, given me all the advantage that I could wish.
His letter is very respectful to me, and mine is as much so to
him, so that I hope the controversy will be conducted in the
best manner.

   I close my Notes on the Pentateuch with a dissertation,* in
which I shew, in about twenty different articles, the impossi
bility of Moses having derived any of his institutions from
Egypt, or any other nation, or from any superior wisdom of
his own. Of this I mean to print some copies as a pamphlet,f
which I hope will be of some use.

has sent me.

   You know I often make long prefaces. There is one to the

long to the Notes on the Scriptures. It is designed principally
to obviate objections to the Mosaic History; though this has
been my object in many of my notes.

   As there is not now any prospect of a new translation of the
Bible, by order of the English government, and if there was, it
might not be much regarded at present, I wish we had the
best of the new translations printed uniformly in one book.
This, I think, may be done here as well as with you, and I
shall endeavour to persuade some bookseller to undertake it.
1 wish you and Mr. Belsham would give me your opinion and
advice with respect to it. For this purpose I want Newcome's
translation of the New Testament, Williams's of the Song of
Solomon, and Horsley's Hosea. These I have not seen, and I
wish Mr. Johnson would send them, so that I might receive
them before winter. Which translation of the Psalms would
you recommend ? There are several good ones. Dr. Geddes
I could not use for the historical books, owing to the quaint-
ness of his style in so many places. The common one, with
corrections, may do for these.

   I am concerned at the renewal of the war, and cannot see
any just cause for it on either side. I had hoped that there
would have been peace the remainder of my time. It must be
the occasion of much distress to both countries. Every thing
promises well with us ; but the seasons have been exceedingly
unfavourable. A late frost destroyed all our fruits, and now
we suffer much from drought.*

Dear Sir,              Northumberland, Aug. 6, 1803.

It is now a considerable time since I have heard from you

or Mr. Lindsey, and I am a little anxious about the regularity

of our correspondence since the unexpected breaking out of

the war.

   St. Domingo must surely now be abandoned to the blacks;
and will not the English colonies be affected by the example ?
It may be the manner in which Divine Providence is preparing
the way for the emancipation of all the negroes in this part of
the world, and introducing a better state of things. The in
habitants of our southern provinces begin to be seriously
alarmed at the number and refractory spirit of their slaves,
and many are removing into the Genesee, and other parts, for
fear of insurrections from them. We are very happily free
from all apprehensions about them in this state. Measures
were many years ago taken for their gradual emancipation, and
in a few years more there will not be one in all Pennsylvania.*

   We are happily at peace here, and without the most distant
prospect of war. The opposition was clamorous for taking
possession of New Orleans by force ; but now that, and all
Louisiana, is gained without it, and in a mannner much more
likely to be permanent. Had it remained in the possession of
France, it would no doubt have been taken from them by the
English, and they would have completely inclosed all the
United States to the west. But the increasing population of
this country would in time have burst through that feeble
barrier.

   So much for politics. It will now, however, become inter
esting to us theologians who are read in prophecy. What does
Mr. Bicheno think? He will probably say that the vintage
might be expected to follow the harvest, and that the war of
Armageddon is not yet over. This war very much resembles
the Peloponnesian, which was renewed after a formal peace, and
ended in the overthrow of Athens, which had the advantage
when the peace was made.

           To Rev. T. Lindsey.f

Dear Friend,            Northumberland, Sept. 12, 1803.

Once more I have had the very great satisfaction of hearing

from you in a letter, a great part of which was written with

your own hand, to me so precious. As you have got so well

to the middle of summer, I hope you may get through the

next winter; though, on your own account, the difference be

tween a remove at present, or a few years hence, cannot be

much. Your life, however, will be a source of great satisfac

tion to many, if I may judge of others by myself, and therefore

the continuance is earnestly to be desired. My health is much

better than it was, a few weeks ago.

I am made very happy by your approbation, as I doubt not

it is sincere, of my pamphlet about Socrates. I wish you may

soon see my defence, against a Mr., now Dr. Linn, who wrote

against it, as intended to lower the character of Jesus, and ad

vance that of Socrates, in opposition to him. I think you will

like the defence better than the pamphlet itself, as leading to a

public discussion, so much wanted here, of the doctrine of the

Divine Unity. He is replying to it ; but I am informed that

all his friends wished that he had never provoked the con

troversy.

Mrs. Lindsey sends me a very unfavourable account of my

daughter's health, which is the first intimation I have had of

her illness. I had lately a letter from her, which I was about

to answer. I inclose one for her, to be sent, if she be living,

otherwise suppress it. It is chiefly on account of her children,

who will want such a mother, that I am much concerned

about her. We shall, I hope, all meet in more favourable

circumstances, and then enjoy even the retrospect of what

appears most unfavourable at present. On this I dwell more
than on any thing in this world, especially since your illness,
and my own increasing weakness. But, I thank God, I am
recruiting, and capable of doing something, I hope, still.*

           To Rev. T. BelSHaM.f

Dear Sir,    Northumberland, Sept. 24, 1803.

Since this unfortunate renewal of the war, I am more

anxious about our correspondence, which is of so much con

sequence to me, far more than it can be to you. In one re

spect, this country has a great advantage over yours, as we

have peace, and not the most distant prospect of war, the

greatest, certainly, of all calamities.

I was never more affected with the various horrors of it than

in reading, lately, Mr. Hay's History of the Rebellion in Wex

ford ; and yet almost all the atrocities were committed, not by

English soldiers, but the Irish themselves, friends of the En

glish government, and who, no doubt, thought to recommend

themselves to it by that means, and they do not seem to have

been punished, or much censured for it. Oppression and

cruelty can never, surely, rise to so great a height in England.

But, indeed, had I not seen this account, I could not have be

lieved it of Ireland, or of any part of the civilized world.

We have the news only once a week, and in this eventful

period, you may suppose that on the post day (which is this

day) our anxiety is not small. Unfortunately, the post returns

are almost obliged to write our letters before we receive any.

I shall, however, keep this open till I see whether 1 have any

from you, or any other friend in England.

Since I wrote the above, I have seen the list of the sub

scribers to my two works. It far, very far, exceeds my ex

pectation, both with respect to the number of names and the

generosity of many of them. Yourself and Mr. Lindsey, as

well as some others, have gone far beyond your proportion.

Dear Sir,    Northumberland, Oct. 20, 1803.

Now that the war between England and France is unfor

tunately renewed, I do not know how a letter from me will

find you. I will, however, direct to you in Paris, or at Caeu;

and hope the best. I was very happy to receive yours of the

10th of May, and hope that our correspondence will never be

wholly interrupted while we live. Your friendship and at

tachment has been one of the greatest of my satisfactions in

this life, and, I doubt not, will be renewed to still greater

advantage in another, to which I am making very sensible

approaches.

All that I am now very solicitous about, is the printing of

what I have been long employed in composing, and which, I

flatter myself, will be of considerable service to the cause of

rational Christianity, which you so laudably have at hearty

Indeed, it is the most important object that any of us can have

in this world. With me, philosophy, I can truly say, was

never more than of secondary consideration ; and now it ap

pears, though very valuable, yet, comparatively, less than ever.

As the study of the works of God, and an incentive to devo

tion, which it is in an eminent degree, and therefore deserving

of the cultivation of every rational being, I hope to resume

this employment, and with more advantage, in another state.

I wish this may reach you, but there is an uncertainty in my

correspondence with France that I cannot account for.§

                   To Rev. T. Lindsey.*

Dear Friend,                   Northumberland, Nov. 4, 1803.

I cannot now expect to hear often from you; but I shall

write as usual, as long as you or Mrs. Lindsey are living, pro

vided I be living myself. But my health is such, that I really

do not expect to survive you. But I have abundant reason to

be satisfied with life, and the goodness of God in it. Few have

had so happy a lot as I have had, and I now see reason to be

thankful for events which, at the time, were the most afflicting.

Two posts ago brought me a letter from Mr. Galton, de

scribing the dying condition of my daughter. I cannot grieve

on her account. She had nothing before her, in this life, but a

prospect of increasing trouble, and I hope soon to meet her in

more favourable circumstances. I am concerned about the

children. My only source of satisfaction, and it is a never-

failing one, is my firm persuasion that every thing, and our

oversights and mistakes among the rest, are parts of the great

plan, in which every thing will, in time, appear to have been

ordered and conducted in the best manner. When I hear my

son's children crying, I consider that we who are advanced in

life, are but children ourselves, and as little judges of what is

good for ourselves or others.

As you were pleased with my comparison of Socrates and

Jesus, I have begun to carry the same comparison to all the

heathen moralists, and I have all the books that I want for the

purpose, except Simplicius, and Arrian on Epictetus, and these

I hope to get from a library in Philadelphia. Lest, however, I

should fail there, I wish you or Mr. Belsham would procure

and send them from London. While I am capable of any

thing, I cannot be idle, and I do not know that 1 can do any

thing better. This, too, is an undertaking that Mr. Jefferson

recommends to me.f

With every good wish, I am yours and Mrs. Lindsey's most

affectionately.}:

Dear Friend,           Northumberland, Dec. 19, 1803.

1am once more made happy by the receipt of yours of the

9th of September. I value your letters more than gold ; but I

am sensible it is unreasonable to expect them from you, diffi

cult as it must now be to you to write. But a single line will

suffice.

I thank God I begin to recover from an illness which has

been very near carrying me oft". It was ill understood by our

physicians at first, and their prescriptions did me harm ; but

now, though exceedingly weak, I am in a good way. This

encourages me to hope that I may live a few years longer, so

as to finish the works I am printing and composing.

The next thing I wish to do is, to assist in the publication of

a whole Bible, from the several new translations of particular

books, smoothing and correcting them where I can. I shall

propose it to some of our booksellers, cheerfully giving my

own labour to so useful a work. If any thing remains of the

subscription to my present publications, I shall spend it on

others, particularly on the Alphabetical Index to the Bible,*

which has been some time completely ready for the press.

I wish this may come safely to your hands; but I dread the

approaching contest, which may throw every thing into con

fusion. It has probably taken place before this time. But

there is a Sovereign Ruler, and he, we cannot doubt, will bring

good out of all evil.

The excellent character and behaviour of my daughter is a

great consolation to me in the thoughts of her death.

Hoping still to have the great satisfaction of hearing from

you a few times more, I am yours and Mrs. Lindsey's most

afiectionately.f

   I am glad that you like my scheme of printing a whole Bible
from the new translations corrected, and I much approve of
your hints respecting it. I shall, I hope, soon be at liberty to
attend to this work, and give my time principally to it, as I
have made much more progress in my Comparison of the Hea
then Moralists with the Christian than I ever expected. This
work will please those who like the pamphlet about Socrates.

   All this, however, I say on the presumption that my health
continues as it is now. I assure you I did not lately expect to
live many weeks, and now am feeble in the extreme, not able
to mount a common staircase without the help of my arms,
with feet and ancles swelled in consequence of this weakness.
But, for about a week I have been better, and now have better
prospect of a recovery, for which I am very thankful.

   My controversy with Dr. Linn has had all the effect that the
most sanguine friends of Unitarianism could wish. We have
each written two pamphlets, and all his friends are mortified
and ashamed for him. I have directed a few copies of each of
my pamphlets to be sent to Mr. Vaughan for the use of my
friends in general. An Unitarian preacher would now be
very acceptable in Philadelphia, and I believe Mr. Christie,
who is leaving us, and who is a popular preacher here, will go
thither. He is about to take up the controversy with Dr. Linn,
and he will do it well. He thinks I have let Dr. Linn off too
gently, and is determined to expose his ignorance and pre
sumption, which, indeed, are very great.

   I rejoice in your account of the spread of Unitarianism
among the common people.* This is the base of the pyramid.f

Dear Friend,  Northumberland, Jan. 16, 1804,

Having just received a box of books from Mr. Johnson, I

beg you would make an apology for the impatience I expressed

about them. The booksellers in Philadelphia having, some

of Christianity, representing the existence and prevalence of the religion of
Christ, as a fact which requires a proper and adequate cause ; and with the
beautiful analogy which you have pointed out between the evidences of
natural and revealed religion.

   " I am sorry that you despair of my conversion. I cannot but flatter my
self that, though the case be inveterate and alarming, it is not incurable and
hopeless, and if the cure should not be accomplished, it shall not be for
want of the application of proper remedies. Your former correspondence
with Dr. Price opened my eyes upon the subject of necessity, and fixed me
in that system, which is my present glory. Who knows whether the pre
sent correspondence may not produce a similar effect ?

   " I am far from having made up my mind upon the subject of controversy
between you and your excellent friend. I profess myself a fellow-student
with my pupils ; a humble but, I hope, a diligent and honest inquirer after
truth, willing to follow evidence whithersoever it may lead, and convinced of
the indispensable duty of avowing truth at all hazards. And here, Sir, I
must aknowledge my great obligation to your writings. To them am I
chiefly indebted for the high idea I entertain of the importance of truth, for
whatever courage I may possess in the investigation of it, and for whatever
fortitude I may feel in the avowal of it. On this account I shall ever feel
myself greatly indebted to you, whether my present inquiries after truth
should or should not terminate eventually in a coincidence of my sentiments
with yours."

   To Rev. T. Belsham. "Birmingham, April 15, 1787- I am much
obliged by your letter, expressive of that candour and liberality which have
always distinguished your character, and cannot fail to do you the greatest
honour. That any thing I have written should have made an impression
upon such a mind, I consider as a great honour to me. I am far from wish
ing to make ready converts, as they are seldom steady ones. Besides, I
never was a ready convert to any thing myself ; but in general a very slow
one, thinking long before I decided. Such is the nature and force of pre
judice, especially of so long standing as yours and mine, (and we cannot
help calling that prejudice, which prevents the reception of our present
opinions,) that I shall not think the worse of Dr. Price or of you, though
you should continue Arians, notwithstanding all the evidence I shall ever be
able to bring in support of my own opinion." See " Memoirs of the late

time ago, advertised the books they had this season, and no
more ships being expected before the river is usually shut up
with ice, I despaired of receiving any till the next spring.
This box contains many very interesting and some very splen
did works, published by Mr. Phillips. They are presents, as
he has before sent me very valuable ones. I beg you would
tell him how much I think myself obliged to him for them.
In my situation, such books are invaluable, especially as my
deafness confines me in a manner at home, and my extreme
weakness prevents my making any excursions. Winter also
keeps me from my laboratory, so that reading and composing
are my sole occupations and amusement. Here, too, I have
not the convenience of borrowing books.

   This situation, however, is not without its advantages. I
have abundant leisure, and I have endeavoured to make the
most of it. I have now finished and transcribed for the press
my Comparison of the Principles of the Grecian Philosophers
with those of Revelation, and with more ease and more to my
own satisfaction than I expected. They who liked my pam
phlet, entitled Socrates and Jesus compared, will not, I flatter
myself, dislike this work. It has the same object, and com
pletes the scheme. It has increased my own sense of the un
speakable value of revelation, and must, I think, that of every
person who will give due attention to the subject.

   I think I told you that, some time ago, I compiled a large
Alphabetical Index to all the Books of the Old and New Tes
tament. This I transcribed twice with my own hand, besides
writing it first in short-hand. I hope it will be found useful,
if it be published. I have sent it to the booksellers in Phila
delphia, asking nothing for my labour. I hope that some of
them will undertake it.

   If my health continue as it is now, (though you little imagine
how weak I am,) I shall be glad to superintend an edition of
the Bible, from the late versions, correcting some of them
where I can. I want Heath on Job for this purpose. I ex
pected also, in the last parcel, the Annual Register, a number
or two of the Philosophical Transactions, and a few copies of

524 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

the new edition of my Charts, and a few other ai tides of less
consequence.

   I am glad to find, by the public papers, that the ship which
carried the fourth volume of my Church History, was arrived
at London. You will, therefore, soon see the whole, and I
wait with some anxiety to hear what you or Mr. Belsham think
of it. I hope you will not think the last article in the general
conclusion* improper, though there is a manifest allusion to
your own case, but without the mention of your name.

   We are all anxious to hear the result of the threatened in
vasion. I have some faint hopes that it will not be undertaken,
at least upon England. What confusion and distress would it
not occasion, in the most favourable issue ! God preserve you,
my friend, from the general calamity ! How enviable is our
situation, compared to yours ! Our only consolation must arise
from regarding the hand of God in all events, confident that
the final issue will be right and good.

which I pray you to accept my thanks. The copy for Mr.

Livingston has been delivered, together with your letter to

tisfaction. It is the first I have been able to meet with which
is clear of those long repetitions of the same transaction, as if
it were a different one, because related with some different
circumstances.

   I rejoice that you have undertaken the task of comparing
the moral doctrines of Jesus with those of the ancient philoso
phers. You are so much in possession of the whole subject,
that you will do it easier and better than any other person
living. I think you cannot avoid giving, as preliminary to the
comparison, a digest of his moral doctrines, extracted in his
own words from the Evangelists, and leaving out every thing
relative to his personal history and character. It would be
short and precious. With a view to do this for my own satis
faction, I had sent to Philadelphia to get two Testaments
(Greek) of the same edition, and two English, with a design to
cut out the morsels of morality,* and paste them on the leaves
of a book in the manner you describe as having been pursued
in forming your Harmony. But I shall now get the thing
done by better hands.

   Have you seen the new work of Malthus on population ? It
is one of the ablest I have ever seen. Although his main ob
ject is to delineate the effects of redundancy of population, and
to test the poor-laws of England, and other palliations for that
evil, several important questions in political economy, allied to
his subject incidentally, are treated with a masterly hand. It
is a single octavo volume, and I have been only able to read a
borrowed copy, the only one I have yet heard of. Probably
our friends in England will think of you, and give you an
opportunity of reading it.

   Accept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of great
esteem and respect.f

526 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   I know not whether Dr. Priestley survived the date
of this letter, long enough to have received it. "The
last scene of his life," while the affecting and edifying
circumstances were in lively recollection, Mr. Priestley
has thus described:

   The first part of my father's illness, independent of his gene
ral weakness, the result of his illness in Philadelphia, in 1801,
was a constant indigestion, and a difficulty of swallowing meat,
or any kind of solid food, unless previously reduced by mas
tication to a perfect pulp. This gradually increased upon him
till he could swallow liquids but very slowly, and led him to
suspect, which he did to the last, that there must be some
stoppage in the oesophagus. Lately he lived almost entirely
upon tea, chocolate, soups, sago, and the like.

   During all this time of general and increasing debility, he
was busily employed in printing his Church History, and the
first volume of the Notes on Scripture; and in making new
and original experiments, an account of which he sent to the
American Philosophical Society, in two numbers, one in an
swer to Dr. Darwin's " Observations on Spontaneous Genera
tion ;" and the other " On the unexpected Conversion of a
Quantity of the Marine Acid into the Nitrous." During this
period, likewise, he wrote his pamphlet of "Jesus and So
crates compared," and reprinted his " Essay on Phlogiston."
He would not suffer any one to do for him what he had been
accustomed to do himself; nor did he alter his former mode of
life in any respect, excepting that he no longer worked in his
garden, and that he read more books of a miscellaneous nature
than he had been used to do when he could work more in his
laboratory, which had always served him as a relaxation from
his other studies.

   From about the beginning of November 1803, to the middle
of January 1804, his complaint grew more serious. He was
once incapable of swallowing any thing for near thirty hours;
and there being some symptoms of inflammation at his

MEMOIRS OP DR. PRIESTLEY.  527

stomach, blisters were applied, which afforded him relief; ami
by very great attention to his diet, riding out in a chair when
the weather would permit, and living chiefly on the soft parts
of oysters, he seemed, if not gaining ground, at least not getting
worse ; and we had reason to hope, that if he held out until
spring, as he was, the same attention to his diet with more ex
ercise, which it was impossible for him to take on account of
the cold weather, would restore him to health. He, however,
considered his life as very precarious, and used to tell the phy
sician who attended him, that if he could but patch him up
for six months longer, he should be perfectly satisfied, as he
should in that time be able to complete printing his works.
The swelling of his feet, an alarming symptom of general de
bility, began about this time.

   To give some idea of the exertions he made even at this
time, it is only necessary for me to say, that besides his mis
cellaneous reading, which was at all times very great, he read
through all the works quoted in his comparison of the different
systems of the Grecian philosophers with Christianity, com
posed that work, and transcribed the whole of it in less than
three months. He took the precaution of transcribing one
day, in long hand, what he had composed the day before, in
short hand, that he might by that means leave the work com
plete as far as it went, should he not live to complete the
whole. During this period he composed, in a day, his second
reply to Dr. Linn.

   About this time he ceased performing divine service, which
he said he had never before known himself incapable of per
forming, notwithstanding he had been a preacher so many
years. He likewise now suffered me to rake his fire, rub his
feet with a flesh-brush, and occasionally help him to bed. In
the morning likewise he had his fire made for him, which he
always used to do himself, and generally before any of the
family was stirring.

   In the last fortnight in January, he was troubled with alarm
ing fits of indigestion ; his legs swelled nearly to his knees, and
his weakness increased very much. I wrote for him, while he
dictated, the concluding section of his New Comparison, and

 528 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

 the Preface and Dedication. The finishing this work was a
 source of great satisfaction to him, as he considered it as a
 work of as much consequence as any he had ever undertaken.
 The first alarming symptom of approaching dissolution was his
 being unable to speak to me upon my entering his room, on
 Tuesday morning, the 31st of January. In his diary I find he
 stated his situation as follows : " 111 all day--not able to speak
 for nearly three hours." When he was able to speak, he told
 me he had slept well (as he uniformly had done through the
 whole of his illness; so that he never would suffer me, though
 I frequently requested he would do it, to sleep in the same
 room with him) ; that he felt as well as possible; that he got
 up and shaved himself (which he never omitted doing every
morning, till within two days of his death); that he went to
 his laboratory, and then found his weakness very great; that
he got back with difficulty; that just afterward his grand
 daughter, a child of about six or seven years old, came to him
to claim the fulfilment of a promise he had made her the even
ing before, to give her a five-penny bit. He gave her the
money, and was going to speak to her, but found himself un
able. He informed me of this, speaking very slowly a word at
a time ; and added, that he had never felt more pleasantly in
his whole life than he did during the time he was unable to
speak. After he had taken his medicine, which was bark
and laudanum, and drank a bason of strong mutton broth, he
recovered surprisingly, and talked with cheerfulness to all who
called upon him, but as though he was fully sensible that he
had not long to live. He consented for the first time that 1
should sleep in the room with him.

   On Wednesday, February 1, he writes, " I was at times much
better in the morning: capable of some business: continued
better all day." He spake this morning as strong as usual, and
took, in the course of the day, a good deal of nourishment with
pleasure. He said, that he felt a return of strength, and with
it there was a duty to perform. He read a good deal in New-
come's Translation of the New Testament, and Stevens's His
tory of the War. In the afternoon he gave me some directions
how to proceed with the printing his work, in case he should

          MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.                         529

die. He gave me directions to stop the printing, of the second

volume, and to begin upon the third, that he might see how it

was begun, and that it might serve as a pattern to me to pro

ceed by.
   On Thursday, the 2d, he wrote thus for the last time in his

diary: "Much worse: incapable of business: Mr. Kennedy

came to receive instructions about printing, in case of my

death." He sat up, however, a great part of the day, was

cheerful, and gave Mr. Cooper and myself some directions,

with the same composure as though he had only been about to

leave home for a short time. Though it was fatiguing to him

to talk, he read a good deal in the works above-mentioned.

   On Friday he was much better. He sat up a good part of
the day reading Newcome ; Dr. Disney's Translation of the

Psalms; and some chapters in the Greek Testament, which

was his daily practice. He corrected a proof-sheet of the

Notes on Isaiah. When he went to bed he was not so well :

he had an idea he should not live another day. At prayer-

time he wished to have the children kneel by his bed-side,

saying it gave him great pleasure to see the little things kneel;

and, thinking he possibly might not see them again, he gave

them his blessing.

On Saturday, the 4th, my father got up for about an hour

while his bed was made. He said he felt more comfortable in
bed than up. He read a good deal, and looked over the first

sheet of the third volume of the « Notes," that he might see

how we were likely to go on with it ; and having examined the

Greek and Hebrew quotations, and finding them right, he said

he was satisfied we should finish the work very well. In the

course of the day, he expressed his gratitude in being permitted

to die quietly in his family, without pain, with every conve-

nience and comfort he could wish for. He dwelt upon the

peculiarly happy situation in which it had pleased the Divine

Being to place him in life; and the great advantage he had en

joyed in the acquaintance and friendship of some of the best

and wisest men in the age in which he lived, and the satisfac

tion he derived from having led an useful as well as a happy life.

On Sunday he was much weaker, and only sat up in au

armed chair while his bed was made. He desired me to read
to him the eleventh chapter of John. I was going on to read
to the end of the chapter, but he stopped me at the forty-fifth
verse. He dwelt for some time on the advantage he had de
rived from reading the Scriptures daily, and advised me to do
the same ; saying, that it would prove to me, as it had done to
him, a source of the purest pleasure. He desired me to reach
him a pamphlet which was at his bed's head, Simpson on the
Duration of Future Punishment. " It will be a source of
satisfaction to you to read that pamphlet," said he, giving it
to me ; " it contains my sentiments, and a belief in them will
be a support to you in the most trying circumstances, as it has
been to me. We shall all meet finally : we only require differ
ent degrees of discipline, suited to our different tempers, to
prepare us for final happiness." Upon Mr. coming into his
room, he said, " You see, Sir, I am still living." Mr.
observed, he would always live. " Yes," said he, " I believe
I shall ; and we shall all meet again in another and a better
world." He said this with great animation, laying hold on
Mr. 's hand in both his.

   Before prayers he desired me to reach him three publica
tions, about which he would give me some directions next
morning. His weakness would not permit him to do it at that
time. At prayers he had all the children brought to his bed
side as before. After prayers they wished him a good night, and
were leaving the room. He desired them to stay, spoke to
them each separately. He exhorted them all to continue to
love each other. " And you, little thing," speaking to Eliza,
'" remember the hymn you learned ; « Birds in their little nests
agree,' &c. I am going to sleep as well as you ; for death is
only a good long sound sleep in the grave, and we shall meet
again." He congratulated us on the dispositions of our children ;
said it was a satisfaction to see them likely to turn out well ;
and continued for some time to express his confidence in a
happy immortality, and in a future state, which would afford
us an ample field for the exertion of our faculties.

  On Monday morning, the Gth of February, after having lain
perfectly still till four o'clock in the morning, he called to me,

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  531

but in a fainter tone than usual, to give him some wine and
tincture of bark. I asked him how he felt. He answered, he
had no pain, but appeared fainting away gradually. About an
hour after, he asked me for some chicken-broth, of which he
took a tea-cup full. His pulse was quick, weak, and flutter
ing, his breathing, though easy, short. About eight o'clock
he asked me to give him some egg and wine. After this, he
lay quite still till ten o'clock, when he desired me and Mr.
Cooper to bring him the pamphlets we had looked out the
evening before. He then dictated as clearly and distinctly as
he had ever done in his life, the additions and alterations he
wished to have made in each. Mr. Cooper took down the
substance of what he said, which, when he had done, I read to
him. He said Mr. Cooper had put it in his own language ; he
wished it to be put in his. I then took a pen and ink to his
bed-side. He then repeated over again, nearly word for word,
what he had before said ; and when I had done, I read it over
to him. He said, " That is right; I have now done." About
half an hour after he desired, in a faint voice, that we would
move him from the bed on which he lay to a cot, that he might
lie with his lower limbs horizontal, and his head upright. He
died in about ten minutes after we had moved him, but
breathed his last so easy, that neither myself or my wife, who
were both sitting close to him, perceived it at the time. He
had put his hand to his face, which prevented our observing it.

   Dr. Priestley was thus highly favoured in the unre
mitting attentions of an affectionate son, who happily
survived to attest " the composure and cheerfulness of
his last moments," with an authority unquestionable,
and in terms to which I could add nothing, without en
feebling their effect. What a " post of honour," in the
service of such a father, to

             Make languor smile, and smooth the bed of death !

" Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last
end be like his."

.532 MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.

   The decease of an illustrious associate, when announced
at Paris, called forth, from Cuvier, an Historical Eulogy,
before the National Institute * while the Royal Society of
London preserved a courtly silence.f Yet, among the
respectful tributes to Dr. Priestley's talents and charac
ter, there was no one more appropriate than the following,
at Birmingham, from the pen of Dr. Parr:

                        THIS TABLET

            Is consecrated to the Memory of the

   REV. JOSEPH PRIESTLEY, LL. D.

              by his affectionate Congregation,
                          in Testimony

         of their Gratitude for his faithful Attention
                to their spiritual Improvement,

 and for his peculiar Diligence in training up their Youth
             to rational Piety and genuine Virtue ;

     of their Respect for his great and various Talents,
 which were uniformly directed to the noblest Purposes ;

                    and of their Veneration
       for the pure, benevolent, and holy Principles,
       which through the trying Vicissitudes of Life,

               and in the awful hour of Death,
  animated him with the hope of a blessed Immortality.

               His Discoveries as a Philosopher
      will never cease to be remembered and admired

              by the ablest Improvers of Science.
          His Firmness as an Advocate of Liberty,
    and his Sincerity as an Expounder of the Scriptures,

                      endeared him to many
   of his enlightened and unprejudiced Contemporaries.

                   His Example as a Christian
will be instructive to the Wise, and interesting to the Good,

              of every Country, and in every Age.

    He was born at Fieldhead, near Leeds, in Yorkshire,
                      March 24, A. D. 1733.

   Was chosen a Minister of this Chapel, Dec. 31, 1/80.
    Continued in that office Ten Years and Six Months.

            Embarked for America, April 7, 1 794.
 Died at Northumberland, in Pennsylvania, Feb. 6, 1804.

MEMOIRS OF DR. PRIESTLEY.  533

   The wish Dr. Priestley had expressed, after surviving

an affectionate wife and a highly-promising son,* was
accomplished. He shared their burial-place ;f and while
the sciences he cultivated are advancing to perfection ;
while the rights of man, which he ably vindicated, are

successfully asserted ; and, especially, while the scriptu
ral views of Christian theology, which he taught with
all the ardour of an apostle, are multiplying their adher
ents, among the serious and the considerate, it may be
fairly expected that, in other and distant times, the wise
and the virtuous will frequently indulge some grateful
recollections beside the grave of Priestley.

   Charmed with the discoveries of science, and eager, by
prompt and unreserved communication, to diffuse as far
as possible, their beneficial influence, he was yet su
premely attracted to the discoveries of revelation.^

Hence his unvarying purpose, " by labour and patience,
through evil report, and through good report," and even
when flesh and heart were failing, to promote, in the most

enlarged sense of the expression, " the greatest good of

   · See I. 208, note *, supra, p. 356.
   f Mr. W. Christie delivered a funeral oration. See I. 352, note.
   \ " Priestley," says Mr. Anthony Robinson, " was a man of restless activity,
but he uniformly directed that activity to what seemed to him the public
good, seeking neither emolument nor honour from men.
   " When philosophy was in fashion, and he, as one of its great masters, was
in fashion, he wrote on religion, to the injury of his reputation, only because
he believed it still more important to mankind than any of the pursuits of
philosophy." M. R. XVII. 169. See I. 33, note V
   " Dr. Priestley," says Dr. Brewster, " was possessed of great ardour and
vivacity of intellect ; but, though ever zealous for the propagation of truth,
his heart would not have suffered him to injure even his bitterest enemy.
Of a mild and placid temper, he was naturally disposed to be cheerful, espe
cially in the private circle of his friends. Uniformly kind and affectionate in
domestic life, he was the tenderest husband, and the best of parents. His
integrity was unimpeachable ; and even malice itself could not fix a stain on
his private character." Ency. Edinen. V. 757, 758. See Dr. Henry's
" Estimate," supra, p. 490, note \ ; " Christian Reformer," XVIII. 246, &c.

the greatest number ;" a sentiment with which he had
the honour, by one of his earliest publications,* to in
spire that philosopher and philanthropist, who has lately
left the world, after devoting himself in death, as in life, to
its service ; but whose memory will remain, unless, again,
in the dispensations of an inscrutable Providence, " dark
ness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people.''

   A willing, though not unanxious, occupation is now
concluded. Seventeen years have elapsed, since I
first entertained the project of printing, in a connected
form, and with such illustrations as recollection or in
quiry could supply, the whole of Dr. Priestley's Theolo
gical and Miscellaneous Works, including his Memoirs
and Correspondence. That intervals of health and ease
have been afforded me, and that some capacity for mental
exertion has been continued, these are favours that de
mand my gratitude, especially at a period of life extended
beyond the years of Priestley.

    To have our names thus connected, is a distinction
of which I am not insensible. It was my happiness
to -share the cheerful and the serious hours of Gilbert
Wakefield, till he was lost to friendship and to society in
the midst of his days. I listened to the Christian coun
 sels of Theophilus Lindsey, when, in the activity of life,
he was eminently serving his generation, according to the
 will of God ; and I have often witnessed how Christian
 consolations would cheer and sustain him, amidst the lan
 guors of age, and in the daily expectance of dissolution.
 And, now, after a personal acquaintance, whose speedy
 interruption has frequently excited an unavailing regret,
 I have been admitted to an intimacy, not I trust unedi-
 fying, with the richly-furnished mind of Joseph Priestley.
 Magnanimi heroes, sit anima mea vobiscum !
